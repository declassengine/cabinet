The Vice-Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events ofthe previous week.Operations during the previous week had been severelyrestricted by bad weather, and attacks by Bomber Command hadbeen restricted to harassing raids by Mosquitoes on three nights.The United States Air Force had undertaken one majoroperation, dropping 1,326 tons of bombs on Emden, with somewhatdisappointing results. Heavy fighting against enemy fighterdefences had developed.Fighter Command and Tactical Air Force had flown only328 sorties by clay and 124 by night. Enemy activity had again been small.Due to bad weather conditions, Allied activity had decreasedslightly, only 7,900 sorties having been made during the past week,mostly in support of the land battle. United States Liberators,supported by fighters, had attacked the marshalling yards at Sofia.The Japanese had raided the docks area at Calcutta, causinglittle damage.Shipping losses for the week by enemy action had been 2 ships totalling 9,000 tons, and belated reports had come in of 17 others,totalling 83,000 tons. The latter figure included 14 ships sunk atBari. The remaining ships, which had been held up in North Russiasince the beginning of the year, had returned safely to the UnitedKingdom.Two escorts of a convoy on passage along the North african coast had been sunk by torpedo and a third damaged. The convoyitself had been unharmed. A military convoy had been attacked inthe Gulf of Taranto by U-boat, causing the loss of one merchant ship.Bad weather had once again hampered operations, and therehad been little progress in the coastal sector on the 8th Army Frontduring the past week. The enemy had fiercely contested our efforts to advance.On the 5th Army Front, the attack in the west had made good progress and the whole of the mountain massif south of theMigmano gap was now in our hands, a gain of considerable tacticalimportance. Elements of an Italian brigade had taken part in thefighting.The Germans were reported to have launched a generaloffensive against the Partisans in Yugoslavia in an attempt to liquidate or disperse them. A delegation from Partisan Head-quarters had reached Alexandria on the 5th December.In Greece the position of EDES had further deteriorated withthe capture of their former headquarters by ELAS bands.Operations had continued to be hampered by ground andweather conditions. Renewed German counter-attacks against theKiev salient had made comparatively little headway, and they had failed to achieve a break-through at any point. The Russians were now counter-attacking in their turn. Russian progress at Znamenkahad placed the German forces in the Eastern part of the Dnieperbend in a dangerous situation.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Conferences at 2    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCairo and Cabinet an account of the main matters discussed at these twoTeheran. Conferences.   A record of the statement by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs is contained in the Secretary s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.
naval construction programme.Production ofNew TypeLanding Ships,and other changes.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (43) 549) asking for the approvalof the War Cabinet for the construction of 80 new-type landingships, to be completed by the 1st April, 1945.The First Lord of the Admiralty, in his Memorandum, reportedthat it had been decided to reduce the escort vessel target require-ment by some 200 ships, and that this would free a certain amountof shipyard capacity which could be used to build a number of thesetank-landing ships, an endeavour being made to obtain theremainder from Canada. The Memorandum also set out a numberof small changes which had been made, with the sanction of theTreasury, in the 1943 new construction programme.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the need for the new type of landing ship arose from plans approved by the Chiefs ofStaff for which a faster vessel than the L.S.T. 2 was needed. Theprogramme would have only small effect on merchant shipbuildingin this country. It was not possible for the United States to assist us further than they were already doing.The Minister of War Transport pointed out that, although theeffect on the merchant vessel building programme in this country would be small, it would come on top of a number of other changes which had already tended to reduce it below what it ought to be atthis critical stage of the war.Moreover, the effect would be much more serious in Canada,whose output of merchant vessels was of great importance. before any decision was made, he thought the matter should be reopenedwith the United States Authorities, and he suggested that the forth-coming visit to Washington of the Controller would be a good opportunity of reviewing the whole situation.In further discussion, it was suggested that the proposals inthe Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty might wellbe affected by the decisions of the recent conference in Cairo,though the First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that he hadbeen able to discuss the matter with the First Sea Lord since thelatter&apos;s return, and he foresaw danger in any postponement.Mr. Bruce, while recognising the desirability of ensuring as littleinterference with the merchant vessel building programme aspossible, urged that the vital requirements of the Avar against japan should not be relegated to a position of lesser importance than thoseof the war against Germany, clue allowance being made for thetime factor.The decision of the War Cabinet was that The First Lord of the Admiralty should review his proposals in consultation with the Minister of war transport, and in the light of the decisions reached at the cairo Conference, and should bring the matter again before the War Cabinet later in the week.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,13th December, 1943.
(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MA,-TESTY &apos;&apos;3 GOVERNMENT )MOST secret no CIRCULATION&apos;./.M.(45)  169TH CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 2(13th December at 5.50 p. m.)CONFERENCES ATCAIRO ANDTEHERANsaid that this matter had been raised informallyTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSone night after dinner, but it had not beenPolanddiscussed formally until the last day of theConference.      Marshal Stalin had taken a veryhard line as to the present Polish Government.He had then said that the frontier question was settled, by which he meant the frontiers ofSeptember 1939.        The Foreign Secretary had askedwhether he meant the Ribbentrop-Molo tov Line, whichhad brought the reply that this frontier wasusually referred to as the Gurzon Line.Maps had then been produced, but there hadbeen a good deal of discrepancy between the lines drawn upon them.      It was  important, however, to observe that the Gurzon Line differed from the Ribbentrop-Molotov Line in that it would restore to Poland large areas in the North inhabited by Poles which had been occupied by Russia in September 1939.      It seemed clear,  too,  that the Russians were prepared to workon the basis of the Curson Line, which,  in the foreign secretary&apos;s view,  was a defensible line.defined in words, but it had been defined on theman.      In the South the Gurzoa Line gave the PolesPremzsl but not Lemberg.The Gurzon Line had never been completely

in discussion then had ensued at the TeheranConference as to the Western frontier of Poland-Stalin had said that this should be the Oder.      Thiswas,  of course,  a rather  extreme step and would bring Poland within 60 miles of Berlin.      It wasalso clear that he Avas agreeable to the Poles getting the Oppeln area of Silesia.Further discussion had been directed to making it clear that the Russians agreed that poland shoixld have East Prussia.      Marshal stalin had agreed to this,  but said, that he wantedKonigsberg as an ice-free port.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thoughtthat the Poles ought to close on this offer.        Itwould however be necessary that the greatestsecrecy should be observed, as to this proposal.We should have to try and get the Pples to say whether they were willing to accept settlement onthese lines before it had been made clear to themthat this was an offer which the Russians wouldaccent.Offices of the V/ar Cabinet, 8.
