Parliament.Debate onthe Address.(previous reference erence:W.M. (43) 155thConclusions,Minute 6.)Demand fora Debate in secret session on tank production.The War Cabinet discussed the course of the Debate on the address.Tuesday, 30th November.The Debate had so far covered a wide range of subjects in the domestic field. It was thought likely, however, that productionmatters might be raised on Tuesday, the 30th November.The War Cabinet accordingly asked the Minister of Produc-tion to speak on behalf of the Government on this date. No doubthe would deal in his speech with various matters affecting theMinistry of Town and Country Planning which had already been raised in the Debate.Wednesday, 1st December.A number of Members of Parliament wished to raise the issueof the suspension of the Detention Order in the case of Sir oswald mosley and Lady Mosley.The War Cabinet agreed that the Joint parliamentary secretary to the Treasury should inform the authorities of theHouse that the Government would be ready to deal with this matter on Wednesday, the 1st December. It seemed likely that this wouldoccupy at least half a day, or possibly a whole day. The HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security would reply for theGovernment.Thursday, 2nd December.It had been provisionally arranged that this day should be devoted to a Debate on Dominion questions. The question had been raised whether the position in Newfoundland could also bediscussed on this day, without prejudice to an adequate discussion on general Dominion issues.The War Cabinet decided that a statement should be made onNewfoundland by the Government Spokesman, probably early inthe Debate. It was hoped that the House would not wish to discussNewfoundland in detail on this date, but, if need be, further timecould be found for a discussion on some later occasion.Friday, 3rd December.It was proposed that discussion should take place on one ormore of the amendments which had been put down. It was not yet known which of these amendments would be selected.The War Cabinet was informed that the Select Committee on national Expenditure had addressed a number of questions on tank production to the Ministry of Supply. It was not likely that thesequestions would be answered under two or three weeks, or that theSelect Committee&apos;s Report would be available for two months. Inthe circumstances it was not thought that it would be possible to postpone the demand for a Debate on tank production until thisReport had been received.The War Cabinet decided that the Joint parliamentary secretary to the Treasury should oppose the suggestion that the debate on tank production should take place as part of the debate on the Address, but that he might indicate that the Governmentwould be prepared to consider affording facilities for a Debate onthis matter a little later on.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,25th November, 1943.
