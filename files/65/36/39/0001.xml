naval construction programme.Production ofNew TypeLanding ships and other changes.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 169thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The War Cabinet resumed consideration of a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (43) 549) asking forapproval for the construction of 80 new type landing ships by the1st April, 1945.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had reviewed his proposals in the light of the earlier discussion at the War Cabinet,and of the decisions reached at the Cairo Conference, and had con-suited the Minister of War Transport. He was satisfied that theproposal to construct 45 of these ships in this country would involvea loss to the merchant shipbuilding programme of only 25,000 tonsin 1944 and 35,000 tons in 1945 (or a loss of four ocean-going ships in 1944 and five in 1945). It should be possible for the remaining35 ships to be constructed in Canada without affecting the merchantship building programme at all. The Canadians had definitelystated that 17 of these ships could be built in the capacity released by the cancellation of orders for escort vessels on United Kingdomaccount. It was reasonable to suppose that the remaining 18 couldbe built in the capacity which would be released by the cancellation of orders for escort vessels on Canadian account; this proposal hadnot yet been put to the Canadians, but negotiations could be openedimmediately.The Minister of War Transport stated that, in view of theinformation that the 80 ships could be constructed without anyeffect on the Canadian output of merchant shipping and with the comparatively small effect on the United Kingdom output referredto by the First Lord of the Admiralty, he withdrew his objectionsto the proposal.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals made in W.P. (43) 549 for theconstruction of 80 new type landing ships, to be completed by the 1st April, 1945, and took note of the minor changes made in the 1943 New Construction Programme sum-marised in paragraph 8 of that Memorandum.Post-WarRelief.Food Require-ments.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 143rdConclusions,Minute 1.)2.   The War Cabinet had before them-(1) A Memorandum by the Minister of State (W.P. (43) 529)setting out the genesis, character and method of handling the relief estimates for food and other requirements which had been sent to Washington.(2) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (43) 547) about military requirements of food for civil affairs.The Minister of State explained that the estimates of food setout on page 3 of W.P. (43) 529 were hypothetical estimates whichhad been sent to the Combined Food Board in order that we mightobtain the Board&apos;s views as to the possibility of meeting them.His Majesty&apos;s Government were in no way committed to theestimates. He did not think that any other procedure would have served the object in view, namely, of ascertaining the availability ofsupplies to meet a demand of this order. When the combined food Board had reported on available supplies and the probable effect on other claimants of allocating to relief any given quantitiesof food supplies at that stage would it be necessary for the UnitedKingdom and United States Governments to consider their courseof action.The following were the main points dealt with in discussion :- (a) Were the Estimates too high ?The Paymaster-General said that it was not easy to find out on what basis the various estimates had been prepared. He pointedout that there were in existence three separate sets of figures (i) The figures in the Report drawn up by the committee presided over by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross.   These had
been submitted on behalf of the Governments of thevarious countries concerned... (ii) The figures set out in the Memorandum by the Minister ofState and known as the Sinclair-Young Estimates,(iii) The figures in the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War.He thought that all three sets of figures were too high. He was afraid that the estimates in the two Memoranda before the WarCabinet, notwithstanding their speculative nature, might be treatedas estimates which were put forward by and with the authority ofhis Majesty&apos;s Government; and that, if there was not enough to goround, there was a risk that the estimates would be used as an argument to reduce the supplies available to this country.Continuing, the Paymaster-General pointed out that theestimates in the Minister of State&apos;s paper would provide sufficientfood for 34 million people for a year, on the basis of 2,000 caloriesa head. It seemed that insufficient account had been taken of theextent to Avhich food would be available in the liberated territories.There was evidence to show that country people in the occupied territories were not too badly off for food (except in Greece). Itwas only in the towns that there was a shortage. While it might bedifficult to get the peasants in the occupied territories to disgorgefood for the people in the towns, we ought to insist on this.There was general agreement with the view that the estimates in the two memoranda before the War Cabinet must be regarded ashypothetical; and that they might prove to be considerably abovethe mark. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, on the otherhand, pointed to the fact that the demands for wheat for Italy andSicily had recently been greatly increased; and said that theestimates might prove to be on the low side.It was agreed that it should be made abundantly clear that thefigures in these memoranda had no approval from the War cabinet and were only estimates prepared in London on certain assumptions;and that the object in putting them forward was to enable the combined Food Board to examine the availability of supplies tomeet relief needs in as realistic a way as possible.(b) Would the submission of these figures prejudice our position ?The second point dealt with in discussion was what practicalsteps should be taken to make sure that the submission of thesefigures, and the way in Avhich they were handled on the CombinedBoard, did not prejudice the continuance of food supplies to thiscountry on the existing scale, or in sufficient quantities, not merely to maintain our existing standards, but to effect some improvement,at least in variety, when Germany had been defeated.The Minister of A gricultnre and Fisheries said that we mustbe careful, in stating our position, to take into account the fact that,in his view, food production in these islands had now reached a peak, and was likely to fall.The Minister of Food informed the War Cabinet that, at thepresent time, the United States War Department could requisitionfood supplies without reference to the Combined Food Board. TheUnited States War Department had accumulated very substantialfood reserves. This was not, of course, a position which we couldmodify; nor did it seem likely that this procedure would in the longrun prove injurious to our interests, more particularly seeing thatthese reserves could not be shipped without the knowledge and approval of the combined shipping authorities.The question was raised whether, as the estimates in these two memoranda were so hypothetical, any useful purpose was served bysubmitting them to the Combined Food Board. The general opinionof the War Cabinet was that the submission of these figures would[26594-3] b 2
bring home to the Americans the magnitude of the problem, and itsurgency. ,The War Cabinet agreed that the essential point was that our representative on the Combined Food Board should be given instruc-tions which would ensure that supplies to this country (and to theColonies) were treated as in a separate category from relief supplies and were not regarded as falling within a common pool.(c) The Military Period.The War Cabinet then turned to consideration of the Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for War. . This stated that theWar Office were charged with responsibility for planning,estimating, demanding and procuring, and arranging for thedistribution of, essential food supplies for the civil population formilitary areas in the military period. The latter period had beentaken as an arbitrary period of six months.. Military areas had beentaken as those in which troops are fighting and securing lines ofcommunication. A ration had been taken as 2,000 calories, after allowing for anticipated local supplies in each area. The generalsteps taken to deal with this matter were set-out in detail.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : I. Our representative on the Combined Food Board at washington should be instructed to proceed as follows : - (1) He should make it clear that the estimates of requirementsof food for relief, which had been sent to washington and were now being discussed with the United states authorities in Washington, had been put forward with-out any official approval from His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment in the United Kingdom; that they were no morethan estimates based on certain assumptions, and were put forward in order to facilitate ascertainment of thesupplies likely to be available to meet relief demands.(2) When these estimates came before the Board, he should takethe line that discussion of this matter must proceed onthe basis that there would be no diminution of thesupplies of food to this country, which must continue ona scale, at least sufficient to maintain our existingstandards, which were not susceptible to reduction.(3) He should obtain specific authority before agreeing to anyfixed allocation of food supplies for relief.II. Military Period.(4) Note was taken of the general position as regards food for civil affairs purposes in North-West Europe during themilitary period, as outlined in paragraphs 3-7 of theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for War.(5) Procurement should proceed on the basis shown in Column 2of Appendix A of the Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War.(6) A decision was deferred on the question referred to inparagraph 10 (&amp;), namely, whether distribution outsideareas of military occupation must be arranged andhandled by civil agents or by the indigenous Govern-ments concerned. (The Secretary of State for Warinformed the War Cabinet that discussions were now proceeding with the United States authorities on thismatter and undertook to report at a later date.)(7) The Secretary of State for War&apos;s view was endorsed that,save for the most compelling reasons, we should not drawfrom the Middle East reserve now being accumulated forGreece and the Balkans in order to meet the require-ments of Italy and Sicily.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,l$th December, 1943.Shipping. .     3.   The Minister of War Transport recalled: that, at theirCanadian Offer Meeting on the 10th November, the War Cabinet had deprecated of Wheat for proposal that a Canadian ship should be allocated to carry to IndiaIndia. part of the offer of 100,000 tons of wheat made by the Canadian(Previous Government towards Indian grain requirements.Reference: ^he prime Minister had sent a personal message to the PrimeW.M. (43) 152nd Minister of Canada informing him of this conclusion. The PrimeConclusions, Minister of Canada had stated, in reply, that he had cancelled them mute 2.) allocation of a Canadian ship which had been due to load from thewest coast of Canada, but hoped that at least one of the additionalCanadian ships which were being put on to the Australian runwould be used for a single voyage to India, Since then, theCanadian High Commissioner had repeatedly pressed for afavourable decision on this suggestion.The Minister of War Transport said that, from the point ofview of economy in shipping space, the proposal was still a wastefulone; but the political now perhaps outweighed the shipping aspects.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he hadbeen subject to considerable pressure by the Canadian authorities,who obviously felt very keenly in the matter, and that there had been some critical references to this question in the Canadian and UnitedStates press. In his view it would be justifiable to incur thewasteful use of one ship if in this way the political difficulties whichhad arisen would be met.The War Cabinet were reminded that we were deriving veryconsiderable assistance from Canadian food and shipping.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of War Transport, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for the Dominions, to arrangefor one ship to be allocated to carry wheat from Canada toIndia on a single voyage, and for the Canadian authoritiesto be informed of the arrangements which were being made.
