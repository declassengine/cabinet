1.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Memorandum by the Minister of State (W.P. (43) 559(Revise) ) covering reports by the various groups whichhad met at Washington for exploratory and informal discussions with United States officials on a number of matters arising under Article VII of the Mutual aid agreement. The Minister of State proposed that anofficial committee should be set up to sift the material in these reports, and that authority should be given toissue invitations forthwith to the Dominion governments to attend a further conference of experts in London,(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (W.P. (43) 566) asking that the remit to theproposed official committee should include an apprecia-tion of the full implications and effects of the proposalsemerging from the Washington talks,(iii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (43) 576), in which he associated himself with theviews of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Deputy Prime Minister suggested that, in view of the verylarge issues involved, the War Cabinet should confine themselves atthis meeting to questions of procedure. He was rather doubtful ofthe wisdom of appointing a committee of officials. It would bebetter, in his view, to invite the Minister of State himself to focusthe issues which required Ministerial decision, in such a way as tobring out clearly the implications of the points of agreement reached in the Washington Conversations, and any underlyingdivergencies of view. The Minister of State would, of course,associate with himself for this purpose such experts and advisersas he thought&apos; necessary, including officials from the Departmentsmainly concerned.General agreement was expressed with this view, the Chancellorof the Exchequer adding that, apart from the main issues of policy,some technical issues needed further clarification. It was agreedthat this process could usefully form part of the Minister of State&apos;sreport to the War Cabinet.It was also agreed&quot; in discussion that it would be helpful if ministers sent the Minister of State a note of any questions whichin their view required to be focused for consideration by the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : -(1) The Minister of State was invited to prepare and submit to the War Cabinet a report on the lines indicated in discussion, focusing the issues in these papers for con-sideration by the War Cabinet.. (2) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for India were authorised to arrangefor the reports summarising the outcome of thediscussions in Washington to be communicated to theDominion and Indian Governments, making it clear thatthese were confidential documents resulting frominformal discussions between officials.(3) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for India were also authorised to invite the Dominion and Indian Governments to send representatives to London for a further conference to beheld not later than February, at which the various issues involved could be examined by experts.Anglo-AmericanDiscussionsunderArticle YII.(previous reference:W.M.

Palestine. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(Previous Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 577). In this reference: Memorandum it was stated that Mr. Hull had informed LordW.M. (43) 92nd Halifax of the text of a statement which he proposed to make, with conclusions, a view to stalling off increasing Zionist pressure. The SecretaryMinute 2.) &apos; 0? State for Foreign Affairs attached to his Memorandum a draft telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington proposing,for Mr. Hulks consideration, an alternative statement.In discussion, it was suggested that the last sentence inparagraph 2, in which it was suggested that Lord Halifax mightundertake &quot;to do his best with Republicans,&quot; might lead tomisunderstanding. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs thought this matter could safely be left to the judgment of lord halifax, but agreed that this suggestion should be put rather moretentatively.Subject to an amendment to meet this point, the WarCabinet approved the draft telegram proposed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,21st December, 1943.
