9KoM.(59) 119th. CONCLUSIONS.E.E.B. absent *19.12.29Minute 1-.P.M*s visit to Prance.Minute g.ShippingDelays.Minute 5.BritishCasualties.W.M.C59) 120th CONCLUSIONS.20.12.S9Minute 8.Supply of aircraft to finland.The P.M. pressed the War Office to investigatewhether the 25 mm. anti-tank gun could not be adopted inthe British Army .As an illustration of the ways in which shippinggets delayed, it was noticeable that the First Lordstated that the sailing of the Norwegian Convoy had been delayed for 48 hours for fear the Germans might try toattack it as some recompense for the destruction of the admiral GRAF SPEE.The figures of casualties given by the Secretary ofState for War were 10, including 3 Offleers.   He subse-quently altered this, presumably to exclude certainaccidental casualties which resulted from one of our patrols walking into one of our own mines and had been blown up on it.   This was mentioned in the discussion.Telegram No. 256 from The Hague was mentioned bythe Foreign Secretary towards the end of the War Cabinetproceedings.   As it seemed to be contradictory to theprevious information given under this item^ it seemedas well to relate the items one to the other.There was some dispute afterwards as to whether thefree gift was to include only the 28 Gauntlets or theadditional 10 Gladiators.   In the Office we were quite certain that the gift related only tothe 28 Gauntlets.The Air Ministry asked for a copy,of the Minute and, on receiving it drafted in this sense, told us that theSecretary of State for Air had said that the gift also included the 10 Gladiators.   We said that we differedand would consult the Treasury, whereupon we were told that a decision in the wider sense had already been communicated to the Finns s   whereupon I communicated withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and got him to agree tothe gift covering both the 10 Gladiators and the 28Gauntlets.W.M.(59) 12Jst CONCLUSIONS.Nothing to record.21.12.39WoMo(39) 122nd CONCLUSIONS.22.12.59As the War Cabinet dealt first with two very longitems, the Prime Minister suggested that the usualreports on the Military and Political Situations mightbe omitted unless there was something of special interest the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that two of Our&quot;Hampdehs&quot;, which had been out oh reconnaissance overthe German flying-boat stations , had been brought down that morning by our own fi^ttters.   These aircraft hadbeen opposed by a north-west gale and had made theirlandfall in the-Firth of Forth instead Of hear the
Minute, 4 *HISTORY OFTHE WAR.Requests forspecial facili-ties forunofficialhistorians.Moray Firth.   In One bomber, one man had been killed ^but apart from injuries this was the only casualty *We had also shot down a French aeroplane ih France,and a fair days; ago the PreMb liad shot down one ofour aeroplanes.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed the view that it wasvery undesirable to grant any special facilities.When the Secretary of State for War said that hethought each Department should be allowed to judgefor itself what action to take, the Prime ministers aid that this was a very dangerous eours e.   Whenthe Secretary of State for War said that this was what was happening at present, he said that thisshould stop.The Prime Minister had to leave before the discussion1was finished,, as the Argentine Ambassador was lunchingwithhim, but he made it quite clear, before leaving,that his own view was that this application should notbe granted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR AND THE FIRST LORDstrongly opposed the proposal, as did the minister without Portfolio.THE TOST SECRETARY said that he knew that Sir RonaldStorrs had made some approach to the Foreign Office.If it appeared that the Foreign Office had gone ratherfurther than was now proposed, he would be prepared togo back on the arrangement entered into.ifTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that, while he did not wish to give any special facilities, he waitedto give Sir Ronald Storrs the facilities given to anyjournalist.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR pounced on this, and said that it was the beginning of a slippery slope.Journalists normally came in a bunch.   It was a differ-ent thing to let a man come alone, ask questions and receive answers.   He wanted itljlaid down quite clearly that no facilities should be given.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred to thesuggestion that proofs should be submitted.   This surel^opened a rather serious door. He thought that it shouldbe laid down definitely that no special facilities should be granted.&apos; v.;-;:.o- IkM^&amp;^V-:-;- %&quot;,Ji:%4;$^. - :v .V ^^      :&apos;.     W:X%S^THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR wished it to be addedthat the Same rule should apply in this war as in thelast war.THE SECRETARY:OF STATE FOR WAR then said that hewould write and say that ho special facilities couldbe accorded, but that there was a Public RelationsOfficer in the Department, and that he could, of coursCJIgo to the Public Relations Officer.The rest of the War Cabinet were not haying this,and they said that the reply should be that no special facilities could be accorded --quite straight  without any pos ts or ip t to imply that what was refus edat the front dOor could be obtained at the back door.
