W.M. (59) 78tli CONCLUSIONS.10 .11.59 .Minute 2.Naval Situa-tion.Minute 10,shipping position.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY reported thatthe NELSON and RODNEY and attendant vessels had arrived at Rosyth,        that the HOOD was approachingPlymouth.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that our imports in the first two months of war had been 50per cent. of the normal.   He thought that when the convoy system was working at its most favourable, thedelay should not result in a reduction of more than20 per cent, of our normal imports l   i.e., he hoped for a 50 per cent, improvement.W.M.(59 ) 79th CONCLUSIONS.11.11.59.Minute 2 .German AirForce.Minute 5.Naval Situa-tion.Arising out of the discussion on Minute   2(&quot;German Air Force:    Information obtained fromPrisoners&quot;) THE FIRST LORD   OF THE ADMIRALTY expressedthe view that parachute troops landed from aircraft should not be regarded as entitled to surrender.   Inhis view they were not in the same position as airmenlanding by parachute in distress after aerial combat.The latter were in the same position as,shipwreckedsailors, and should receive every consideration.   Butjust as shipwrecked men who were armed and attackedtheir rescuers on shore would not be entitled tosuch consideration, so parachute troops were outlawsand should be given no quarter.Considerable discussion ensued on this question,in which the arguments in favour of treating parachutetroops in the same way as other military forces were brought out by other members of the War Cabinet.   Itwas suggested that the operation was really equivalentto landing troops on the coast of an invaded countryin order to outflank the defences.   There was, ofr course, no reason why parachutists should not be attacked by every possible means, both during andafter their landing.   But it would be out of thequestion to issue orders that no quarter should beallowed to parachutists.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY explained thatthe Fleet was still at Rosyth, and that the HOOD had arrived at Plymouth.W.M.
