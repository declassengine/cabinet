At the end, after all but the War Cabinet hadretired, information was given as to President Roose-velfs peace feelers, which wales recorded elsewhere.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY reminded his colleagues that before he went to Paris he had said that he expected to see Mr Prytz.   Re had failed to do so as mr Prytz had been delayed.   He asked for the PrimeMinister&apos;s mind as to whether he should ask to see Mr Prytz at once, or whether this would give too muchprominence.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the foreign secretary should give Mr Prytz 24 hours to ask for an interview, and, if he did not do so, that Lord Halifaxshould then take the initiative.W.M.

It would, therefore,]be extremely embarrassing for the War Office to quoteany figure.At the end of the Meeting there was a referenceto a scare which had started through a red balloonfloating about in the Eastern Counties.   This balloonhad been sent up for meteorological purposes, but ithad apparently given rise to a scare that gas balloonswere being let loose by the Germans.
