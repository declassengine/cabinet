before, THE FIRST LORD? with a chuckle, said &quot;Whileyou are putting pressure on neutral countries, would it not be a good plan if you were to put some pressure on the B.B.C.?&quot;   THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR,perhaps even more cynically, said &quot;Is it fair to regard them as neutral?&quot;(Tuesday to Friday of this week was one ofthe heaviest weeks we have had, with verylate hours.   Virtually, all this was attributable to work in connection withthe S.W.C.)W.M. (40)  78th CONCLUSIONS . 1 .4 .40.In connection with Minute 4, THE PRIME minister  explained, in connection with the importance of secrecy, that it had come to our notice that copiesof an important document recording the results of discussions between our Chiefs of Staff and the FrenchChiefs of Staff, on the eve of the Supreme War Council,had been given to the French Chiefs of Staff.   the copy which had been given to General Gamelin had cometo light a:few days later in a chair, behind a cushion,in the Hyde Park Hotel.   This matter had been very fully investigated, and there seemed every reason to hope that no damage had been done.   Nevertheless, thiswas a very disquieting disclosure of the way in which our French Allies are apt to behave.   The wholebusiness had. been kept very dark, but we had broughtit fairly forcibly to the notice of the French higher command.W.M. (40 )  79th CONCLUSIONS . 2 .4 .40.A quiet day.   Very little of any importance to record.But for the last item the War Cabinet would havelasted only three-quarters of an hour. But the lastitem, namely, German Oil Supplies, was somewhatlengthy.In the afternoon, the first Meeting since thewar of the Ministerial Priority Committee was held to discuss Steel allocations.   We had been verydespondent as to getting a definite decision out ofthe Committee, and had rather come to the view thatthe type of Committee which had been devised fordealing with priority questions was not altogethersuitable.   Altogether, we had spent nearly a month,allowing for the Easter Holidays, in informal meetings between the Minister.for Co-ordination of Defence,Colonel LI ew ell in, Sir John Anders on   Mr As shot on, inobtaining information from various sources.   .Notwithstanding that there were at least 25people at the Meeting, we succeeded in getting asettlement of a sort after 2^ hours&apos; discussion - a result far better than we had expected.
