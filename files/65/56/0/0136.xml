W.M. (40) 65th CONCLUSIONS.11 .5 .40.Minute 6*Ass istanceto Finland.Minute 5?The recentRaid onthe SaarFront.The First Lord in very good form, in connection with one of the attacks on a U-boat.   He said that in additionto Oil rising slowly to the surface, there had also beena very strong smell of rum (Loud laughter). He also reportedthat the only point about the dummy ships which was notlife-like was that there were fewer seagulls round them.He hoped to get a bread ration out of the Ministry of food to remedy this!   He also toldda story about the captain of one of the (real) ships coming into scapa, who had beenvery much annoyed that no signals had been sent them fromthe dummies!Once again the real discussion was on Finland.   Therewas considerable discussion as to how far we should, go inendeavouring to force our way into Finland;   but there wasno dispute as to the next step we should take.The First Lord made some reference to the recent raidoh part of the Saar front occupied by a battalion of the duke of Cornwall&apos;s Light Infantry.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR&apos;WAR concurred.THE FIRST LORD then said that he hoped that theSecretary of State for War would proceed with his policyof returning to the position of having Officers in eachplatoon.   He made some comments in this connection on thepolicy of the Secretary of State&apos;s predecessor.There followed some discussion as to the differencebetween the German system of Warrant Officers and our ownsystem.THE C.I.G.S. said that the position would be restored to that previously existing as soon as sufficient young officers could be sent out.W.M. (40)  66th CONCLUSIONS12 .5 .40.Minute 2.Assistanceto Finland.Apart from half an hour spent on the first item, Russia,the whole Meeting was taken up with discussion of aid to finland, and, in particular, with the instructions to begiven to Commanders as to the extent to which force shouldbe used.   On this -it appeared that the Chiefs of Staffs&apos;aide-memoire   contemplated far more drastic action thanMinisters had intended generally, or, indeed, than was contemplated in the instructions prepared by the War Officeand the Admiralty.   The result was a long, somewhat confuseddiscussion, which left matters in a difficult state.   TheConclusions were a little titivated up, in consultation with sir Horace Wilson and General Ismay in the course of the afternoon, as a preliminary to the meeting presided over bythe Prime Minister and attended by thrCe other Ministers,the Chiefs of Staff andvthe Naval and Military Commanders.This meeting was thoroughly,satisfactory, and resulted in real understanding between Ministers and the Commanders asto the very limited extent to which force should be used.It was rather hard not to be cynical when observingthat at the very moment when these instructions were beingfinally clewed up, messages were being reported on zhewireless and on the tape to the effect that Finland and russia had come to terms.   I am bound to say, however, that
a good many of us felt so little real confidence in the expedition that we could not avoid the feeling that perhapsit would be as well if this proved to be the way out.Minutes 2and 4 .RoyalMarineOperation.proposed meeting of supreme WarCouncil.Minute 6.Finland.M. Baladier&apos;sSpeech.Minute 7*Mr sumner welles *Visit.daysW.M. (40)  67th CONCLUSIONS . IS .5 .40.A quiet day after the excitements of the last fewThe First Lord was somewhat perturbed by the Frenchnow saying that they wanted to wait two months before theystarted the Royal Marine operation.   By that time themelted ice would be coming down from the Rhine, and thiswas likely to hamper the operation.   Indeed, in some of thetributaries the waters might be flowing the wrong way.The general view was that it was clear that the french were really anxious to postpone the operation, and that theywere making unduly heavy weather about the aeroplanes atVillacoublay.The First Lord made it clear that the reason why hewas so keen for a Meeting of the Supreme War Council wasthat he wanted us to recover the initiative, which he hopedwe should have taken had the Narvik Expedition fructified.It was he who proposed to put up ideas which should bediscussed by the Staffs before consideration at the supreme war Council.The Prime Minister was quite hot about M. Daladier&apos;sspeech on the previous day.   His evident desire was totake the matter up;   but he felt that it was quite likely that it would be found that M. Daladier had cleverly lefthimself a way out.   He gave two instances of the way inwhich he had done this.   Thus, in one passage he had mentioned 50,000 troops as available to proceed to Finland,but he did not say that the Expeditionary Force consisted of that number.   In another passage, expressly referring to the Expeditionary Force, he did not mention any specificnumber.   Again, in the passage relating to the British sharehe had stated that the main burden both as regards ships and troops would fall on His Majesty&apos;s Government.No Minister made any reference to what was to be done as to a stand-fast of the expedition, notwithstandingvarious hints to this effect, and this matter was taken upin the course of the afternoon.There were one or two interesting points not recorded in the Minutes.   Mr Sumner Welles had been aware of thesubterranean movements in Germany which were alleged to havethe support of the German Generals.   Again, speaking of mussolini, Mr Sumher Welles had said that, although he didnot look like a man who had had a stroke, he had been Shockat his appearance, and that he looked like a man who had gone through a severe strain.The Prime Minister started off his statement by sayingthat Mr Sumner Welles had been bluffed very hard in Berlin.able.Generally, the impression gained was far from favour-
