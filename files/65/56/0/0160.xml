Appointment THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the present of Agent in      proposal was to appoint Sir Nevile Bland to Vichy.Prance. He was a rather more senior man than they had originally intended to appoint.   On the other hand, he was tough,and would do the job extremely well.THE PRIME MINISTER thought it was better to send a rather too senior man than the reverse.Minute, 2.C-in-G home forces.Middle East,coast defences.Tanks o-WdU(40) 208th CONCLUSIONS.19.7.40.THE PRIME MINISTER, who had been attending aMeeting of the Defence Committee from 11 till 12.30 p.m.gave an account of some defence matters.   He said thatthe Secretary of State for War had definitely decidedthat Sir A.F. Brooke should succeed Ironside.   Ironsidewould get his baton, but they did not want him in India.The Indian appointment could be left for the moment.Probably Auchinleck. would get it in October.In the Middle East it was important to strengthenup morale.   The Admiralty was now considering sending a force consisting of HOOD, BARHAM and VALIANT, andthree Aircraft-carriers - ILLUSTRIOUS, ARK ROYAL andARGUS.   This would be the greatest sea-borne air forceever dreamed of.   The idea was that this force shouldadvance and should meet the Mediterranean force coming from Alexandria.   BARHAM and ILLUSTRIOUS would then pass into the Eastern Mediterranean, with stores for Alexan-dria, a convoy from Malta having also been passed in.There was always a chance that this movement might result in a scrap with the Italian Fleet.   The whole position was being studied, and it could not take place for a month or so.The Prime Minister then dealt with our coast defences (the subject of the Defence Meeting at 11 o&apos;c).We had now done a lot of work on the East Coast and onthe South Coast. The extent of the forces locked up in home defence showed the torturing power of the enemyhaving the initiative.   We must not get into the positionof having to defend the whole of the West Coast on thesame standard. The first thing to do was to take actionagainst 35 ships in the Gironde and at St. Nazaire(both German-occupied territory), which might be a threat to an attack on our West Coast.The next line of defence was a patrol in theWestern Approaches, a patrol which would be greatly strengthened if we could have a Southern Irish port.The practicability of this was, however, a matter whichmust depend on how it affected the Irish balance;i.e*, would, this action turn the Irish against us?The third line of defence was to put a minefieldacross the southern end of St. George*s Channel to the bristol Channel, thereby protecting our Western Coast.The Prime Minister also referred to the upshot ofhis Meeting at 10 a.m. of the Defence Supply Committeeon Tanks.   He said that a thoroughly satisfactory scheme had been devised, which had now been wrecked by theWar Office once again insisting on making modifications.He thought it would be a very good plan if Mr Morrisonwould agree to hand over Tanks to Lord Beaverbrook.The Minister of Supply had a vast amount of work on hand,g-70- :3&apos;y[-    &apos;
piand lie thought that it would be a fair distribution ofwork if Lord Beaverbrook, who was not wholly occupied,was to take over Tanks.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL undertook to throw a fly overMr Morrison.
