They would probably say that we couldnot. attack ourselves in 1940, but that the germans might attack in the Balkans.W.M.

All this to illustrate the extent of theNaval resources which had had to be disposed to accom-plish the catching of the GRAF SPEE.This was the first of the rota Meetings held on aSaturday.
