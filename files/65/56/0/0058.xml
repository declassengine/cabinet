Soviet Russia.regard to magnetic mines.   THE FIRST LORD did not regard it as the duty of the Legal Advisers of theForeign Office to put the legal point of view, but rather to find a colourful pretext for the particularline of action which the First Lord favoured.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER remarked that oneof these days we should have to settle our attitude to Russia, and said that there was a lot of public feeling in this country that the Russians were headingin just the abominable way to Finland as the germans had to Poland, and that we ought to declare war on them.THE FIRST LORD replied that we had given a guaran-tee to Poland but had not done so to Finland, and thatwe had enough on our hands already.W.M.(59) 111th CONCLUSIONS.11.12 .59.Minute 2.Magnetic Mines.Minute 5.Iron Ore.THE FIRST LORD said that the mines so far recover-ed were those able&apos;jto be dropped by aircraft.   One ofthe type laid by a sunmarine had not yet been obtained.It seems to be thought that the submarine mine hastwo explosions;   possibly one which releases it fromthe bottom, and another when it comes in contact witha ship.   This would explain the nature of the damagesustained by the NELSON,The code arranged between theFirst Lord andMr Kennedy for communication on this matter was thatif Mr Kennedy replied &quot;My wife cannot express an opinion&quot;, this would mean that while the president was not prepared to commit himself, he did not receive!the notion too badly.    If he reacted very unfavourably!the message was to be something like the following:&quot;My daughter is unable to accept the invitation&quot;.The answer received had been &quot;My wife cannot express an opinion, but received the proposal more favourablythan I had expected&quot;.W.M.(59) 112th CONCLUSIONS.12 .12 .59..Minute 3.naval situation.Minute. 10,League ofNations.THE FIRST LORD announced a collision between theBARHAM and the DUCHESS, causing the latter to sinkwith a loss of SO to 70 lives, in a very cold-bloodedway, being, I think, nettled at the continuance ofthese misfortunes.This gave rise to a little outburst by the PRIMEMINISTER, who said that it was time we had a little change of luck.THE FIRST LORD voiced his feeling that many people in this country, who deplored the evil times the Leaguehad fallen upon, would wel come^iaction taken by theGovernment at the present Meeting.
