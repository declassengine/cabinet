that he had not slept properly for three nights at thetime of the speech he made about Finland.   This, nodoubt, accounted for the fact that he had said certainthings that he would not have said if he had been infull command of his judgment.   It was thought that itmight be a good plan to get him over here for a coupleof days and get him to quieten down somewhat.In the discussion about Holland, the foreign secretary said that M. Colijn had told him that he hadbeen anxious to discuss for a couple of hours with theFirst Lord a proposal he had for a new gospel to be put to the neutrals, which he wished to expound to theLeague of Nations Committee.   After an interview of a couple of hours with the First Lord, however, he onlygot to the point of obtaining permission to send to theFirst Lord a written memorandum explaining the point a tissue.   This had a very good reception!     (The meeting was not over until nearly 2 o* clock .)W.M. (40)  70th Conclusions . IS.5 .40.One of the most coffee-housing of all our Meetings!We wandered, all round the place, and discussed nearlyeverything under the sun.   The First Lord of the Admiralty,in particular, took a very gloomy view of what would nowhappen in the Balkans.   He thought that Roumania, andprobably Yugo-Slavia, would be squeezed, and that wewould not be able to do anything.Among other matters there was a short discussion on the Royal Marine Operation.   Reference was again madeto the fact that the French were basing their request-for postponement on the fact that 300 aircraft were atpresent in the open and exposed to great danger of attack.This, however, was generally felt to be a pretext.Nevertheless, it was clearly impossible for us to carryout the first part of the operation without Frenchcons ent.The First Lord read out a letter which he hadreceived from General Gamelin.   This letter, however,did not add very much to our information on the subject.(i spent most of the afternoon at a meeting between Horace Wilson and M. Jean Monnet, at whichdiscussion started on a memorandum which M. daladier had recently put to the French Cabinet, outlining proposalfor bringing the French economic effort into harmony with their war effort.   This was the paper on which m. Monnet had helped M. Daladier considerably in thefive weeks which he had recently spent in Paris.After about an hour, Arthur Robinson went away,and the discussion really turned on the French proposals(again fathered by M. Monnet) for setting up a FrenchWar Cabinet organisation and on methods of strengthening the French Administration.   I got theimpression thatM. Monnet stands in very much the same relation toM. Daladier as his interrogator did to our Prime Minister^W.M. (40)  71st CONCLUSIONS. 18.5 .4Q.Not a very long Meeting, but a great many subjectswere touched on.One got the general impression that the arrange-ments for the defence of Scapa had not been awfully well-56-

It was clear, however, that the admiralty and the Air Ministry were both working at the positionvery hard.Nothing else of particular importance in a veryquiet Meeting.P.S.   It should be noted that the raid on Scapacaused the first civilian casualty in thiscountry resulting from a German air raid.W.M. (40)  72nd CONCLUSIONS19 oo .40.A quiet Meeting.The decision to take a much more forthcomingline in regard to assistance to the Netherlands wasreached without any difficulty, notwithstanding thefact that the extent to which we could lend assistanceto Holland has not been fully worked out.   It seems tobe generally agreed, however, that the Dutch are in amuch better position to resist than they were last autumn, and that, provided they put up a decent res is t-ance, we ought to be able to come to their help.This was a very rambling discussion - what thediplomats call a tour d&apos; horizon, covering the iron oretraffic, the position in the Balkans, the Royal marine operation, the likelihood of an early Meeting of theSupreme War Council, and. one or two other matters in passing.    It seemed to be generally agreed that we arepassing through one of our periodical bad patches, fromthe point of view of prestige abroad. The French, inparticular, are jumpy and anxious to do something, andare liable to try and push us into something ratherfoolish.Minute 5.The naval situation.The First Lord gave more details of the Luleaproject.   As, &quot;however, we had had all this the day before,it was not worth while&apos;repeating it.The Prime Minister suggested that we might make some play with the fact that vjust at the time whenHitler and Mussolini were embracing on the Brenner,an Italian ship in ballast from Rotterdam to italy was being mined off the North Foreland.Nothing of particular interest.W.M. (40) 73 rd CONCLUSIONS. 20.3 .40.A nice, quiet, short Cabinet.Minute 1 * Everyone was delighted at the success of the attackon Sylt.   This was the first occasion on which our air Attack        bombers had really had things their own way.on Sylt.I When the discussion was proceeding as to thet likelihood of reprisals, the P.M. said that the weather was clouding over, and we must not assume that theGermans would have a clear night for an attack this evening.Wing-Commander Elliot afterwards said to me thatthisshowed the amateur&apos;s outlook, since any flying man-57- &quot;Sv-1&quot;-
