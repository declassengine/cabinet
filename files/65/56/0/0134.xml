Minute 5.Royal marine operation.Minute, 9.The coal situation.Minister of Economic Warfare&apos;s views - an account whichwe were subsequently informed was quite inaccurate.There has been some &quot;wigs on the green&quot; behind the sceneson this.   Fortunately, however, there is no dispute as tothe Conclusion reached.Ws regards the Royal Marine Operation, I was subsequently informed that the Chancellor of the exchequer was very anxious that it should not come off on Tuesdayor Wednesday, as he was anxious to get his  300,000,000Loan safely harvested before this comes Off.The last item, in regard to the Coal Situation, was again produced without warning, by the Lord Privy Seal.Subsequently to the Meeting, the Minister of Transportinformed me that the Supply Departments were very muchupset at the idea that for a further week priority shouldbe given to coal traffic.   This information was not beforethe War Cabinet.W.M. (40)  64th CONCLUSIONS.9 .5 .40.Minute g.Shipping inthe Downs.Minute 4.Assistanceto Finland.D.C.N.S. thought that one reason why the germans had not attacked, shipping in the Downs was that theshipping there comprised such a lot of neutral shipping,and. that some part of the cargoes eventually found its way through to Germany.On Finland the general view seemed to be that it was unlikely that the Finns would make their appeal.Royal NavalOperation.There was a little further talk about the royal marine Operation which was not incorporated in theMinutes.Visit ofMr sumner welles.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the draft declarationhad been agreed and was being sent over to Paris by the hand of a messenger (this really meant Mr Hopkinson, ofthe Anglo-French Liaison Section).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER again made his point that he hoped, that Tuesday and Wednesday would, be days ofcalm skies .There was some discussion as to whether the french would let out the secret.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat the only secret which to the best of his knowledgethe French had ever kept had been the news of the visit of King George VI to Paris in the previous summer:    towhich THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that it had been con-siderably in the interest of the French to keep that dark.At the end of the Meeting THE FOREIGN SECRETARY askedadvice as to the arrangements for the entertainment ofMr Sumner Welles.   The main idea was that he should be entertained at small parties,.not exceeding eight, butthat he should be asked to meet the members of the WarCabinet, the Chiefs of Staff, the Leaders of the Opposi-tion and one or two people such as the Minister ofInformation (Sir John Reith), Sir John Anderson and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
