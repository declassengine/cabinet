a very calm and amicable settlement.   The First Lord was,I think, conscious of having taken a very violent line and was anxious to do the generous and maker amends.And so for the Easter holidays, arranged, as at christmas, on the rota system.   There was a fairly general expectation that Easter would see fireworks and that weshould all be called back again.   In point of fact, theOffice was, I believe^ extremely quiet until the afternoon of Monday, when arrangements for the Meeting of theSupreme War Council on Thursday began to boil up.minute e 4.Supreme WarCouncil.W.M. (40)  75th CONCLUSIONS.86.5 .40.A very quiet day:   nothing of importance to record.In connection with the arrangements for the Meetingof the Supreme War Council, the Prime Minister said thathe understood M. Reynaud had formed a War Cabinet of nine Ministers, all of whom had Departmental responsibilities -ties.   This was amusing in view of the fact that it hadbeen suggested that M. Reynaud was going to show thePrime Minister how to arrange a proper War Cabinet!&apos;.M. (40)  76th CONCLUSIONS.27.5 .40.Minute 1.Supreme WarCouncil.Norwegian^rritorial^Piters.It had not been intended to have a Meeting this day.The Foreign Secretary&apos; had suggested, that it might bepossible for the Prime Minister and himself to settle the line to be taken by the British representatives atthe Meeting of the Supreme War Council to be held, on the ensuing day without holding a War Cabinet.    I advisedArthur Rucker that there&apos;were too many important points to be settled for this to be&apos;quite decent.In the result we had. a long and very valuable WarCabinet Meeting.    It was one of the days on which eachsubject ran into the next, and the discussion rangedfrom one subject to another, back again, and to and froall over the place.   This has all been tidied up in theMinutes, in which no regard is paid to chronology.The only points of importance were as follows.On the general situation the Prime Ministerexpressed in the strongest terms his feelings on readingM. Reynaud*s Paper (W.P.(40) 109).   He said that itthrew a horrifying light on the French Prime Minister,who was rattled.   He thought that he must create an impression on the French mind.   None of the Frenchprojects had. been properly thought out.In dealing with the revived project for putting aminefield in Norwegian territorial waters THB FIRST LORDgave one of his&apos; typical passages.   He described ourwarships, which had been on a sweep in the Skagerrak,as hungry cattle browsing up to the fence and nibblingthrough it.   He made the point strongly that the communications which we were to make to the norwegian and Swedish Governments would involve no strongerprotests than the laying of a minefield.\
On the Royal Marine Operation THE SECRETARY of state FOR AIR made the prophecy that the French would want to postpone it until June.SIXTH MEETING OF THE SUPREME WAR COUNCILS8th MARCHy 1940.This Meeting is very fully recorded.   (We had ina succession of Assistant Secretaries to report it,,for the first time, and there is little to record.)The Prime Minister started off by an orationwhich must have lasted, for almost an hour and a half.One got the impression, usual in these Conferences,that there was not the slightest chance of everfinishing the Agenda under three days;   and then,after a time, things began to go quickly.M. Reynaud has a curious habit of wriggling hishead inside his collar, and at moments does look likesome rather cunning little animal peeping out of itshole.   The animal, however, is not quite a fox, but some special mountain species of animal.   He looksmore like a marmot than any other man I have seen.Generally, the impression he made on me was of less directness and rather more cunning than M.Dalad.3er.It is only fair to add. that he also gave one theimpression of being about five times as able as anyof the people in the rest of his party.   Laurent Eynaclooked, very ordinary, and Campinehi did not strikeone as being a strong man.W.M. (40)  77th CONCLUSIONS. 89 .3 .40.The main point dealt with was the P.M&apos;s accountof the Meeting of the Supreme War Council, which iscut down in the Minutes as it was available in theMinutes of the Meeting itself.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at first he had thought that the reasons given for M. Daladier&apos;sabsence were a pretext, and that M. Daladier&apos;s legwas only diplomatically worse.   After talking toM. Leger, however, he had. been convinced, that thereason was genuine.   At the same time he thought thatit was probably a good thing that he had not come, asit might have been somewhat embarrassing that he shouldbe present at the first Supreme War Council attended byM. Reynaud.There was very little of importance to record.       -jIn the Confidential Annex   in regard to actionin Norwegian territorial waters, THE FIRST SEA LORDsaid that the minefield could be laid in about twentyminutes.   It was a great surprise to everyone,including the First Lord,   who thought the operation would take some hours.There was a rather bright remark dealing with theNaval Operation.   After the P.M. had been inveighingagainst the action of the B.B.C. in giving, without anycomment, the completely untrue German account of an air attack on a convoy which had taken place the evenjnj
