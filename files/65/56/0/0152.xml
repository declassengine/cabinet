insufficient that the War Office had asked the treasury to make up the booty to a decent level, which theTreasury had refused to do.    Incidentally, 1874 wasthe year of birth of the Right Hon. Gentleman the FirstLord of the Admiralty, and the abolition of booty inthat year might be said to be the first reform for whichhe was1 responsible!There was also some interesting play as to the division of prize-money in the last war.   Thus, theCommander-in-chief got 1,000 shares;    the Admiral incharge of a Squadron, 600 shares;    the Canteen Staff,2 shares, each; the value of each share being  6.15-0.Below the Admiral the rates had, of course, been scaleddown.   Here the Minister for Co-ordination of defence said &quot;Scaled, down very rapidly&quot;.   This caused a gooddeal of amusement, which I do not think Lord Chatfieldaltogether shared.The end of this discussion was cut short as most members of the War Cabinet were attending the memorial service to the late Sir John Gilmour at 12.15.W.M.(40) 81.8JLJ3QHCLUSI01g,o4.4 .40 .This was the first Meeting after the changes inthe Government.   Before the Meeting I had a ratheraffecting farewell from the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.Minute, 2 .Anglo-italian relations.Rather a quiet Meeting:importance.no item of outstandingThe discussion on this item, which emerged outof the discussion on Contraband Control, was of ratherspecial interest.   I was impressed once again with thesure gr8.sp which the Prime Minister, seems to have ofthe psychological basis of the Italian situation.   Heseems to know his own mind exactly as to how he is goingto tackle Signor Mussolini.The information received from Mr Wedgwood Bennwas passed on to the Prime Minister by Mr Attlee.Nothing else of special interest.Minute 5.NorwegianTerritorialWaters.pyal Marineperation.W.M. (40) 82nd CONCLUSIONS.5.4.40.The most noteworthy point was the definite decisionto proceed with the laying of a minefield in norwegian territorial waters, notwithstanding the fact that theFrench definitely refused to agree to the Royal marine operation.When the First Lord telephoned to the foreign secretary and said that the French would not agree tothe Royal Marine Operation, so far from appearingdissatisfied with the decision, the First Lord said  &quot;that he now felt that ityould be impossible for us totake the responsibility of pressing the step further.He seemed, indeed, to be almost persuaded that it wouldbe undesirable to carry it out at the present time.
This was too much for the Prime Minister, who told the story of the man who had a parrot which swore terribly,and, in order to cure it of this habit, another parrotwith refined language was put into the saiie room.   Theresult was that there was no improvement in the language of the swearing parrot, but that the second parrotlearned to swear horribly.   The P&apos;JB. told this withgreat gusto.Minute 6.Scandinavia.Allied Notesto norwegian and swedish governments.WJSfi. (40) 85rd CONCLUSIONS,6j4 o40The Foreign Secretary was obviously rather deeplyperturbed by the Swedish reaction to the communicationmade to the Swedish and Norwegian Governments.The Prime Minister took it all very calmly,realising, I think, that it was time for a littlerough-stuff on our part, and that there was no usedoing rough-stuff half-heartedly.In the course of the Meeting it emerged, thatMr Mallet had not been told what in fact were the stepswe were proposing to take.   This seemed rather a mistakeand likely to put him in a false position at Stoclcholm.It was agreed that he should at once be informed, in confidence, of the position.W.M. (40)  84th CONCLUSIONS.        8.4 .40Minute 2.Naval Opera-tions offNorway.Minute 5.fcioyal marine operation.The chief event was the First Lord&apos;s description of the Naval operations proceeding off the West coast of Norway, which was extremely dramatic;   In particular,the fact that the GLOWWORM had dropped astern through a man having fallen overboard and thus first came into contact with the enemy&apos;s Fleet.The general opinion seemed to be that our activi-ties had completely puzzled the Germans and had stirredthem up to take action, and very likely to take someextremely ill-judged and hazardous action.   The PrimeMinister went so far as to say that if Hitler had ordered a sea-borne expedition to Narvik-in the face of his military advisers and it had ended in disaster,it might result in his fall.The Foreign Secretary suggested that we might taithe Norwegians that we had laid our minefields because we knew that the Germans were going to take this action.I am glad to say that this suggestion was quashed.   Itwould not have borne examination for a moment.   In anycase a public declaration of laying a minefield in territorial waters is not the right counter to a sea-borne invasion.In regard to theRoyal Marine Operation, the lord privy Seal said that at the Press Conference which hehad held that morning, one Pressman, Broadbent of the&quot;Baily Mail&quot; had asked a question about the Secondoperation? and had replied, when the Lord Privy Sealasked him where he had got his information from, thatit had come from France and that it was common knowledge that a second operation was contemplated but had beenshelved.
