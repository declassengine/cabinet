On the Royal Marine Operation THE SECRETARY of state FOR AIR made the prophecy that the French would want to postpone it until June.SIXTH MEETING OF THE SUPREME WAR COUNCILS8th MARCHy 1940.This Meeting is very fully recorded.   (We had ina succession of Assistant Secretaries to report it,,for the first time, and there is little to record.)The Prime Minister started off by an orationwhich must have lasted, for almost an hour and a half.One got the impression, usual in these Conferences,that there was not the slightest chance of everfinishing the Agenda under three days;   and then,after a time, things began to go quickly.M. Reynaud has a curious habit of wriggling hishead inside his collar, and at moments does look likesome rather cunning little animal peeping out of itshole.   The animal, however, is not quite a fox, but some special mountain species of animal.   He looksmore like a marmot than any other man I have seen.Generally, the impression he made on me was of less directness and rather more cunning than M.Dalad.3er.It is only fair to add. that he also gave one theimpression of being about five times as able as anyof the people in the rest of his party.   Laurent Eynaclooked, very ordinary, and Campinehi did not strikeone as being a strong man.W.M. (40)  77th CONCLUSIONS. 89 .3 .40.The main point dealt with was the P.M&apos;s accountof the Meeting of the Supreme War Council, which iscut down in the Minutes as it was available in theMinutes of the Meeting itself.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at first he had thought that the reasons given for M. Daladier&apos;sabsence were a pretext, and that M. Daladier&apos;s legwas only diplomatically worse.   After talking toM. Leger, however, he had. been convinced, that thereason was genuine.   At the same time he thought thatit was probably a good thing that he had not come, asit might have been somewhat embarrassing that he shouldbe present at the first Supreme War Council attended byM. Reynaud.There was very little of importance to record.       -jIn the Confidential Annex   in regard to actionin Norwegian territorial waters, THE FIRST SEA LORDsaid that the minefield could be laid in about twentyminutes.   It was a great surprise to everyone,including the First Lord,   who thought the operation would take some hours.There was a rather bright remark dealing with theNaval Operation.   After the P.M. had been inveighingagainst the action of the B.B.C. in giving, without anycomment, the completely untrue German account of an air attack on a convoy which had taken place the evenjnj
before, THE FIRST LORD? with a chuckle, said &quot;Whileyou are putting pressure on neutral countries, would it not be a good plan if you were to put some pressure on the B.B.C.?&quot;   THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR,perhaps even more cynically, said &quot;Is it fair to regard them as neutral?&quot;(Tuesday to Friday of this week was one ofthe heaviest weeks we have had, with verylate hours.   Virtually, all this was attributable to work in connection withthe S.W.C.)W.M. (40)  78th CONCLUSIONS . 1 .4 .40.In connection with Minute 4, THE PRIME minister  explained, in connection with the importance of secrecy, that it had come to our notice that copiesof an important document recording the results of discussions between our Chiefs of Staff and the FrenchChiefs of Staff, on the eve of the Supreme War Council,had been given to the French Chiefs of Staff.   the copy which had been given to General Gamelin had cometo light a:few days later in a chair, behind a cushion,in the Hyde Park Hotel.   This matter had been very fully investigated, and there seemed every reason to hope that no damage had been done.   Nevertheless, thiswas a very disquieting disclosure of the way in which our French Allies are apt to behave.   The wholebusiness had. been kept very dark, but we had broughtit fairly forcibly to the notice of the French higher command.W.M. (40 )  79th CONCLUSIONS . 2 .4 .40.A quiet day.   Very little of any importance to record.But for the last item the War Cabinet would havelasted only three-quarters of an hour. But the lastitem, namely, German Oil Supplies, was somewhatlengthy.In the afternoon, the first Meeting since thewar of the Ministerial Priority Committee was held to discuss Steel allocations.   We had been verydespondent as to getting a definite decision out ofthe Committee, and had rather come to the view thatthe type of Committee which had been devised fordealing with priority questions was not altogethersuitable.   Altogether, we had spent nearly a month,allowing for the Easter Holidays, in informal meetings between the Minister.for Co-ordination of Defence,Colonel LI ew ell in, Sir John Anders on   Mr As shot on, inobtaining information from various sources.   .Notwithstanding that there were at least 25people at the Meeting, we succeeded in getting asettlement of a sort after 2^ hours&apos; discussion - a result far better than we had expected.
