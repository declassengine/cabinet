Il5 5W .M . (40) 88th CONCLUS IONS .10*2*40,Minute 1,The Air^Situation,Minute 1.The air situation.Minute 2.The naval situation.Minute 12.Palestine.Minute 1,Nationales ourcesand. our war Effort.The reason why the Air Ministry did not claim the aircraft brought down in the sea, was that thiscame from what was known in the last war as a &quot;Japanese&quot;source of information.(Lord Hankey came to see me onMonday.   He thought the bowdlerisedversion in the Minutes was a littletoo open.)The Meeting turned into a rather general informal discussion of a number of points which cropped up.These are recorded in a separate note which was notcirculated.(SUPRA)W.M. (40) 59th CONCLUSIONS.12.2.40 .The reconnaissance related to a photograph ofJade and the Ems Estuary.   Both Wilhelmshaven and Emsharbours were frozen up.   The reconnaissance had beencarried out by a Spitfire especially cleaned up, thebolts smoothed down, thereby adding 15 miles to the speed.   Photographs were handed round to the WarCabinet, which had been taken at a height of 32,000 ft.This Spitfire was unarmed, and relied on speed for avoiding action.   The Air Ministry thought that, theyhad spotted 50 or 60 submarines in Emden, frozen inthe harbour.    It was this information which is referredto in the Conclusions.   It emerged next day, however,that the so-called submarines were only^barges.THE FIRST LORD described the steps that had beentaken to intercept the 6 German ships which had leftVigo.   He also described how the gale had interruptedthe task of completing the defences of Scapa Flow.   Oneofithe blockships had rolled off into deep water.   Thiswas in addition to the three blockships which had been sunk on the way up.   There seems to be a fatality aboutthe blockships at scapa.A long and troublesome discussion, leading to a conclusion which I think was inevitable beforehand,namely, that the First Lord was prepared to give way tothe views of his colleagues, after a stout resistance.W.M. (40) 40th CONCLUSIONS.15 .2 .40.A very long Meeting - two hours and a half.Nearly the whole time was occupied in dealing with minute 1 - a survey of our national resources.This at one time promised to be an extremelycontentious item.   The conclusion of the Meeting,however, was really determined longfoefore the meeting was held, by the fact that it had been arranged thatthe Paper from the Military Co-ordination Committeeon the Equipment of the British Army should be taken at the same Meeting, and the fact that this latter paper was based on the Report drawn up by the Secretary ofState for War and the Ministry of Supply, in conjunction-6 6-
