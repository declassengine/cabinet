The statement which I recorded as to Mr Sumber Welles&apos;remarks about Mussolini does not quite accord with thestatement in the printed account of the interview, which makes Mr Sumber Welles say that Mussolini had not had astroke.     The significance of this reference to a strokeis that a few days ago the Foreign Secretary reportedthat there had been a strong rumour in certain Italiansocial circles that Mussolini had had a stroke.   It hadbeen believed that he had had a   stroke some monthsearlier.minute e 5.Flying Boats:Diversion offor MilitaryDuties.W.M. (40)  68th CONCLUSIONS.14 .5 .40 .Minute 4.Scandinavia.It had been thought that this proposal would beaccepted, but the P.M. took a rather strong view against it.   It was clear that the War Cabinet could not acceptthe Secretary of State for Air&apos;s full proposals, but itwas by no means clear what the Conclusion was as to thetwo Civil Flying-boats at present diverted for militaryduties;    i.e., the CABOT and the CARIBOU.   Sir John Reith,whom I saw in the evening, and the Assistant Postmaster-General, thought that they were going to get these twoFlying-boats back;   but this was not the P.M.&apos;s intention.This was the main point of interest.   At 12.15 a.nr.the First Lord&apos;s people rang up and asked for a numberfor a War Cabinet Paper, which we received at 8 a.m.witha request that it should be put on the Agenda to bediscussed that day.   The Paper purported to be about theNaval Staff, but the language bore unmistakable signs ofa well-known statesman&apos;s fad.   The proposal that, notwith-standing the collapse of Finnish resistance, we should still go to Narvik, met, of course, with no support otherthan from the First Lord, who, towards the end, took theline that it would, of course, be a very unpleasant thing to do, but that he felt it was right to put the point upin order to see what reception it would have.Mr Sumrier Welfes .      The Foreign Secretary said that he had been informed by Mr Sumlner Welles the previous day that he had been invited by Count Ciano to meet him at lunch when passing through Rome on his return to the United States9 in orderto receive full particulars in regard to informationcommunicated to Mussolini by Herr von Ribbentrop during his recent visit to Rome.W.M. (40)  69th CONCLUSIONS.A very long and troublous Meeting.15 .5 .40.Minute 5 .Assistanceto FinlandMinute 10,India.On Assistance to Finland we had a certain amount of difficulty in harmonising views on the question whether we should attempt to recover the arms sent to Finland -either in that country or in transit.   The reference to finland rather stirred old wounds, and the First Lordasked where we thought the   German blow would fall:   would it be on Holland, or would it be on Roumania?   He also made some rather sarcastic remarks about the coal situatio(Minute 9).The main discussion was on India.   As soon as LirdZetland came into the room, the Prime Minister said&quot;Well, Secretary of State, we are all glad to see youhere this morning&quot;, and there was a sort of hum of applause,such as I have never yet heard in the Cabinet Room.
