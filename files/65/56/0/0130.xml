Minute 2.S.S.DOMALA.4. ^^^e rirf * Lord is 8till a good deal distres.Nothing else of any importance to record.Minute. 1.Coal Situa-tion.Minute 2.Diversion ofShipping.Minute 5.Air Situa-tion.W.M. (40)  60th CONCLUSIONS.5.4.40 .lightsRather a long Meeting, but no particular highThis item took longer than it ought to have done,considering that it was merely a statement of what hadbeen done and calling for no decision.   One or twostatements were made, e.g., by the Lord Privy Seal, which resulted in other Ministers wishing to have their say.There was some back-chat on small points; e.g., that400 wagons of coal had arrived at the London power company&apos;s depot at Willesden and they had only been ableto unload 40 wagons a day.The First Lord was heard, before the Meeting, tosay, rather ominously, that he had enough material to talk for an hour.   He proceeded, when he got going, to deliver a forthright attack on the position, and expressedthe strong dissatisfaction of the Naval Staff with thepresent position, said that the Minister of transport had not got enough power, and that all he could do wasto consult, review and discuss.   He also proceeded togive a long list of instances in which there had beendelay in unloading, which the Port and Transit Committeehad apparently not been able to remedy.A good deal of this was, I think, the work ofWinston&apos;s &quot;circus&quot;.   I had been at a meeting under theChairmanship of H.J. at the Treasury the previous day to deal with the Shipping position.   To our amazementwe found there Professor Lindemann, who had proceeded to be closeted with the Minister of Transport&apos;s repre-sentatives - apparently an attempt to settle the hareswhich Winston had put up on this diversion of shippingaffair.All this took a good deal of time, but the PrimeMinister quietened things down by a suggestion that as anumber of Departments were concerned, the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence should superintend the necessaryplans, and preparations.Winston had another;innings (not recorded in theMinutes) in connection with the statement made by theSecretary of State for Air that the aerodrome at Borkumhad been seen to be lit up, but on our aircraft flyinglow the lights had been extinguished.   This was a signalfor a discussion on whether arrangements could net bemade for switching off lights instantaneously in thiscountry in the event of an air raid.The Minister of Home Security said that masterswitches for lights existed in this country for all important activities, such as marshalling yards, butthat the provision of master switches for street lightingthroughout the country would be a very expensive business.
Minute, 4 *Use of convoys byNeutrals.Minute 6.Assistanceto Finland.Minute, 1 *Death ofMr OliverBoden.Minute 3 ..Holland.The western front.The First Lord had yet another innings on this item, and again referred to the suggestion that weshould offer insurance to all neutral ships sailing inour convoys.The situation is still obscure.   The War cabinet felt that it was no use dealing with demands forassistance on a large scale, e.g., 100 bombers, until we knew whether the Finns really meant to go on withthe fight and to appeal to us for assistance, or whetherthey meant to make terms with the Russians.W.M. (40) 61st CONCLUSIONS.6 .S .40 .At the end of this item THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORAIR said that he had just heard that Mr Oliver Bodenhad died suddenly that morning.   Mr Boden was employedby Lord Nuffield to manage the Castle Bromwich aircraft factory, and;: I think, another factory engaged on warwork for the Government.   His death was a great loss.This led to some discussion as to the output ofCastle Bromwich.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, when last at Birming-ham, he had seen Lord Austin and had been shocked athis appearance.   He thought that Lord Austin was finish-ed and would never do any useful work again.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he thought this was so.   Unfortunately, Lord Austin, who wasChairman of a Committee which managed Shadow Factories,insisted on continuing to do this work, although in point of fact the real work was being done for him byMr Roots.The reference to some possible trouble between theDutch and the Germans led to the First Lord advancingthe view that the Germans might well launch an attack onfHolland in the near future, in order to gain a base forair attacks on this country.   He referred to a reportof a conversation which the wife of Herr Tauber had had with a German recently, who was known to be very eloseto Goering.   He had spoken very freely one night, andhad said that the Germans expected that Russia would bemuch weakened by the Finnish campaign, and that theGermans would soon be able to obtain control of Roumaniaiwithout using force at all.   Their next move would beto divide up Yugoslavia with Italy.   This, again, wouldbe done without fighting.   The only fighting-which wouloftake place would be on the northern part of the western front.   On the next day the German had spoken to FrauTauber and had said that he had spoken very freely andwildly the night before, and that she was not to pay anygattention to what he had said, or repeat it to.anybody?and, provided she promised not to repeat it, he promised^to get her Macedes car out of Austria for her.In t,he ensuing discussion THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he did not think an attaclflon the Western Front was probable.   Hitler was a bullyand a boaster, but at bottom he was a coward, and hisnerve would probably fail him when it came to taking somomentous a decision.
