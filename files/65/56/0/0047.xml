Minute 152*United StatesEffect ofRestrictionof Importsfrom.It was pointed out, however, that there-was a longhistory of bad feeling between Sweden and Poland, andthat this was probably illustrated by Mo Wallenberg&apos;remarks.One of the remarks by Mr.Kennedy which theChancellor of the Exchequer quoted was that it mightbe better for us tO&apos;reach a moderate settlement inregard to trade restrictions with the United States,which would mean that we should have to call upon theUnited States for direct financial help after 11 monthsrather than that we should impose more drastic restriction-tions which would mean that we could hold out for a longer period without calling for financial help from america.   The moral to be drawn was that Americanwillingness to help might be more important to usthan the precise period in which we could conduct thewar without such help.W.M.(59) 98th CONCLUSIONS.E.E.B. absent at funeral.29 sll .59GERMANY.probable intentions.!.(59) 99th CONCLUSIONS.50.11 .59.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY gave a certain amount ofinformation under the heading &quot;Germany - probable intentions&quot; which amplified the information given atthe 98th Meeting, Minute 10 (Confidential Annex).According to a secret source, there was at present no intention of invading Holland and Belgium^ butit was hoped to carry out an occupation bloodlessly.An invasion had been abandoned on political grounds.In the period 20th-25th November there had been talk of no large-scale attack in the West or elsewhere, and considerable hopes were being placed on a peace offensive, in which it was hoped that Italy would actas mediator.W.M. (59) 100th CONCLUSIONS.Nothing special to record.I q12 o59 eMinute 7.Belgium.Pursuit ofGerman Air-craft.W.M. (59) 101 s t CQNOLUSjmS,.There was some discussion on the question whethepursuit of enemy aircraft over neutral air was analogoto the doctrine of &quot;hot pursuit&quot;, under which warshipscould pursue ah enemy into neutral territorial watersin order to prevent escape.     It was suggestedtthat the theory underlying the inviolability of neutral terri-torial waters was. that&apos; the neutral Power could maintain this inviolability against belligerent ships.   In thelast War we had exercised the-right to pursue theDRESDEN into territorial waters on the grounds that the site of the action was in a remote part where theneutral Power in question was not able to exerciseeffective control over its territorial waters.
If a belligerent vessel took refuge in a neutral harbourshe could be interned. The same considerations did not,however, apply to aircraft, since it was impossible to3intern belligerent aircraft infringing neutral air;they could only be shot down.   The new conditions of warfare made it necessary for us to create a precedent,which in time, no doubt, would receive the sanction ofinternational law.(The above was elaborated without referenceto any legal experts, and I thought it better not to include it in the Minutes.)Sir Walter Monekton.        At the end. of the Meeting the HOME SECRETARY saidthat the reports in the newspapers that Sir WalterMonckton, the Head, of the Censorship, was resigning,were put about by Mr Pish.    It was not true that sir Walter Monckton was resigning, though he was by nomeans happy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought that sir Walter Monckton was unhappy at the way in which hewas treated by the Service Departments .   It would bevery discouraging if he were to go, and he (the PrimeMinister) meant that he should stay on.   Although hehad heard that Sir Walter was unsettled, he had had no direct discussion with him on the matter.THE HOME SECRETARY said that Sir Walter dislikedbeing made to look a fool.. The First Lord had promised to put on paper a statement of the principles whichgoverned the Admiralty in deciding whether or notinformation should be published, but unfortunatelythis statement had. not yet materialised.Public MeetingsPosition ofPolishRefugees.Belgium and holland.Skilled labour in event of invasion.THE PRIME MINISTER informed his colleagues thathe had made arrangements for a series of nine Meetingsup and down the country to be addressed by members ofthe War Cabinet.   He had arranged that each of them should address a Meeting, with the exception of theMinister without Portfolio, whom he could hardly call upon for this duty.   He proposed to open the series inLondon, and to finish the series at Birmingham.   the meetings would be arranged by the Lord Mayors of the towns concerned, who would, be told that if any prominentmember of the Opposition Parties wished to attend the meetings they could be given facilities for a prominentseat on the platform, and perhaps for proposing orseconding a resolution.THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat there was just a possibility that 2,500 refugeesmight be accepted from Roumania to Cyprus.   They wished,however, to keep this offer quiet for the moment as the roumanians v.&apos;ere treating the Polish refugees better.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO also referred tothe possibility that we might pick up a lot of usefulskilled labour if Belgium and Holland were invaded.He had seen Sir Charles .Craven and told him to keep hiseyes open for these possibilities .*M.
