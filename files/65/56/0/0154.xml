This was too much for the Prime Minister, who told the story of the man who had a parrot which swore terribly,and, in order to cure it of this habit, another parrotwith refined language was put into the saiie room.   Theresult was that there was no improvement in the language of the swearing parrot, but that the second parrotlearned to swear horribly.   The P&apos;JB. told this withgreat gusto.Minute 6.Scandinavia.Allied Notesto norwegian and swedish governments.WJSfi. (40) 85rd CONCLUSIONS,6j4 o40The Foreign Secretary was obviously rather deeplyperturbed by the Swedish reaction to the communicationmade to the Swedish and Norwegian Governments.The Prime Minister took it all very calmly,realising, I think, that it was time for a littlerough-stuff on our part, and that there was no usedoing rough-stuff half-heartedly.In the course of the Meeting it emerged, thatMr Mallet had not been told what in fact were the stepswe were proposing to take.   This seemed rather a mistakeand likely to put him in a false position at Stoclcholm.It was agreed that he should at once be informed, in confidence, of the position.W.M. (40)  84th CONCLUSIONS.        8.4 .40Minute 2.Naval Opera-tions offNorway.Minute 5.fcioyal marine operation.The chief event was the First Lord&apos;s description of the Naval operations proceeding off the West coast of Norway, which was extremely dramatic;   In particular,the fact that the GLOWWORM had dropped astern through a man having fallen overboard and thus first came into contact with the enemy&apos;s Fleet.The general opinion seemed to be that our activi-ties had completely puzzled the Germans and had stirredthem up to take action, and very likely to take someextremely ill-judged and hazardous action.   The PrimeMinister went so far as to say that if Hitler had ordered a sea-borne expedition to Narvik-in the face of his military advisers and it had ended in disaster,it might result in his fall.The Foreign Secretary suggested that we might taithe Norwegians that we had laid our minefields because we knew that the Germans were going to take this action.I am glad to say that this suggestion was quashed.   Itwould not have borne examination for a moment.   In anycase a public declaration of laying a minefield in territorial waters is not the right counter to a sea-borne invasion.In regard to theRoyal Marine Operation, the lord privy Seal said that at the Press Conference which hehad held that morning, one Pressman, Broadbent of the&quot;Baily Mail&quot; had asked a question about the Secondoperation? and had replied, when the Lord Privy Sealasked him where he had got his information from, thatit had come from France and that it was common knowledge that a second operation was contemplated but had beenshelved.
The Prime Minister said that Mr Attlee had called on him on Friday, 5th April, at his own request,in order to inform him that a French journalist had given him a full account of the proceedings of therecent Meeting of the Supreme War Council, which ingeneral corresponded closely to the account given him.by the Prime Minister.   Mr Attlee had added that thejournalist had then gone on to speak of a secondOperation which had been agreed upon in London andsubsequently stopped by the French Government.   TheFrench journalist understood that this Operationconsisted of an attack on German ports in the Baltic,including an attack on Stettin.   The Prime minister had informed Mr Attlee that there was no foundation for this particular story.Nothing else of special interest.   It is curiousthat, more or less by accident, we also had on theAgenda an item relating to attacks on enemy warships in neutral territorial waters, and an item regardingthe chartering of Norwegian shipping.
