I .R .A. Murder-ers&apos; Appeal.Minute 5.utilisation of man-power resources ofthe colonial empire.Minute 4.The S.S..SAMA MARU.certain people s minds that we should run a GovernmentBureau to deal with this problem.   The disadvantages ofthis course were pointed out repeatedly to the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence, but he had been ratherunwilling to abandon the idea.Note, however, the ASAMA MARU again.The rest of the Meeting consisted mainly of oddsand s craps.W.M.(40) 22nd CONCLUSIONS.24.1 .40The only contentious item was the ASAMA MARU again.At the end ofthe Meeting the FIRST LORD OF THEADMIRALTY&quot; referred to the two I.R.A. murderers, whoseappeal against their conviction for murder in connectionwith the bombing outrage at Coventry had been dismissedon the previous day.   In so far as the Home secretary was to exercise his responsibilities on judicial grounds,those responsibilities were inviolable.   If, however,the matter was to be dealt with on political grounds , hethought the matter should be discussed, in the War cabinet before a decision was reached.After the Home Secretary had explained the position the PRIME MINISTER said, that he agreed that if the matter was to be considered on political grounds it should bediscussed in the War Cabinet.I did. not record this matter in the War cabinet conclusions, intentionally.    I was informed by Sir RupertHoworth that there was no record of such a topic havingbeen recorded previously in the War Cabinet Minutes,and it seemed to me that it might be awkward to have such a discussion on record.W.M.(40) 25rd CONCLUSIONS.25 .1.40 cAnother primarily Civil day.   The procedure forsuch discussions is now working very smoothly andsatisfactorily.The proceedings started by the Prime Ministerpointing out the disadvantages of the proposed PioneerUnits, before the Colonial Secretary had had. time toset out his proposals.   In consequence, a good many ofthe proposals in the Report were not really discussed at all.The ASAMA MARU again.   The First Lord took a somewhat sticky attitude and said that he did not agree atall with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views.The Prime Minister succeeded in composing whatlooked like becoming a serious breach, with great skill.The rough edges of the discussion have been removed in the Conclusions as presented.&quot;(SO-I
