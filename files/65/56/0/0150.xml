W.M. (40) 80 th CONCLUSIONS.5 .4 .40 .M. Daladier&apos;attitude.Royal marine operation.Strength ofthe ReynaudGovernment.The most important item was Minute 5.   TheSecretary of State for Poreign Affairs read out a longreport from a member of his staff (Mr Jebb) and a memberof the French Embassy (M. Charbonniere) .   This account(which was considerably abbreviated in the Minutes, atthe Poreign Secretary&apos;s request), gave a considerablydetailed account of M. Daladier&apos;s frame of mind.M. Daladier had what was virtually a neurosis in regardto the French Air Force.   He felt a deep sense of shame,as he had a strong pride in the French Army.   M.Daladierdid not really wish to contemplate effective actionagainst Germany until Prance had a powerful Air Forceand an aircraft industry of her own.   The complex ofFrenchmen being out-numbered by twice as many Germanscame into play here.   Added to this was the fact thatthe present relations between the two men (M.Daladierand M. Reynaud) were not good.   It would be very gallingto M. Daladier to see M. Reynaud obtaining a markedsuccess at the Supreme War Council immediately after having suppls.nted him.Another interesting point not recorded in theMinutes is that it was felt that if nothing was doneby the 9th April, M. Reynaud would be in grave difficul-ties when he met the Senate.   Either he would not givethe real explanation regarding his Governments inaction,in which case his Government would fall, or, if he gave the real reason he would secure the elimination notonly of M. Daladier but also of the Marine Operation.There was also some discussion as to whetherM. Reynaud&apos;s Government was firmly situated.   On thisopinions differed.   Some said that it was still wobbly.The Poreign Secretary said that his information wasthat in any ease it was bound to be wobbly for the firstmonth.    &quot;The Times&quot;, however, had reported that morningthat it was stronger.   M. Leger was reported by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty as having said that ifM. Reynaud fell, he would be supplanted not by M.Daladier, who did not wish to return at the moment, butby M. Herriot, who was not a very extremely competentperson.   If he fell, he would be succeeded by M.Chautempslwho would liquidate the war. ,this .The Prime Minister said that he did not believeMinute 8.Prize money and PrizeBounty.,   ThiS was very amusing.   The discussion startedwith a little sparring between the First Lord and theChancellor of the Exchequer as to who should take the floor first.   Eventually the First Lord induced theChancellor to take the floor, which, I think, was whatboth wanted.   In any event,- the Chancellor, afterstarting by a comprehensive and flat denial of some ofthe First Lord&apos;s statements, cleverly got the thing onto a very entertaining and amusing level.   There was agreat deal about &quot;privateers&quot; and &quot;letters of marque&quot;.Then, in regard to the Army, the Army had hadbooty, and this went back to the reign of King John;but unfortunately King John&apos;s army had never won anybattles, so they never got any booty.   (Here came anaside from the P.M. about &quot;luggage lost in the Wash&quot;.)And so to the Ashanti wars, when the booty had been so
insufficient that the War Office had asked the treasury to make up the booty to a decent level, which theTreasury had refused to do.    Incidentally, 1874 wasthe year of birth of the Right Hon. Gentleman the FirstLord of the Admiralty, and the abolition of booty inthat year might be said to be the first reform for whichhe was1 responsible!There was also some interesting play as to the division of prize-money in the last war.   Thus, theCommander-in-chief got 1,000 shares;    the Admiral incharge of a Squadron, 600 shares;    the Canteen Staff,2 shares, each; the value of each share being  6.15-0.Below the Admiral the rates had, of course, been scaleddown.   Here the Minister for Co-ordination of defence said &quot;Scaled, down very rapidly&quot;.   This caused a gooddeal of amusement, which I do not think Lord Chatfieldaltogether shared.The end of this discussion was cut short as most members of the War Cabinet were attending the memorial service to the late Sir John Gilmour at 12.15.W.M.(40) 81.8JLJ3QHCLUSI01g,o4.4 .40 .This was the first Meeting after the changes inthe Government.   Before the Meeting I had a ratheraffecting farewell from the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.Minute, 2 .Anglo-italian relations.Rather a quiet Meeting:importance.no item of outstandingThe discussion on this item, which emerged outof the discussion on Contraband Control, was of ratherspecial interest.   I was impressed once again with thesure gr8.sp which the Prime Minister, seems to have ofthe psychological basis of the Italian situation.   Heseems to know his own mind exactly as to how he is goingto tackle Signor Mussolini.The information received from Mr Wedgwood Bennwas passed on to the Prime Minister by Mr Attlee.Nothing else of special interest.Minute 5.NorwegianTerritorialWaters.pyal Marineperation.W.M. (40) 82nd CONCLUSIONS.5.4.40.The most noteworthy point was the definite decisionto proceed with the laying of a minefield in norwegian territorial waters, notwithstanding the fact that theFrench definitely refused to agree to the Royal marine operation.When the First Lord telephoned to the foreign secretary and said that the French would not agree tothe Royal Marine Operation, so far from appearingdissatisfied with the decision, the First Lord said  &quot;that he now felt that ityould be impossible for us totake the responsibility of pressing the step further.He seemed, indeed, to be almost persuaded that it wouldbe undesirable to carry it out at the present time.
