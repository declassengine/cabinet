Minute 152*United StatesEffect ofRestrictionof Importsfrom.It was pointed out, however, that there-was a longhistory of bad feeling between Sweden and Poland, andthat this was probably illustrated by Mo Wallenberg&apos;remarks.One of the remarks by Mr.Kennedy which theChancellor of the Exchequer quoted was that it mightbe better for us tO&apos;reach a moderate settlement inregard to trade restrictions with the United States,which would mean that we should have to call upon theUnited States for direct financial help after 11 monthsrather than that we should impose more drastic restriction-tions which would mean that we could hold out for a longer period without calling for financial help from america.   The moral to be drawn was that Americanwillingness to help might be more important to usthan the precise period in which we could conduct thewar without such help.W.M.(59) 98th CONCLUSIONS.E.E.B. absent at funeral.29 sll .59GERMANY.probable intentions.!.(59) 99th CONCLUSIONS.50.11 .59.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY gave a certain amount ofinformation under the heading &quot;Germany - probable intentions&quot; which amplified the information given atthe 98th Meeting, Minute 10 (Confidential Annex).According to a secret source, there was at present no intention of invading Holland and Belgium^ butit was hoped to carry out an occupation bloodlessly.An invasion had been abandoned on political grounds.In the period 20th-25th November there had been talk of no large-scale attack in the West or elsewhere, and considerable hopes were being placed on a peace offensive, in which it was hoped that Italy would actas mediator.W.M. (59) 100th CONCLUSIONS.Nothing special to record.I q12 o59 eMinute 7.Belgium.Pursuit ofGerman Air-craft.W.M. (59) 101 s t CQNOLUSjmS,.There was some discussion on the question whethepursuit of enemy aircraft over neutral air was analogoto the doctrine of &quot;hot pursuit&quot;, under which warshipscould pursue ah enemy into neutral territorial watersin order to prevent escape.     It was suggestedtthat the theory underlying the inviolability of neutral terri-torial waters was. that&apos; the neutral Power could maintain this inviolability against belligerent ships.   In thelast War we had exercised the-right to pursue theDRESDEN into territorial waters on the grounds that the site of the action was in a remote part where theneutral Power in question was not able to exerciseeffective control over its territorial waters.
