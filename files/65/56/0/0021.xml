It would also be made clear that there wasno connection with any peace feelers from the Vatican.it was generally -agreed that the latest development-ments, as shown in Lord Lothian1 s telegram, represented a very great improvement upon President Roosevelt&apos;original suggestion, and that by far the greater part ofthe mischief inherent in his original proposals had been avoided.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that a telegram should be sent to Lord Lothian to the effect that we were extremely relieved on hearing the latest proposals, andthat, in particular, it would be very valuable if president roosevelt would make it known that he was not in favour of proposals which would lead to a premature and inconclusivepeace.It was also suggested that it might be desirablethat the Foreign Secretary should give a hint to the press that^the^announcement of: Mr Sumher Welles*a visit to   .Europe ahouid be wplayed down&apos;* *On the question whether the Prime Minister should refer to this move of President Roosevelt*s in hie next

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FBREIGH AFFAIRS saidthat he (probably more than any other member of theWar Cabinet) was the recipient of feelers from Germany,with most of which he did not feel it was necessary to trouble the War Cabinet.A week or two ago he had received a feeler whichwas rather more important.   It had come through anEnglishman, an entirely reliable person, who was employed by us to obtain such information as he couldcollect in Switzerland from people who had been inGermany.    This Englishman had done very useful work.A week or two ago he had met the ejr. German ChancellorWirth.The Foreign Secretary read, out an account of thereport from the intermediar^&quot;Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that it wasimpossible to assess the value of this approach.   Itwas possible, but, he thought, not likely, that the gestapo were interested in this approach.   It was alsoimpossible to assess the probability that anythingwould result from the movement referred to.   TheGermans were always talking about some such movement
as that suggested, but hitherto nothing had eventuated.Nevertheless, the Foreign Secretary said that a revolu-tion in Germany would be so valuable to us that we ought not to lose any opportunity which might have this result.   He had therefore examined this proposal closelyIt was difficult to know what we should say, or shouldnot say, in reply to the question as to Germany&apos;s  future.He thought that the best plan was to answer on somewhatand dealdifferent lines, st&amp;xslgslxRg with a matter which was a constant preoccupation of those in Germany who wishedto see a change in the regime, namely, that if theybrought matters to a head and civil war resulted, raswould we guarantee not to take the opportunity to jumpon their faces .   He had therefore sketched out a reply on these lines, which he would like to send as a verbalmessage.The Foreign Secretary then read out the draft reply/tTHE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that it wasnot in our power to make a land offensive againstGermany, since we were not in contact with the Germans,while the French were.   If the French saw the frontcrumbling in front of them he had no doubt that theywould advance.
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that this point was covered by the draft reply.   We only said that we wouldnot desire to take military advantage of such a situationand he had made it clear that we had not consulted our allies.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the Germans would say that while it was nibt physically in our power tomake a land attack on Germany while it was within thepower of the French, nevertheless we could stop theFrench from attacking if we so desired;   he thought,therefore, that the Germans would be satisfied with the assurance proposed.    If, however, they were not satisfied with the assurance given, then it- was clear that weshould have to talk to the French.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE1 EXCHEQUER referred toreferences in the report by the intermediary to &quot;Generalsand opposition&quot;.   Did this mean two separate entities?THE FOREIGN SECPETARY said Yes.   The &quot;opposition&quot;referred to important Germans, such as Schacht, Bruening^and Neurath, who were out of sympathy with the regime.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO raised the questionwhether co-operation with the movement from outside was required.
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL raised the question whether itwas desirable to ask them to inform us of the approximatedate.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it was only-right that some confidence should be shown in us in thismatter, and unless we were informed of the approximatedate we should not know whether, if a movement tookplace, it was a movement resulting from the activity ofthose with whom we had been in contact.Nevertheless, it was agreed that it would bedesirable to modify somewhat the wording in regard toour being given advance knowledge of the approximatedate.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY asked what would happen if the &quot;purge&quot; took place and the present government was replaced by a resolute new Governmentequally determined to oppose the Allies?   Would not ourposition then be weakened?THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the people whointended to bring off this putsch would almost certainly have to make peace. In any case, the fact that such a movement had taken place would greatly weaken Germany.
The War Cabinet agreed  That a verbal reply should be sent by theintermediary on the lines of the ForeignS ecretary&apos; s draft.? modificationregarding theapproximatedat e.
EXTRACT PROM REPORT BY INTERMEDIARY.On February 13th. I again saw W. who had in themeantime received the visit of an important emissary fromthe Opposition and from the General Staff in Germany.   Ina long talk the latter has assured W. that there was no immediate hurry;   that no offensive inHhe West or anywhereelse &amp;as likely for perhaps another month or even longerif the General Staff together with Brausehiteh, Reichenauand other Generals remained so dead against the offensive.W. went on to say that the recent speeches of Mr chamberlain and Lord Halifax warning the German people about their co-responsibility with the Nazis had made a great impressjcnIon the General Staff and the Opposition.   According toW., General Haider and his colleagues are now. ready toattempt a purge on a big scale, either entirely withoutGoering or using him at most for a very brief period.They intend to set up an entirely new Government.Questioned as to further details, W. informed me that tothe best of his knowledge Haider and Co. and the opposition were quite prepared to form a German federation, to forma new Polish State and a new Czechoslovak State, to dissolvethe central Army, police force, Government, etc. into thoseof the individual member States of the Federation, butthey had insisted upon a Federal Reich re-grouped.   Thereduction of Prussia to its component States should be no obstacle.   W. led me fully to understand that they planned to have a new capital of the Reich in place of Berlin andthat they realised&apos; that the war machine and the totalitariansystem were quite impossible for a State that is bankrupt.
W. believed that the Generals and the Oppositionregarded general disarmament in Europe as an essential part of a settlement;   also the freeing of the currency and the return to general international trade away fromthe narrow concepts of autarchy.   Before, however, suchaction (a purge) could be attempted, theOOpposition,particularly the Generals, desired a verbal message fromthe British Prime Minister that Germany will not be dividedup into small States, as, according to W., is planned by aninfluential French group.   This group wished to returnto Napoleonic times, to divide the Reich into the smallDuchies and States, segregated from one another politicallyI told W. that I could make no comment on this but would discuss his proposals with my friends in London.
2wIf an attempt were made by theopposition in Germany to change theGovernment, and this resulted in internaldisturbance, H.M.G. would not desire totake military advantage of such a situation.Provided H.M.G. could be assured that thenew Government was one whose word could be trusted, they would certainly be preparedto eo-operatevwith it in the establishmentof lasting anr? constructive peace on thegeneral basis that responsible Britishspokesmen have made plain.This is as much as we Ban say without consulting our Allies.   If it was agreed thatwe might take them into our confidence onthis matter, we would try in conjunctionwith them to give a more specific assurance.In this case it seems to us that it would benecessary that we should have knowledge inadvance of the approximate date on which the
attempt to replace the Government would bemade, and that consideration should be givento the possibility that the German opposition might themselves desire some diversion tobe made from outside in order to assist themin bringing their attempt to a successfulconclus ion.
