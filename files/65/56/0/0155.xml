On other days, the leader of the House would deal with thePrime Minister&apos;s Questions .Foreign Office Questions should continue to beaddressed to the Lord President of the Council,with the same discretion to allow Questions of minor importance to be taken by the Par 1 lament ar^Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in accordance with the arrangement which hashitherto prevailed.The question of the Leadership of the opposition was referred to, and the view was expressed that itwould be quite wrong to allow Mr Maxton to be regardedas Leader of the Opposition.The view was taken that Privy Counsellors not inthe Government should sit on the Front Opposition Bench.The question was also discussed as to who should,for example, ask the Leader of the House each week tomake a statement as to the business of the ensuing week.It was suggested that this might be done either by the leader of the House making a statement without being asked a Question, or a Question might be put by the senior Privy Counsellor present on the Front OppositionBench.
