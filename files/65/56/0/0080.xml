C4&amp; ) loth CONCLUSIONS,10.Minute 1.Scandinavia.Minute 2.Finland.The Low-Countries .This Meeting was wholly oceupied by the dis eussio:on Scandinavia. . Once again the Meeting was virtuallythreesome - the Foreign Secretary, the First Lord ofthe Admiralty and the Prime Minister.   It was difficultto avoid the conclusion that the Prime Minister was perhaps a little happiea^ now that he had made up his mind that the Narvik pro subject could not be authorised,than in the earlier discussions.The First Lord took the conclusion very manfully,and, to be candid, much better than I expected.The item on Finland was dealt with hastily. Ineffeet, except for the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence, there was a unanimous opinion that any helpgiven to Finland must be given unofficially.Reports were gabbled through.   The Secretary ofState for Air said that he would let his report be circulated in the Minutes, and he did not read it.The First Lord was not to be deprived of his littlebit of funln Ia IW.M. (40) 11th CONCLUSIONS. 15 .1.40.After Scandinavia, the Low Countries!The normal team for duty was the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the First Lord and the Secretary ofState for Air.   Of these, the former was away makinga speech in Glasgow, and the latter at Portsmouth on duty, their places being taken by Lord Chatfield andLord Hankey.The Secretary of State for Ware came along in orderto give the Cabinet information which he had receivedabout the Low Countries.W.M. (40) 12th CONCLUSIONS.Sunday. 14 .i.4d12 .5Qp.m.The Ministers present were most anxious that an opening which might lead to an invitation to us toenter Belgium should not be missed, and the First lord was emphatic that the Prime Minister should, returnthat afternoon.W.M. (40) 15th CONCLUSIONS. 14.1.40.6.50 p.m.There was complete agreement on the conclusion reached.   The Prime Minister prepared the draft state-ment before the Meeting, and handed it across the table to the First Lord of the Admiralty, who madeone or two pencil amendments and expressed himself ascompletely satisfied with the formula.I think the general feeling at the end of thisMeeting was,that, while it was desirable to give a fairly forthcoming reply most people did not reallyexpect that there would be any particular result fromthe messages sent by us to Roger Eeyes.
