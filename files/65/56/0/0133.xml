We had no report on the Naval situation, in theabsence of the First Lord of the Admiralty, and as theChiefs of Staff were busily at work, in the Central war room and we were told that there was no special matter which they wished to raise.Minute 7. We had realised that there was a likelihood of this being raised, and had asked the Foreign Secretary whetherFinland. he proposed to do so.   He sent a message to the effectthat he did not propose to raise the matter in such a way as to require the Chiefs of Staff to be present.I passed this message on to the Secretary of Statefor Air, and asked whether he was happy that the C.A.S.should not be present at the Meeting.The Secretary of State for Air did not wish theC.A.S. sent for.   He thought, I think, that in theabsence of the C.A.S. the War Cabinet would not decide to send further bombers to Finland.   In the event, however the general body of opinion was distinctly in favour of doing so, and I was instructed to record a decision tothis effect.It emerged that the Chiefs of Staff, at their simul-taneous meeting, had also been considering this question,and had. eome to a very different conclusion. Accordinglyit was arranged, that C.A.S. should attend at the Meetingheld at 5.30 in the afternoon, at which the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary were to settle the terms of adraft telegram to Finland.As a result of the discussion which took place atthat meeting, it was agreed not to send them a telegramuntil the ensuing morning, and to put the matter again onthe Agenda, together with the draft Report on the subject which the Chiefs of Staff had been preparing.Altogether not a very successful day&apos;s work.The latest news, however, seems to show that the Finnsare not on the point of making up their mind immediately,and that a short delay is not going to affect matters one way or the other.WJt. (40)  65rd CONCLUSIONS.8.3.4Q0Minute, 4..Assistanceto Finland.Minute 8.Italy.German CoalThe main business was the discussion on Finland,picking up the decision reached by the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary, after the previous day*s Meetingof the War Cabinet, to defer sending a further telegram to Helsinki until the Chiefs of Staff Report had beenconsidered.   This matter was really settled by the proposaput forward by the Prime Minister, which found a happycompromise between the two points of view.   The decisionto get ready 50 Blenheims to send to Finland was arrivedat wi,th a far greater measure of general agreement than had seemed possible 24 hours earlier.   Indeed, I think the decision met with general approval almost without exception.There were only two other points .   One was thediscussion on the Royal Marine Operation, and the otherconcerned the Italian coal ships.   The latter was producedout of the blue by the Foreign Secretary rather naughtily,just after the Minister of Economic Warfare had departed.The Foreign Secretary proceeded to give an account of the
Minute 5.Royal marine operation.Minute, 9.The coal situation.Minister of Economic Warfare&apos;s views - an account whichwe were subsequently informed was quite inaccurate.There has been some &quot;wigs on the green&quot; behind the sceneson this.   Fortunately, however, there is no dispute as tothe Conclusion reached.Ws regards the Royal Marine Operation, I was subsequently informed that the Chancellor of the exchequer was very anxious that it should not come off on Tuesdayor Wednesday, as he was anxious to get his  300,000,000Loan safely harvested before this comes Off.The last item, in regard to the Coal Situation, was again produced without warning, by the Lord Privy Seal.Subsequently to the Meeting, the Minister of Transportinformed me that the Supply Departments were very muchupset at the idea that for a further week priority shouldbe given to coal traffic.   This information was not beforethe War Cabinet.W.M. (40)  64th CONCLUSIONS.9 .5 .40.Minute g.Shipping inthe Downs.Minute 4.Assistanceto Finland.D.C.N.S. thought that one reason why the germans had not attacked, shipping in the Downs was that theshipping there comprised such a lot of neutral shipping,and. that some part of the cargoes eventually found its way through to Germany.On Finland the general view seemed to be that it was unlikely that the Finns would make their appeal.Royal NavalOperation.There was a little further talk about the royal marine Operation which was not incorporated in theMinutes.Visit ofMr sumner welles.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the draft declarationhad been agreed and was being sent over to Paris by the hand of a messenger (this really meant Mr Hopkinson, ofthe Anglo-French Liaison Section).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER again made his point that he hoped, that Tuesday and Wednesday would, be days ofcalm skies .There was some discussion as to whether the french would let out the secret.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat the only secret which to the best of his knowledgethe French had ever kept had been the news of the visit of King George VI to Paris in the previous summer:    towhich THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that it had been con-siderably in the interest of the French to keep that dark.At the end of the Meeting THE FOREIGN SECRETARY askedadvice as to the arrangements for the entertainment ofMr Sumner Welles.   The main idea was that he should be entertained at small parties,.not exceeding eight, butthat he should be asked to meet the members of the WarCabinet, the Chiefs of Staff, the Leaders of the Opposi-tion and one or two people such as the Minister ofInformation (Sir John Reith), Sir John Anderson and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
