W M .(40) 204th 0ON0LUS TONS .IS.7.40.-Minute l;Bomb dropped on AluminiumWorks atSlough.Minute 2.The operation at Guernsey.Minute S.I was told today that one of our pilots, onreturning to his aerodrome, had said that one of hisbombs had dropped out by mistake.   It is very unfortunate-nate that this casual bomb should have been the onlyone which had done any serious damage to one of ourfactories.The G.N.S. said that the party had returned with7 crashed boats, and that one boat had been sunk.The P.M. said that the party had been back forsome time, but there was no report, which was ratherunsatisfactory.   He said that the raid was a pin-prick,and had been intended to smash up the aerodrome, tokill any Germans they saw, and get away.   But why didwe send 140 men when there were 469 Germans on the island?   However, he supposed the War Cabinet did not object to operations of this kind.&quot;No&quot;, said the Lord President, &quot;provided that theyare successful.It was reported that 8 battalions from India had arrived.   One battalion was to be added to the GuardsBrigade;   the other 7 would be made into two MobileBrigades, thus making up 3 Mobile Brigade groups.They were to be armed with French guns.THE LORD PRESIDENT asked what was the answer toflamenwerfer for use by tanks?THE C.I.G.S. said, therewas not a very good answerif they got too near!Minute 5.The operation at Guernsey.polish andelgian Gold.tJ .S .S .R .W.M. (40) 805th CONCLUSIONS-. 16.7.40.This was one of our confidential Meetings.THE PRIME MINISTER started off by saying that theGuernsey raid had been a super flop. It had been intendedto land at three plac.es, but a wrong landfall had beenmade.   Two of the parties had landed on the wrongisland and had returned.   One: party had landed andwalked up to a barracks, which they had found empty.They had achieved, little or nothing, and had thenreturned with oner or two men having been injured ordrowned.     On the return of the party, General Bournewas asked whether a Communique should be issued.   TheP.M*s comment was that ^hiexploit of this kind should,above all, be kept as secret as possible.He was satisfied that this kind of thing requiredto be done on a bigger scale, and he proposed to putSir Roger Keyes in charge.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY gave the War Cabinet informa-tion on this subject which Sir Alexander Cadogan had given to the War Cabinet on Saturday.   For this reasonI recorded none of it.I also did not record a discussion started bya reference made by the Lord President of the Councilto telegram 265 to Moscow from Mr Butler to Sir stafford cripps.   This telegram said that Gallaeher and various
Communistshad been suggesting that it would be a gOodplan if some of them went out to Mos cow.   R.A.Butlerhad asked Cripps&apos;s views on this.The view generally expressed in the War cabinet was that this matter ought never to have been dealtwith without being referred to the Poreign secretary or to the War Cabinet, and that the business should beput a stop to.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he would put out a retrieving hand.   This was amended by THE PRIME MINIS-TER into &quot;a smothering paw&quot;.:  THE PRIME MINISTER gave a resume of the situationin the Middle East.   When Italy had come into the war,the Navy had been afraid of the effects of air bombing.Little, however, had happened, and they had planned a double move of the Mediterranean Fleet and Force &quot;H&quot;to the middle of the Mediterranean from each end.   Onthis move they had been attacked from the air, andItaly&apos;s bombing had been much more accurate than they expected.   The Admiralty were now back in their oldposition of fearing the effects of air attack on theFleet in Mediterranean waters.The Prime Minister said that he was very anxiousto have a go at Italy.   He was also anaous to increasethe anti-aircraft defences of Malta, both in guns and aircraft.   He thought that perhaps we could afford todo this.   Arrangements had been made for the HERMES totake Hurricanes into the Mediterranean, which wouldthen fly off to Malta.   Should the anti-aircraft gunsand further aircraft in crates be sent round the Cape,or should an evolution be made and convoys escorted to malta?THE LORD PRESIDENT asked if we could have a go atPantelaria on the way.Continuing, THE PRIME MINISTER said that generallyhe was afraid of a vexatious time in the Middle East.We had 100,000 troops there, the great bulk of themwhite troops, but they were lightly armed.   Italy had250,000 men in Libya, and 27 brigades in Abyssinia.We might have to take punishment in the Middle East,now that the French were out of it.   The country wouldbe upset if we took punishment in the winter.   We oughtto maintain our hold, on the Malta channel, and deliverpunching blows to the Italians in different directions.He set up a Middle East Ministerial Committee to look into the question.   The Germans would probably lendsupport to the Italians.Discussion then ensued as to what would happen if the Germans came down to the Mediterranean and middle East.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that nothing wouldstop them.   He had asked General Freyburg to appreciate&quot;the situation in the Middle East, and he hoped to getsomething out of his views.   We wanted younger men,:but we did not know who were the ones to put up.THE PRIME MINISTER said that great work had beendone in the last month.   It would, be a good thing forWar Cabinet Ministers generally to pay visits to thevarious sectors.   We now had 450 anti-tank guns, and
1,200 pieces of artillery.   The rifles from america had been distributed.   We also had large numbers of tanks, both heavy - and&apos;-light, and armoured cars, and our aircraft and aircraft factories were protected.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether the aerodromes at St. Athans and Stormy Down were properly protected.THE PRIME MINISTER said that as regards our Generalshe thought very highly of Auchinlech, and also of Brooke,who had been in charge of a Corps in what had perhapsbeen the crucial battle in Flanders which had resultedin our saving the B.E.F.   Gort was now Inspector-Generalof Training.   He would be invaluable as C,-in-C.Irelandif the need arose, or to lead a force on the Continent.W.M. (40) 206th COWOLTTSTpftTS. 17.7.40.The discussion on Aliens lasted a full hour, andis much boiled down in the Minutes.There was a good deal of discussion about personnel for the Committee which was not recorded.W.M. (40) 207th CONCLUSIONS. 18.7.40.This looked like a long Meeting, but the P.M. haddetermined to take things with a rush, and it was verydifficult to get various Ministers into the room in time before the item for which they were attending was over.It was agreed that, while we must not carry outwarlike operations against oil supplies in unoccupied france, there was no objection to carrying out sabotageactivities, suitably camouflaged.At the end of the Meeting there was a good deal ofdiscussion by the War Cabinet alone.THE PRIME MINISTER invited the Lord Privy Seal&apos;attention to a case, reported in the Press, of a man whohad refused to plead as a conscientious objector atsome military tribunal, and the Ministry of Labour had put in an appearance for him and pleaded his case.The Prime Minister thought this was a little unnecessary,and invited the Lord Privy Seal to enquire into thematter.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on his trip theprevious day he had seen several Generals - Brooke,Auchinleck and Mart ell.   They had all impressed himvery much.   He thought that, although General Ironsidehad done very good work in the last month and could notbe said to have let the country down, nevertheless itwould be right to appoint another man in his place.&quot;He thought that he should be offered India, and he would get a baton as a Field-Marshal.   Brooke should beCommander-in-Chief, and Auchinleck should get theSouthern Command.This view was generally accepted by the WarCabinet, who felt that General Ironside did not reallycommand complete confidence.   The matter was put to beSecretary of; State* who would make a recommendationaccordingly to the King.
