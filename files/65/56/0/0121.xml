W.M. (40) &amp;lst CONCLUSIONS24 og o40,The stock items went very quickly, with theexception of a little snarling by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty.   He attacked the Air Ministry for a ,statement in the &quot;Dally Express&quot; that they had sunkfour submarines - a statement which, of course, was nottrue.   He then tried to prove that they had issuedcontradictory orders as to whether the ALTMARK mightor might.not be bombed within territorial waters.   Thiswas based on some confusion.The First Lord pretended that he had expectedto have on the Agenda the revised draft Statement inregard to the stoppage of traffiKin Norwegian territorial waters.   This draft ^ad not, of course, been intendedto come before the Meeting.    In the end we managed todeal with the matter by arranging that copies should be circulated to the Ministers present, and,, if they so desired, they should ask for a further Meeting to beheld in the afternoon.   This we managed to stave off.W.M. (40) 52nd CONCLUSIONS.28.2 .40.Minute 2.-naval situation.Minute 5.Stoppage ofTraffic in norwegian territorial waters.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister,THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that the Admiralty had laid five minefields in the Heligoland Bight.   Judgingby wireless activity on certain occasions from positions in the minefields we had laid, it was reasonable to hope-that we had had some success.THE FIRST LORD also said that he had had a longreport from Commander Bickford, the Officer in command of the Submarine SALMON, who had had a very tough&apos; time on his last patrol in the Heligoland Bight.   He was nowto have a period of leave.   The First Lord was impressedjby the effect on the personnel concerned, of continuedemployment on very dangerous jobs.   From some reports which Commander Bickford had made, the First Lordthought that the Germans were now probably in possession^of asdics.Discussion of the revised draft Statement occupiedby far the greater part of the morning.   I was left withthe impression that it was desired to continue the dis-cuss ion on the ensuing day;   more particularly as it wassuggested that if the Statement was settled on Tuesdayand released on Wednesday, we might announce our proposals,on Thursday and the minefield be laid on the ensuingMonday. &apos; Arrangements were made on this basis for theWar Cabinet Meeting on the following day.   It subsequent-lly appeared that the Prime Minister&apos;s discussion with thqLeaders of the Opposition Parties had resulted in theirasking for more time.   As a result, discussion of thismatter was postponed to a later day.
