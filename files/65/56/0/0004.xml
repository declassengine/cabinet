- MOST SECRET -W.M. (59) 67th CONCLUSIONS. 1.11 .59 .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat an approach had been made the previous day throughSecret Service channels from elements in the German Army.The approach seemed to be from reasonably important andwasinfluential quarters.   The general line of approaclythatthose taking part in it desired to establish a new government,-with a complete change of policy.   This theyprofessed to be able to carry out.   In order, however,to carry it out, it might be necessary to keep Herr Hitleiin an ornamental position, in which he could not influencepolicy.   There was evidence from many quarters that agood deal was going on in Germany, and that matters werefar from comfortable.   He had mentioned the matter tothe Prime Minister, who was disposed to think that a verbalreply should be sent to those who had sent the message.The reply should be to the effect that we had made ourposition plain in our public statements.   The essence ofthe whole matter was confidence.    It was impossible to feel any confidence so long as the head of the GermanGovernment was in a position to influence policy.   If thepeople concerned were in a position to make any proposals,we should, of course, have to consider them confidentiallywith the French.   He (the Foreign Secretary) thought itwould be undesirable tq take any action which would dampdown this movement, but at the same time we must show no sign of weakness whatsoever.In the course of discussion, objection was raisedby THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY&quot; to the terms of the reply suggested by the Foreign Secretary. It was essentialthat we should get wholly rid of Herr Hitler and his
regime. It would be wrong to bold out any encouragement to these approaches.   The sooner that they realisedour resolution, the better. ,. /THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought that itwould be undesirable to let the opinion grow up inGermany that they had got to be defeated in battlebefore there was any chance of reaching a settlement.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that if this approachwm made on a higher plane it might be dangerous, butat the moment there was every advantage in encouraginga movement which was of a disintegrating character.It was important not to stifle any growing oppositionTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR.WAR pointed out thatit was essential that we should make an end to therecurring crises with which we had been faced, over aperiod of years.    It was important to encourage no direct conversations.   The leaven of dissension inGermany was already operating, and it would continueto work.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE agreed with this view, and thought it was dangerous to affordany encouragement to such approaches.   What would ourposition be if the French got to know about them?THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that if weresponded to these manoeuvres they might well be disclosed in order to make trouble between us and theFrench;   He did not like dealing with these matters in such an informal manner.   He had not even had anopportunity to see the suggested reply in writing.He thought it was extremely perilous to contemplateanything which might be regarded as making terms with&amp; regime with a Hitler facade.inGermany if
A^m^  1HE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that if thepeople in question were really in a position to makeHitler occupy an ornamental position, they were reallyin a position to get rid of him altogether.   Anornamental position was not really a stopping-pointfrom their point of view.- THE PRIME MINISTER said that the argument wasthat Hitler had been a great figure in the eyes ofthe German public and that it might not be possibleto- make the ^change if he were wholly removed from the scene.   Our difficulty was, of course, that we could never be certain that he might not step down againfrom the shelf on which he had been placed.   His own view was that it would be unwise to take any actionwhich might result in damping down the movement fromwhich the present approach started.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER suggested thatwe might reply that we stood for the removal ofHitlerism and all that it stood for, and any approachmust be judged, by that test.   It must be made clearthat what we were after was to put an end to a system,and we were not concerned with any personal question.Prom the French point of view this was essential.It was agreed, that this matter should be discussed further on a later occasion.1st Novembert 1959
