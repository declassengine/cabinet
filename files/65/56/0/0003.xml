- MOST SECRET&quot;1- 13W.M. (59) 85th CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Note.(16th November, 1939.)*     *     *Reference was made to Telegram No. 191 fromBrussels (Copy, attached) reporting a further conversation which Admiral Sir Roger Keyes had. had with the King of the belgians.   This telegram made further reference to theKing&apos;s intense anxiety to contribute something towardsbringing about, an acceptable peace.   The King admitted that Hitler was unlikely to make any offer acceptable tothe Allies, but the opening of peace negotiations mightinduce Hitler to wait before committing himself irrevoeabjrto intensified and lightning warfare, while delay wouldenable Belgium to complete her defences.   The King was ready personally to throw out feelers, with the greatestsecrecy, if His Majesty&apos;s Government so wished.General agreement was expressed with the viev; that,while the King of the Belgians could throw out feelers ifhe so desired, it would be terribly dangerous to allow,him to think that we desired him to throw out such feelers.The last paragraph of the telegram stated that sir Roger Keyes was going to British Headquarters on theday of the despatch of the telegram (l6th November) andwould, return to England on the next day, unless he received a message that evening at British Headquarters .It was agreed that the wisest course was to say nothing and to let Sir Roger return home.NOTE:   As will be seen from the note of the discussion,when Sir Roger came to the War Cabinet on the18th November^ the wording of paragraph 5 of telegram No. 191 from Brussels, whxch had been drafted in a great hurry, had not, in Sir RogerKeyes&apos; view, been happily phrased, and had not really given a correct view of the King&apos;attitude./ W.M.(39) 8Jft4 Conclusions, Minute 6(Confidential Annex).
SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION AMD WAR CABINET.Froms   BELGIUM.Decypher.   Sir R. Clive (Brussels).16th November, 1939.R. (by telephone) 10.40 turn. 16th November, 1959.No. 191.coocccccccccocccceMOST IMMEDIATE.Following from Admiral Keyes:-I have had further conversation with the King, and am confident that he will act promptly with the support of themajority of his Government if Holland, is invaded.2.   He is, however, intensely anxious to contributesomething towards bringing about an acceptable peace.   He fullyappreciates that the replies of King George and of the french president were definite and uncompromising, that any furtherapproaches could only fee initiated by Germany, and that any negotiations must be conducted with the utmost secrecy.5.   He admits that Hitler is exceedlingly unlikely tomake any offer acceptable to the Allies, but possibly theopening of peace negotiations might induce Hitler to waitbefore committing himself irrevocably to intensified andlightning warfare.4.   Delay would enable Belgium to complete her defences, wouldbe in the interests of the Allies and greatly to the ultimatedetriment of the present regime in Germany5.   He is ready personally to throw out feelers with thegreatest secrecy if His Majesty&apos;s Government so wishes.6.   His Majesty continually harped on the value of delayboth on humanitarian grounds in the hoDe of ending the war, and on military grounds as being not only in the interests Of the Alliesbut also of Belgium.7.   I am going to British headquarters today and shall returnto England tomorrow unless I receive a message from you this evening at British headquarters.

X saw the King of the Belgians for two hours.The King was most anxious to keep his country neutraland out of the &quot;war. He was therefore anxious to do nothing which would infringe neutrality. He took theview that if Staff talks took place, the Germans werehound to get to hear about it.He also took the line that Belgium was nowstrongly armed, that the line of the Albert Canal wasa strong one which would hold up for some time andwould give time for our troops to advance.   He felt sure that we knew all about the Belgian positions *He knew that the French and the Germane had this informa-tion*   He felt that he must play the game, and he didnot see how he could Xielp us to get more information.He had been terribly pestered by the French.   In thelast two days nine different people had tried to getinterviews with him.^Rver since the occupation of the Rhlneland, when there had been Staff Conversations With tee French,the Belgians had been treated like a poor relation.This treatment had driven them into a declaration of neutrality.The King knew of the talks that had taken place between General Gamelin and the Secretary of State forWar and the Minister without Portfolio*T said that the King had given me the Belgianpoint of view, and that I would now give ours .   We hadguaranteed that if. Belgian neutrality was violated byGermany, we would come to their help.   It was not fair to expect us to come headlong to their help without proper pre^arrangeraents .*   I then spoke to the King onthe lines which I had discussed with the Chief of theImperial General Staff.   I escplained the information which we ought to possess.   In reply to the King*sstatement that-Ve must already possess this information;.
1 said that -we did not use spies in Belgium^The King was apparently astounded at the littleinformation that we had as to Belgian defences. Itappeared that the King was not aware of the episode inMay last, when the Director of Military intelligencehad gone over to Belgium by invitation, had been received in a most discourteous manner and had been refused any information, notwithstanding the fact that he had goneever by pre-arrangereent.t then explained our general plans, namely,that we could take up the line of the Scheldt but probably could not advance beyond that point *X then asked what would happen if Belgianneutrality was infringed,   The King said that this wasa political question, and would not give an answer.In reply to another question% as to whether Antwerp meantnothing to them, he let it be understood, that if Hollandwas attacked that -would probably bring Belgium in.The King then explained that he thought that 24hours at least woul^ be taken before the Germans reachedthe first Belgian defences.   (He said that the Batchwere working very hard on inundations, but X gained theimpression that the King had tried to reach an agreementwith Holland but that the Butch were unwilling to play .)The Belgians would be able to hold out for at leastanother 34 hours on the line of the Albert Canal, andat least another 24 hours on a new line further back.Surely this provided enough time to enable us to come up to their help,X then explained that, while we were anxiousto come to Belglura*3 help, it was up to the Belgians tomake it possible for us to do so.   I thought It wasperfectly easy for the Belgians to arrange to give usinformation without the French or the Germans getting to hear of it.
X then mentioned General Overstraeten, and saidthat co-operation between him and our Military Attacheshould be possible without anybody getting to know of it.When I mentioned this General, the King*s facelit up. and although X did not commit myself to theKing, t- was fairly-clear that&apos;action, on the lines proposed would be taken.   Our Military Attache had come back to w--     but was- going back, to Brussels-atthe beginning of next week, and - X thought that a -meetingcould then be arranged.The Wing also gave information as to an importantGerman who had been sent to see him.   Me thought thatthis German had tried at one time to frighten him and at the same time to persuade him to make an effort to get the war stepped.The King hinted that he thought heaight be in abetter position to help us later on, but he did notexplain in what way.X also had a talk with the Bowager Queen of the belgians, and with her sister, who is married, to aBavarian.Most of the Belgian gold is out of the countryand the rest -is near the frontier.   The arrangements in regard to oil and shipping are also satisfactory.The Belgians are determined to leave nothing behindthat would be of any use to Germany.The-ting, also mentioned, that the Belgian ArsMyhad only one blanket each, and that any help we could provide in this way would be much valued *   They had40,000 tons of wool which they oouia not use.   could we not take the wool and provide blankets in return?The King thought that our propaganda was bad*He did not think that our pamslilefcs were of any valueat the present stage, although they might be later on.
when &amp;ermany*e food rations., wfcieh were already very.shorty became shorter still *   there was already aserious shortage of food for those who were mot inthe Artsy.   He also mentioned that young women wereconscripted for working In factories and in the fields%and that the children were put in ere^hfiflfr where theywere looked after by women of&apos; a-low class-   there were-also said to he large numbers of executions*  The sonsof well-to**do people and those unfriendly to the -regimehad deliberately been put&apos;in the forefront of the battlein Poland *   Nevertheless, in the last few months RerrHitler&apos;s position had been greatly strengthened, partly as the result of the successes in Poland^ and partly on account of good propaganda,   $he people were frightened of the Gestapo.   (This related particularly to theBavarians * and every Officer and man had sworn an oathto Herr Hitler, and, it was thought, would keep it*). * * *
1&apos; visited :%h.e - General - Headquarters of. the british expeditionary Force on my way, where t was told thatas the B*EiF* was under the oosBnand of General Georges,no undertakings oould be given to the Belgians by theBritish for assistance on land except through the French.On arrival In Brussels I had dinner with QueenElizabeths   She had paid a number of visits to theBelgian defences on the frontier recently, and spokehighly of the morale of the Belgian troops and of the immense efforts which had been made to strengthen thefortifications *   There was no doubt about the Belgiandetermination, to defend their country.   I asked the.Queen whether the violation of fiife Dutch frontier bythe Germans would be sufficient to cause the Belgians toask for our assistance.   She was not prepared to give a reply on that point *   She expressed her great admirationOf the King of the Belgians, who was very like his fatherand had a determined character?   Her Majesty spoke agood, deal of the difficulties which the Belgians had had with the French ever since the last war, and of theKing&apos;s unpopularity in Paris *   She also expressedunbounded confidence in General Van Overstracten, whowas pro-Ally in sympathy and was the outstanding figure in the Belgian Array?On the next day I saw the King and discussed&apos;with, him-the probable Belgian attitude if the neutrality of Holland was infringed,-   t eapreseed to the King my views of the attitude which t thought would have beenadopted by the late King In present circumstances *t said that X thought the late King would have declaredthat the present concentration of German troops on theEastern frontier of Belgium was an outrage,- and. that theBritish and French could be relied upon hot to violateBelgian neutrality t   he would have made It clear to
the Germans that the crossing of the Butch frontier would inevitably -bring Belgium into the war against them*   TheKing ,pellnted out that he: was a : constitutional monarchand couldenty express the views of his Government, whoaid not Judge the moment opportune for any such declaration-tion.  He was, however, GoEsa&amp;nde^ of the Army,and when the right time came he wou^d lead them againstthe Germans, and he would be supported by the majorityof his GovernmentsApparently the Butch have not asked the Belgiansto come to their assistance if attacked, and the Belgiansdo not wish to be asked.   They feel that the Butch army is so small that it would be calling upon the Belgiansto operate against the Germans in areas which were notat all suitable, and which would&apos;prejudice the.defenceof their own country,   ft is certain,, nevertheless, thatif Holland is invaded, the Belgians will call us into their own country,On the following day X again met the King at theQueers house.   The King again expressed his desire to do something more in an effort to restore peace beforeirrevocable action is taken.   He knew that the war wouldbe a bloody one, and that the Germans would stick atnothing,   Xt would be worth a great deal to gain time,even if no other benefit resulted from a further attempt at a settlement.   X told the King that X feared the case was hopeless,   Herr Hitler could hardly put forward any terms which we could consider, and our attitude had beenmade clear by the uncompromising answer from King Georgeto the offer of mediation made by the Queen of theNetherlands and the King of Belgium,At the time of my last visit to Belgium, a Germandoctor had been in Brussels who had treated the Kingafter a ski-dng accident, and who had established friendly
-      CO -r^&amp;relations with hira*.  flhis doctor had &apos;h6&apos;en through thePolish campaign, and was known to be in close touch with herr Hitler,   t surmised that this doctor bad been sentto Belgium to impress on the King the great power of theGerman mechanised drive into Poland*   I heard that the doctor had had an audience of the King, from which he had&quot;come out iiuch: depressed .and went straight hack to &apos;Germany*;.ft   iar probable that the King had totd the doctor that belgium would resist any attempt by Germany to pass through her territory.   I think it possible that anyfeelers which the King might wish to put out to germany will be done through the agency of this doctor.t think that ray telegram of the 16th november was perhaps phrased to give an impression that the king of the Belgians wished to put out peace feelers with theauthority of the British Government.   This does notcorrectly express the King&apos;s attitude *   The King realised that such feelers would probably produce no result, buthe hoped that if, by any chance, any reasonable proposals were to come from Germany, His Majesty4s Governmentwould consider them.   It is only to this extent thatthe King expects us to be associated with his action.It, is Quite certain that the Germans had, nothing to do with the offer of mediation made by the two raonarhs *The King is inspired with a genuine wish to do what hecan, at-any rate, to gain tlme*The importance of more time was also tst&amp;flastemphasised by General Van Overstraeten.   The Belgiansare anxious to complete the work on their second line ofdefence.The Belgians had been convinced that the germans were going to begin their invasion on the 11th November *A number of German diplomatic families had left shortly before, and all Intelligence pointed the same way*
For several- days he for ehand the German reconnaissance aircraft had flown ceaselessly ever the Belgian defences,,taking photographs *  However, the attack did not come^and the Belgians attribute this to the fact that theGermans had discovered the great strength of the Belgiandefences and the Allied concentration behind the FrancesBelgian frontier.   The Belgians are now inclined to thinkthat nothing will happen until the Spring,   But GeneralVan Overs traeten is quite confident that if the Germansdo come they will sustain a decisive defeat .The Belgians are very anxious to obtain some A*A,guns, in order to prevent the contiraial reconnaissanceon the part of the German Air force,The British Military Attache&apos; lnBrussels has established, very good relations with General Van Overstraeiten, and: will be given full information-   The General issuspicious of the French Military Attache, however,and desires that all conversations between the Frenchand the Belgians should take place in Paris,The King of the Belgians, in my interview,questioned the wisdom of making a change at the british embassy at such a vitally important juncture.   Thepresent Ambassador&apos;e attitude has been extremely helpfultowards my somewhat delicate Mission.
Prime Minister

Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

With reference to my telegram of January 15 from Brussels, the King of the Belgians asked me to try to get some sort of guarantee from H.M. Government, which he could show to his Government, and he gave me a draft which covered the points he considered would induce them to act promptly, if Belgian neutrality was threatened by Germany.

I telephoned this from G.H.Q. France on the morning of January 14, and during the night of 14th to 15th, I received a message which I was directed to give to the King.

He agreed that it provided all that Belgium could reasonably expect in the way of a guarantee, but since it was dependent on Belgium inviting the British and French armies across the frontier at once and thus involving Belgium in the war, he could not possibly show it to his Government, consisting as it did of all parties, including Flemings, who were absolutely determined to keep out of the war as long as there was the remotest possibility of averting it.

Moreover he said it would have a very bad effect; for although his Government were definitely pro-English, the Flemish element was to a great extent anti-French, and it would be concluded that we were acting under French influence, which had in their view been insistent and tiresome ever since the last war.

The King&apos;s point of view is given in my telegram of 15th January. Before despatching it, I read him the part which concerned him, and he said that it expressed his view exactly. That the King expressed the view of the Belgian nation, with few exceptions, cannot be questioned. I asked the King if his Government were ready to invite the allied armies into Belgium the moment the Dutch frontier was violated by Germany - a direct corollary of the speech of m.Spaak, the Foreign Minister, in the House of Representatives recently From the King&apos;s reply it was obvious that M.Spaak&apos;s speech had reservations and that there would be considerable delay before his Government would be induced to act, although as I pointed out, most ? and insistently, the violation of Dutch territory was a direct threat to Antwerp and the Belgian interests on the Scheldt, and must
inevitably lead to an attack on Belgium.;V (gjfe       As 1* seems probable that&apos;Germany will in the first instance3        attack Holland In; t^$       remain neutral, until sheherself is tlareatened, it seems to meimperative that something sn^violation of Dutah neutrality should be a signal for the immediateentry of British and Jrench troops into Belgium.     X would suggestthat the guarantee that I gave to the King should be amended tothat effect.^It would give him strong arguments to put before hia Governmentand ensure that golden opportunities were not lost, while his Govem-ment hesitated to take a step vital to Belgium&apos;s security and Interestsand Incidentally all-important to the allies.I gathered that the Belgian Government includes ignorant people,obsessed with the determination to keep oUt of war, but they cannotbe ignored at this stage without creating a dangerous political crisis-I submit that it is in the interests ot the allies to substitute the proviso I haVe suggested, which if accepted, would ensure the entry of their armies into Belgium the moment Dutch neutrality isviolated.
10, Jirfmrteg Mtttd,Mljitiissa.SECRET. / 23rd February, 1940.Dear Edward,I showed these papers to the Prime Ministerto-day.     He spoke to Lord Halifax and he theninstructed me to inform Sir Roger Keyes that he, thePrime Minister, has; no objection to these papersbeing sent to the King of the Belgians, provided itis made quite clear that they represent Sir Roger&apos;sown views and not necessarily those of the Government.I spoke to Sir Roger and impressed this upon him andhe assured me that he appreciated the point and asked that the papers should be sent to you for retention.I made it clear that unfortunately the pressure is such to-day that the Prime Minister could not see him.Sir Roger did mention in the course of our conversation that he would have liked to send theKing of the Belgians some message from thePrime Minister as The King regards himself ascommuni cat ing ...
communieating with the Prime Minister.     I explained,however, that I could not authorise this andSir Roger did not press the point.    It was not very-clear what kind of message he wanted to send.Sir Edward Bridges,, K.C.B., M.C.

On 16th February, I received a message from King Leopold, to the effect that on 15th January, the Belgian Ambassador in Paris was sent for by M. Daladier, who told him that the French Army was ready to move into Belgium within six hours, on receiving the invitation, which he understood would be given, on the strength of the guarantee which had been asked for and would be granted.

The Ambassador expressed great surprise, and said that he knew nothing of any guarantee being asked for by his Government; on which M. Daladier replied:

«L&apos;eventualité d&apos;un tel appel ayant été, dans les circonstances que Votre Excellence n&apos;ignore point, évoquée devant les Gouvernements français et anglais.» ...

This put the King in an awkward position, when it was reported to his Government, however the matter has been settled; but the King has asked me to give him a note of what actually occured, in case the matter is re-opened by any future Government, not so well disposed towards him as the existing one.

Roger Keyes

Admiral of the Fleet
In compliance with Your Majesty&apos;s wish, I got into communication with Mr Chamberlain on the morning of 14th January, and transmitted your request that - in the event of Belgium becoming involved in the war between Germany and Great Britain and her Allies - you might be given the following guarantee, similar to the one given to King Albert in 1914 :-

"1) Pas d&apos;ouverture de négociations do paix sans participation de la Belglque.

2) Garantie de la restauration integrale du statut politique et territorial de la Belgique ainsi que de sa colonie.

3) Assistance pour la restauration économique et financière de la Belgique."

I explained that Your Majesty had not asked for this guarantee on behalf of your Government through official channels, because you felt that this would take time and would be difficult to arrange. If, however, the Prime Minister would give such a promise, it would be a great help to your Government.

During that night (14/1/40) I received a telegram authorising me to give Your Majesty the reply that I handed to you on the morning of the 15th January.

Your Majesty told me that as the acceptance of the terms of the guarantee would at once involve Belgium in war, you could not entertain it, and you did not propose to show the offer to your Government.

I informed the Prime Minister of this on my return to England.
