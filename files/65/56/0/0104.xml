seaward than was possible at the moment.A technique had been developed of inter-ception to seaward from these stationsequipped with R.T.   The sub-controllershad been partially trained and were nowbeing put to their duties.   It was hopedthat 6 stations on the East Anglian Coastwould be working within a week.   others were coming along rapidly and it was hopedthat the East Coast, with the exception ofthe Scottish Coast, would be adequatelycovered by the 1st March.In reply to the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence, THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR staff explained that these measures were designedto overcome the difficulties under which theFighters at present laboured in navigatingover the sea, and in finding their way tothe ships which they were sent to protect.It would enable information to be passed tothem once they left the ground, and would thus ensure a much greater measure of control..W.M. (40) 55rd conclusions..3..J.0.*Minute 1...The air situation.The CoventryMurd ers.The CoventryMurders.Minute ft.I      -Sir stafford cripps*visit toMos COW oIn the absence of the Prime Minister, the Foreign!Secretary, the three Service Ministers and the Chiefs of 1Staff, the War Cabinet was reduced to a Second Eleven.Air Vice-Marshal Peck was asked about the german aircraft brought down in this country and reported inthe Press as having been set on fire.   It appeared as amatter of fact that the machine had not been set on fire, although two members of the crew had attempted to do so.   It had been thought better, however, to allow the reports to appear in the Press that the aircraft hadbeen set on fire, in order to delude the enemy.There was again a short reference to the Coventrymurders, which is recorded elsewhere.W.M. (40 ) 54th CONCLUSIONS.6*3 .40.Another Second Eleven Meeting.   Again a further discussion as to the Coventry murders.W.M. (40) 85-th CONCLUSIONS..7 .S .40.The Prime Minister in very good form in recountingthe Fifth Meeting of the Supreme War Council, which hadobviously gone with a swing.Nobody seemed to be much alarmed as to Sir stafford cripps&apos;s perigrinations.

At the end, after all but the War Cabinet hadretired, information was given as to President Roose-velfs peace feelers, which wales recorded elsewhere.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY reminded his colleagues that before he went to Paris he had said that he expected to see Mr Prytz.   Re had failed to do so as mr Prytz had been delayed.   He asked for the PrimeMinister&apos;s mind as to whether he should ask to see Mr Prytz at once, or whether this would give too muchprominence.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the foreign secretary should give Mr Prytz 24 hours to ask for an interview, and, if he did not do so, that Lord Halifaxshould then take the initiative.W.M. (40) 56th CONCLUSIONS.8 .2 .40,Minute 2.The naval situation.Minute 8.Vote &quot;A&quot;.Red BalloonS care.Minute 5.-^jlllAssistaneefcrwv/to Finland.There was really nothing which necessitated aMeeting of the War Cabinet, but the Prime Minister didnot like the suggestion either of postponing the WarCabinet to a later hour or of not having a Meeting.Some of the subjects discussed were rather discussed by way of filling in time.The First Lord mentioned that H.M.S. REPULSEwould soon reach Devonport, and that he was going to let the newly-arrived Italian Naval Attache see her.He seemed to be well-disposed towards us, spoke Englishvery well, and had an attractive wife.The Secretary of State for War was very anxious that maximum numbers should not be used.   His predecessorlhad stated that we should have three million men underarms by August.    In reaching this figure he had included the total number of men in various Classes which wereto be called up, and had thereby included 50 per cent,of those Classes who were in reserved occupations andwould not be called to the Colours.   It would, therefore,]be extremely embarrassing for the War Office to quoteany figure.At the end of the Meeting there was a referenceto a scare which had started through a red balloonfloating about in the Eastern Counties.   This balloonhad been sent up for meteorological purposes, but ithad apparently given rise to a scare that gas balloonswere being let loose by the Germans.
