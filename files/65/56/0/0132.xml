THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that a German attack onHolland would probably only be undertaken as a last anddesperate gamble.   It might conceivably be done as a counter to our intervention in Scandinavia, but theoccupation of Denmark would probably be a better move from the German point of view.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that the allied forces were all ready to meet an attack through the low countries, but there would certainly be a dangerousperiod during the move forward from our present line.The particulars given by C.A.S. as to our bomberstrength were as follows :-Total.10 Squadrons in France,each composed, of 24machines ... 2406 Squadrons of heavy bombers in the UnitedKingdom, each composedof 18 machines . .. 1086&quot;Squad.rons of/nediumbombers in the UnitedKingdom, each composedof 18 machines (the ....        108machines of 2 out ofthe 6 Squadrons were already packed for despatch to Scandinavia) total ...       456.The Foreign Secretary was not very pleased with theWar Cabinet decision.   I think he felt that an absolutelyrigid attitude in regard to Italian coal ships wouldresult in our getting into a jam.   I rather expect himto return to the charge in a day or so   one of hisdisarming admissions that he never felt happy with theoriginal decision.Beyond the fact that it was agreed that we should start negotiations with France and Turkey to get adecision as to how the cost should be borne before wewere finally committed to the whole scheme, the WarCabinet reached no very definite conclusion.   The Conclu-sion as drafted was- shown to the Chancellor of theExchequer, who suggested the addition of (c) and acceptedthe others.W.M. (40) 62nd CONCLUSIONS. 7.8.40.There was no serious difference of opinion, oralterations made in the recommendations by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.   Nevertheless, this lasted 40 minutes.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs returnedto the charge, as I expected.   Fortunately, it seemedsituation?reV10US day&apos;S coneliasions Pretty well met the
We had no report on the Naval situation, in theabsence of the First Lord of the Admiralty, and as theChiefs of Staff were busily at work, in the Central war room and we were told that there was no special matter which they wished to raise.Minute 7. We had realised that there was a likelihood of this being raised, and had asked the Foreign Secretary whetherFinland. he proposed to do so.   He sent a message to the effectthat he did not propose to raise the matter in such a way as to require the Chiefs of Staff to be present.I passed this message on to the Secretary of Statefor Air, and asked whether he was happy that the C.A.S.should not be present at the Meeting.The Secretary of State for Air did not wish theC.A.S. sent for.   He thought, I think, that in theabsence of the C.A.S. the War Cabinet would not decide to send further bombers to Finland.   In the event, however the general body of opinion was distinctly in favour of doing so, and I was instructed to record a decision tothis effect.It emerged that the Chiefs of Staff, at their simul-taneous meeting, had also been considering this question,and had. eome to a very different conclusion. Accordinglyit was arranged, that C.A.S. should attend at the Meetingheld at 5.30 in the afternoon, at which the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary were to settle the terms of adraft telegram to Finland.As a result of the discussion which took place atthat meeting, it was agreed not to send them a telegramuntil the ensuing morning, and to put the matter again onthe Agenda, together with the draft Report on the subject which the Chiefs of Staff had been preparing.Altogether not a very successful day&apos;s work.The latest news, however, seems to show that the Finnsare not on the point of making up their mind immediately,and that a short delay is not going to affect matters one way or the other.WJt. (40)  65rd CONCLUSIONS.8.3.4Q0Minute, 4..Assistanceto Finland.Minute 8.Italy.German CoalThe main business was the discussion on Finland,picking up the decision reached by the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary, after the previous day*s Meetingof the War Cabinet, to defer sending a further telegram to Helsinki until the Chiefs of Staff Report had beenconsidered.   This matter was really settled by the proposaput forward by the Prime Minister, which found a happycompromise between the two points of view.   The decisionto get ready 50 Blenheims to send to Finland was arrivedat wi,th a far greater measure of general agreement than had seemed possible 24 hours earlier.   Indeed, I think the decision met with general approval almost without exception.There were only two other points .   One was thediscussion on the Royal Marine Operation, and the otherconcerned the Italian coal ships.   The latter was producedout of the blue by the Foreign Secretary rather naughtily,just after the Minister of Economic Warfare had departed.The Foreign Secretary proceeded to give an account of the
