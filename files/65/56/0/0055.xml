Mr herbert morrison&apos;sSpeech.BritishSubjectskidnappedat Venlo.Minute 2.The naval situation.Minute 9.The Balkansaircraft which had presumably mistaken the Swale for theMedway.   The (aircraft which had crashed at Sheringhamhad also had a mine on it, and steps were being taken tore cover it.THE PRIME MINISTER referred somewhat bitterly toMr Herbert Morrison&apos;s speech in the House last night,in the course of which he stated that the disaster at scapa Plow (i.e. the sinking of the R6YAL OAK) wouldnot have happened if Lord Stanhope had been removed fromOffice earlier.   Mr &quot;Morrison had also stated that theappointment of Sir John Gilmour as Minister of Shippingwas idiotic.   The Prime Minister was not worried about that remark, which was^aimed at himself, and he was quitprepared to look after himself.   The statement in regardto Lord Stanhope he thought was disgraceful.   Even theharmless part of Mr Morrison&apos;s speech had the characterof ordinary peace-time Party stuff.   Anyhow, he was not proposing to put down a Private Notice Question inregard to the statement about Lord Stanhope, as thatmight have led to a demand for publication of theReport in regard to the ROYAL OAK.   He wished hiscolleagues to be aware of his views on the matter.At the end of the Meeting THE SECRETARY OP STATEFOR AIR asked whether there was any further news of thetwo British subjects who had been kidnapped at Venlo.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that four days ago theUnited States Ambassador at Berlin had received instruc-tions to make enquiries regarding these two men, butthe United States Embassy had not yet been able tofurnish a report.WoM. (59) 108th CONCLUSIONS.8 ol2 o39 oTHE FIRST LORD said that there was some reason tothink that the ship torpedoed outside Narvik had been torpedoed inside Norwegian territorial waters.   If so,this might prove a considerable help to us.   This, nodoubt, was a reference&apos; to our desire that the NorthernBarrage should extend into territorial waters.Reference was made to a rather gloomy telegramfrom Sir William Seeds (No.503), the effect of whichwas that we might as well reconcile ourselves to being at war with the Soviet.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Sir William Seedswas a very ill man, and too much attention should notbe paid to his views.Minute 12.War cabinet arrangements.W.M. (59) 109th CONCLUSIONS. 9.12.59.There was some general discussion not recorded inthe Minutes.ni^JZg2 ?feST.L0RD OF-THE ADMIRALTY thought that itmight be a good plan that on one day in the week theWar: Cabinet should divide into two packs, which shouldhunt separately.   Thus, one pack might pursue thequestion of the supply of munitions, which would provide
several full days&apos; hunting, while the other, under;the Prime Minister, might range over the Home Front.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR favoured the PrimeMinister&apos;s scheme, and thought the Chiefs of Staffneed not normally attend on Tuesdays and Thursdays.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that the plan proposed would be a great improvement so far as the Home Frontwas concerned.   He had at first thought that it mightbe a good plan to arrange that a specific item covering the Home Front should be put on the Agenda on one day in each weeks   but after considerationhe had thoughtthat the best plan would be that the Home Front itemshould be ensured an early place on the Agenda onthese two days in the week.   He thought that theproposed plan was a good one.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR also favouredadopting the plan proposed.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER hoped that thePrime Minister would take a really long holiday at christmas, and expressed the affection and anxiety ofhis colleagues.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was going to be at chequers for Christmas, and intended to be present at the Meetings on the 27th and 28th December.   Fortu-nately he had a temperament which enabled him to throwoff cares quickly.THE FIRST LORD thought that something should bedone to counteract the idea of Christmas which these arrangements favoured.THE PRIME MINISTER said that nothing would bepublished as to the arrangements proposed, but he would circulate a Memorandum to his colleagues.W.M.(39) 110th CONCLUSIONS. 10.12 .59.. A Sunday Meeting.   A good deal of rather desultorytalk concerning the desirability of shutting down theseSunday Meetings.The First Lord arrived late, in a vile temper,having spent the day at Chatham, where apparentlythings had not gone very well.   Among the points he mentioned, and not recorded in the Minutes, was thathe had been disturbed to find at Chatham that therewere only eight balloons instead of the fifty whichhad been authorised for the defence of the thames estuary.   The Commander-in-Chief was concerned that german mine-laying aircraft had been allowed to alightin the Estuary without being fired on.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theestuaries had now been made an artillery zone, in which any aircraft could be fired upon.   All the balloonshad been sent to Chatham, but the barges for them werenot yet available.   Out of the first eight balloons,seven had caught fire very shortly after they arrived.There was also a good deal of discussion about theFirst Lord&apos;s suggestion for retaliatory measures in
