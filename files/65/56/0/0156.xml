W M .(40) 204th 0ON0LUS TONS .IS.7.40.-Minute l;Bomb dropped on AluminiumWorks atSlough.Minute 2.The operation at Guernsey.Minute S.I was told today that one of our pilots, onreturning to his aerodrome, had said that one of hisbombs had dropped out by mistake.   It is very unfortunate-nate that this casual bomb should have been the onlyone which had done any serious damage to one of ourfactories.The G.N.S. said that the party had returned with7 crashed boats, and that one boat had been sunk.The P.M. said that the party had been back forsome time, but there was no report, which was ratherunsatisfactory.   He said that the raid was a pin-prick,and had been intended to smash up the aerodrome, tokill any Germans they saw, and get away.   But why didwe send 140 men when there were 469 Germans on the island?

On the return of the party, General Bournewas asked whether a Communique should be issued.   TheP.M*s comment was that ^hiexploit of this kind should,above all, be kept as secret as possible.He was satisfied that this kind of thing requiredto be done on a bigger scale, and he proposed to putSir Roger Keyes in charge.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY gave the War Cabinet informa-tion on this subject which Sir Alexander Cadogan had given to the War Cabinet on Saturday.   For this reasonI recorded none of it.I also did not record a discussion started bya reference made by the Lord President of the Councilto telegram 265 to Moscow from Mr Butler to Sir stafford cripps.
