Il5 5W .M . (40) 88th CONCLUS IONS .10*2*40,Minute 1,The Air^Situation,Minute 1.The air situation.Minute 2.The naval situation.Minute 12.Palestine.Minute 1,Nationales ourcesand. our war Effort.The reason why the Air Ministry did not claim the aircraft brought down in the sea, was that thiscame from what was known in the last war as a &quot;Japanese&quot;source of information.(Lord Hankey came to see me onMonday.   He thought the bowdlerisedversion in the Minutes was a littletoo open.)The Meeting turned into a rather general informal discussion of a number of points which cropped up.These are recorded in a separate note which was notcirculated.(SUPRA)W.M. (40) 59th CONCLUSIONS.12.2.40 .The reconnaissance related to a photograph ofJade and the Ems Estuary.   Both Wilhelmshaven and Emsharbours were frozen up.   The reconnaissance had beencarried out by a Spitfire especially cleaned up, thebolts smoothed down, thereby adding 15 miles to the speed.   Photographs were handed round to the WarCabinet, which had been taken at a height of 32,000 ft.This Spitfire was unarmed, and relied on speed for avoiding action.   The Air Ministry thought that, theyhad spotted 50 or 60 submarines in Emden, frozen inthe harbour.    It was this information which is referredto in the Conclusions.   It emerged next day, however,that the so-called submarines were only^barges.THE FIRST LORD described the steps that had beentaken to intercept the 6 German ships which had leftVigo.   He also described how the gale had interruptedthe task of completing the defences of Scapa Flow.   Oneofithe blockships had rolled off into deep water.   Thiswas in addition to the three blockships which had been sunk on the way up.   There seems to be a fatality aboutthe blockships at scapa.A long and troublesome discussion, leading to a conclusion which I think was inevitable beforehand,namely, that the First Lord was prepared to give way tothe views of his colleagues, after a stout resistance.W.M. (40) 40th CONCLUSIONS.15 .2 .40.A very long Meeting - two hours and a half.Nearly the whole time was occupied in dealing with minute 1 - a survey of our national resources.This at one time promised to be an extremelycontentious item.   The conclusion of the Meeting,however, was really determined longfoefore the meeting was held, by the fact that it had been arranged thatthe Paper from the Military Co-ordination Committeeon the Equipment of the British Army should be taken at the same Meeting, and the fact that this latter paper was based on the Report drawn up by the Secretary ofState for War and the Ministry of Supply, in conjunction-6 6-
which settled that our immediate objective should be36 Divisions, while net abandoning the 55 Divisions asthe ultimate objective.   Since this conclusion coincidedalmost exactly with the conclusion of Lord Stamp&apos;s Survey,!there was nothing else to do but to accept this conclusions in the course of the economic part of the discussion!the following secret figures were given, but were omitted from the record:-(a)  200- 250 millions, the estimated valueof our Dollar securities.(b) The figure of  700 millions for the hettotal of our capital assets of all kinds.(c) The figure of  135 millions representingthe withdrawals from London in the first four months of the war (i.e.,withdrawalsat the rate of  400 millions per annum).W.M. (40) 41st CONCLUSIONS. 14.2 &apos;.40 .The statement that the Skagerrak was closed wasthe prelude to a statement that the ore ships comingdown the Norwegian coast ha.d to cut across the Skagerrakto the west coast of Denmark and leave territorial waters,and that the Navy meant to have a cut at thenuThe Navy also gave warning that they proposed tohave a shot at the anchorages being used between Borkum,Juist and nor deney.The generally expressed view was the hope thatthere would be no open breach between M. Daladier andM. Reynaud.   The probable re-shuffle of M. Daladier&apos;sGovernment, referred to by Sir Ronald Campbell in thesecond telegram quoted, was thought as referring not toah attempt to get rid of M. Reynaud, but to a desire onM. Daladier&apos;s part to broaden the base of his Administra-tion.   This would be quite likely, as a result of the unanimous vote of confidence passed in M. Daladier atthe eonclusioriof the recent Secret Session.Information from another source, which was notquoted in the War Cabinet and which reached, me today,is that these two eminent politicians get on quite well,but that their mistresses quarrel!The Meeting ended early, and the members of theWar Cabinet (with no Officials present) had a short discussion on a &quot;question of politics&quot;.w,M. Unl 42nd CONCLUSIONS. 15.2 .4Q,.A small Meeting;   the S/S for War being still awayin Prance; and the First Lord, accompaniedChancellor of the Exchequer, welcoming the EXETER at-Plymouth.Most of the Meeting was occupied by discussion ofthe West Indies Royal.
