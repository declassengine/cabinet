Minute, 4 *Use of convoys byNeutrals.Minute 6.Assistanceto Finland.Minute, 1 *Death ofMr OliverBoden.Minute 3 ..Holland.The western front.The First Lord had yet another innings on this item, and again referred to the suggestion that weshould offer insurance to all neutral ships sailing inour convoys.The situation is still obscure.   The War cabinet felt that it was no use dealing with demands forassistance on a large scale, e.g., 100 bombers, until we knew whether the Finns really meant to go on withthe fight and to appeal to us for assistance, or whetherthey meant to make terms with the Russians.W.M. (40) 61st CONCLUSIONS.6 .S .40 .At the end of this item THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORAIR said that he had just heard that Mr Oliver Bodenhad died suddenly that morning.   Mr Boden was employedby Lord Nuffield to manage the Castle Bromwich aircraft factory, and;: I think, another factory engaged on warwork for the Government.   His death was a great loss.This led to some discussion as to the output ofCastle Bromwich.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, when last at Birming-ham, he had seen Lord Austin and had been shocked athis appearance.   He thought that Lord Austin was finish-ed and would never do any useful work again.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he thought this was so.   Unfortunately, Lord Austin, who wasChairman of a Committee which managed Shadow Factories,insisted on continuing to do this work, although in point of fact the real work was being done for him byMr Roots.The reference to some possible trouble between theDutch and the Germans led to the First Lord advancingthe view that the Germans might well launch an attack onfHolland in the near future, in order to gain a base forair attacks on this country.   He referred to a reportof a conversation which the wife of Herr Tauber had had with a German recently, who was known to be very eloseto Goering.   He had spoken very freely one night, andhad said that the Germans expected that Russia would bemuch weakened by the Finnish campaign, and that theGermans would soon be able to obtain control of Roumaniaiwithout using force at all.   Their next move would beto divide up Yugoslavia with Italy.   This, again, wouldbe done without fighting.   The only fighting-which wouloftake place would be on the northern part of the western front.   On the next day the German had spoken to FrauTauber and had said that he had spoken very freely andwildly the night before, and that she was not to pay anygattention to what he had said, or repeat it to.anybody?and, provided she promised not to repeat it, he promised^to get her Macedes car out of Austria for her.In t,he ensuing discussion THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he did not think an attaclflon the Western Front was probable.   Hitler was a bullyand a boaster, but at bottom he was a coward, and hisnerve would probably fail him when it came to taking somomentous a decision.
THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that a German attack onHolland would probably only be undertaken as a last anddesperate gamble.   It might conceivably be done as a counter to our intervention in Scandinavia, but theoccupation of Denmark would probably be a better move from the German point of view.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that the allied forces were all ready to meet an attack through the low countries, but there would certainly be a dangerousperiod during the move forward from our present line.The particulars given by C.A.S. as to our bomberstrength were as follows :-Total.10 Squadrons in France,each composed, of 24machines ... 2406 Squadrons of heavy bombers in the UnitedKingdom, each composedof 18 machines . .. 1086&quot;Squad.rons of/nediumbombers in the UnitedKingdom, each composedof 18 machines (the ....        108machines of 2 out ofthe 6 Squadrons were already packed for despatch to Scandinavia) total ...       456.The Foreign Secretary was not very pleased with theWar Cabinet decision.   I think he felt that an absolutelyrigid attitude in regard to Italian coal ships wouldresult in our getting into a jam.   I rather expect himto return to the charge in a day or so   one of hisdisarming admissions that he never felt happy with theoriginal decision.Beyond the fact that it was agreed that we should start negotiations with France and Turkey to get adecision as to how the cost should be borne before wewere finally committed to the whole scheme, the WarCabinet reached no very definite conclusion.   The Conclu-sion as drafted was- shown to the Chancellor of theExchequer, who suggested the addition of (c) and acceptedthe others.W.M. (40) 62nd CONCLUSIONS. 7.8.40.There was no serious difference of opinion, oralterations made in the recommendations by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.   Nevertheless, this lasted 40 minutes.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs returnedto the charge, as I expected.
