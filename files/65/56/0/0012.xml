OoLUooCO Li.UJO&quot;&quot;&quot;TVoLUH -5. !JIT]?J.,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that Herr Himmler was now seeking to connect the Munich bomb  explosion with theVenloo affair.    He had discussed the matter with the secret Service authorities, who still believed that thepeople they had been in touch with, up to the date of thefVenloo episode, had been genuine.   He was not certainJfchat the Germans were not trying to get us to give awayJinf information.    Of course,  it was possible thai, we had been,Ok pouble-crossed;-The point for consideration was whether weJaow to put out some statement which would correct$impression made by the Gentian statements.&quot;2 fourhttheThe Foreign Secretary then handed round  co.pi.es ofp. statement which had been prepared dealing with thispatter. The statement did not deal with the question ofjfche wireless set &quot;which it was said, we had given to the gestapo.   While the Gestapo knew that we had handed overk wireless set to certain people in Germany, very likelythey did not know where the set was.draft was read, and. was regarded an a very goodI TheStatement.3I In dis cuss ion it was agreed, that  the reference in-it to pelements  in the German Army&quot; should, be deleted.In further discussion, the question was raised whether it was time to publish a statement at all.    Tin(l)  The statement b-^-kedof the wireless   set.the really vital point(2)  If we said, nothing the affair would, noonwork itself out, or be overlo.id. with othermatters.(3)  In any  case, nobody was likely to believe the German story.(4)  if the statement was published,  it mightwell  contradict some of the answers  givenin thegruelling cross-examination to which, nodoubt,  they had been subjected.    This mightbe particularly awkward if later a trial wasstaged., with these two unfortunate men asthe central figures.It was therefore decided that the right course wasI to tell the Press that there were two Secret Service menI who had been kidnapped;    that it was desirable not to sayj too much about the affair;    but that it had,  of course,j not the slightest  connection with the Munich bomb  explosion
