A short Meeting, which resulted in a certainamount of general confabulation at the end.THE U.S.A. THE PRIME MINISTER gave an account (not recorded and CANADA.      in the Minutes) of his discussion with Mr., R.B.Bennett  the previous day.   Mr Bennett had just returned fromP.M.&apos;s dis-      Canada and the United States.   In his view, the troublecussion with    we were now experiencing with the United States was mr R.B.Bennett.largely due to Mr Cordell Hull, who had a one-trackmind and was only capable of thinking of his economic policy and trs.de matters.   Mr Cordell Hull had got it into his head that we were interfering with UnitedStates trade, and was therefore anti-Ally at the moment.Mr Bennett had warmly approved the information which we had given out as to the amount of contrabandin parcels from the United States, and said that if this information had been made public a month ago we should never have had all this trouble.The Prime Minister said that he now understoodthat the trouble related mainly to contraband in lettersMr Bennett had said that there was a definitedesire in the United States to get Canada out of thewar.   He thought, however, that we need, not worry muchabout this, as Canada was now more united in favour of britain than at any time within his knowledge.   Theattitude of the French-Canadians was largely due tothe influence which the Queen had exercised during theRoyal Visit to Canada in the previous year.Mr Bennett thought&apos; that, although president roosevelt would like to stand again, he would probably not do so, for the reason that the opposition to. him,due partly to prejudice against a third term, would be too strong.The Prime Minister said that Mr Bennett was mainly in touch with big business circles, and that what hesaid must therefore be to that extent discounted.   Hehad thought that many people would like Mr Cordell Hullas President.   This, the Prime Minister said, was to him a new idea, but Mr EDEN said that he had heard the samewhen he had been over in the States the previous year.The Prime Minister said that this idea would fillhim with alarm.   He added that Mr Bennett had said that. Mr Duff Cooper had done great harm in the States.Lord Lothian, he thought, was a trifle high-brow and rather over the heads of the people between theAlleghenys and the Pacific.The discussion then became rather general.   Itwas pointed out that there was very little in theUnited States papers showing sympathy with us.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that opinionwent up and down rapidly in the United States;   beforethe ADMIRAL GRAF SPEE episode our prestige had been low,but that affair had sent our prestige rocketing up, and now it was down again.   But no doubt it would soon riseagain.
Reference was also made to Mr Joe Kennedy, whowas said to have done us a good deal of harm in theStates and also to be indulging in a good deal ofgambling.   It had been reported in the papers that hewas shortly returning to this country.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that his information was that Mr Kennedy was to see his doctor early inFebruary with a view to settling whether or not it wasnecessary for him to have an operation before returning to his post.   (Thisrsounds as though this gentleman&apos;sfeet were still somewhat frigid!)A tribute was paid to Sir Gerald Campbell, our high Commissioner in Canada, who was said to be the bestrepresentative we had ever had on that side of the water.W.M.UO) 25th CONCLUSIONS.,27.1.40A short &quot;rota&quot; Meeting.

The master of the Rolls gave a very clear and effective account ofthe position.The fact that the whole of the crew of the STARFISHand UNDINE had been saved gave rise to some anxiety,since it is feared that the Germans may either have captured the submarines or be able to raise them.   Inthis case they would presumably obtain the secrets ofthe asdic.Minute 7. The First Lord, again demonstrates his extremesusceptibility to any business being transacted by theFinland. Chiefs of Staff.   He regards their activities as in someway interfering with the due responsibility of Ministers,.M.(40) 27th CONCLUSIONS.SO .1 .40 .Minute 2.West IndiesMinute 5.Propaganda.Discussion in regard to the publication of theReport of the Royal Commission on the West Indies showed a very strong disinclination on the part of the WarCabinet to agree to publication of the Report.   Therewas, however, no discussion as to the excuse whichshould be given in public for non-publication.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE mentioned that he had been approached by a friend of the Rev. W.H,Elliott who had represented him as a very influentialbroadcast speaker before the war, who was now very much concerned to use his influence with the public to sustain public opinion and so to help in the successful prosecution of the war.   He was, however, how allowedto broadcast only from Bristol, and was not allowed torefer to the war in his talks.The War Cabinet took note of this statement and invited the Minister of Information to look into thematter. This hardly        -g0-s eemed worth incorporation in the Minutes.
