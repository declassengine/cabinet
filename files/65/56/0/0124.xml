WoM. (40) 55rd CONCLUSIONS.Minute 1Command ofBritishLand Forcesin France.Minute 4.*A quiet day.   There was rather the atmosphere of   alull between more exciting times.The First Lord was very outspoken about the relation?between General Gamelin and General Georges.   He said thatGeneral Georges, in his opinion, was by far the better man of the two, and had been marked out as Gamelin&apos;s successor,and that the latter had been due for retirement.   He was now rather unsure of his position, and was fighting forrather petty points.    If it came to a show-down, he hadno doubt that Georges would win.   But Georges was a goodsoldier and would be loyal to his Chief.THE PRIME MINISTER raised the question of a statement on the German wireless with regard to the NELSON, which H.M.S.NELS0N. had been flatly denied.THE FDRST LORD said that the denial had been issuedby the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; without consultation with the Admiralty.The Prime Minister was obviously apprehensive lest anattempt was to be made to deny what had happened, and wasopenly relieved to hear that the First Lord had decided tostate the facts in a speech in the House that afternoon.Minute 8.Mr sumner welles.  &apos;Minute 11.Assistanceto Finland.There was some discussion as to whether Mr Sumner Welleshad. changed his plans and was leaving for Berlin instead of stopping longer in Rome and then proceeding to Paris.    Itwas generally agreed that the change in plan was an advant-age from our point of view.   The hope was also expressed that Mr Sumner Welles would not travel to and fro betweenthe belligerent Capitals.The Prime Minister seemed to me to feel real anxiety,about the position in Finland.   He was very strong on theline that we could not deal with all and every requestput forward without some considered view as to what formof help was really required, and what value it would be.Minute 1.The air situation.Mjnute 2iNavalituation.W.M. (40) 54th CONCLUSIONS88.2 .40,The Meeting was over at 12.15:    I think the shortestordinary Meeting of the War Cabinet yet held.The information received as to the number of german aircraft leaving on particular expeditions and returning to that country, comes from the &quot;Japanese source ofinformation&quot;.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF thought that the germans were quite right not to indulge in anti-aircraft fireagainst single British machines engaged on leaflet raidsover Germany.   He thought that we would adopt the samecours e.THE FIRST SEA LORD gave information as to the dateswhen our new capital ships would be completed.   He saidthat the First Lord had deliberately tried to create theimpression that our new capital ships would all be readyquite soon, whereas in point of fact only the KING GEORGEwould be available in the near future; i.e., she would bereceived in September and would be ready for battle inOctober.
The First Sea Lord said that the DUNKERQUE would beready quite soon, and, when asked what use would be madeof her, he thought the French would take great care tokeep her in a very safe place *The information contained in Mr Howard Smith&apos;telegram was as follows:(a) The Germans intended at a given moment to launch a gas attack against Great Britain,and,in order to secure a pretext for so doing,proposed first to drop a few gas bombs on German towns and to allege that this hadbeen done by British aircraft:(b) It was the intention of the German Governmentto forbid either the entry into, or the departure from, Germany by any foreignerafter the 1st April, 1940.   All foreignersin Germany had been told that they must decide by that date whether they wished toremain or to leave.^Minute 7.Germany:possible intentions.W.M. (40) 55th CONCLUSIONS29 .2 .40.This was expected to be a long and difficult day.Perhaps for that very reason it was the opposite.   Itwould very obviously have been a difficult day if steps had not been taken to deal with the situation in advance.Minute 1.Stoppage ofTraffic in norwegian territorial waters.MinUte 6.Assistanceto Finland.Minute 8.Mr sumner welles&apos;Visit.The P.M. told me the day before that he meant to start the proceedings with a statement of his own views,and that he had seen the First Lord before the meeting and explained to him the conclusion which he intended toreach.   As a result, Miriute 1, the proposals to lay aminefield in Norwegian territorial waters, was disposedof in about three-quarters of an hour, instead of lastingfor an hour and a half to two hours.Everyone felt that the Prime Minister had been inmagnificent form and had dealt with the matter withextraordinary skill.   He was like a schoolboy on thefirst day of the holidays, at the end of the Meeting.The First Lord behaved very well, but left beforethe end of the Meeting.   ? did he feel that there mightbe too much of a strain to be on his best behaviour fortoo long.After this, the rest of the Meeting was anti-climax.The discussion in regard to the Finnish Government&apos;s appeal is not altogether accurately represented in theMinutes.   Most of the Ministers present had got theimpression that it had been part of the plan that the appeal by Finland should be from the outset a public one.This Was not the ease (See W.P.(40) 59\ on which thePrime Minister&apos;s statement recorded in the confidential annex was based).   The Minutes were a bit doctored to getthis point right.   I went and saw Sir Alexander Cadogan,at his request, and we settled the terms of his telegram to Helsinki, and of the Cabinet Conclusion, together.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that Mr Sumner Welles&apos;sstatement that nothing much seemed to betoken a rapprochemjai.between Rome and Moscow, would surprise no-one excep
