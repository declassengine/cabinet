) lip;      ^   ^fwt- MOST SEORIST -W.M. (59) 55th CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Note,(gist October,! 1939.)*     o     eSIR ROGER REYES said that he had seen the king of the Belgians for two hours .   The King was most anxious to keep his country neutral and out of thewar.   He was therefore anxious to do nothing whichwould infringe its neutrality.   He took the view thatif Staff talks took place, the Germans were bound to get to hear about it.He also took the line^hat Belgium was nowstrongly armed, that the line of the Albert Canalwas a strong one which would hold up for some timeand would give time for our troops to advance.   he felt sure that we knew all about the Belgian positions.He knew that the French and the Germans had this inform-ation.   He felt that he must play the game, and he did not see how he could help us to get more informationHe had been terribly pestered by the French.   In theprevious two days nine different people had tried toget interviews with him.Ever since the occupation of the Rhineland, when there had been Staff Conversations with the French, the belgians had been treated by the French like a poorrelation.   This treatment had driven them into adeclaration of neutrality.The King knew of the talks that had taken place between General Gamelin and the Secretary of State forWar and the Minister without Portfolio.Sir Roger Keyes then said that the King had given him the Belgian point of view, and he would now giveours.   We had guaranteed that if Belgian neutralitywas violated by Germany, we would come to their help./   -     &apos; ;      -1* i    III
It was not fair to expect us to come headlong totheir help without proper pre-arrangements.   He had then spoken to the King on the lines which he had discussed with the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff.   He explained the information which we oughtto possess.    In reply to the King*s statement thatwe must already possess this information, he had said that we did not use spies in Belgium.The King was apparently astounded at the littleinformation that we had as to Belgian defences.It appeared that the King was not aware of theepisode in May last, when the Director of military intelligence had gone over to Belgium by invitation,5tB$ had been received in a most discourteous, manner and had been refused any information, notwithstanding the fact that he had gone over by pre-arrangement.Sir Roger Keyes said that he had then explainedour general plans, namely, that we could take upprobably could not advancebeyond, that point.Sir Roger had then asked what would happen ifBelgian neutrality wees infringed.   The King had said that this was a political question, and wouldnot give an answer.    In reply to another question,as to whether Antwerp meant nothing to-them, he letit be understood that if Holland was attacked that-would probably bring Belgium in.The King had then explained that he thought that24 hours at least would be taken before the Germansreached the first Belgian defences.   (He said thatthe Dutch were working very hard on inundations,but Sir Roger gained the impression that the king had tried to reach an agreement with Holland butthat the Dutch were unwilling to play.) The Belgians
would be able to hold out for at least another 24hours on the line of the Albert Canal, and at leastanother 24 hours on a new line further back.   Surelythis provided enough time to enable us to come upto their help.Sir Rober Keyes had explained that, while we were anxious to come to Belgium&apos;s help, it was up to the belgians to make it possible for us to do so.   Hethought it was perfectly easy for the Belgians toarrange to give us information without the Frenchor the Germans getting to hear of it. ^He had then mentioned a certain General CSvUrstp^ula^and had said that co-operation between him and our military Attache should be possible without anybodygetting to know of it.Sir Roger said that when hehad. mentioned this- iGeneral, the King&apos;s face had lit up, and although hehad not committed himself to the King, he was fairlyclear that action on the lines proposed would betaken.   Our Military Attache had come backto Londonbut was going back to Brussels at the beginning of next week, and he thought that a meeting could thenbe arranged.The King also gave information as to an importantGerman who had been sent to see him.   He thought thatthis German had tried at one time to frighten him and at the same time to persuade him to make an effort to get the war stopped.The King had hinted that he thought he might bein a better position to help us later on, but he didnot explain in what way.Sir Roger Keyes also gave certain information asto a talk with the Dowager Queen of the Belgians,and with her sister who was married to a Bavarian.
Most of the Belgian gold was out of the countryand the rest was near the frontier.   The arrangements in regard to oil and shipping were also satisfactory.The Belgians were determined to leave nothing behindthat would be of any use to Germany.The King had also mentioned that the Belgian army had only one blanket each, and that any help we could provide in this way would be much valued:.   They had40,000 tons of wool which they could not use.   could we not take the wool and provide blankets in return?. Sir Roger also said that the King thought thatour props.ganda was bad.   He did not think that ourpamphlets were of any value at the present stage,although they might be later on when Germany&apos;s foodrations, which were already very short, became shorterstill.   There was already a serious shortage of food for those who were not in the Army.   He also mentioned that young women were conscripted for working in factories and in the fields, and that the childrenwere put in ereches, where they were looked after by women of a low class.   There were also said to be large numbers of executions.   The sons of well-to-dopeople and those unfriendly to the regime had deliberate-ately been put in the forefront of the battle intPoland.   Nevertheless, in the ls.st few months Herr,   Hitler&apos;s position had been greatly strengthened,partly as the result of the successes in poland and partly on account or good propaganda.   The people were frightened of the Gestapo.   (This related particularly to the Bavarians, and every officer and man hadsworn an oath to Herr Hitler, and,it was thought,would keep it. )Richmond&quot;: Terrace, S.W.1,21st October, 1939 .
Since my return to England, I have told the Prime Minister andgeneral Ironside - Chief of the Imperial General Staff - of myinterview with Your Majesty.They most fully appreciate your difficulties and are determined to do nothing to add to them in any wa^, but as I told Your Majesty,they are anxious that you should understand their difficulties andanxieties.Being under an obligation to come to the assistance of Belgium,if her neutrality is violated by Germany, H.M. Government are ofcourse most anxious that British aid should be immediate and effective and in time to prevent German^ troops ravaging Belgium, as they didin the last war.As I am sure Your Majesty realises, from the information I gaveyou, the British Army in Prance is holding a sector of the french frontier, which is the best possible strategic position to enableSreat Britain to fulfil her guarantee to Belgium.The British Army,however, has another responsibility, i.e. toprevent a German army, which might advance through Belgium, crossing the French frontier and ravaging the country of her Ally, as was alsodone in the last war.Our General Staff is confident, that in the position which our army now occupies, it can defeat any German attack through Belgiumin the sectpr it now holds.Whether it will be able to provide the assistance the Belgian Army will look for, must depend on whether the British General staff is satisfied that it will find prepared positions^in Belgium, of sufficient strength to resist a German onslaught, and whether it canreach these positions in time, without running the risk of being attacked by mechanised, air assisted columns, in weak positions, oren route across unfavourable country.As I told Your Majesty, the Chief of the Imperial General Staffsays, it simply is not fair to ask him to leave an impregnableposition, which enables him to fulfil our obligation to our Ally,unless be is confident that in doing so, he will not jeopardise theBritish Army and its communications, and he must have more infor-mation than he possesses at present.
As I submitted to Your Majesty, if the British guarantee is to(9 invoked, it carries some pbii^,tibn on the part of the BelgianGeneral Staff to ppovide the British General Staff with the informationrequiredto make the guarantee effective.There can surely be no doubt&apos;&apos;^than/.(^rrBa^y will not hesitate toviolate Belgian neutrality, if her military position can be improved   .jby doing so - regardless of whether Belgium has, or has not, given herany pretext to claim that she has infringed her neutrality.      but mr Chamberlain realises that if Your Majesty agreed to Staff talksand Germany seized on that as a pretext for invading Belgium, it wouldmake your position impossibly difficult.I told the Prime Minister and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, that in order to avoid any risk of four Majesty&apos;s neutralitybeing compromised, I had proposed that Colonel Blake - our military attache in Brussels- might be given an opportunity of telling GeneralYanfeverstsaten confidentially, what information is considered essentialby our General Staff.General Ironside thought that this would be an admirable arrangementif Your Majesty would agree, and he asked me to give you his tofef humbleduty, and his word of honour,that any information thus obtained by colonel Blake would be treated as absolutely secret, would not pass through the diplomatic channels of the Embassy, and since it was aquestion of co-operation between the British and Belgian armies, itwould not be passed on to the French General Staff.I told $feaeral Ironside that I had suggested to Your Majesty, thatit might be possible for Colonel Blake - who is free to pass the french frontier - to give the information direct to the General S$affof theBritish Army in France and thus save time.However, General Ironside considered that it might be dangerous^ anicompromising, and in my presence he told Colonel Blake to communicate to him direct, any confidential information he might be given.I trust that Your Majesty will approve of this, for it is of vitalimportance that our General Staff should have further information andbe ready in every respect ^unhappily Belgium should be invaded by; Germany. ,
