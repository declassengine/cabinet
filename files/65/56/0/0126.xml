those who suspected Signor Mussolini of planning topromote a change of regime in Moscow, and of being, forthis purpose, willing to co-operate with Germany.   he also said that he understood that Mr. Sumber Welleswished to eschew social engagements during his visit,though he would no doubt wish to be received by the King.(N.B. The reason for the First Lord leavingbefore the end of the Meeting was thathe had to think out his speech to theLobby Correspondents that afternoon  a speech whieh, I am told, be did very well.   My suggested reason for hisleaving the Meeting was, therefore,not only malicious, but mistaken.)W.M. (40) 56th CONCLUSIONS. 1 .S .40 .The main course in this repast was intended to bethe Shipping situation.   The subject was originallyto have been taken a week earlier, but was postponedtwice, largely owing to the First Lord&apos;s insistence.The conclusions reached had been fully discussed between the Lord Privy Seal and the Prime Minister, andone or two Officials, before the Meeting.    In effect,the only dissentient from the view that the shipping situation was difficult was the First Lord.   As, however,he was prepared to agree that the matter should, be reviewed, although he took a more optimistic view ofthe situation, there was no particular difficulty in reaching agreement.The part of the Meeting which deals with theMinistry of Supply hypothesis is considerably toned down.Actually what happened was that everyone who had readhis Papers was quite convinced, that the Ministry ofSupply were asking for an import programme of 30.6 million!tons a year.   This, of course, was a terrific bombshell,   jand was recognised as such.   Everyone was amazed whenthe Minister of Supply said that the Department meantnothing of the kind.The Chancellor of the Exchequer put the Ministerof Supply through a fairly gruelling cross-examination.The Minister was then sent out of the room to speak t&amp; his Department and make quite sure that thestatement which he made was correct - rather an infradig, proceeding which was not recorded in the Minutes.(Before taking the Shipping Papers, however, he Foreign Secretary made a, statement inregard to Finland.   Indeed.&quot;M. Corbin wascloseted with the P^M. and,Lord Halifax whenMinisters arrived at the House of Commons.The result was to make a very long Meeting.)W.M. (40) *7t.h nOMCLUSIONS. 1.5.40. 6 .5Q paiThis second Meeting was summoned at about 40minutes notice, to deal with the latest developments in the Finnish situation.   As the Meeting was summonedat such short notice, the Prime Minister, who had gone to Chequers, could not attend.
