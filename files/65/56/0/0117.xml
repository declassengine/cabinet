W.M. (40) 44th CONCLUSIONS.Minute 2,I S.S.ALTMARK.Minute 5.Assistanceto Finland:NewspaperArticle.A joyous Meeting, made memorable by the FirstLord&apos;s obvious glee in describing the ALTMARK episode.This was Mr Hore-Bel&quot;isha* s article in the &quot;news of the World&quot;. Very strong feelings were expressed bythe Ministers present at the ex-Seeretary of State forWar&apos;s conduct in writing this article.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusion on the subject wasvery quickly overridden by events.   The ex-Secretary ofState for War would not accept the re-draft of hisarticle prepared by the Foreign Office and said that hewould not agree to the article being published at allunless it could be published in its integrity.    In theevent, however, the article was published as originallywritten, with two gaps, which, from one point of view,made the worst of both worlds.   At the time of thedecision to stop publication of the whole article, itwas known to the powers-that-be that the whole articlehad been published in Australia.W.M. (40) 45th CONCLUSIONS.      Sunday T 18.2.40Minute 1.Assistanceto Finland.. This Meeting was arranged on Sunday at short notice as a result of the French authorities beinganxious for immediate action to be taken in regardto the project for assistance to Finland.Minute 3.S candinavia.The First Lord tried some rush tactics, and asked the War Cabinet to agree forthwith to action being takento stop traffic in Norwegian territorial waters.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs wasnot having any.Minute 2.H .M .S .DARING.W.M. (40) 46th CONCLUSIONS.19 .2 .40.The First Lord reported the loss of the DestroyerDARING.   He had, I think, known of this the previous daybut had kept it back.   When the First Lord said thatthe news waS being given out shortly, the Prime MiniSberremarked, somewhat caustically, that the news was onthe tape now.Minute 1.Man Power.W.M. (40) 47th CONCLUSIONS.20 .2 .40 .Another Civil-day.   The proposal that the Ministryof Labour should be induced to produce some statisticsto show what is happening in the man-power field went through very happily.   There had been a certain amountof preparation for this beforehand.In regard to training, the Departments still takethe view that it is impossible to carry out training to convert semi-skilled men into skilled men in our Govern-ment establishments.   They also take the view that the
mpres ent arrangements ensure that too many, young men whoare eminently suitable for our large industrial programme are not taken into the Army.   X am bound to say thatpersonally I still cherish grave doubts on this fide ofour programme, and think that before many months areout we shall be pulling men back from the Army.W.M. (40) 48th CONCLUSIONS .       81.2 .40 .On several occasions in the last year or so theForeign Secretary has tried to get some central bodyestablished to deal with demands for   the supply ofmunitions, material, etc., by our Allies or potentialAllies.   These schemes always come a bit unstuck, withthe result that the determination of the three defence departments is to keep these matters in their own hands.The present case is no exception, and the scheme whichwas authorised amounts to not very much more than aglorified Information Bureau   a much smaller schemethan was originally put forward.The account given by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs of his visit to Egypt contained a reference to the Egyptian Prime Minister and. the king of Egypt, whom he referred to as two unsatisfactoryfeatures.   The Egyptian Prime Minister was not a person who had any particular support, but he was deliveringthe goods.   According to Sir Miles Lampson, the King ofEgypt was fast becoming one of the problems of Easternpolitics.   He was very popular, and a difficult situation might arise in regard to him at any time.W.M. (40) 49th CONCLUSIONS. 22.2 .40.The First Lord of the Admiralty was rather delightedat the success of his attempt to prevent the S.S. WAHEHEfrom scuttling herself.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat one explanation of the publicity given to thismatter might be that he had sent a letter a few days agoto Mr Gibson, of the Finnish Aid Bureau.   This had followed a visit which Lord Nuffield had made, offering a gift of  100,000 towards the total of half a million which the Finnish Aid Bureau were endeavouring to raise.Lord Nuffield had asked that the gift should not be made   public, as otherwise the remaining 5400,000 would not beraised.   The Foreign Secretary had therefore written toMr Gibson to say that there was no objection to publicity Ifrom the political point of view.   This might have beentaken by the Finnish Aid Bureau as a general sanction for publicity.The message which the Secretary of State for ForeigriAffairs said that he had received from Sir Percy Loraine   iwent into rather more detail than is recorded in theMinutes.   Sir Percy had apparently said that he couldnot exclude the possibility of Signor Mussolini bringingItaly into the war on the side of Germany, though he didnot think it probable.   He would not exclude the possi-bility of internal trouble which might give the Germansan excuse for entering the country.   The Foreign Seeretarjsaid that he imagined that this eventuality would not be altogether unwelcome to the French and ourselves.
