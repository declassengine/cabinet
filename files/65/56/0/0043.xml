When the PrimeMinister had asked on what day he should broadcastand had put himself in4the B.B.C*s hands and had offered to broadcast on Wednesday, they had said thatthey thought Sunday was the best day and would obtainthe largest number of listeners.W.M.

(59) 97th CONCLUSIONS.       28.11.59 .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR referredxto a letterhe had received from the Foreign Secretary relating toa story that&apos;the Germans had a new shell containingliquid oxygen which would penetrate concrete.   This&quot;./fairy-tale came out of a letter from a German to hiscousin.Nobody took this story very seriously.   THE PRIMEMINISTER likened it to the stories at one time fashion-able, describing some new and potent invention derivingits power from electricity.During the FOREIGN SECRETARY&apos;s tour d*hprizonhe stated that M. Wallenberg, the deputy leader ofthe Swedish Trade Delegation now in London, hadvolunteered the observation, in the course of a conversation the previous day, that it would fes onthe whole be better for the future peace of Europe if russia and Germany had a common frontier.   If,&apos; afterthe war, we found ourselves under the necessity of re-creating a separate Poland, we ought not, M.Wallen-berg had suggested, to do anything to spread thedelusion that Poland could be a Great Power.   At themost Poland ought to be a neutral State on the Swissmodel.   The Foreign Secretary seemed anxious that weshould not exclude the possibility of some common frontier between Germany and Russia..   -9-
PHOTOGRAPH OP        This was referred to &quot;off the record&quot; at theTHE CABINET.Meeting of the War Cabinet on the 28th November.THE PRIME MINISTER apologised for troubling hiscolleagues with this matter, and said it was onewhich he could not settle without inviting theiropinion.   He said that Lord Kemsley&apos; s proposal was somewhat repugnant to his taste.The general view of the War Cabinet was thatthe proposal in question,   in form at any rate, wasa concession to a particular newspaper, and that,having regard to the jealousies between the news-papers at the present time, it was undesirable thatan exclusive right to the use of an autographedphotograph of the War Cabinet should be conceded toa particular newspaper.    It was suggested that thePrime Minister might send a letter to Lord Kerns leywhich the Fund could use.
Minute 152*United StatesEffect ofRestrictionof Importsfrom.It was pointed out, however, that there-was a longhistory of bad feeling between Sweden and Poland, andthat this was probably illustrated by Mo Wallenberg&apos;remarks.One of the remarks by Mr.Kennedy which theChancellor of the Exchequer quoted was that it mightbe better for us tO&apos;reach a moderate settlement inregard to trade restrictions with the United States,which would mean that we should have to call upon theUnited States for direct financial help after 11 monthsrather than that we should impose more drastic restriction-tions which would mean that we could hold out for a longer period without calling for financial help from america.   The moral to be drawn was that Americanwillingness to help might be more important to usthan the precise period in which we could conduct thewar without such help.W.M.(59) 98th CONCLUSIONS.E.E.B. absent at funeral.29 sll .59GERMANY.probable intentions.!.(59) 99th CONCLUSIONS.50.11 .59.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY gave a certain amount ofinformation under the heading &quot;Germany - probable intentions&quot; which amplified the information given atthe 98th Meeting, Minute 10 (Confidential Annex).According to a secret source, there was at present no intention of invading Holland and Belgium^ butit was hoped to carry out an occupation bloodlessly.An invasion had been abandoned on political grounds.In the period 20th-25th November there had been talk of no large-scale attack in the West or elsewhere, and considerable hopes were being placed on a peace offensive, in which it was hoped that Italy would actas mediator.W.M. (59) 100th CONCLUSIONS.Nothing special to record.I q12 o59 eMinute 7.Belgium.Pursuit ofGerman Air-craft.W.M. (59) 101 s t CQNOLUSjmS,.There was some discussion on the question whethepursuit of enemy aircraft over neutral air was analogoto the doctrine of &quot;hot pursuit&quot;, under which warshipscould pursue ah enemy into neutral territorial watersin order to prevent escape.     It was suggestedtthat the theory underlying the inviolability of neutral terri-torial waters was. that&apos; the neutral Power could maintain this inviolability against belligerent ships.   In thelast War we had exercised the-right to pursue theDRESDEN into territorial waters on the grounds that the site of the action was in a remote part where theneutral Power in question was not able to exerciseeffective control over its territorial waters.
