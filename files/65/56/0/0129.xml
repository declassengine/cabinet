. W.M. (40) 58th CONCLUSIONS. 2.3.40.Minute; 2. This was the first time that shipping had been... attacked by Aircraft on the South Coast.   The First1/    Air Attacks   Lord topk a very serious view of the situation, andon Shipping, seemed anxious to Stir up the R.A.F.There followed a discussion on interceptionmethods, in the course of which the First Lord saidthat he thought the evacuation of Bawdsey to Dundeehad resulted in a setback of scientific investigations.The suggestion that Sir Henry Tizard should come and give the War Cabinet information on this subject met with general approval, but the Chancellor of theExchequer said that he would like to consult the PrimeMinister before this was arranged.Minutes 5 &amp; 4. In regard, to Finland, the main point which emergedwas perhaps the general feeling that it was not theFinland. military situation which was so dangerous as the atti-tude of the Finnish Government.   It seemed clear thatthe Finnish Government were having strong pressure put upon them by the Swedish Government to make peace, so&apos; as to avoid Scandinavia as a whole becoming involved, inthe war.The view was also expressed that the finnish government&apos;s demands on us looked rather like a manoeuvrebefore a surrender - an attitude which, it was felt,Field-Marshal Mannerheim almost certainly did not share.The First Lord thought that we ought to try and get something out of the parlous situation.   He revertedto the argument that he would like to see the Finnsretiring to the head of the Guif and meeting our troopsthereabouts.   He said several times that we ought toget our foot into the door.interception of aircraft at night.W.M. (40) 59th CONCLUSIONS.4 .3 .40 oAssistanceto Finland.Minute 1.The air situation.A very quiet day.   The main item was Finland once more.   The general opinion is now definitely turningto the view that it will be impossible to get theNorwegian and Swedish Governments to agree to our sendingtroops through to help Finland.   Perhaps the mostimportant point which emerged was that none of the actions hitherto taken by the Finnish Government con-stituted the appeal to us and to the French, and to theNorwegian and Swedish Governments, which formed part ofthe plan.Failing any assurance that this appeal would everbe made, the War Cabinet were naturally indisposed toconsider sending further aeroplanes to Finland.The rest of the Meeting was relatively small beer.The significance of a bomber capable of crossingthis country at 35,000 ft. is that it would be out ofrange of R.D.F. and would be able to carry out attacksoh the West coast with a good chance of not being inter-cepted.   Endeavours are being made to develop R.D.F. tobe effective at these heights.
Minute 2.S.S.DOMALA.4. ^^^e rirf * Lord is 8till a good deal distres.Nothing else of any importance to record.Minute. 1.Coal Situa-tion.Minute 2.Diversion ofShipping.Minute 5.Air Situa-tion.W.M. (40)  60th CONCLUSIONS.5.4.40 .lightsRather a long Meeting, but no particular highThis item took longer than it ought to have done,considering that it was merely a statement of what hadbeen done and calling for no decision.   One or twostatements were made, e.g., by the Lord Privy Seal, which resulted in other Ministers wishing to have their say.There was some back-chat on small points; e.g., that400 wagons of coal had arrived at the London power company&apos;s depot at Willesden and they had only been ableto unload 40 wagons a day.The First Lord was heard, before the Meeting, tosay, rather ominously, that he had enough material to talk for an hour.   He proceeded, when he got going, to deliver a forthright attack on the position, and expressedthe strong dissatisfaction of the Naval Staff with thepresent position, said that the Minister of transport had not got enough power, and that all he could do wasto consult, review and discuss.   He also proceeded togive a long list of instances in which there had beendelay in unloading, which the Port and Transit Committeehad apparently not been able to remedy.A good deal of this was, I think, the work ofWinston&apos;s &quot;circus&quot;.   I had been at a meeting under theChairmanship of H.J. at the Treasury the previous day to deal with the Shipping position.   To our amazementwe found there Professor Lindemann, who had proceeded to be closeted with the Minister of Transport&apos;s repre-sentatives - apparently an attempt to settle the hareswhich Winston had put up on this diversion of shippingaffair.All this took a good deal of time, but the PrimeMinister quietened things down by a suggestion that as anumber of Departments were concerned, the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence should superintend the necessaryplans, and preparations.Winston had another;innings (not recorded in theMinutes) in connection with the statement made by theSecretary of State for Air that the aerodrome at Borkumhad been seen to be lit up, but on our aircraft flyinglow the lights had been extinguished.   This was a signalfor a discussion on whether arrangements could net bemade for switching off lights instantaneously in thiscountry in the event of an air raid.The Minister of Home Security said that masterswitches for lights existed in this country for all important activities, such as marshalling yards, butthat the provision of master switches for street lightingthroughout the country would be a very expensive business.
