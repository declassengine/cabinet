minute 7.Western FrontEvents of14th/l5thJanuary, 1940In this connection THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTYdrew attention to plans concerted by the French with theItalians some five years ago for the despatch of troops to co-operate with the Italians in the defence of the brenner Pass. -At the end of the Meeting, THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he would shortly be circulafc-ing a note of a conversation which he had had with sir Roger Keyes.   The main point was that the latter hadbeen quite explicit that when the King of the Belgianssent his message to him enquiring as to guarantees andconditions in connection with the possible entry ofAllied troops into Belgium, the King had never had it inhis mind to invite our troops in before the Germans had actually invaded Belgian territory.   Sir Roger Keyes had hoped that, as the Belgians were that week-end fullyanticipating an immediate German invasion, he might beable to persuade the King to persuade his Government to invite us in; but that was another matter.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY, to whom the message had come on the 14th January, said that he entirely agreed with this account.W.M.(40) 50th CONCLUSIONS.23 .2 .40 .Minute 1. &quot;Stoppage ofTraffic in .NorwegianTerritorialWaters.Owing to the celebration to the crews of the EXETERand AJAX, the Meeting was not held until the afternoon.It was timed for 3.SO, when we were given to believetha.t the Guildhall Luncheon would be over and the revellersreturned.. So they all had, with the exception of theFirst Lord, at 3.37;   but we did not get started until4 o&apos; clock.   The intervening time was occupied by thePrime Minister discussing the situation with Sir john simon and Lord Halifax, and it was clear that he wasfeeling some difficulty in the matter.Just as the Meeting started, the Prime minister asked that the Minister of Economic Warfarejshould be summoned.   He had. not been given notice of the Meeting,and there was a certain amount of going to and fro while I told him in the Private Secretary&apos;s room what the meeting was about and the points he was expected to answer.The Minister was somewhat taken aback at being asked to answer such questions off-hand, and sent for his expert,Mr Morton.Generally the discussion was a little difficult, andI felt that the Meeting had not been adequately preparedfor.U.S .S.R.The intervention by the Deputy Chief of the naval staff as regards the argument which would be the bestargument to use from the point of view of internationallaw and practice, was one of the most effective interven-tions that i have ever heard.   Everyone agreed that itput the point of view clearly, neatly, and most convincing-Minute 2 (U.S.8.R.) took place in the discussion as an enclave in Minute 1, and was extracted to a separateitem in the discussion.The rest of the Meeting went very quickly.
