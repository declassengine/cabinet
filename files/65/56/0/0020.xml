President Roogevelt*g,,otoy^gft ftWftlfifr..THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS readtwo unnumbered telegrams which bad been sent to lord lothian to carry out the decision reached by the Warimpression at the War Cabinet had been that president roosevelt was determined to go ahead, more or less irres-pective of what we said.   On the other hand, the impressionmade by the correspondence on three minds in the ForeignOffice independently^had been that our original reply hadconsiderably shaken President Roosevelt, and that ourfurther reply might dissuade him from the suggestionaltogether.Roosevelt would appreciate that if he persisted with his proposal, the responsibility for saving Finland would rest with him.It was generally agreed that the telegrams whichhad been despatched struck exactly the right note*Some fear was expressed that Finland mightcollapse before the middle of March, and the question was asked whether we should be ready to start earlier.Secretary to a, -eritical period not later than; the .third;,week In March,had been so drafted because he was afraid that the Finns might launch their appeal too soon.   It wasvery desirable to hold off President Roosevelt as longas possible.:.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought Presidentft &apos;Was- explained ;that the reference in para,.-?&apos; of&apos;the first unnumbered telegram read out by the ForeignRichmond Terrace, S.w.1Gth February 4 1940*

February 7th, 1940.Unnumbered.SECRET.Your telegram No. 160.Following from Prime Minister.I am very grateful to the President for givingsympathetic consideration to the points which you, on my instructions, put to him, and gratified to note that insome cases at least he is disposed to recognise their force.2.    In order that he may he fully acquainted with the inner movements here and thus have before him all possible repercussions of the action he has in mind, I feel that ought to tell him in confidence the upshot of ourconsultation with the French Government on February 5th.3.   We found them, as we are indeed ourselves, deeplyconcerned over the Finnish situation.   All reports show thatthere must be a limit to Finnish resistance, which mustcrumble sooner or later in default of substantial help.It will not be sufficient merely to send the Finns what wecan spare in the matter of war material.    It will probablybe necessary to fight at their side.k.   The complete overthrow of Finland would arouse inFrance and this country the most intense feelings ofindignation and raj^p and it is almost certain that, howeverunjustly, these feelings would express themselves in anindictment of the Allies for having betrayed the cause forwhich we took up arms.   All this apart from the material factthat the conguest of Finland wouldmean the practicalsubjugation of Scandinavia to Germany and Sussia.
I    2. ? &apos;5*   Our principal difficulty is that we cannot renderdirect and substantial assistance to Finland without; norwegian and Swedish co-operation or at least consento   At the presenttime Norway and Sweden hesitate to take any action whichexposes them to the joint or several threat from the soviet and Germany.   Though they might welcome our assistance againstthe Soviet threat to Finland and Northern Scandinavia they would naturally ask us how we could guarantee them against a Germanthreat to Southern Scandinavia if that should result from our action.6.   The French and we agreed that the most practical plan for saving Finland would be the immediate preparation of aFranco-British expeditionary force to go to the assistance off inland across Northern Scandinavia.   At the same time we should prepare another force with which we could assist Norway and sweden if the German threat against the South should materialise,though we ourselves are doubtful whether in fact the germans would care so to extend their liabilities.7*   We anticipate that when the critical period approaches,probably not later than the third week in March, Finland wouldbe likely to send out a last appeal to save her from destruction.We and France would then ask the Scandinavian countries to give us the necessary facilities for the passage of our forces andwe should hope to obtain their consent if we could show themthat we had sufficient means at hand to save Finland and to give them reasonable protection.   We are therefore pressing on withour preparations with all speed.8.   The President will understand that this is a most highly confidential communication, and that he is entrusted witha secret that has been divulged to no one
9.   At the same time he will perceive our anxiety lest  &apos;&apos;the action he proposes to take should interfere with the successof this plan.   What we fear is that if the Governments of norway and Sweden get the idea that some sort of peace negotiations are likely to he set; on foot they will refuse the facilitieswe want in order to save Finland and will excuse themselves onthe ground that Finland will no doubt he looked after in thecoming negotiations and that, if they should fail and Finlandhe destroyed, the responsibility will not be theirs.   It was this contingency which I had in mind in my allusion to Finlandin my earlier telegram No. 173.10.   You may show this telegram to the President and leave him a copy*
Cypher telegram to Lord Lothian (Washington)7th February, 19h0.Unnumbered.secret my immediately preceding telegnam.1*     We have now put frankly and fhlly to the President ouranxiety concerning the effect which his proposal might have onour plans for saving Finland,,     We could not put this tohim before the recent Paris meeting, at which we learned howstrongly the   French Government shared our views,2.       This is a strong reason, additional to those mentioned in my telegrams Nos. 172 and 173, why we hope thePresident will not pursue his plan,3,     I leave it to you to judge how faryou can go in dis-suading him from it.     If he is determined in any event to sendMr. Sumner Welles on a mission, I do hope that he may notthink it necessary to make public announcement on the subject.If he must make public announcement, I hope at least it wouldnot be in any form that would encourage the idea that mission was part of a peace plan,h.     Incidentally, it may be rather unfortunate that Romeshould be the first item on Mr, Welles&apos; itinerary, as that may give rise to the impression that the President is acting in concert with the Vatican^ - a development that has been expected in some quarters,     There may be good reasons whyMr, Welles should go to Rome first.     But I am sure it wouldbe better if that could b e avoided.
