The First1/    Air Attacks   Lord topk a very serious view of the situation, andon Shipping, seemed anxious to Stir up the R.A.F.There followed a discussion on interceptionmethods, in the course of which the First Lord saidthat he thought the evacuation of Bawdsey to Dundeehad resulted in a setback of scientific investigations.The suggestion that Sir Henry Tizard should come and give the War Cabinet information on this subject met with general approval, but the Chancellor of theExchequer said that he would like to consult the PrimeMinister before this was arranged.Minutes 5 &amp; 4. In regard, to Finland, the main point which emergedwas perhaps the general feeling that it was not theFinland. military situation which was so dangerous as the atti-tude of the Finnish Government.   It seemed clear thatthe Finnish Government were having strong pressure put upon them by the Swedish Government to make peace, so&apos; as to avoid Scandinavia as a whole becoming involved, inthe war.The view was also expressed that the finnish government&apos;s demands on us looked rather like a manoeuvrebefore a surrender - an attitude which, it was felt,Field-Marshal Mannerheim almost certainly did not share.The First Lord thought that we ought to try and get something out of the parlous situation.   He revertedto the argument that he would like to see the Finnsretiring to the head of the Guif and meeting our troopsthereabouts.   He said several times that we ought toget our foot into the door.interception of aircraft at night.W.M. (40) 59th CONCLUSIONS.4 .3 .40 oAssistanceto Finland.Minute 1.The air situation.A very quiet day.   The main item was Finland once more.   The general opinion is now definitely turningto the view that it will be impossible to get theNorwegian and Swedish Governments to agree to our sendingtroops through to help Finland.   Perhaps the mostimportant point which emerged was that none of the actions hitherto taken by the Finnish Government con-stituted the appeal to us and to the French, and to theNorwegian and Swedish Governments, which formed part ofthe plan.Failing any assurance that this appeal would everbe made, the War Cabinet were naturally indisposed toconsider sending further aeroplanes to Finland.The rest of the Meeting was relatively small beer.The significance of a bomber capable of crossingthis country at 35,000 ft. is that it would be out ofrange of R.D.F. and would be able to carry out attacksoh the West coast with a good chance of not being inter-cepted.   Endeavours are being made to develop R.D.F. tobe effective at these heights.
