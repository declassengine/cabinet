- MOST SECRET -MO CIRCULATION.W.M.(59)  72 nd CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex.THE FOREIC-N SECRETARY referred again to theproposed reply to be sent to the approach made by theterms of the declaration which had been imparted to us(Annex &quot;A&quot;).   He also referred to the telegram whichhad been received on Friday, and to the reply which hadbeen sent thereto    (Annexes  &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;) .     He then read, out the proposed draft reply which he suggested should be sent.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that hisown mind was fairly clear as to the general lines onwhich this matter should be hs.nd.led.    It was, of course,impossible to know just how much this approach was worth,although he thought it was more substantial than thosewhich had preceded it.    He had an impression that a. gooddeal in our favour was going on in Germany.   The conclusions-sion he drew from this was that we should, not be toohasty or impetuous in playing our hands, and that things were disposed to cone our way.On the other hand, we must be careful to do nothing to discourage this fissiparous tendency.    If our main purpose was to see the extinction of the Nazi regime,this  could only be done from within.    It would thereforebe moat unwise not to use this opportunity, providedthat it could, be so handled, as not to land us in diffi-culties, more particularly with the French.The Foreign Secretary then vent through&apos;the draft reply, in which he had taken into account the criticismsHe rea.d out tothe Cabinet the precise-1-
made when this matter had been discussed on it would be noted that the first three ps.ragraphsdid not say flat-footedly that we would, not on any terms negotiate with Herr Hitler.   He thought it would,be unwise to say so in so many words at the presenttime.    It had been suggested, to him that the fourthparagraph, as drafted, might be a little awkward whenthe time came to show it to M. Daladier.   He referredto the expression that we had. no desire to snmsh Germany.He thought that this had better be re-worded.THE FIRST LORD suggested re-wording to the effectthat we should never contemplate a Europe in whichG-ermany would not play a conspicuous, due or worthypart as a great- anc1 respected nation, but that wein the last few years.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO referred to variousapproaches vhich had been ms.de in the last war, and said that his impression had. been that we had alwaysmanaged, to secure the permission of our French alliesbefore entering into discussions.It was pointed, out, however, that these approacheswere approaches from duly accredited Governments.At the present time we were only concerned with satis-fying ourselves that the approach came from someonewho was in a position to &quot;deliver the goods&quot;.    It wasonly when we had satisfied ourselves on thai point that it would be a question of informing the French.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when he saw M.Daladierwhen he next went, to France, he would, tell him what had.happened, but would put nothing on paper.General agreement was expressed with this view.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that a member of oneof the French Security Services had recently said to a-&amp; ter what had occurred-2
member of our of our Services in Paris, &quot;Vous avezsans doute votre conversations avee la. Bocae, commenous&quot;.Subject to one or two minor amendments thedraft reply was agreed to.Richmond Terrace, S .W.1,6th November, 1939.
