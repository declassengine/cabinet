f!THE FOREIGN SECRETARY drew attention to thestatement published in the Press that morning as  to the message which the Gestapo had sent to us on the wirelessset which it was  alleged that we had handed over to .ouragent of the Gestapo. ^- /&quot;   &quot; /&quot;CL. (L^JK-ttThe Foreign Secretary said, that we had made nocounter statement,  and. that our Press had, on the whole,. been very satisfactory..It was difficult to know whether we had beendouble-crossed all through, and whether they unmasked theaffair because they wanted to link it up with Munich.Another possibility was that the Germans thought thatwas the head, of some sort of conversations,ana had laid a plot to kidnap him.The Foreign Secretary said that he was asking theUnited States authorities  to approach the German Governmentwith a view to ensuring that were asdecently treated as  could be expected.Some reference was made to Herr Dahlerus.    THEc    . j  a     FOREIGN SECRETARY said that his activities   continued,  and^-p^vUx-ih^   that he occasionally sent messages  to     a^vv&apos;ynKers , mostlyof a very vague and muddled  character.Reverting to the Venloo affair,  the Foreign Secretary    &apos;said, that Snoop had known all about the matter.    He had since learnt that had talked about the affairrather freely at The Hague.    The wireless set and the simple cypher had been given to two German Colonels;  theyhad. appeared very haggard and strained, a.ndhad. had no doubt of their genuineness .Information had also been received from Swedenthat there was open talk of the German Generals  deposingHerr Hitler.    It was  generally agreed that there could beno doubt that there had been forces at work which had prevented a German attack in the West in October, and thatthe Germans would have to do a lot of inventing to linktogether the Venloo and Munich episodes.    The trial,  ifstaged, would be the laughing-stock of Europe.R
