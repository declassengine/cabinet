minute 2,The naval situation.Minute 5.Belgium.The report recorded by the FIRST LORD OF THEADMIRALTY was that a total of 30 German Submarines hadbeen lost, were overdue or had been badly damaged.The report said to have been submitted to Herr hitler was that 24 German submarines had been lost, 3 werenot less than five days overdue, and 3 not less thaneight days overdue, and 3 badly damaged.The First Lord said that the Gulf of Bosnia wasfreezing up nicely.   This meant that the question-whetherthe Germans were to be allowed to receive iron ore viaNarvik would become a matter of great importance.   he hoped to submit a Paper on this matter in the next fewdays.Reference was made to the THETIS.   The First Lordsaid that the THETIS was now in dock at Holyhead.Arrangements had been made for officials to carry outthe necessary technical examination, after which the inquiry into the loss oft the THETIS would be resumed.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thatour Military Attache&apos; at Brussels, who had inspected theWavre-Namur line, had found no work at all going on.Asked whether he thought that, notwithstanding the factthat this part of the line had not been fortified,General Gamelin intended, if opportunity offered, to advance up to it, he answered in the affirmative.WeM.(59) 82nd CONCLUSIONS.14 .11 ,39 .Minute 5.The netherlands and Belgium.Minute 6.Air Policy.In connection with this discussion, THE foreign secretary, in the course of the reference to a eonversa-tion which he had had on the previous evening with theNetherlands Minister, said that the President of theUnited States of America had conveyed to the GermanGovernment a statement that the violation of Dutchneutrality would exercise a violent and possiblyunforeseen influence on American policy.    It was thoughtthat this statement had had a marked effect.The discussion left the impression that there may perhaps still be some misunderstanding as to the casulties likely to be incurred if an attack iscarried out on military objectives in the Ruhr.   Therate of casualties recorded in the Minutes as anticipated!are not total casualties expected over the whole opera-tion, but casualties in respect of machines engaged:i.e., they represent the rate of casualties which wouldbe sustained on each raid.Towards the end of the discussion the point was emphasised by the FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY and oneor two other Ministers, that in our conversations withthe French it was important that we should not appear:to go to them with undecided views, but should makepl^in that in the British Government&apos;s view the operation in question should be carried out in the event of a land Ibattle developing in Belgium which looked like beingdecisive. ;W.M. (59) 81a t CONCLUSIONS v. 15 ,11.89-.
