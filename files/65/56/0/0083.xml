It had been arranged tohave the Meeting at 3 in the afternoon, to enable lord halifax to stay in Yorkshire until Monday morning.He had, however, owing to the threat of attack OnHolland and Belgium, returned on Sunday,reaching london on Sunday night.Likewise, the Agenda had been fixed; before the threat to the Low Countries became acute. nevertheless we proceeded with the business arranged, the piece deresistance, being the discussion on Air Strengths, ona Paper prepared by the Secretary of Statefor Air on various points raised by the First Lord of * the Admiral tyftwo months before.   Indeed, the First Lord had enquiredtenderly after this Paper on several occasions in the intervening period.At least an hour and a half was spent in diseussingthe Paper on Air Strengths, and it was then agreed torefer further discussion to the Military Co-co-ordination committee.   This Committee is becoming a positive menace!Everything is referred to it which the First Lord wouldlike to discuss in further detail, and this includes agreat many matters affecting both the Air Ministry andthe War Office.   The Secretary of State for Air remarkedin a caressing tone (which did not disguise the possibleexistence of claws) that when the M.C.C. had finisheddiscussing the War Office and the Air Ministry, no doubtit would be pleasant to have a discussion on that committee into how the Admiralty were managing their affairs.The discussion on Military Policy in the MiddleEas(t was useful in that it stopped two rather foolishideas:   one, the formation of a Native Division in kenya, and the other a proposal to build up supplycapacity in Palestine:   the former suggestion havingbeen favoured by the First Lord of the Admiralty, andthe second by the former Secretary of State for War.For the rest, the discussion on Middle East policy was rather unsatisfactory, because, while it was agreedthat we ought to get ahead with preparations in theMiddle East, nobody had the least idea of how much allthese preparations would cost, or, indeed, what was involved.   It is one of the weaknesses of our system that until you have got a decision in favour of policy,the Departments are not allowed to spend money ondetailed planning.   The result is that when you arediscussing the policy in terms of policy, nobody knowswhat it involves in terms of bricks and mortar - pounds,shillings and pence.There was nothing much else of importance at theMeeting.   The discussion on the Western Front, recorded in the Confidential Annex, was very tame.   The PrimeMinister&apos;s conviction, (a) that the whole affair of the,-discovery of the German plan sounded fishy, and (b) thatjthere was not the slightest chance of Belgium invitingus into their country until they were absolutely certainfof invasion, had gained ground.f-j_
