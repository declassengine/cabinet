1,200 pieces of artillery.   The rifles from america had been distributed.   We also had large numbers of tanks, both heavy - and&apos;-light, and armoured cars, and our aircraft and aircraft factories were protected.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether the aerodromes at St. Athans and Stormy Down were properly protected.THE PRIME MINISTER said that as regards our Generalshe thought very highly of Auchinlech, and also of Brooke,who had been in charge of a Corps in what had perhapsbeen the crucial battle in Flanders which had resultedin our saving the B.E.F.   Gort was now Inspector-Generalof Training.   He would be invaluable as C,-in-C.Irelandif the need arose, or to lead a force on the Continent.W.M. (40) 206th COWOLTTSTpftTS. 17.7.40.The discussion on Aliens lasted a full hour, andis much boiled down in the Minutes.There was a good deal of discussion about personnel for the Committee which was not recorded.W.M. (40) 207th CONCLUSIONS. 18.7.40.This looked like a long Meeting, but the P.M. haddetermined to take things with a rush, and it was verydifficult to get various Ministers into the room in time before the item for which they were attending was over.It was agreed that, while we must not carry outwarlike operations against oil supplies in unoccupied france, there was no objection to carrying out sabotageactivities, suitably camouflaged.At the end of the Meeting there was a good deal ofdiscussion by the War Cabinet alone.THE PRIME MINISTER invited the Lord Privy Seal&apos;attention to a case, reported in the Press, of a man whohad refused to plead as a conscientious objector atsome military tribunal, and the Ministry of Labour had put in an appearance for him and pleaded his case.The Prime Minister thought this was a little unnecessary,and invited the Lord Privy Seal to enquire into thematter.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on his trip theprevious day he had seen several Generals - Brooke,Auchinleck and Mart ell.   They had all impressed himvery much.   He thought that, although General Ironsidehad done very good work in the last month and could notbe said to have let the country down, nevertheless itwould be right to appoint another man in his place.&quot;He thought that he should be offered India, and he would get a baton as a Field-Marshal.   Brooke should beCommander-in-Chief, and Auchinleck should get theSouthern Command.This view was generally accepted by the WarCabinet, who felt that General Ironside did not reallycommand complete confidence.   The matter was put to beSecretary of; State* who would make a recommendationaccordingly to the King.
