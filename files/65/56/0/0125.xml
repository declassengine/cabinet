The First Sea Lord said that the DUNKERQUE would beready quite soon, and, when asked what use would be madeof her, he thought the French would take great care tokeep her in a very safe place *The information contained in Mr Howard Smith&apos;telegram was as follows:(a) The Germans intended at a given moment to launch a gas attack against Great Britain,and,in order to secure a pretext for so doing,proposed first to drop a few gas bombs on German towns and to allege that this hadbeen done by British aircraft:(b) It was the intention of the German Governmentto forbid either the entry into, or the departure from, Germany by any foreignerafter the 1st April, 1940.   All foreignersin Germany had been told that they must decide by that date whether they wished toremain or to leave.^Minute 7.Germany:possible intentions.W.M. (40) 55th CONCLUSIONS29 .2 .40.This was expected to be a long and difficult day.Perhaps for that very reason it was the opposite.   Itwould very obviously have been a difficult day if steps had not been taken to deal with the situation in advance.Minute 1.Stoppage ofTraffic in norwegian territorial waters.MinUte 6.Assistanceto Finland.Minute 8.Mr sumner welles&apos;Visit.The P.M. told me the day before that he meant to start the proceedings with a statement of his own views,and that he had seen the First Lord before the meeting and explained to him the conclusion which he intended toreach.   As a result, Miriute 1, the proposals to lay aminefield in Norwegian territorial waters, was disposedof in about three-quarters of an hour, instead of lastingfor an hour and a half to two hours.Everyone felt that the Prime Minister had been inmagnificent form and had dealt with the matter withextraordinary skill.   He was like a schoolboy on thefirst day of the holidays, at the end of the Meeting.The First Lord behaved very well, but left beforethe end of the Meeting.   ? did he feel that there mightbe too much of a strain to be on his best behaviour fortoo long.After this, the rest of the Meeting was anti-climax.The discussion in regard to the Finnish Government&apos;s appeal is not altogether accurately represented in theMinutes.   Most of the Ministers present had got theimpression that it had been part of the plan that the appeal by Finland should be from the outset a public one.This Was not the ease (See W.P.(40) 59\ on which thePrime Minister&apos;s statement recorded in the confidential annex was based).   The Minutes were a bit doctored to getthis point right.   I went and saw Sir Alexander Cadogan,at his request, and we settled the terms of his telegram to Helsinki, and of the Cabinet Conclusion, together.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that Mr Sumner Welles&apos;sstatement that nothing much seemed to betoken a rapprochemjai.between Rome and Moscow, would surprise no-one excep
those who suspected Signor Mussolini of planning topromote a change of regime in Moscow, and of being, forthis purpose, willing to co-operate with Germany.   he also said that he understood that Mr. Sumber Welleswished to eschew social engagements during his visit,though he would no doubt wish to be received by the King.(N.B. The reason for the First Lord leavingbefore the end of the Meeting was thathe had to think out his speech to theLobby Correspondents that afternoon  a speech whieh, I am told, be did very well.   My suggested reason for hisleaving the Meeting was, therefore,not only malicious, but mistaken.)W.M. (40) 56th CONCLUSIONS. 1 .S .40 .The main course in this repast was intended to bethe Shipping situation.   The subject was originallyto have been taken a week earlier, but was postponedtwice, largely owing to the First Lord&apos;s insistence.The conclusions reached had been fully discussed between the Lord Privy Seal and the Prime Minister, andone or two Officials, before the Meeting.    In effect,the only dissentient from the view that the shipping situation was difficult was the First Lord.   As, however,he was prepared to agree that the matter should, be reviewed, although he took a more optimistic view ofthe situation, there was no particular difficulty in reaching agreement.The part of the Meeting which deals with theMinistry of Supply hypothesis is considerably toned down.Actually what happened was that everyone who had readhis Papers was quite convinced, that the Ministry ofSupply were asking for an import programme of 30.6 million!tons a year.   This, of course, was a terrific bombshell,   jand was recognised as such.   Everyone was amazed whenthe Minister of Supply said that the Department meantnothing of the kind.The Chancellor of the Exchequer put the Ministerof Supply through a fairly gruelling cross-examination.The Minister was then sent out of the room to speak t&amp; his Department and make quite sure that thestatement which he made was correct - rather an infradig, proceeding which was not recorded in the Minutes.(Before taking the Shipping Papers, however, he Foreign Secretary made a, statement inregard to Finland.   Indeed.&quot;M. Corbin wascloseted with the P^M. and,Lord Halifax whenMinisters arrived at the House of Commons.The result was to make a very long Meeting.)W.M. (40) *7t.h nOMCLUSIONS. 1.5.40. 6 .5Q paiThis second Meeting was summoned at about 40minutes notice, to deal with the latest developments in the Finnish situation.   As the Meeting was summonedat such short notice, the Prime Minister, who had gone to Chequers, could not attend.
