1orWar Cabinet an opportunity for discussion.**The discussion lasted for an hour ari$ three quarters .   The Prime Minister remarked after it thatit was one of the most useful discussions which theWar Cabinet had had.   Certainly it revealed a numberof ways of tackling the problem and the need for a concerted drive along all these different lines.Altogether a satisfactory morning.Minute 4.The naval situation.The First Lord mentioned that the Admiralty had had an unconfirmed rumour from vague sources to theeffect that two German cruisers had been sunk bysubmarines of the  STARFISH Class.   (The two submarineswhich the Germans claimed, apparently rightly, to have sunk, belonged to this Class).    It does seem possiblethat these two ships had been sunk after a conflict inwhich they had taken heavy toll of the enemy.   (I didnot include this in the Minutes, as I gather that theinformation is at present very shadowy.)While the First Lord was making this announcementthe Prime Minister burst out laughing.   The First Lordlooked up and asked if the Prime Minister was laughingat the statement which he (the First Lord) had made.The Prime Minister said No, he had been laughing at   ahumourous communication made to him by the Secretaryof State for Air, to the effect that one of the two German Officers who had come down in the famousaeroplane which crashed at Hasselt with plans for theGerman invasion, had been drunk.To my mind, this is yet another suspicious circum-stance.    If an Officer knew that he was to take partin a deliberate crash, would there not be a strongtemptation to acquire a little Dutch courage, even ifthe forced landing was to take place in Belgium!Minute 6*Air Situation.Minutes 10,11 and 12 .Scandinavia.Finland:Preparationof StrategicalPlans.W.M. (40) 18th CONCLUSIONS. 19.1.40.(N.B.   These notes are dictated onFriday, 26th January, after a rather busy week, and may therefore tend to be a littles crappy.)This was a very long Meeting indeed.The information received by the Attache was acomplete set of photographs of the Meuse crossingsurgently required by the Air Staff.(/ See next page.)The discussion recorded in Minute 12 was ratherconfused, since certain parties to the discussion thoughtthat the particular plan which gave rise to the question^ofvprocedure dealt with in Minute 12 related to Finland,whereas other people thought it related to a plan forforces in Norway and Sweden. Hence a good deal ofavoidable confusion.Minute 12 again showed the First Lord&apos;s intensedislike for the procedure whereby plans are in the first]instance sent to the Joint Planning Committee to work
The belief   current in this Office is that the FirstKSJ-J?&quot; Mt feally understand that the Joint PlannineOonmattee. consists of the planning experts of the three service Departments:   i.e., it is a Joint Staff of 1*2&amp;cenh^PartmentS - *** n0t *f3&quot;^       merchant?esh?phUuSinI WaKJ^W&apos;XJ oS.to.oR,aOil SuppliesQontinuation of Minute 6.)In connection with this matter reference wasmade to the U.S.S.R.   oil supplies.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that theRoumanian Ambassador in London had mentioned to him a plan for damaging the oil pipeline to Baku, whichwas of vital importance to Russian oil supplies, andwhich passed within only fifty miles of the Turkishfrontier.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had received similar information, and had placedthose concerned in touch with the Roumanian Ambassador.The War Cabinet invited the minister without Portfolio to keep in touchwith this matter.WM*(40) 19 th CONCLUSIONS. 20.1.40E.E.B. absent, it being his day off.Minute 2...AircraftIndus try *Minute 4.The Case ofthe S .S.ASAMA MARU.W.M.(40) 20th CONCLUSIONS.22 .1 .40.The aircraft factory at which the trouble had started was Napiers.Note the very-brief reference to the case of theS.S.
