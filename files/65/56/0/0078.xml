Another short Meeting, held at 12 Noon in orderto give the P.M. more time to prepare for his MansionHouse speech.The only item of real importance was Scandinavia,in regard to which a short resume was given of theinformation given the preceding day.   This discussion was of a mark-time nature, pending (a) further informs&apos;tion as to the reaction of the Swedish and Norwegian Governments;    (b) the return of the First Lord of theAdmiralty.W.M. (40) 6th CONCLUSIONS. 10.1.40.A Meeting dominated by the resumed discussion ofthe Scandinavia situation on the return of the FirstLord of the Admiralty.   The,general impression made bythe discussion was essentially the different points ofview put forward by the Foreign Secretary and the FirstLord of the Admiralty, the P.M. not at present defi-nitely committing himself pending further informationas to the Swedish reaction.The new President of the Board of Trade waseffective in dealing with the effect on us of thetotal stoppage of the Supplies of iron ore from Narvik.Nothing else of interest.W.M. (40) 9th CONCLUSIONS. 11,1 .40 .The fight between our Blenheims and the Messersch-mitts in the North Sea was a gallant affair, and it was clear that our Blenheims did extraordinarily well.   Atthe same time it would seem that the Messerschmittlong-distance fighter was a combination of relativelylong distance and of strong armament, which may be alittle better than anything we have got with precisely the same combination.The D .C .A .S. mentioned that the Mes s ers chmittwhich was brought down turned turtle, and that this may have been the result of the slipstream which thisMesserschmitt encountered when it came down behind ourBlenheims, which in turn came right down to the water and kept shoulder to shoulder formation.The really interesting item was again Scandinavia,the First Lord straining at the leash, and the foreign secretary still, unwilling to agree to the Narvikproject being launched.   Except for the P.M., who wisheda reassurance of the Swedish attitude, hardly anyone else expressed a view.Opinion on the &quot;pilot&quot; issue swung round ratherdefinitely.   At first the First Sea Lord said definitClthat without Norwegian pilots ships could hot navigatethrough Norwegian territorial waters all down the coas tBut after some discuss ion it was generally felt thatif pilotage was,.the only difficulty the Germans would find some way round.
