which settled that our immediate objective should be36 Divisions, while net abandoning the 55 Divisions asthe ultimate objective.   Since this conclusion coincidedalmost exactly with the conclusion of Lord Stamp&apos;s Survey,!there was nothing else to do but to accept this conclusions in the course of the economic part of the discussion!the following secret figures were given, but were omitted from the record:-(a)  200- 250 millions, the estimated valueof our Dollar securities.(b) The figure of  700 millions for the hettotal of our capital assets of all kinds.(c) The figure of  135 millions representingthe withdrawals from London in the first four months of the war (i.e.,withdrawalsat the rate of  400 millions per annum).W.M. (40) 41st CONCLUSIONS. 14.2 &apos;.40 .The statement that the Skagerrak was closed wasthe prelude to a statement that the ore ships comingdown the Norwegian coast ha.d to cut across the Skagerrakto the west coast of Denmark and leave territorial waters,and that the Navy meant to have a cut at thenuThe Navy also gave warning that they proposed tohave a shot at the anchorages being used between Borkum,Juist and nor deney.The generally expressed view was the hope thatthere would be no open breach between M. Daladier andM. Reynaud.   The probable re-shuffle of M. Daladier&apos;sGovernment, referred to by Sir Ronald Campbell in thesecond telegram quoted, was thought as referring not toah attempt to get rid of M. Reynaud, but to a desire onM. Daladier&apos;s part to broaden the base of his Administra-tion.   This would be quite likely, as a result of the unanimous vote of confidence passed in M. Daladier atthe eonclusioriof the recent Secret Session.Information from another source, which was notquoted in the War Cabinet and which reached, me today,is that these two eminent politicians get on quite well,but that their mistresses quarrel!The Meeting ended early, and the members of theWar Cabinet (with no Officials present) had a short discussion on a &quot;question of politics&quot;.w,M. Unl 42nd CONCLUSIONS. 15.2 .4Q,.A small Meeting;   the S/S for War being still awayin Prance; and the First Lord, accompaniedChancellor of the Exchequer, welcoming the EXETER at-Plymouth.Most of the Meeting was occupied by discussion ofthe West Indies Royal. Commission Report and a Statementof Policy in regard to the Colonial Empire. The Colonial-St7r-

Mr Attlee had beensaying that we ought, after the war, to treat the Colonie^as though they were Mandated Territories.   He (the PrimeMinister) thought it would be rather fun to come out hotand. strong with a statement that we were proposing to actwith great generosity and to treat the Mandated territory-ies as though they were Colonies from the point of viewof grants from the new fund for development welfare inthe Colonies.The War Cabinet were informed that, as the AirMinistry had reported that there were no enemy destroyers and submarines anchored just inside Borkum, Juist andNordeney, it had been decided to abandon the proposalto attack them.In regard to the magnetic mine, we had not yetrecovered a magnetic mine of the type laid, by submarines .The BORDE had accounted for 16 mines to date.   Her sistership should be ready in about ten days.   The double-Lsweep had accounted for its first magnetic mine theprevious week.The Prime.Minister, I think, rather relished theidea of writing to M. Daladier and pressing him to sendhelp to the Finns, having regard to the number of specialpleas which M. Daladier had made to him!(N.B.   Nothing dictated for this book sincethe 15th February, as the result of a;-rather heavy week.)W.M. (40 ) 43rd CONCLUSIONS.16 .8 .40.The First Lord of the Admiralty delivered a slash-in g attack on the C.I.G.S. in regard to the scale of equipment, of the forces.     He took the view that ourscale was grossly excessive in vehicles.The Secretary of State for War was absent.The general impression of the Military secretaries of the C.I.D. was that the C.I.G.S. was given some goodballs to leg which ought to have been, but were not,despatched to the boundary.Next day the C.I.G.S. produced a Memorandum for circulation to the War Cabinet on the subject.   As,however, the Memorandum did not contain any statement to distinguish between the number of so-called Vehicles&quot;which were really artillery and the vehicles which weretransport, we gave it back to him and asked him toproduce another one.   At the time of writing it has notsince reappeared.Mr Kermit Roosevelt has made the suggestion thatwe might invo&amp;e the support of his cousin the Presidentof the United States .   As, however, there is a good dealof unfriendliness between the Democratic and Republicansections of the Roosevelt family, this was not thought to be advisable.
