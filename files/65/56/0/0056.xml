several full days&apos; hunting, while the other, under;the Prime Minister, might range over the Home Front.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR favoured the PrimeMinister&apos;s scheme, and thought the Chiefs of Staffneed not normally attend on Tuesdays and Thursdays.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that the plan proposed would be a great improvement so far as the Home Frontwas concerned.   He had at first thought that it mightbe a good plan to arrange that a specific item covering the Home Front should be put on the Agenda on one day in each weeks   but after considerationhe had thoughtthat the best plan would be that the Home Front itemshould be ensured an early place on the Agenda onthese two days in the week.   He thought that theproposed plan was a good one.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR also favouredadopting the plan proposed.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER hoped that thePrime Minister would take a really long holiday at christmas, and expressed the affection and anxiety ofhis colleagues.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was going to be at chequers for Christmas, and intended to be present at the Meetings on the 27th and 28th December.   Fortu-nately he had a temperament which enabled him to throwoff cares quickly.THE FIRST LORD thought that something should bedone to counteract the idea of Christmas which these arrangements favoured.THE PRIME MINISTER said that nothing would bepublished as to the arrangements proposed, but he would circulate a Memorandum to his colleagues.W.M.(39) 110th CONCLUSIONS. 10.12 .59.. A Sunday Meeting.   A good deal of rather desultorytalk concerning the desirability of shutting down theseSunday Meetings.The First Lord arrived late, in a vile temper,having spent the day at Chatham, where apparentlythings had not gone very well.   Among the points he mentioned, and not recorded in the Minutes, was thathe had been disturbed to find at Chatham that therewere only eight balloons instead of the fifty whichhad been authorised for the defence of the thames estuary.   The Commander-in-Chief was concerned that german mine-laying aircraft had been allowed to alightin the Estuary without being fired on.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theestuaries had now been made an artillery zone, in which any aircraft could be fired upon.   All the balloonshad been sent to Chatham, but the barges for them werenot yet available.   Out of the first eight balloons,seven had caught fire very shortly after they arrived.There was also a good deal of discussion about theFirst Lord&apos;s suggestion for retaliatory measures in
Soviet Russia.regard to magnetic mines.   THE FIRST LORD did not regard it as the duty of the Legal Advisers of theForeign Office to put the legal point of view, but rather to find a colourful pretext for the particularline of action which the First Lord favoured.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER remarked that oneof these days we should have to settle our attitude to Russia, and said that there was a lot of public feeling in this country that the Russians were headingin just the abominable way to Finland as the germans had to Poland, and that we ought to declare war on them.THE FIRST LORD replied that we had given a guaran-tee to Poland but had not done so to Finland, and thatwe had enough on our hands already.W.M.(59) 111th CONCLUSIONS.11.12 .59.Minute 2.Magnetic Mines.Minute 5.Iron Ore.THE FIRST LORD said that the mines so far recover-ed were those able&apos;jto be dropped by aircraft.   One ofthe type laid by a sunmarine had not yet been obtained.It seems to be thought that the submarine mine hastwo explosions;   possibly one which releases it fromthe bottom, and another when it comes in contact witha ship.   This would explain the nature of the damagesustained by the NELSON,The code arranged between theFirst Lord andMr Kennedy for communication on this matter was thatif Mr Kennedy replied &quot;My wife cannot express an opinion&quot;, this would mean that while the president was not prepared to commit himself, he did not receive!the notion too badly.    If he reacted very unfavourably!the message was to be something like the following:&quot;My daughter is unable to accept the invitation&quot;.The answer received had been &quot;My wife cannot express an opinion, but received the proposal more favourablythan I had expected&quot;.W.M.(59) 112th CONCLUSIONS.12 .12 .59..Minute 3.naval situation.Minute. 10,League ofNations.THE FIRST LORD announced a collision between theBARHAM and the DUCHESS, causing the latter to sinkwith a loss of SO to 70 lives, in a very cold-bloodedway, being, I think, nettled at the continuance ofthese misfortunes.This gave rise to a little outburst by the PRIMEMINISTER, who said that it was time we had a little change of luck.THE FIRST LORD voiced his feeling that many people in this country, who deplored the evil times the Leaguehad fallen upon, would wel come^iaction taken by theGovernment at the present Meeting.
