mpres ent arrangements ensure that too many, young men whoare eminently suitable for our large industrial programme are not taken into the Army.   X am bound to say thatpersonally I still cherish grave doubts on this fide ofour programme, and think that before many months areout we shall be pulling men back from the Army.W.M. (40) 48th CONCLUSIONS .       81.2 .40 .On several occasions in the last year or so theForeign Secretary has tried to get some central bodyestablished to deal with demands for   the supply ofmunitions, material, etc., by our Allies or potentialAllies.   These schemes always come a bit unstuck, withthe result that the determination of the three defence departments is to keep these matters in their own hands.The present case is no exception, and the scheme whichwas authorised amounts to not very much more than aglorified Information Bureau   a much smaller schemethan was originally put forward.The account given by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs of his visit to Egypt contained a reference to the Egyptian Prime Minister and. the king of Egypt, whom he referred to as two unsatisfactoryfeatures.   The Egyptian Prime Minister was not a person who had any particular support, but he was deliveringthe goods.   According to Sir Miles Lampson, the King ofEgypt was fast becoming one of the problems of Easternpolitics.   He was very popular, and a difficult situation might arise in regard to him at any time.W.M. (40) 49th CONCLUSIONS. 22.2 .40.The First Lord of the Admiralty was rather delightedat the success of his attempt to prevent the S.S. WAHEHEfrom scuttling herself.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat one explanation of the publicity given to thismatter might be that he had sent a letter a few days agoto Mr Gibson, of the Finnish Aid Bureau.   This had followed a visit which Lord Nuffield had made, offering a gift of  100,000 towards the total of half a million which the Finnish Aid Bureau were endeavouring to raise.Lord Nuffield had asked that the gift should not be made   public, as otherwise the remaining 5400,000 would not beraised.   The Foreign Secretary had therefore written toMr Gibson to say that there was no objection to publicity Ifrom the political point of view.   This might have beentaken by the Finnish Aid Bureau as a general sanction for publicity.The message which the Secretary of State for ForeigriAffairs said that he had received from Sir Percy Loraine   iwent into rather more detail than is recorded in theMinutes.   Sir Percy had apparently said that he couldnot exclude the possibility of Signor Mussolini bringingItaly into the war on the side of Germany, though he didnot think it probable.   He would not exclude the possi-bility of internal trouble which might give the Germansan excuse for entering the country.   The Foreign Seeretarjsaid that he imagined that this eventuality would not be altogether unwelcome to the French and ourselves.
minute 7.Western FrontEvents of14th/l5thJanuary, 1940In this connection THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTYdrew attention to plans concerted by the French with theItalians some five years ago for the despatch of troops to co-operate with the Italians in the defence of the brenner Pass. -At the end of the Meeting, THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he would shortly be circulafc-ing a note of a conversation which he had had with sir Roger Keyes.   The main point was that the latter hadbeen quite explicit that when the King of the Belgianssent his message to him enquiring as to guarantees andconditions in connection with the possible entry ofAllied troops into Belgium, the King had never had it inhis mind to invite our troops in before the Germans had actually invaded Belgian territory.   Sir Roger Keyes had hoped that, as the Belgians were that week-end fullyanticipating an immediate German invasion, he might beable to persuade the King to persuade his Government to invite us in; but that was another matter.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY, to whom the message had come on the 14th January, said that he entirely agreed with this account.W.M.(40) 50th CONCLUSIONS.23 .2 .40 .Minute 1. &quot;Stoppage ofTraffic in .NorwegianTerritorialWaters.Owing to the celebration to the crews of the EXETERand AJAX, the Meeting was not held until the afternoon.It was timed for 3.SO, when we were given to believetha.t the Guildhall Luncheon would be over and the revellersreturned.. So they all had, with the exception of theFirst Lord, at 3.37;   but we did not get started until4 o&apos; clock.   The intervening time was occupied by thePrime Minister discussing the situation with Sir john simon and Lord Halifax, and it was clear that he wasfeeling some difficulty in the matter.Just as the Meeting started, the Prime minister asked that the Minister of Economic Warfarejshould be summoned.   He had. not been given notice of the Meeting,and there was a certain amount of going to and fro while I told him in the Private Secretary&apos;s room what the meeting was about and the points he was expected to answer.The Minister was somewhat taken aback at being asked to answer such questions off-hand, and sent for his expert,Mr Morton.Generally the discussion was a little difficult, andI felt that the Meeting had not been adequately preparedfor.U.S .S.R.The intervention by the Deputy Chief of the naval staff as regards the argument which would be the bestargument to use from the point of view of internationallaw and practice, was one of the most effective interven-tions that i have ever heard.   Everyone agreed that itput the point of view clearly, neatly, and most convincing-Minute 2 (U.S.8.R.) took place in the discussion as an enclave in Minute 1, and was extracted to a separateitem in the discussion.The rest of the Meeting went very quickly.
