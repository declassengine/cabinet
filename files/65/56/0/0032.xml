THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY produced somestartling statistics as to the reduction in the importsThe Shipping of maize from the United States and the Plate River in position.       September and October.   As these figures came from someprivate source of his own and could not be checked, theywere not inserted in the Minutes.In connection with paragraph 7 on page 6, whereit is stated that Eire were prepared to pay higher ratesthan we thought right, it was mentioned that Mr Rank,who was acting in some capacity for the Ministry of Food,was also acting for the Eire Government, and it was hewho had chartered these ships at higher rates on behalfof Eire.   It was suggested that it might be put to him. that this was scarcely playing the game.   He took theview that he did not want to go above the BritishGovernment figure, but was acting under instructions from the Eire Government,&apos;.M.(39) 87th CONCLUSIONS18.11 .59 .Minute 7.Visit ofDominionMinistersto France.The contrast between the work being done on theBritish part of the line and the French part of the line was in point of fact put. rather more strongly ,than is indicated in the Minutes.   Thus, THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR DOMINION AFFAIRS emphasised that the pill-boxes, onour part of the front were small as compared with those on the Maginot Line, and were as far as 800 yards apart.They were all arranged for lateral and not for frontalfire.   Our people were engaged in digging trenches and supporting points in between these pill-boxes.In regard to the Maginot Line, considerableemphasis was laid on the factjthat the French were workinglike beavers on the preparation of a secondary linebehind the Maginot Line.   Further, the Maginot Line washeld twice as strongly as our line, which enabled a farlarger number of men to be put to work on it.   The anti-tank obstacle on our part of the line consisted mainly ofa trench which could be destroyed by shell-fire.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs also mentioned that no single gun had been fired the whole time that they were on the Maginot Line.   When ColonelReitz had wanted to fire a new type of 4.2-inch gunthe French had nearly had a fit!    The party had motoredin front of the main Maginot Line.   This had been repre-sented as possible on account of the fact that therewas a fog that day.   The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, however, had doubts as to whether this was thereal reason.W.M.(59) 88th CONCLUSIONS. 19.11.39.E.B.B* absent.        &apos;
