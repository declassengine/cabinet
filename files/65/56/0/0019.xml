As regards internal politics, it was feltthat the move proposed would be jumped at by the pacifists, and probably by Mr LloydGeorge,(8) It was suggested that the President&apos;s movewould be a little less objectionable if heannounced beforehand the sort of terms onwhich America thought that it would be right that peace should be concluded!   i*e.,Mr Sumner Welles&apos;s mission would be a little less &quot;out of the blue&quot;.. * .Richmond Terrace, s.W.1,7th February, 1940*

His instructions would be to visitthese capitals solely to advise the President and Secretary ofState whether there was any possibility of ending the war in thenear future     He was authorised to make no proposal orcommitment in name of United States and would report on his return...
return solely to President and Secretary of State,.    announcement to this effect would probably he published, about February i$th*President said that he wanted Prime Minister Informed of this in strictest confidence as he was not saying anything to theFrench because it would certainly leak into press,     If however the Prime Minister had any comments to make he would gladly see meon his return to Washington next Tuesday,He further said that at the same time he proposed to announce that in view of desire of all neutrals for eventualrestoration of world peace on sound and lasting basis informaldiplomatic conversations between neutrals were being undertaken.Such conversations would not be concerned with terms for ending of war but rather to elicit neutral views as to principles whichshould underlie final peace including reduction of armaments, a sound international economic system, ete*I said that I thought discussion between neutrals would bea. great advantage provided it was concerned with mobilisingneutral opinion about fundamentals of world peace and did notdegenerate into proposals for whittling away Allied blockade orbelligerent rights in name of neutral rights,,     President saidthat he entirely shared this view*     As regards the Under**Secretary of State&apos;s proposed mission I said that the news of under-Secretary of State&apos;s mission eertainly would produce a profound effect in Europe of mingled hope and anxiety and I asked him whether he had any idea about possible basis whether for a peace or an armistice to which it might conceivably lead.He said that hie ideas about peace were practically the same asours that any peace must incdude restoration of freedom toCzechoslovak&amp;aand Poles in some real form and guarantees thatthere would be no renewal of aggression during any of our life&quot;times.     It would have to include restoration in Europe of what
he called the four freedoms;   freedom from war, freedom ofinformation i.e. press and public meeting, freedom of religion,and freedom for trade,     I said I could not conceive of herr hitler agreeing to these conditions in any effective form becausethey would mean end of Nazi regime and that I thought that real danger in such conversations was that they might lead to a weakening in Allied morale.     What Herr Hitler wanted most wasdemobilisation of democracies under conditions which would enable him to launch a Blitzkrieg against them later on.     I said thatift for instance, as he suggested,there was any possibility ofan armistice      groups undecypherablo? by meeting betweenprincipals on an United States warship with himself as a moderatornot mediator it would be impossible for Allies to suspendblockade so that during its duration Germany could (?) renew itssupplies,,     President replied that he was not hopeful of Under*-Secretary of State being able to find any basis of agreement which he or the Allies could accept but if that proved to be so he would be able to issue a statement on Under-Secretary ofState&apos;s   return, making it clear that Germany was the obstacle to.....in   i....................... i i        i i.

President asked that PrimeMinister should inform The King.President also said that with a few mutual concessions thereneed be no recurrence of recent little crisis in Anglo-american relations.     Administration in no way wanted to impede our war effort but he thought that we could make some concession aboutmails without opening any serious line of communication for germany.

r6o (TELEGRAM.Lord Lothian,   SECRET.WASHINGTON.No.^172^Cypher,Despatchedkth Feb. 1940.I*k5 a.m.Your telegram No. Ih2.Following from Prime Minister1*   You may certainly take the earliest opportunityof informing the President that I am most interested inhis proposal and appreciate fully the motives that haveInspired it.2.   The information which the President hasreceived from Germany corresponds with what has beenreaching H.M. Government, but in estimating the value ofthis information the President has no doubt observed thatno announcement by any leading Allied statesman would justify the belief in Germany that the Allied Governmentsintend if victorious to partition Germany.   If the Germanpeople do believe this it is because the German Government,by means of their propaganda, are forcing this belief upon them in the hope that by this means they may counteractany craving for peace among the German people, and may bebetter able to reconcile them to further hardships andsacrifices.3*   As to the inevitability of a tremendous offensive in the spring, this too has for some time past been putabout by German propaganda as part of the war of nerveson which they are engaged.   It must be realised that this war of naves is directed not only against belligerentsbut also against neutrals.   By keeping the neutrals ontenterhooks/
tenterhooks, especially those neutrals in close proximity to Germany, the German Government hope to create among them a general fear lest a continuance of the war will eventually involve them in hostilities, either directly or indirectly.     We do not therefore feel that this kindof propaganda is necessarily conclusive as to peace being more difficult of attainment later.   It is not unreasonable to suppose that it is precisely the policy of the GermanGovernment to produce this impression, under the mistakenidea that by this means they can mobilise world publicopinion against the Allies, who would be represented asbeing the sole obstacle in the way of peace.h*   I am gratified to note that the President is convinced of the necessity that any peace settlement must include &quot;guarantees that there would be no renewal ofthe kernel of the difficulty and it is clear that thePresident appreciates the fact.    It might not be so dif-difficult to devise a settlement that apparently righted thewrongs done in recent months;   the whole difficulty is tofind some means of assuring Europe that this could not befollowed sooner or later by a renewed attack on the rightsand liberties of the weaker European States.5.   We cannot imagine how such assurance could be attained so long as Germany remains organised on the presentlines and helpless tinder the direction of her present rulers.To demand, as condition of a peace, that the present Germanregime shall be overthrown or changed may have one or otheraggression during any of our lifetimes&quot;.,,,,1,1,......ii......Win............... &quot;&apos; mThat is reallyof/
of two effects.   It might encourage the German people to throw off the Hitler regime or it might unite thembehind Hitler from fear that the Allies and America are trying to disrupt Germany so as to destroy her.   Theformer alternative is rendered rather remote by the fact of the complete grip which Hitler, the Party and theParty machine seem to have on a population that is tradit-ionally and remarkably amenable to discipline.   The latteralternative^ is to be feared because it is the obvious linefor hitler propaganda machine to take, and because weshould have to anticipate that they would Use it skilfullyand to the full.6a    But to be quite frank, there would be the utmostdifficulty in persuading the people of this country and,I believe of Prance, that any settlement is worth signingwith Hitler or the present regime.7.     We have hitherto felt that the best method of handling this difficulty is to state conditions which, while not such as to invite rejection by considerable elements inGermany, are yet such as Hitler would find it impossible toaccept.    I infer that this is not far from the Presidentsthought, for 3 of the President&apos;s k &quot;freedoms&quot; imply the disappearance of the present regime in Germany, which couldneither allow nor survive &quot;freedom of information, freedomof religion and freedom for trade&quot;.8.   We should of course fully subscribe to these,but I should like further to make it plain that our willing-ness to consider any territorial or other settlement wouldhave /
-u-have to be conditional on the inclusion of provisionswhereby these conditions were reasonably assured.9.   As regards the President&apos;s proposed procedure,I should feel considerable diffidence in making any suggestions, as he alone can know what will afford him the best means of obtaining data on which to form a judg-ment.10.   In any discussions, however, it would surely bedesirable that the Polish Government shouh be associatedwith those of Great Britain and France.   The invasion ofPoland was the immediate cause of the war;   Poland is theally of Great Britain and France in this warj   and all three governments are pledged not to make a separate peace.Moreover, as the President recognises, the restoration ofPoland is a pre-requisite of any peace negotiations.   i venture to hope, therefore, that        Sumner Welles will,while in Europe, make a point of consulting the PolishGovernment now established in France as well as the otherGovernments mentioned by the President.11.   The President doubtless has in mind the problems arising out of the Soviet aggression on Finland, and inview of the strong feeling thereby aroused throughout theworld, he will perhaps consider whether it would be desirableto extend Mr. Sumner Welles&apos; enquiry in that direction.12*   The announcement of the mission of Mr. Sumner Welleswill of course produce a sensational impression throughoutthe world, more particularly if it makes public the fullpurpose of this initiative*
13*    It may be that the President feels that he cannot obtain the data that he requires from his regularrepresentatives in the various capitals*   But such asensational intervention will raise hopes in some quartersand give rise to discussion - much of it ill-infonned -in nearly all, and if the President, after weighing allthe considerations that I feel bound to submit to him,feels that full disclosure would best contribute to theends he has in view, it would seem of great importance that he should give clear indication in the announcementof his own conviction that the first essential purpose tobe achieved is durability of any settlement arrived at.lk*    I must frankly admit to a good deal of anxietylest the effect of this move, however carefully presented,should be to cause embarrassment to the Democracies, fromwhich Germany, still unconvinced of the failure of thepolicy of force, will reap advantage.15.   There is no doubt greater unity in Prance and england than there is in Germany, but there are alwayselements in the community which do not share the general opinion, and what I fear is th%t the public announcementof the Presidenfs initiative will at once bring theseelements into open and vocal prominence in the countries where &quot;freedom of information&quot; already exists.,    Since theGerman public and press will remain dragooned and controlledthere will ensue a false appearanee of unity in germany which will contrast very unfortunately with an apparentdisunity in the c&amp;mocratic countries.   The period of waiting,while/
while Mr. Stunner Welles collects his impressions, willbe a critical one and I am concerned at the thought thatit may be used by the German Ministry of Propaganda toemphasise the divisions in the ranks of their opponentsand thus alter the situation to our disadvantage.16*    I am most anxious to avoid giving the president the impression that I do not fully appreciate the impulsewhich has inspired his courageous proposal.    On the contrary,you may assure him that I will certainly co-operate to thebest of my ability.    But I earnestly hope that he will con-sider very seriously the possible effects of a public announce-ment of the purpose of Mr. Sumner Welles&apos; mission before this becomes absolutely necessary.17*   I am sure hv will not object to my putting my views on this most important matter to him with the samefrankness which he has displayed towards me (and for whichI am deeply grateful).18*   You may if you wish show this telegram to thePresident and leave him a copy.Please see my immediately succeeding telegram.
\;teLordLothian,WASKIUGTON.My immediately preceding telegram,No* 173a Baring last month or two and particularly the past fewCypher, weeks we haw beet receiving through intermediaries fromDespatched       German sources, among others from the entourage of Goeriaghth Febs 191*0*l.h5 a.m. Whose alleged moaSration is now completely suspect) amass of information similar to that which appears to haveprompted this step by the President.2,   WhtQe on the one hand some of these stories have only emphasised the irresistibility of the offensive powerof the German armed forces, the ruthlessness with whichthey will be used, and the imminence of their employmentagainst Holland and Belgium as well as against the Allies,others have suggested that the projected offensive can becalled off if peace talks could be started,.     In thevarious peace terms put forward there have been more orless vague proposals for restoration of a Polish and CzechState and references to a colonial settlement, economic?reconstruction and disarmament^     In some ease&amp; our infona-ation has suggested that if the Allies would Intimate their willingness to negotiate on something like these terms andwould make it clear that they were not aiming at thedismemberment of Germany, steps would be taken by the army to overturn or modify the present regime in Germany and bring into power a government with whom the Allies couldnegotiate,3*   These stories have been passed on to us throughneutral government and private channels and through the k 1 Ifetieaa/
Vatican?k* We have &quot;been inclined to regard, these stories aspart of the German m&amp;r of nerves. It may well he that an offensive will he delivered lay Germany in Western europe in the near future, hut it would he greatly to Hitler fsadvantage if he oould obtain peace on terms reasonably satisfactory to himself without running the militaryhazards of a great offensive and without imposing losses and privations on the German people which might welljeopardize the existence of the regime. In the hope of achieving this, Hitler has naturally been using for thispurpose the sentiment which undoubtedly exists in neutraleofntries in favour of an early peace, even though it bean inconclusive and precarious peace. In this way neutral governments would hope to escape the peri 1 that nowthreatens many of them, and to be saved the inconvenience and less that the war is bringing upon them. Borne govern-meats, like the Italian Government, nay think an inconclusivepease would give scope for profitable manoeuvre to their own *advantage. Others may hope that peace with Germany would lead to a crusade against Bolshevism, By mobilizing those elements of world opinion (whether Interested or dis-interested) which are in favour of an early peace. Hitlermay hope to secure a settlement which would leave germany with her armed fcress intact, in possession of part at anyrate of her gains, and In a poft&amp;tion to resume herexpansionist career whenever she wishes and before theAllies can gather themselves for action again.    We have
good reasons to believe $hat this is indeed the ideacherished by some of taeframers of German policy, whetherNazi or non-Nazi.5, We have therefore for some time past been expectinga peace move to come either from the Italian governments the Pope or from the President, though we had not foreseenthat it would be so spectacular as a public mission from washington, the object of which would be fully advertisedin advance,6* The misgivings we feel have been hinted at in myiiHHsedlately preceding telegram but we cannot help suspectingthat what the President now proposes to de 3s precisely what Hitler hoped, he would do*     We are inclined to thinkthat Mr., Kennedy, whose opinions are&quot; well known to us, mayhave bad some influence in settling the President*s policy,and we also know that certain American business men withdubious political connections have been in touch with theGoering entourage,7* In connection with the reference to Finland in my immediately preceding telegram, I should explain that weare contemplating giving..,;greater assistance to Finland,provided we can get Norwegian and Swedish co-operation.This action would have to be taken at a very early date,and we should anticipate that, if the Scandinavian   Govern-ments felt there was a possibility of peace, they would bemore reluctant than they misfit otherwise be to participate in any action that might risk Involving them in a war whichthey might hope to escapes
8*    This telegram is intended to supply you with the background against which we see the President * a new move.It is not intended for communication to him as it stands,but you my draw on it so far as you think fit in thecourse of conversation^
Decypher.     Lord Lothian (Washington).6th February, 1940.Do     10.^5 p.nu 6th February, 1940.R.       8.35 a.m. 7th February, 1940.No. l60.SECRETIMPORTANTFollowing for Private Secretary.Decypher yourself.Following for Prime Minister.I gave your telegram No. 172 to President this morning.He expressed appreciation and general agreement with it.He was also a good deal impressed with first five paragraphs of your telegram No. 173 which I read to him.     He fully appreciated the point made in paragraphs 13 to 16 ^/grp. und/7172 and said that in any published instructions to W he wouldprobably avoid use of word &quot;peace&quot; and simply send him on a tour of enquiry.     He thought consultation with PolishGovernment wise but he objected to including Finland (?and)Russia as extending enquiry too much.     He said he would consult Secretary of State and W this afternoon and see meagain later this week.     He is still clearly in favour of proceeding though I understand Secretary of State has moredoubts.     Incidentally he said W would be told to make it cleatto Germany that any attack on France and Great Britain which showed any prospect of success; would inevitably b ring UnitedStates nearer to intervention.     State of public Steelinghere however did not make it possible for him to use such an argument publicly in Election year.He said it was essential that nothing should be al&amp;wedto leak out in England to the effect that he had informedGreat Britain of proposed Mission, partly for international and partly for domestic reasons.
