that he had not slept properly for three nights at thetime of the speech he made about Finland.   This, nodoubt, accounted for the fact that he had said certainthings that he would not have said if he had been infull command of his judgment.   It was thought that itmight be a good plan to get him over here for a coupleof days and get him to quieten down somewhat.In the discussion about Holland, the foreign secretary said that M. Colijn had told him that he hadbeen anxious to discuss for a couple of hours with theFirst Lord a proposal he had for a new gospel to be put to the neutrals, which he wished to expound to theLeague of Nations Committee.   After an interview of a couple of hours with the First Lord, however, he onlygot to the point of obtaining permission to send to theFirst Lord a written memorandum explaining the point a tissue.   This had a very good reception!     (The meeting was not over until nearly 2 o* clock .)W.M. (40)  70th Conclusions . IS.5 .40.One of the most coffee-housing of all our Meetings!We wandered, all round the place, and discussed nearlyeverything under the sun.   The First Lord of the Admiralty,in particular, took a very gloomy view of what would nowhappen in the Balkans.   He thought that Roumania, andprobably Yugo-Slavia, would be squeezed, and that wewould not be able to do anything.Among other matters there was a short discussion on the Royal Marine Operation.   Reference was again madeto the fact that the French were basing their request-for postponement on the fact that 300 aircraft were atpresent in the open and exposed to great danger of attack.This, however, was generally felt to be a pretext.Nevertheless, it was clearly impossible for us to carryout the first part of the operation without Frenchcons ent.The First Lord read out a letter which he hadreceived from General Gamelin.   This letter, however,did not add very much to our information on the subject.(i spent most of the afternoon at a meeting between Horace Wilson and M. Jean Monnet, at whichdiscussion started on a memorandum which M. daladier had recently put to the French Cabinet, outlining proposalfor bringing the French economic effort into harmony with their war effort.   This was the paper on which m. Monnet had helped M. Daladier considerably in thefive weeks which he had recently spent in Paris.After about an hour, Arthur Robinson went away,and the discussion really turned on the French proposals(again fathered by M. Monnet) for setting up a FrenchWar Cabinet organisation and on methods of strengthening the French Administration.   I got theimpression thatM. Monnet stands in very much the same relation toM. Daladier as his interrogator did to our Prime Minister^W.M. (40)  71st CONCLUSIONS. 18.5 .4Q.Not a very long Meeting, but a great many subjectswere touched on.One got the general impression that the arrange-ments for the defence of Scapa had not been awfully well-56-
