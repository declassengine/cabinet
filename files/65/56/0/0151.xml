Thus, theCommander-in-chief got 1,000 shares;    the Admiral incharge of a Squadron, 600 shares;    the Canteen Staff,2 shares, each; the value of each share being  6.15-0.Below the Admiral the rates had, of course, been scaleddown.   Here the Minister for Co-ordination of defence said &quot;Scaled, down very rapidly&quot;.
