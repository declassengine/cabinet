PORTFOLIO said that his information was that the area - some SO square miles -was toobig to be dealt with successfully by sabotage.At best, the pipeline to Batum might be cut, but our experience of similar action in Palestine (where theHaifa pipeline had on occasions been cut in many places)showed that the effect was negligible, repairs having beencarried out with little difficulty and with practically nointerruption in the flow pf oil.   Air action, on the otherhand, beid out much more pressing possibilities .
