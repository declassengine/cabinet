* - * * -.THf WS^MWWSW. said that he understood thatcertain of his.- colleagues, fished., again to refer to theCoventry murders *   As a general rule he thought it was amiatske that a matter, which had already been decided,should be further discussed unless some new factor had arisen.   In the present ease he understood that theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs had. certain newpoints to raise,   The case could therefore be regarded asexceptional *THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOB FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, after the Meeting on the previous day, he had seena telegram from Lord Lothian, reporting representations made to him by the Irish Minister at ?/ashington*   these representations were that the execution of Richards andBarnes would have the same effect as the executions whichhad taken place in Dublin in 1916,   The views expressedby Mr Irennan. were regarded by the American Departmentof the Foreign office as almost certainly correct.On the previous day, while not very happy with theconclusion reached, he had expressed his concurrencewith it.   But he had had an uneasy afternoon, and his experience was that if he was not happy once a decisionhad been reached, he felt doubts whether the decision hadbeen right, since he was not usually troubled with doubtsonce a decision had been reached *   When this matter hadbeen discussed the previous day, he had felt that thiswas a case in which instinct and reason were very finelybalaneed*   But since then his instinct had re-asserteditself.   A long talk which he had had with the Duke of devonshire had exercised a powerful Sjiapresslen upon him-lS^&apos;
and had made him wish to re-consider the decision ahd* on balance, to revise it,fits PRIME MBIXSTHl said that he also harl seen the duke of Devonshire, who had expressed the view that thedecision reached was likely to have very unfortunate results *.. fhe. Duke &quot;had said&apos;that no outrages had&apos;takenplace since the Coventry murders. He (the Prime Minister)had challenged that statement, and had said that he thoughtthat several outrages had taken place, but that there hadbeen no loss of life-THE H0M1 SSGRSTARY confirmed that several outrageshad taken place, but of a milder character *Continuing, THS PRIMS UXSXST3R said that the duke*s view was that, if these men were executed, theresult would be further loss of life, but that if the sentences were commuted the campaign was likely to die down*THE HOME SECRETARY said that the indications he hadreceived were that the oonspirators were very active.He had recently had to expel from the country, under theAct passed in July, a large number of men.THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat Sir John Maffey had sent a message from Mr JamesDillon^ who had offered to come over to this country.It was also significant that Mr Cos grave had been to seeSir John Maffey and had urged clemency. Sir PatrickHannon* H*P** had also spoken to him as to the effect ofexecutions on Irish opinion throughout the &quot;Empire.   It had also been reported to him that Mr W*J* Stewart, M.F. forBelfast South^ shared this view. &apos; $(e had- put a great dealof effort in recent years into the improvement of relationswith Sire, and the reward had not always been commensurate with the effort?   but it could not be deftied that Sire&apos;aneutrality was friendly neutrality *  He was afraid thatthe executions would mean a setback.... -14-.
THE FIRST LORD OF TH1 ADMJRAtiTY said that ireland had been much mere friendly to us at the beginning of theGreat war *THE GS AHCBH$R OF THE EXCHSOjOSR thought thatMr Cosgrave*s opinion was of great significance, as mr Cos grave and his Party had always tried to preservegood relations with us.   There often came a point at whichIrish people felt inhibited from taking a reasonable line,on account of some tragedy which haa taken place.THE PRIME MIKXSTBR said that the Duke of Devonshiretook the view that Richards and Barnes had not intended todo murder *THE HOME SECRETARY said that his position in thematter was not an easy one. He found it impossible,   indealing with this question, to put aside the considerable experience which he had had of Irish affairs.   Time and again he had had to deal with these cases.   He had referred the day before to the ease of Kevin Barry.   TheIiord Chancellor of Ireland had favoured clemency, but hehad taken an opposite view, and the  rovernment had acceptedhis view.   He was sure that steady improvement in Irishaffairs had resulted from an attitude, not of greatseverity, but of firmness and consistency?   and thatvacillation in administration of the criminal law hadplayed a large part in the deplorable deterioration whichhad taken place in relations between this country andIreland.   There was always a flood of representationswhen it was proposed to carry out a death sentence on anIrishman.   All Irish people found it difficult to resista plea for clemency, feeling, no doubt* that no harm wouldresult from pressing such a plea, since the responsibilityfor the decision rested eleewhere*The Home Secretary then referred to the Cardiffcase, where three Catholic Irishmen had been convicted of-15*** -
iisarder.   Almost unbelievable pressure bad been broughtto bear from all quarters on the Homo Office.   At thetime Sir Austen Chamberlain had been in charge of theHome Office, and Mr T*P.O* Connor, who had lived nextdoor to Sir Austdtn, had visited him and pressed forclemency.   The sentences had been carried out, and nodire consequences had ensued.   He (the Home Secretary)discounted tremendously the reports of opinion in Ireland.Though he did not wish to make any statement which might appear to import prejudice, it was Mr James Billon&apos;sfather who had so grossly misled Sir Augustine Birrellas to the state of opinion in Ireland in 1916.If the carrying out of these sentences would havea great effect on our war effort, that, of course, was:-:,a matter which must bei taken into consideration and mustweigh very heavily.   But what would be the effect on our war effort if the sentences were not carried out?   Clemencycould have no good affect on the implacable efforts ofthose who were running the I.R.A. campaign.   The resultsof a reprieve would be to relax our pressure on the I.R.A.,If the sentences were carried out, we should impress them,on the other hand, with a sense of our power, and theleaders would find it harder to obtain agents in thiscountry.Looking at the matter on a higher plane, if thesesentences were commuted, the members of the I.R.A. organ-isation would be able to contend that \?e had accepted theview that deaths which they inflicted by their outrageswere only laurdor in a technical sense.    Any such admlssiowould add to the strength of the movement.If the War Cabinet wished to press for theexercise of clemency in this case, he felt that it was essential that the views of the Horthemlreland Governmentshould be ascertained before any final decision was reachesince that Government was faced with much the same problem
0.as regards the plea that, if these sentences wereeosamuted,the leaders of opinion in Ireland would have anopportunity of coming out on our side, was it not truethat these same leaders had already had plenty of opportunity-nltles of coming out on our side?   But they had not done so.   He quoted the opinion of Mr tfames MeMshon, who had said to him quite recently that you could not fight thet*B*A* movement with sugars ticks,., ome further discussion took place as to whether,-if the sentences were commuted^ it would he possible.toavoid a publie statement,THE LORD SRIVY SEAL said that he was not convincedthat a public statement would be necessary in such an event *TH1 HOMS SECRETARY took the opposite view.In further discussion, the following Ministersalso expressed themselves in favour of letting the lawtake its course?-&quot;The Minister for co-ordination of Defence,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The Minister without Portfolio,TH1 PRBIS MIIISTSB said that, in his view, .commutation of these sentences would be an act of weakness,and that the decision reached on the previous day should stand ** * *
