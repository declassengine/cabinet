THE IMPROVEMENT 07 THE DEFENCES OP THEBRITISH SECTOR OP THE WESTERN PRQNT.*       *        *1 * The Minutes of the War cabinet.net as circulated *There is only one reference, namely, W.M.(39) J3$J!Minute 7, on the 18th Nowafoer, 1939 - Report by theSecretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs on the visit of the Dominion Ministers to Prance.In the course of this account the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs commented on the extentof the work in progress on the British sector of theline, as compared, with the work in progress on other sectors of the French front.   The Conclusion recordedwas that, if the Dominion Ministers so desired, aMeeting should be arranged between them and theService Ministers and their Advisers, at whichmatters arising out of the visit of the dominion ministers to Prance could be discussed.This Meeting never took place.   The information which reached us in the War Cabinet Office was thatthe Dominion Ministers were not anxious for theMeeting to take place, and that, while they had expressed some views on the matter at the time, theurge for the Meeting came from Mr Eden.2. CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX TO WAR CABINET CONCLUSIONS aIn this Annex I record matters of which thereshould be an account available to Ministers ana, onsuitable occasions, the Chiefs of Staff, but of whiit is not desirable to give as wide a circulation iobtains in the case of the War Cabinet Minute;themselves.   The Confidential Annex to the Meeting;
-ft)held on the Slst November, 1939 (W;M.(S9) 90th.Conclusions, Minute 11) records the Secretary ofState for War&apos;s visit to Prance.   A copy of this minute was shown to the Secretary of State for Warand the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.   Theformer made certain corrections.   The relevant extractis as follows&apos;-&quot;A great deal of digging was in progressalong the Front, but he (the Secretary ofState) had been surprised to see only two new pill-boxes being constructed.   He had mentioned this point to Lord Gort, who had informed him that there was some difference of opinion as to the best form of pill-box.The British authorities, it appeared, didnot agree that the French type of pill-boxwas the best that could be devised.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that hehad consulted General Gamelin, who feltthat we should have behind the lines acement works at our disposal.   The french had so organised matters that they couldbuild a pill-box in three days.   Most ofthe trenches which were dug in our sectorfilled at once with water, and the Frenchthought that they should be cement-lined.Engineer Officers from the Field Force were coming over to England that day, and he hopedthat great improvements would be made.Generally speaking, however, our defenceswere very strong, and Lord Gort was con-strueting two lines of defences behind themain line&quot;.There is nothing else relevant in the Minutesas circulated, or in the Confidential Annex.There are two other sources of evidence.   First,I became rather perturbed at the frequency with which some matter was discussed, so to speak, &quot;off the record&quot;, or which in other ways was not suitable for incorporation in the Minutes.   For the past month or so I have therefore kept a series of Motes, in whichI have reeorded miscellaneous points off the record.These Notes, unlike the Confidential Annex, are not shown to anyone, and are intended only for use on occasions like the present, namely, when it is desire
to know whether a subject has been discussed &quot;off the record&quot;.   There is nothing in this note-book of minebearing on the subject, with the exception of an expanded note of what Mr Eden said as to the visit of the Dominion Ministers to Prance.   The reason forthis note is that Mr Eden asked me to tone)down what he actually said.The second source of further evidence is mymanuscript notes of the Meetings, which I now Iseeg.I have looked through these notes from the 87th Meetinjonwards, and I can find in these notes no record ofthe fact that the C.I.G.S. was visiting Prance andwould enquire into the position of the defences onthe British sector o^ the line.To complete the story, however, I should addthe following:-(l) That I was aware at the time that theC.I.G.S. was going to Prance ana thatit was proposed that he should enquire into this matter..       .      1 (2) That I have an impression, which I cannotcdfuu^ I_substantiate^jfthcrfr-the Secretary of State/ ^^&quot;L       f . rorjvajff 5533 p&quot;i pacca-nt that the C.I.G.S.&quot;T&amp;oiA-&quot; was going to Prance ..mattcga imwi ta&amp;that he would take the oppor tuuifaij/1 la &apos;look into this matter.I can find no supporting evidence for this in myNotes of the^lee^ngs^   I may well be mistaken in thinking that the matter was mentioned in the Cabinet,since General Tsmay and I had some talk about thematter in the Office at the time.   The burden of ourtalk ras that we were afraid that the C.I.G.S, was likely to handle this matter tactlessly when he gotto G.H.Q,., and we racked our brains to see whether we could think of any way of ensuring that the matter would be handled in such a way as not to increase theexisting friction.    In the end I think we came to theIS .13 .39conclusion that there was nothing which we could doin the matter to help.
The following -further information may be ofinterest.The Secretary of State for War, in his statement to theV^ar Cabinet on the 21st November, said thatEngineer Officers from the Field Force were comingover to England that day.   The Chief Engineer of theB.E.F. (i am not sure whether this is the correct rank)Pakenham-Walsh, was present at a Meeting of the ArmyCouncil at which the condition of the defences of theBritish sector of the line in France was discussed.I gather that Pakenham-Walsh was given a message totake back to Lord G-ort.    I am also informed (by GeneralIsmay) that the manner in which the Secretaiy of Statefor War discussed this topic gave some offence, andthat General Gordon-Finlayson, the Adjutant-General,spoke up rather strongly on the matter.The visit of the C.I.G.S. to France, during whichhe enquired into the state of the defences, covereda period Wednesday 29th November to Saturday 2ndDecember.General Ismay also inform? me that the C.I.G.S.,at a Meeting of the Chiefs of Staff just before he left for France on this visit, excused himself forhis forthcoming absence on the ground that theSecretary of State for War had been complaining tohim (the C.I.G-.S.) about the state of the defences,and that he (the C.I.G.S.) had insisted that he would go out aftd see for himself what the position was.
