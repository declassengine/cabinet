Minute 5*The naval situation,magnetic mines.Minute 7.Assistanceto Finland,Minute 1..Ass is tanceto Finland.Minute 5.Assistanceto Finland.Secretary was, I think, a little anxious lest his revised proposals should not be accepted by the War Cabinet.In the main, these proposals met with complete approval,and criticism fastened, on only one or two quite minorpoints.In the discussion on the Colonial Empire, thePrime Minister made a nice point.   Mr Attlee had beensaying that we ought, after the war, to treat the Colonie^as though they were Mandated Territories.   He (the PrimeMinister) thought it would be rather fun to come out hotand. strong with a statement that we were proposing to actwith great generosity and to treat the Mandated territory-ies as though they were Colonies from the point of viewof grants from the new fund for development welfare inthe Colonies.The War Cabinet were informed that, as the AirMinistry had reported that there were no enemy destroyers and submarines anchored just inside Borkum, Juist andNordeney, it had been decided to abandon the proposalto attack them.In regard to the magnetic mine, we had not yetrecovered a magnetic mine of the type laid, by submarines .The BORDE had accounted for 16 mines to date.   Her sistership should be ready in about ten days.   The double-Lsweep had accounted for its first magnetic mine theprevious week.The Prime.Minister, I think, rather relished theidea of writing to M. Daladier and pressing him to sendhelp to the Finns, having regard to the number of specialpleas which M. Daladier had made to him!(N.B.   Nothing dictated for this book sincethe 15th February, as the result of a;-rather heavy week.)W.M. (40 ) 43rd CONCLUSIONS.16 .8 .40.The First Lord of the Admiralty delivered a slash-in g attack on the C.I.G.S. in regard to the scale of equipment, of the forces.     He took the view that ourscale was grossly excessive in vehicles.The Secretary of State for War was absent.The general impression of the Military secretaries of the C.I.D. was that the C.I.G.S. was given some goodballs to leg which ought to have been, but were not,despatched to the boundary.Next day the C.I.G.S. produced a Memorandum for circulation to the War Cabinet on the subject.   As,however, the Memorandum did not contain any statement to distinguish between the number of so-called Vehicles&quot;which were really artillery and the vehicles which weretransport, we gave it back to him and asked him toproduce another one.   At the time of writing it has notsince reappeared.Mr Kermit Roosevelt has made the suggestion thatwe might invo&amp;e the support of his cousin the Presidentof the United States .   As, however, there is a good dealof unfriendliness between the Democratic and Republicansections of the Roosevelt family, this was not thought to be advisable.
