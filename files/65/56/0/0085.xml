Minute 1.Broadcastingof shipping losses.Minute g.Palestine.Minute 4.Old-AgePens ions.Minute 7.possible german Attackon Belgium.Minute 18.Scandinavia.The Meeting was chiefly notable for the positivelyfirst appearance at a War Cabinet Meeting of Sir JohnReith.    It was also notable in another way.   The firstitem discussed was the broadcasting of shipping losses,an item raised by the First Lord of the Admiralty, whoyielded to a request of Sir John Reith&apos;s that he (sir john) should be given time to consider an alternativesolution before discussion in the War Cabinet.   hence the discussion was postponed.The third item, Palestine, was likewise a matterraised by the First Lord of the Admiralty, and wasremitted to the Prime Minister to find a solution.On this item there was a unanimous feeling that theChancellor of the Exchequer had found what was both a sound and a rather shrewd solution of a problem which,politically, was very difficult.As regards a possible attack on Belgium, the PrimeMinister reacted very hotly to the latest telegram fromSir Roger Keyes, which strongly confirmed all the PrimeMinister&apos;s reactions to this whole project.

On this there was One of thoserather unexpected swings of opinion.   Previously it had seemed certain that the V/ar Cabinet would favour sending the Lord Privy Seal.
