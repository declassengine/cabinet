THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported that the Minister   vof shipping had informed him--that the Norwegianshipping deal had been settled, and that he had alsoSucceeded in obtaining 20 Greek, and a number of Yugo-Slav ships.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY was distressedto hear that all the Norwegian ships to be obtainedunder this deal would hot be in our hands at an earlydate, as he was anxious to take early steps toprevent the export of ore from Narvik.   He would shortly be putting before the War Cabinet a paper explaining how he propos ed to do this.. 0 .......  ^W.M.-.(-89) 92nd CONCLUSIONS.S5 a^.^L Ofl59..oMinute 1.The air situation,In connection with the visit of German pilotsto the Shetlands, reference was made to a foreignreport that the Germans contemplated seizing a base in the Shetlands.Minute 2.The naval situation,THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF gave the War Cabinetinformation as to the anti-submarine defences in theForth.   These were complete, except in respect ofthe Loop minefield, which would be ready before thenext visit of the Fleet.   Work was going on as rapidly as possible on the anti-submarine defencesof scapa.Request forSecret Session.After the conclusion of the matters recorded inthe Minutes, a discussion took place &quot;off the record&quot;on two matters.   The first concerned a request byMr Attlee for a Secret Session on Supply.THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;s view was that, provided aSecret Session were asked for on a specific subject and was confined to that subject, he had not muchobjection to it.On the other hand the view was expressed that ifthere was a Secret Session in the Commons there wouldhave to be one in the Lords, where the Rules ofDebate were very wide.   Further, that if a Se cretSession was agreed to on Supply, one would be askedfor next week on Air, and so on and so forth.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that aSecret Session would amount to no more than a general discussion on the War, which would be rather afterthe fashion of itatements made by Ministers to the1922 Committee.   He thought that the Secret Sessionsin the Great War had done good, but a very powerfulcase could be made out on Supply matters.The question of secrecy was referred to.   It was generally agreed that it would be impossible to rely on the information given being kept secret, and thatreally secret information cOuld not, therefore, beimparted.   On the other hand, if the informationimparted became known, there would be a good argument against having another Secret Session.In conclusion, THE PRIME MINISTER said that hehad still to discuss the matter with the Chief Whipand he could not yet come to any decision.
, difficult, to refuse a Secret Session, more especially as one of the reasons why a Secret Session was desiredwas in order that Members of Parliament might give... -information to the Government in secret which they&apos; were unwilling to give in public., : ^      .&apos;&quot;: :, , - -All-Party This was followed by a discussion about a projectMeetings. for All-Party Meetings.   Sir Archibald Sinclair was willing to play, but apparently Mr Attlee was not willing to play.   It had apparently been intended that these Meetings should be run under the aegis ofthe Ministry of Information, and it appeared that theLabour representative on the Ministry of InformationAdvisory Committee was taking exception to certain ofthe activities of the Ministry in putting up a casein defence of action taken by the Government incommandeering schools, and so forth, these actionsbeing regarded as Party actions by the Labour repre-sentative.In discussion the view generally expressed wasthat there was a lot to be said for All-Party Meetings,but that if they could not be run under the Ministryof Information tin regard to which some sympathy was expressed with the Labour view) they might be run bythe Party machine.   Another suggestion was that Meetingsmight be run in connection with the Savings movement.Such Meetings would start by urging the need for savings, but would no doubt rapidly come down to discussion e  the reasons why it was important to win the war.   The need for such Meetings was strongly urged,as at the present time the only Meetings held were those under the aegis of the Labour Party.W.M. (59) 93rd CONCLUSIONS. 24.11.39.Minute 2. THE FIRST LORD gave a description of theunscrewing of the detonators in the magnetic raineaMagnetic Mines .     found near Shoeburyness .   The smaller protuberancehad first been unscrewed.   This had been detachedeasily.   The Officers concerned had then tackled thelarger protuberance, which they had found very stiff.They had left it alone while investigating the otherfeatures of the mine.   Finally they had applied moreforce and had succeeded in detaching it, when it had proved to be a second detonator.   It was thought thatthere might be two, and perhaps three, successiveoperations in the firing mechanism.   One might beacoustic, the second magnetic.   The nature andexistence of the third was not established.    If thiswas the correct explanation, the soundless propellorm;j.ght, so to speak, set alive the magnetic operation in the mine.   In view of the wealth of scientifictaleafctnow being applied, he felt confident that an effective antidote would soon be developed.Minute 11. THE SECRETARY OF STATE ^aid that he had receivedKinformation from a private source, said to be known byRoumania. only two or three people in Roumanian to the effectthat Germany was furnishing military supplies^Roumania to assist her to defend herself against apossible attack by the U.S.S.R.
