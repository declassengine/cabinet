knows that the weather changes every fifty miles on along flight.Minute 2.The naval situation,Minute 6.Prance.Health ofMr Savage,P.M. of MewZealand.once!Very little.   The admiralty in the shade forThe Poreign Secretary said that Sir RonaldCampbell had told Sir Alexander Cadogan that M. Legerhad been extremely depressed.   It seems clear that oneof the reasons why certain people in Prance have a down on M. Daladier is that he kept so many offices in hisown hand.   People have been saying lately that Prancehas been governed by a triumvirate - Daladier, Legerand Gamelin.   Perhaps it is cynical to say that ifthere is a new Government and a Poreign Secretary,M. Leger will not have quite so much power in thefuture as he has had in the past.    It is also clearthat a lot of M. Daladier&apos;s fellow politicians havebeen extremely irritated with him because they thoughtthat he stood aloof from them and did not take enoughpains to see them and talk to them.   This is said tobe the case particularly with M. Blum, whom M.Daladieris said not to have spoken to for ever so long.After the conclusion of Minute 7, the PrimeMinister asked the -Dominions Secretary if he had anynews of Mr Savage, the Prime Minister of New Zealand.Mr Eden said No, but he was afraid that Mr Savagewas dying.The Prime Minister then said that he well reraem-bered an occasion some years ago in the Cabinet Rooni,when he was presiding at some Imperia.1 Conference and aForeign Office Paper had been under discussion.   ThePrime Minister had asked various Dominion representa-tives for their views and they had all replied thatthey had nothing to sayt until he came to Mr Savage,who had said &quot;I have only one thing to say. that it sbunk from beginning to end&quot;, whereupon he (the PrimeMinister) had said &quot;Oh, that is all you have got tosay, is it?&quot;   Apparently, when Mr Savage had realised that he completely misunderstood one paragraph in the document, he changed his views.   We all had a goodlaugh about this.Minute, 9.Supply ofLabour forthe B.E.F..C.C.Meeting,W.M. (40)  74th CONCLUSIONS. 21.5.40.An uneventful and unexpectedly short Cabinet.We expected some fireworks about this item.   TheFirst Lord of the Admiralty had taken a very fierceline on this matter when it had been previouslydiscussed at the War Cabinet, and even a stronger linewhen the same matter had been discussed in the M.C.C.This meeting was, indeed, reported as having been thehottest meeting yet recorded of this Committee, whichis saying a good deal.   I was only present at the tailend of it, which struck me as pretty warm, but I was told the earlier proceedings had been at an even highertemperature.The Prime Minister, however, saw Lord Ghatfieldand also the Secretary of State for War before theMeeting, and suggestions were made which resulted in
a very calm and amicable settlement.   The First Lord was,I think, conscious of having taken a very violent line and was anxious to do the generous and maker amends.And so for the Easter holidays, arranged, as at christmas, on the rota system.   There was a fairly general expectation that Easter would see fireworks and that weshould all be called back again.   In point of fact, theOffice was, I believe^ extremely quiet until the afternoon of Monday, when arrangements for the Meeting of theSupreme War Council on Thursday began to boil up.minute e 4.Supreme WarCouncil.W.M. (40)  75th CONCLUSIONS.86.5 .40.A very quiet day:   nothing of importance to record.In connection with the arrangements for the Meetingof the Supreme War Council, the Prime Minister said thathe understood M. Reynaud had formed a War Cabinet of nine Ministers, all of whom had Departmental responsibilities -ties.   This was amusing in view of the fact that it hadbeen suggested that M. Reynaud was going to show thePrime Minister how to arrange a proper War Cabinet!&apos;.M. (40)  76th CONCLUSIONS.27.5 .40.Minute 1.Supreme WarCouncil.Norwegian^rritorial^Piters.It had not been intended to have a Meeting this day.The Foreign Secretary&apos; had suggested, that it might bepossible for the Prime Minister and himself to settle the line to be taken by the British representatives atthe Meeting of the Supreme War Council to be held, on the ensuing day without holding a War Cabinet.    I advisedArthur Rucker that there&apos;were too many important points to be settled for this to be&apos;quite decent.In the result we had. a long and very valuable WarCabinet Meeting.    It was one of the days on which eachsubject ran into the next, and the discussion rangedfrom one subject to another, back again, and to and froall over the place.   This has all been tidied up in theMinutes, in which no regard is paid to chronology.The only points of importance were as follows.On the general situation the Prime Ministerexpressed in the strongest terms his feelings on readingM. Reynaud*s Paper (W.P.(40) 109).   He said that itthrew a horrifying light on the French Prime Minister,who was rattled.   He thought that he must create an impression on the French mind.   None of the Frenchprojects had. been properly thought out.In dealing with the revived project for putting aminefield in Norwegian territorial waters THB FIRST LORDgave one of his&apos; typical passages.   He described ourwarships, which had been on a sweep in the Skagerrak,as hungry cattle browsing up to the fence and nibblingthrough it.   He made the point strongly that the communications which we were to make to the norwegian and Swedish Governments would involve no strongerprotests than the laying of a minefield.\
