The statement which I recorded as to Mr Sumber Welles&apos;remarks about Mussolini does not quite accord with thestatement in the printed account of the interview, which makes Mr Sumber Welles say that Mussolini had not had astroke.     The significance of this reference to a strokeis that a few days ago the Foreign Secretary reportedthat there had been a strong rumour in certain Italiansocial circles that Mussolini had had a stroke.   It hadbeen believed that he had had a   stroke some monthsearlier.minute e 5.Flying Boats:Diversion offor MilitaryDuties.W.M. (40)  68th CONCLUSIONS.14 .5 .40 .Minute 4.Scandinavia.It had been thought that this proposal would beaccepted, but the P.M. took a rather strong view against it.   It was clear that the War Cabinet could not acceptthe Secretary of State for Air&apos;s full proposals, but itwas by no means clear what the Conclusion was as to thetwo Civil Flying-boats at present diverted for militaryduties;    i.e., the CABOT and the CARIBOU.   Sir John Reith,whom I saw in the evening, and the Assistant Postmaster-General, thought that they were going to get these twoFlying-boats back;   but this was not the P.M.&apos;s intention.This was the main point of interest.   At 12.15 a.nr.the First Lord&apos;s people rang up and asked for a numberfor a War Cabinet Paper, which we received at 8 a.m.witha request that it should be put on the Agenda to bediscussed that day.   The Paper purported to be about theNaval Staff, but the language bore unmistakable signs ofa well-known statesman&apos;s fad.   The proposal that, notwith-standing the collapse of Finnish resistance, we should still go to Narvik, met, of course, with no support otherthan from the First Lord, who, towards the end, took theline that it would, of course, be a very unpleasant thing to do, but that he felt it was right to put the point upin order to see what reception it would have.Mr Sumrier Welfes .      The Foreign Secretary said that he had been informed by Mr Sumlner Welles the previous day that he had been invited by Count Ciano to meet him at lunch when passing through Rome on his return to the United States9 in orderto receive full particulars in regard to informationcommunicated to Mussolini by Herr von Ribbentrop during his recent visit to Rome.W.M. (40)  69th CONCLUSIONS.A very long and troublous Meeting.15 .5 .40.Minute 5 .Assistanceto FinlandMinute 10,India.On Assistance to Finland we had a certain amount of difficulty in harmonising views on the question whether we should attempt to recover the arms sent to Finland -either in that country or in transit.   The reference to finland rather stirred old wounds, and the First Lordasked where we thought the   German blow would fall:   would it be on Holland, or would it be on Roumania?   He also made some rather sarcastic remarks about the coal situatio(Minute 9).The main discussion was on India.   As soon as LirdZetland came into the room, the Prime Minister said&quot;Well, Secretary of State, we are all glad to see youhere this morning&quot;, and there was a sort of hum of applause,such as I have never yet heard in the Cabinet Room.
Lord Zetland then described the incident.   He had just finished speaking and was engaged in conversationwith the Chairman.   He had noticed the assailant, whoseface had attracted his attention, and he had put him downas possibly (I think) an Afghan.   He then felt as though he had received a terrific blow on the side, which hadknocked him over.   The shot must have been fired from about three or four feet, as his coat had been singed.I think the first remark which Lord Zetland made on .thematter was that he did not know why the bullet had notglanced off and gone through his heart.Minute 11.Supply oflabour forthe B.E.F.minute e 2.H.M.S.HOOD,Minute 6.Supreme WarCouncil.The main view of the War Cabinet was that if theViceroy was willing to lie back and wait, it was a pityfor the War Cabinet to put to him further suggestions for taking the initiative in dealing with the Constitutionalissue.    It was better to leave the situation to develop.The Lord Privy Seal dissented from this view, and soto a certain extent did the Home Secretary.An argument which obviously stirred considerablefeeling was that it would be a great mistake to take theinitiative and make any move which would look like anattempt to placate Congress on the eve of the resolution which it was thought they were going to pass at Ramgarh.In the end, the War Cabinet took the easy way of deferringa decision until after Ramgarh.There followed what was expected to be a short dis-cussion on the supply of labour for the ExpeditionaryForce, in which tempers were rather frayed.   The FirstLord of the Admiralty poked fun at the vast requirements in the back areas of the B.E.F.   He said that ourExpeditionary Force, instead of being a steel-capped, spearwas becoming a pin on the end of an enormous scaffold-pole- and other observations in the same vein.    It also appear-ed that the War Office had not clewed things up with theMinistry of Labour.   In the end the matter was put back for discussion at the M.C.C.THE FIRST LORD said, that it was proposed to sendH.M.S. HOOD to Malta.    She had had trouble with hercondenser tubes, which would take 45 days to repair.Although she could steam, it was believed that it was notpossible for her to go absolutely top-speed until the trouble had been remedied.The reason for sending her to Malta for this repairwas that all our dockyards were so congested that therewas no room to get the job done here without displacingother work.    It would be necessary to watch the Italiansituation before deciding whether to lay the HOOD up forthis job.There was some discussion whether this Meeting shouldbe held in France or in England.    It was really the turnfor the Meeting to be&apos;held in this . country, and doubly sosince the last two Meetings have been held in France.   Onthe other hand, some doubt was entertained whetherM. Daladier&apos;s foot would permit him to travel.It was stated that M. Daladier insisted on undergoinga very painful treatment for his foot in order to enable him to recover more quickly and to resume his visits to theFront, which had become almost an obsession with him.The result of this painful treatment was that M. Daladierwas in a very jumpy and nervy frame of mind.   It was said
that he had not slept properly for three nights at thetime of the speech he made about Finland.   This, nodoubt, accounted for the fact that he had said certainthings that he would not have said if he had been infull command of his judgment.   It was thought that itmight be a good plan to get him over here for a coupleof days and get him to quieten down somewhat.In the discussion about Holland, the foreign secretary said that M. Colijn had told him that he hadbeen anxious to discuss for a couple of hours with theFirst Lord a proposal he had for a new gospel to be put to the neutrals, which he wished to expound to theLeague of Nations Committee.   After an interview of a couple of hours with the First Lord, however, he onlygot to the point of obtaining permission to send to theFirst Lord a written memorandum explaining the point a tissue.   This had a very good reception!     (The meeting was not over until nearly 2 o* clock .)W.M. (40)  70th Conclusions . IS.5 .40.One of the most coffee-housing of all our Meetings!We wandered, all round the place, and discussed nearlyeverything under the sun.   The First Lord of the Admiralty,in particular, took a very gloomy view of what would nowhappen in the Balkans.   He thought that Roumania, andprobably Yugo-Slavia, would be squeezed, and that wewould not be able to do anything.Among other matters there was a short discussion on the Royal Marine Operation.   Reference was again madeto the fact that the French were basing their request-for postponement on the fact that 300 aircraft were atpresent in the open and exposed to great danger of attack.This, however, was generally felt to be a pretext.Nevertheless, it was clearly impossible for us to carryout the first part of the operation without Frenchcons ent.The First Lord read out a letter which he hadreceived from General Gamelin.   This letter, however,did not add very much to our information on the subject.(i spent most of the afternoon at a meeting between Horace Wilson and M. Jean Monnet, at whichdiscussion started on a memorandum which M. daladier had recently put to the French Cabinet, outlining proposalfor bringing the French economic effort into harmony with their war effort.   This was the paper on which m. Monnet had helped M. Daladier considerably in thefive weeks which he had recently spent in Paris.After about an hour, Arthur Robinson went away,and the discussion really turned on the French proposals(again fathered by M. Monnet) for setting up a FrenchWar Cabinet organisation and on methods of strengthening the French Administration.   I got theimpression thatM. Monnet stands in very much the same relation toM. Daladier as his interrogator did to our Prime Minister^W.M. (40)  71st CONCLUSIONS. 18.5 .4Q.Not a very long Meeting, but a great many subjectswere touched on.One got the general impression that the arrange-ments for the defence of Scapa had not been awfully well-56-
