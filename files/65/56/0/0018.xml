kOPY.SECRET.SIR ERIC MACHTIG/K.C.M.G. .O.B.EUNITED KINGDOM representative to EIRE s50 UPPER MOUNT STREET,DUBLIN.1st January, 1940.Dear Ivlaclitig,Your Secret letter of the 29th December.In a normal world, the decision regarding thecapital sentences imposed in the Coventry case would be taken  within the four corners of the judicial record.In so far as considerations of clemency or expediencyreceived weight it would he for reasons aeducible fromthe record.      But the world is not normal and to-day nostep can &quot;be taken without a broad survey of thelandscape.2 (a)    It may be that the Coventry crime is of a character so heinous as to override all other considerations however grave.      Clearly you do not require an opinion from me on this point.      If that view prevails you must not regard me as opposing it inany way.(b)   It.may he that the case presents&quot; quitenatural features which would justify a measure ofclemency.     Here again my opinion is not relevant.
(c) In view of the anxieties of War. it may he held that a decision in a case such as this, touching so manynerve centres, should not he taken without a broadreview of the consequences which may flow from it.It is on this last point that the Secretary ofState would wish to have my views as I survey theIrish stage.      If I appear to stress the arguments of expediency it is not because I Z.o not appreciate thatthere are other and possibly more valid arguments.      Itis because this aspect of the matter is the only one onwhich I am entitled to speak.3.    There can be no question but that the I.R.A.movement in Ireland to-day is receiving a powerfulstimulus from the fact that two of its members arelying under sentence of death in an English jail.The course,of events in recent years was graduallyblunting the memory of far-off, old unhappy things, butthe forces of ignorance and suspicion though diminishingare latent, and they are exploited by the I.R.A.      TheCause has always thrived on its martyrs and to-day after a long interval the ghosts come trooping back to the stage       Nevertheless, the audience is thinner and lessconvinced.      The I.R.A. bombings in England have been widely condemned here, though certainly not in a publicfashion.      Public opinion against the miscreants would, Ithink, have won the day completely.      Then suddenly therecomes into the picture that old. spectre of Irish history-the English scaffold for Irish patriots.The halo of martyrdom is the greatest asset tothe cause of the I.R.A.  and comes.to them   at a time whenthey
they were obviously losing grip.     We have many evidencesround us here to-day of their efforts to reassert themselves.Recently luck has been running against Mr.  de Valera&apos;sGovernment.      Owing to a flaw in their legislation fifty-fourpolitical internees were suddenly released from detention.These were the leading spirits of the I.E.A.movement.Following swiftly on their release came thfe daring coup onthe Phoenix Park Arsenal.      i.ir.  de Valera has good reason tobe anxious.      Ee can see that the executions in the Coventrycase will give a slogan to the I.R.A.  and that the task ofreasserting the authority of the Government, which is nowimperative and which in normal circumstances would not bedifficult, will assume an uglier shape.The I.R.A. clamour for the urgent and immediateremoval of Partition by methods of violence andagitation bring them into direct conflict withMr. de Valera who in his recent Christmas broadcast to america asked for help in an effort to solve the problemof Partition through goodwill and understanding.     He went onto say &quot;Need I point out ;to you that any aid, to be effective,must be given, as it was in the years 1919-21, to therightful authority, to the&apos; free elected Government of our people?     Given elsewhere, it can only lead to frustrationor to civil war, and perhaps to the loss of all that hasbeen gained&quot;. . h.
4.     To sum up the arguments in this case from the angle of expediency, I ask myself two questions -(a)    In so far as the punishment inflicted in theCoventry case should be a deterrent of similar crimesin the future, is it expedient that the capital sentencesshould be maintained?     In my opinion the answer to thisquestion must be that owing to the nature of the case andfactors inherent in Irish history and temperament, thebalance of argument lies against the capital sentences.The halo of martyrdom is maintaining the courage of the condemned men.      It will give others the courage and the call to follow them.      The blood sacrificeis an ominous feature in the history of Ireland.     EasterWeek, 1916, might have ended in a fiasco, but for its aftermath.A sentence of penal servitude would remove the halo andabstract the venom.     Our practical objects would seem to be best served by such a sentence.(fe)    In so far as the punishment inflicted in theCoventry case may have important consequences for mr. de Valera&apos;s Government, for Anglo-Irish relationshipand the problems of the War, is it expedient that the capitalsentences should be maintained?In view of what has been said above, it is not necessary to deal with this issue at length.      It is evident that the verdict in this case is a matter of moment for the de Valera Government,     A weakening of that Governmentto-day
to-day does not bring into view a Government of theright but a &quot;Government of the extreme left.    In my opinion&quot;therefore, it is expedient that we should, if possible,avoid any action which may tend to shake the existing government, to bring on the Partition issue in violentform, to disrupt the Anglo-Irish relationship of to-day andto stir foreign opinion, notably in the U.S.A., by a newchapter of trouble in Ireland.     I do not say that theseconsequences will follow, but I am certain that we musthave the possibility in mind in coming to a decision in theCoventry case.5.     With your letter under reply you forwarded aletter from Major-General Hugh Montgomery, dated 15thDecember, and addressed to Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, fromthe General&apos;s home in Tyrone, Ulster.     Prom the politicalangle I do not think the case could be better put.6,     The Secretary of State asks what are my viewson the desirability of giving greater publicity to thegrim facts of the Coventry outrage.     These seem to be wellunderstood over here.      In the quarters which alone needinfluencing the view would be &quot;It is true and it isterrible.      But it   was a mistake and they were trying todo something   for Ireland&quot;.     At present I feel that theless we have in the papers the better.     If the condemnedmen are to be executed it might be worth while trying to give the press here a lead9     But I doubt it.     Passionswould be running high and no editor wants a brick through his window.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)   J. L. Maffey.
Roinn an Taoisigh,Baile Atha Cliath.January 29th, 1940.Dear Mr. Eden,Although I arn sure that Sir John Maffey hasalready given you a full report of my views in the caseof the condemned men, Barnes and Richards, I feel, onaccount of its importance and its &quot;bearing on the relationsbetween our two countries, that I should myself write to you about it.I realise all the difficulties which the exerciseof the prerogative in this case will present to your government.     I know that these men have been convicted of murder, in accordance with law, and that a considerablebody of your public opinion may demand that the fullpenalty be exacted.      I know, too, that at the presenttime, in the circumstances of war, your Government may think that it is necessary to be stern and feel thatclemency may be misunderstood.Nevertheless, I am convinced that it will be a mistake if you let these considerations prevail.     Thereare, in my opinion, considerations of higher policy whichdictate the opposite course.     The history of the relationsbetween our two countries has already been much stainedwith blood.     Each succeeding generation of your countrymenhave deplored the unwisdom of their predecessors and themselves fallen into the very errors they condemned.: Ought
Ought you not to make sure that you avoid doing likewise,and should, we-not on &quot;both sides endeavour with all our strength to prevent the old round of violence and counter-violence beginning afresh.   Our two Governments have achieved much towards putting the relations betweenthe two countries on a level of decency.    Is it not thebest statesmanship to persevere resolutely in that course?I believe that if your Government give thismatter full consideration, they will agree.    If thesemen are executed, the relations between our peoples will almost certainly deteriorate.    It will matter little thatBarnes and Richards have been found guilty of murder.With the background of our history, and the existence of partition, many will refuse to regard their action in thatlight.   They will think only of the cause these men had it in mind to serve.The moment Barnes and Richards are dead, theymay well, in popular opinion, be enrolled in the long listof Irishmen who in varying conditions gave their lives inan effort to free their people, or to resist oppression.The execution of these men will give rise to new and bitterantagonisms between us which countries who see their profitin them will not hesitate to exploit.   Is it wise, witheyes open, to permit this thing to happen?Sincerely yours,(Sgd.) lilamon de valera.The Right Hon. Anthony Eden, M.P
