Witt,(g&amp;) iggrd CONCLUSIONS . S7.12.S9.Nothing to record .WoM.(40) 1st GOHGI^SIQNS. 2.1.40.Nothing to record.W .M . ( 40) 2nd CONCLUS IONS . 3*1.40.The Conclusions for the item on Scandinaviawere not easy to draft.   Thus -(a) While the Report of the Chiefs of Staffmentioned Trondheim, the actual discussion in -che War Cabinet ranged round Stavangerand Bergen only.(b) While it was clear that the Foreign secretary was authorised to communicate with the UnitedStates Government, it was by no means so clear at what stage he was to communicate to them,i*o**.. whether contemporaneously with the approach to the French or with the approach to the Norwegian Government.(e) It was clear that the Prime Minister wished the preparation by the Service departments to be preparation of plans, and not the actualsteps such as getting together shipping, andso forth.   The War Office, however, are very anxious to get, everything keyed up, so thatthey can go off at the shortest notice.This is linked up with  (d) Should Conclusion (iv) contain a furtherproviso that orders should not be issued toenter Norwegian territorial waters until the plans for the forces referred to in Conclusion(v) had been completed?   Otherwise we might becaught short.I am fairly confident that the Conclusions as drafted went as far as the Prime Minister intended to go,and it was therefore decided to leave these points to beraised specifically by the Service Departments if they so desired.THE SECRETARY OF&apos;STATE FOR WAR said that duringthe Christmas Recess he had stayed with Captain Taylor,M.P. for Eastbourne, who was now in command of a Battery,and had taken the trouble to listen in to the FecampStation, which he said was 500 or 600 per cent betterthan the B.B .0. and gave a first-class entertainment of third-class music.   His cook alsovthought that Feeampwas better than the B.B.C.    He reverted to the questionof synchronisation, whereupon the Prime Minister saidquite firmly that he was not prepared to go into all thismatter over again and that the decision reached should stand.It seemed better not to record this.
