Minute 1.Broadcastingof shipping losses.Minute g.Palestine.Minute 4.Old-AgePens ions.Minute 7.possible german Attackon Belgium.Minute 18.Scandinavia.The Meeting was chiefly notable for the positivelyfirst appearance at a War Cabinet Meeting of Sir JohnReith.    It was also notable in another way.   The firstitem discussed was the broadcasting of shipping losses,an item raised by the First Lord of the Admiralty, whoyielded to a request of Sir John Reith&apos;s that he (sir john) should be given time to consider an alternativesolution before discussion in the War Cabinet.   hence the discussion was postponed.The third item, Palestine, was likewise a matterraised by the First Lord of the Admiralty, and wasremitted to the Prime Minister to find a solution.On this item there was a unanimous feeling that theChancellor of the Exchequer had found what was both a sound and a rather shrewd solution of a problem which,politically, was very difficult.As regards a possible attack on Belgium, the PrimeMinister reacted very hotly to the latest telegram fromSir Roger Keyes, which strongly confirmed all the PrimeMinister&apos;s reactions to this whole project. This tele-gram seemed to show that there had never been any chanceof the Belgians inviting us in until they were actuallybeing invaded, and all the talk about guarantees was merely an attempt to get something more out of us whilethe going was good.And so to the last item, Scandinavia, where theFirst Lord again pressed, strongly that no decision shouldbe taken that day.   He put forward the view that, while there would have been some point in sending the lord privy Seal to Scandinavia if we had taken action to stop the Narvik traffic, there seemed no point in doing so in the present situation.(See note on opposite page.)W.M. (40) 16th CONCLUSIONS.17 .1 .40 .Minute 9.S candinavia.The main item of interest was another discussion on the Narvik project, this time on the proposal that aspecial Mission should proceed to Scandinavia, headed by the Lord Privy Seal.   On this there was One of thoserather unexpected swings of opinion.   Previously it had seemed certain that the V/ar Cabinet would favour sending the Lord Privy Seal.   On the present occasion, however,the opinion was that we should do more harm than good bya Mission which would inevitably involve publicity, andthe proposal was negatived.W.M. (40) 17th CONCLUSIONS. 18.1.40.Minute 1. Virtually the whole Meeting was taken up withdiscussion of the Labour Situation.   We had had someThe Labour        debate among ourselves in the Office as to whether itSituation.        was worth while to have a discussion on this in the WarCabinet pending the completion of a full Stamp Surveycovering not merely labour but also shipping, raw mater133and exchange.    In the end we had come: to the conclusionthat as it was obvious that the labour situation was notdeveloping quickly enough, it was right to give the
1orWar Cabinet an opportunity for discussion.**The discussion lasted for an hour ari$ three quarters .   The Prime Minister remarked after it thatit was one of the most useful discussions which theWar Cabinet had had.   Certainly it revealed a numberof ways of tackling the problem and the need for a concerted drive along all these different lines.Altogether a satisfactory morning.Minute 4.The naval situation.The First Lord mentioned that the Admiralty had had an unconfirmed rumour from vague sources to theeffect that two German cruisers had been sunk bysubmarines of the  STARFISH Class.   (The two submarineswhich the Germans claimed, apparently rightly, to have sunk, belonged to this Class).    It does seem possiblethat these two ships had been sunk after a conflict inwhich they had taken heavy toll of the enemy.   (I didnot include this in the Minutes, as I gather that theinformation is at present very shadowy.)While the First Lord was making this announcementthe Prime Minister burst out laughing.   The First Lordlooked up and asked if the Prime Minister was laughingat the statement which he (the First Lord) had made.The Prime Minister said No, he had been laughing at   ahumourous communication made to him by the Secretaryof State for Air, to the effect that one of the two German Officers who had come down in the famousaeroplane which crashed at Hasselt with plans for theGerman invasion, had been drunk.To my mind, this is yet another suspicious circum-stance.    If an Officer knew that he was to take partin a deliberate crash, would there not be a strongtemptation to acquire a little Dutch courage, even ifthe forced landing was to take place in Belgium!Minute 6*Air Situation.Minutes 10,11 and 12 .Scandinavia.Finland:Preparationof StrategicalPlans.W.M. (40) 18th CONCLUSIONS. 19.1.40.(N.B.   These notes are dictated onFriday, 26th January, after a rather busy week, and may therefore tend to be a littles crappy.)This was a very long Meeting indeed.The information received by the Attache was acomplete set of photographs of the Meuse crossingsurgently required by the Air Staff.(/ See next page.)The discussion recorded in Minute 12 was ratherconfused, since certain parties to the discussion thoughtthat the particular plan which gave rise to the question^ofvprocedure dealt with in Minute 12 related to Finland,whereas other people thought it related to a plan forforces in Norway and Sweden. Hence a good deal ofavoidable confusion.Minute 12 again showed the First Lord&apos;s intensedislike for the procedure whereby plans are in the first]instance sent to the Joint Planning Committee to work
