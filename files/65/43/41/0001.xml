Man-Power. 1.   The Deputy Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet(Previous that at the &quot; Octagon &quot; Conference it had been decided that for the reference: purposes of planning production and the allocation of man-power,W.M.(44)48th the date for the end of the war against Japan should be set at conclusions, 18 months after the defeat of Germany. This date would be minute 4.)      adjusted periodically to conform to the course of the war.The Deputy Prime Minister said that Departments should acton this basis in their forward planning.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Man-Power. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theReallocation Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 509) coveringbetween a draft White Paper on the reallocation of man-power betweenCivilian civilian employments during the period between the defeat ofEmployments Germany and the defeat of Japan.in the The Minister of Labour and National Service said that if the transitional War Cabinet approved the general lines of the draft, he proposedPeriod. to discuss it with the Joint Consultative Committee and thereafter(Previous submit a final draft to the War Cabinet.*Reference:W.M. (44) 113th ,             Principles governing Reallocation.Conclusions, -Minute 2.) (Section II of W.P. (44) 509.)The following points were raised on this section : (a) A sentence might be included to the effect that steps werebeing taken to decide how much labour would be allocated to particular employments (e.g., production for export, building, &amp;c).(b) It was suggested that it would be desirable to qualify thestatement in paragraph 5, that persons in Class A would be allowedto exercise their reinstatement rights and go back to their formeremployment or restart their businesses. The point might perhaps be met by the insertion of some such words as &quot;so far as this isphysically possible and no conflict with the control is involved.&quot;The Secretary of State- for Air drew attention to the importanceof not inserting any qualification, which might be regarded as a departure from what had been promised in the White Paper alreadypublished on the reallocation of man-power between the armed forces and civilian employment.(c) It was suggested that the statement in paragraph 16 (1)about women preparing to join their husbands on release from theForces might be open to too wide an interpretation.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theobject in view was to allow women, who had been transferred fromtheir home areas, to return in time to make a home for their husbandsbefore they were released from the Forces. He would, however, see whether closer definition was possible.(d) The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister for Air-craft Production said that difficulties would arise if the statement in paragraph 17 (that persons who had worked away from home. for three years or more, and wanted to obtain work nearerhome, would be given first priority for release for transferirrespective of the work on which they were engaged or whetherthey were redundant) meant that persons who had worked away from home three years or more would be entitled to release eventhough the factories in which they were engaged had no redundancyat all.The Minister of Labour and National Service explained thatthe object of the statement in paragraph 17 was to ensure that,where a number of workers were redundant in a factory, the manage-ment would do their best to re-arrange the workers with a view toreleasing those from other areas; instead of dismissing those workerswhom it was most convenient to dispense with.* Subsequently circulated as &quot;W.P. (44) 563.
(e) The Minister of Labour and National Service confirmed that persons released from the Civil Defence Services would be liable for call-up for the Forces, if they were of the appropriate age. it seemed unlikely, however, that there Would be many within the age limits.(/) The Minister of Education asked whether a substantial number of persons released could be allowed to undertake training as teachers. He proposed to discuss the detailed arrangements withthe Minister of Labour and National Service.The Minister of Labour and National Service explained that hewas engaged in consultations with the University authorities aboutre-opening Arts Courses, and that he hoped it would be possible toarrange for the early release of Service personnel at present engaged on administrative work in the Services, because they had beenwqunded or had finished their operational duties. This matter wasbeing looked into by the McCorquodale Committee.The Secretary of State for Air drew attention to the need for retaining a fair proportion of personnel with educational qualifica-tions in order to carry on the Services&apos; schemes for demobilisation and training. * &quot;The Secretary of State for War pointed out that there was a.risk of dissatisfaction if arrangements were made to include in class B persons who were not required for reconstruction employ-ment, but were being released in order to undertake further education and training.(g) It was suggested that it might be desirable not to give inparagraph 18 firm figures of the age limits for call up for the Forces.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that heestimated that the call up of men aged 18 to 25 would probably coverall the needs, but that he had added two years as a margin of insurance. He saw some difficulty in going beyond 27 and was inclined to think that it would be preferable not to give definitefigures in the White Paper.He added that, in so far as these workers were needed for essential munitions production, they would be protected by defer-ment. A sentence making this clear would be added to the white paper.ill) The Service Ministers pointed out that, since it was clearthat women would be required in the Services after the war, theword &apos;&apos; probably &apos;&apos; should be deleted from the first sentence ofparagraph 24.(i) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat a large number of younger policemen had been released for service in the Forces and that it was understood that these men would return to the Police Service. Even after their return, how-ever, the average age of policemen would be dangerously high andit would be necessary to obtain up to 15,000 young recruits in thefirst two years after the war.. - The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he hopedthat most of the new recruits required for the Police Force wouldbe found from younger men released in Class A, rather than from men within the call-up age limits who had not already been in theForces.       tThe Secretary of State for War suggested that in cases whereit was desired to recruit for central or Local Government Servicesmen due to be released from the Forces, it would be very desirableto provide full information about the openings available to the menbefore their discharge.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe would be glad to co-operate with the Service Ministers in making-full information about entry into the Police Force available to men-     in the Forces.[28375-1] b 2
(j) The Service Ministers stressed the extent to which theService Departments depended on women for clerical labour and said that, if breakdowns in certain departments were to be avoided,it would be necessary to consider very carefully the arrangementsfor the release of women and for the substitution of other labour.Service Depots had hitherto had lower priority for the supply oflabour than factories, but in the transitional period it would be essential that these Depots should be treated as having equalpriority with factories.Labour Controls in Stage II.(Section III of W.P. (44) 509.)(Jc) There was general agreement that simultaneously with thepublication of this portion of the White Paper, the Governmentwould require to make a statement on the retention of economic controls. These controls would be essential, both in order to securethe necessary production of munitions for the Japanese war, andalso to ensure that labour and materials were devoted to those types of civilian production (e.g. for the export trade, and for rehousing)which were entitled to priority on reconstruction grounds. Areport on the problem of the retention of economic controls in the transitional period had been prepared by an Official Sub-Committeeof the Reconstruction Committee. It was clear that while there could be a progressive relaxation of the controls during the transi-tional period, a large number of them would require to be retained in whole or in part throughout the whole period. There was, ofcourse, the wider question of the retention of emergency powers ingeneral after the end of the war with Germany. This question would inevitably be raised in Parliament and would give rise to aconsiderable amount of political argument. It was felt, however,that it could be distinguished from the narrower question of theretention of the necessary economic controls during the transitional period, provided that it was made clear that the Government&apos;sproposals were limited to that period.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested thatthe Minister of Reconstruction should consult with the Departmentsconcerned and submit to the War Cabinet a draft paper about theeconomic controls which would have to be retained in the transitional period. This draft paper could then be considered by the WarCabinet, concurrently with a revised White Paper on the Re-allocation of Man-power with a view to simultaneous publication.(I) The Minister of Education suggested that the form of presentation in Section III might be altered in order to indicatemore clearly that there would be a considerable relaxation of the controls exercised over labour.(m) The Minister of Education pointed out that paragraph 34of the draft White Paper dealing with juveniles was in extremelygeneral terms, and suggested that he might try to work out more detailed proposals with the Minister of Labour and NationalService. The Minister of Labour and National Service explainedthat he had already undertaken discussions with the Ministry ofEducation and the Scottish Education Department with regard tothe control of juvenile employment and that it was intended todiscuss certain proposals with the local authorities very shortly.He was anxious to dissociate the control of juvenile labour fromthe war-time system of control, and to graft it on to the neweducational system.(n) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed outthat in view of the possibility that the Japanese war might come toan end at an earlier date than was expected, it would be desirable togive consideration to the question of what controls would have tobe retained in- the period immediately after the end of theJapanese war.
The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he hadalready arranged for an investigation into the question of thecontrol of labour after the end of the Japanese war, and proposedto consult the other Departments concerned on the matter very shortly.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft White Paper circulated with.P. (44) 509 as a basis for discussion with the joint consultative Committee.(2) Took note that the Minister of Labour and National service would consider the point raised in discussion and would submit a revised draft after the discussions with theJoint Consultative Committee.(3) Invited the Minister of Reconstruction, after consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to submit to the WarCabinet proposals in regard to the continuance ofeconomic controls in the transitional period, in orderthat a Government announcement on this subject mightbe made simultaneously with the publication of theWhite Paper on the reallocation of man-power.Detention of 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMembers of the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 505)British Union, regarding the detention of members of the British Union under(Previous       Regulation 18B and the question whether any steps should be takenReference:under Regulation 18AA with regard to property held by the Union.W.M.(43)60th The discussion and conclusions reached are contained in theConclusions,     Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Minutes 1and 2.) --:--Italy. 4.   The War Cabinet had a discussion about the proposed announcement to be made jointly by the Prime Minister and thePresident about Italy. On the previous day a telegram had beensent to our Ambassador at Washington suggesting a number of amendments in the draft announcement (see Cordite&quot; 393). Inthis telegram it had also been pointed out that it was desirable thatthe statement should be communicated to the other United Nationsbefore it was made, as it represented important changes in policy..  . The War Cabinet were informed that the President now contemplated that the statement might be released on Sunday,the 24th September. A further telegram had accordingly beensent to our Ambassador at Washington, pointing out that inaddition to the considerations already mentioned, public reactionswere likely to be critical of a statement promising Italianadministration an increasing measure of control immediately afterthe lack of control shown by the recent, lynching incident. Atelegram had also been received from the Prime Minister expressing the view that postponement for ten days or a fortnight would bedesirable.The War Cabinet were strongly of the opinion that theproposed announcement should be postponed. This would alsoenable certain aspects of the proposed announcement to be further considered.The War Cabinet accordingly agreed that a telegram shouldbe sent to the Prime Minister (and repeated to Washington) asking the Prime Minister to send a telegram himself to the Presidentpressing strongly for the postponement of the proposed announcement.Note. After consultation with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, it was decided to vary this procedure andto send a telegram to Lord Halifax which would be repeated to the&quot; Prime Minister.
Finance of 5.   At their meeting on the 29th August the War CabinetRelief in the had agreed to accept a settlement of the liability for irrecoverableMilitary expenditure on relief during the military period on the basis of period. the following proportions  (Previous Per cent.Reference: United Kingdom    ...       ...       ... 25WM- (44) H7th Canada        ...     &apos;.......i.       ...        8Conclusions, United States        ...      ...       ...       ...      67Minute 2.) This had been subject to our commitment in respect of ourproportion of the irrecoverable deficit not exceeding  10 million,unless further authority was given by the War Cabinet at a later date.. This figure of  10 million had subsequently been raised to 12^ million.The War Cabinet were now informed that a telegram had beenreceived from the Minister of State dated the 19th September(No. 10 Relief) to the effect that the State Department were preparedto agree to our percentages, but wished the limit of irrecoverableexpenditure to be shared in the proportions named to be raised from $200 million to $450 million. This would raise our liabilityfrom  12^ million to  28J million.In support of this view it was pointed out that expenditurein Italy to date amounted to $150 million, and must be regardedas irrecoverable. If $50 million were set aside for the Balkansbefore UNRRA operated there, this would only leave $200million &apos;for further relief and rehabilitation in Italy and elsewhereduring the military period. The Minister of State had expressedthe view that if we were to secure acceptance of a percentage as favourable to us as 25 per cent., the negotiations should be completed at once. He had accordingly asked authority to agree to reach asettlement on the basis that the limit of irrecoverable expenditure to be divided between the three countries in the agreed proportionswould be raised to $400 million or $450 million.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, explained that theChancellor thought that- this was as favourable a settlement as wewere likely to secure, and asked that authority should be given tothe Minister of State to act accordingly.In the course of the preliminary discussion the proposal was criticised on two grounds; first, that the additional expenditure would constitute a very heavy additional burden on the people inthis country, in view of our financial position. Secondly, it was urged that it looked as though, under the scheme proposed, a veryconsiderable proportion of the expenditure might be spent in italy. The view was expressed that the Italian people were not.in so great need of relief as the people in Balkan countries still tobe liberated. It was important that we should do all we could to make sure that the countries who had fought on our sidethroughout the war received more favourable treatment than theItalians, who had fought against us. Consideration ought to be .given to the question whether we could not impose some limit onour relief expenditure in Italy during the military period.Discussion on these two points ensued. The War Cabinet felt,however, that before reaching a decision they would prefer to have before them a memorandum, setting out the considerations infavour of the course now proposed, and dealing with the points raised in discussion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,22nd September, 1944.
Japan. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that whatseemed to be a genuine ^eace-feeler had been received from Stockholm.     An intermediary who had spoken to the SwedishMinister for Foreign Affairs said that responsible circles in japan considered it necessary to get peace as soon as possiblein view of the imminent German collapse.     We proposedtonotify the United States Government and, subject to their views,,to tell them that we were not prepared to give any reply toindirect approaches from the Japanese.The Foreign Secretary said that the Japanese Governmenthad also renewed their attempts to persuade Germany to make aseparate peace with Russia.     At a later stage in the meeting he informed the War Cabinet that the Russians had refused toreceive a special mission from the Japanese, the despatch ofwhich had been connected with this manoeuvre.Hungary. Continuing, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that a peace-feeler had been received from Hungary.     Arepresentative from Hungary (General Nadoy) together with aLieut.-Colonel Howie of the South African Artillery, anescaped prisoner-of-war who had been living in Hungary for ayear, had arrived in Italy.     They had no written credentials,but there seemed no doubt that they had been authorised bythe Regent in the Hungarian Government to ask for an armistice.Colonel Howie, however, had given a slightly different accountof his last conversations with the Regent, the gist of whichTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRET NO CIRCULATION RECORDW.M.(hk) 125th Conclusions, Minute 3Monday, 25th September, 19hk

was that the Hungarians understood that Russianoccupation was inevitable, and would do all thatthey could to take action against the Germans ifAllied troops would participate in the occupation of hungary and the country was not left entirely to theRussians to control.The United States and Russian Governments werebeing informed of this approach.     It had been made clear by General Y/ilson that there could be no questionof negotiation.The War Cabinet -Took note of these statements.
