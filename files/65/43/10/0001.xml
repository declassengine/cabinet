Disposal of 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGovernment- Minister of Reconstruction (W.P. (44) 384) on the disposal ofowned Government-owned factories.FSiCto)?i6sThe Minister of Reconstruction said that he had discussed withReference-      t^le Ministers primarily concerned the principles to be followed in w M f431142nd disposing of Government-owned factories, and had agreed with&apos; ,   .     n them to submit to the War Cabinet the recommendations set forthConclusions,       .    tt8.       .... no ,Minute 6.)        m WR (44) 384&apos;Two major points of principle called for settlement: (i) Should the factories be disposed of to the highest bidderor should they be allocated by the Government accordingto broader social an d economic criteria ?The Ministers concerned agreed that there was agood case for allocation rather than competitivebidding, and they recommended that the availablefactories should be disposed of according to the criteriaset forth in paragraph 4 of W.P. (44) 384.- (ii) Should the factories be sold out-right or merely rented tothe approved applicant ?The Ministers concerned felt that there should be abias towards leasing rather than out-right sale.It would be convenient if the President of the Board of Tradecould make an announcement of the Government&apos;s policy on thismatter on Tuesday, the 25th July, when the Board of Trade Votewould be taken.The following points arose in discussion : (a) The Minister of Aircraft Production pointed out that therecommendations in W.P. (44) 384 were limited to factories likelyto become available between the end of hostilities in Europe andthe end of the war with Japan. It was difficult for a production department to say when a given factory was likely to become available, and it would be better to apply the principles to any government-owned factories likely to become available.(b) The First Lord of the Admiralty doubted whether theproposal to allocate factories according to broad social and economiccriteria, instead of disposing of them to the highest bidder, would work satisfactorily. Thus, how would a proper rent or purchase price be fixed without going into the market ?It was explained that the application of the criteria set out inparagraph 4 of W.P. (44) 384 would mean in practice a decision that the factory concerned should be allocated to a particular typeof industry (e.g., an export industry rather than an industryproducing for the home market), and that it would be still open tothe Government to allocate the factory to the highest bidder withinthe chosen industry. Again, from the point of view of the national economy as a whole, there might be cases in which it would bedesirable to dispose of a factory in a development area on very favourable terms in order to secure the establishment of an industry of permanent value for the(c) The President of the Board of Trade said that he thoughtthat there might be opposition in Parliament to the proposal that,where a lease was granted, the tenant should normally be given theright to acquire an option to purchase the factory out-right at theend of the lease. He suggested, therefore, that he should make no reference to this in his statement.It was urged that the point was bound to be raised inParliament, and that, if the general aim of the proposals was to beachieved, it was essential both to let prospective applicants knowclearly what they were being offered and to make the offer sufficiently attractive. The practice of granting long leases rather than sellingland out-right was commonly adopted by private landowners andby local authorities, and most applicants would be satisfied with the degree of security offered by a long lease.   But there would remain
certain exceptional cases in which out-right sale would be theappropriate course, and the proposed statement should indicate thatin such cases out-right sale would not be excluded.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the WarCabinet that many of the factories concerned were built onrequistitioned land, and that, before they could be disposed of bythe Government, legislation would have to be passed making theGovernment owner of the land. When he had put- proposals for anAcquisition of Land (Defence) Bill before the Lord presidents committee, the Committee had insisted on a procedure whereby anycase in which the Government sought to acquire land on which theyhad built a factory would have to be referred to an independentCommission. This would hamper the working of the scheme proposed in W.P. (44) 384, and he accordingly suggested that thisdecision of the Lord Presidents Committee&apos;should be reconsidered.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the principles set out in W.P. (44) 384 for thedisposal of Government-owned factories.(2) Agreed that the principles should apply to all factorieslikely to become available and not solely to those likelyto become available between the end of hostilities inEurope and the end of the war with Japan. .(3) Agreed that the proposed statement as to terms of disposalshould be amended in the following sense The normal procedure for the disposal of factories should be by way of lease for a suitableterm, but the possibility of out-right sale in appro-priate cases was not excluded.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reconsider theterms of the draft Acquisition of Land (Defence) Billwith a view to ensuring that the procedure for theacquisition of land on which Government-ownedfactories had been built did not hamper the applicationof the principles Laid down in W.P. (44) 384.(5) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade wouldmake a statement on the subject of the disposal ofGovernnient-owned factories in the debate on the Boardof Trade Vote on the 25th July.Parliament.electoral reform andRedistributionof Seats.(previous reference:W:.M.(43U72ndConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and Secretaryof State for Scotland (W.P. (44) .391) making recommendations on the report presented to the Prime Minister by the Speaker inhis letter of the 24th May dealing with (i) redistribution of seats;(ii) reform of the franchise for Parliamentary and LocalGovernment; and . -methods of election.(iii)The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security explained to the War Cabinet the recommendations set-out in his memorandum,and these met with general approval.The main point dealt with in discussion was the representationof the City of London. The Home Secretary and Minister of home security said that, as the proposals for redistribution of seats were confined in the first instance to partial redistribution of&apos;&apos; abnormally large &quot; constituencies, no question of altering theCity&apos;s present representation of two members would arise until ageneral scheme of redistribution had been drawn up, i.e., probablyafter the next General Election. It was the intention, however,that the Bill should make permanent provision for redistribution,and he thought that some direction should he given to the BoundaryCommissioners as to the lines on which they should deal with the[27914]b 2
representation of the City of London at a later date. The City had at present about 38,000 electors. It was intended that the spouse of person having a vote in respect of business premises should not infuture be entitled to vote. This would probably reduce the numberof electors in the City to about 24,000, which was less than half thenormal quota for Great Britain (53,110). The fact that a numberof other constituencies in London would probably lose their membersat the first general redistribution made it very difficult to defend a  representation of two members for the City. He himself thoughtthat the right course was to make a specific provision that the city of London should have one member only when general redistributiontook place. Failing acceptance of this proposal by the Govern-ment, the matter might be left to a free vote of the House.In discussion the view was very generally expressed that, as itwas not intended to alter the City&apos;s representation in the initialredistribution, there was no need to settle the matter now; and thatthe right course was that the Redistribution Bill should contain ageneral direction to the Boundary Commissions that, so far aspossible, constituencies should comprise about 50,000 electors, butthat in exceptional cases it would be necessary to depart from this figure. A discretion of this kind would be necessary in any case to deal with the special position of large sparsely populated ruralconstituencies. Any recommendation from the boundary commission would, of course, have to be brought in due coursebefore Parliament. Should an amendment to the RedistributionBill be put down proposing that a specific provision should beinserted in the Bill that when general redistribution took place, thepresent representation of the City of London should be modified, theGovernment should take the line that this was not the proper timeto settle the issue.The War Cabinet reached the following general conclusions,which they invited the Home Secretary and Minister of home security to report to the Prime Minister : -(1) The recommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference was accepted that the Boundary Commissions should berequired to undertake a general &quot;review of the state of constituencies at intervals of not less than three andnot more than seven years, it being understood that therecommendations of the Commissions would be subjectto Parliamentary approval.(2) The recommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference was accepted that, in the first instance, there should be a partial redistribution of abnormally large constituenciesonly, and that the total increase should not exceed25 members.(3) The proposals of the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security for the division of abnormally largeconstituencies set out in the Appendix to W.P. (44) 391were approved. Under these proposals the Bill would include a schedule of 20 existing constituencies (each with an electorate in 1939 of over 100,000), which wouldqualify for 25 additional members.(4) The recommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference was accepted, that constituencies at present returning two members should be abolished except where, after - localenquiry by the Boundary Commissions, it was found inany particular case that abolition was undesirable.(5) It was agreed that there should be separate boundary commissions for England, for Scotland, for Wales andMonmouth, and for Northern Ireland.(6) For the purpose of the first general redistribution theprinciple should be accepted that there should be no reduction in the present number of members for scotland or for Wales and Monmouth. The Government should. not, however, commit themselves to the acceptance ofthis principle thereafter.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20th July, 1944.(7) The question of the representation of the City of london should be dealt with on the lines suggested at &quot; X &quot; in discussion.(8) The proposals for the Conference for dealing with the reform of the franchise (including assimilation ofParliamentary and Local Government franchise, thelimitation of the business premises&apos; qualification byexcluding the spouse, and the free and automaticregistration of the university elector) should not beincluded in the forthcoming Bill, but should be left overto be dealt with at a later date.(9) Subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, the WarCabinet authorised the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security and the Secretary of State forScotland to proceed with the preparation of aRedistribution Bill for submission to Parliament on theabove lines.
