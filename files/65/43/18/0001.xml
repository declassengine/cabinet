India.Gandhi.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 100thConclusions,Minute 8.)1. The War Cabinet at their meeting on the 3rd Augustinvited the India Committee to consider further the terms of thedraft reply to be sent by the Viceroy to Mr. Gandhi&apos;s letter of the27th July (Appendix IV to W.P. (44) 426). They now had beforethem the report of the Committee (W.P. (44) 430) submitting a revised draft telegram.The sense of. the War Cabinet was very strongly that (a) wehurst be at pains to protect the position of the Untouchables in any arrangements for the future government of India, and that weshould bring out equally that there was no intention of failing in thedischarge of the other obligations which we had incurred to racialor religious minorities or to the Indian States; (b) it was important to make it clear that we regarded ourselves as in no sense open to criticism for our trusteeship of India.After discussion, the War Cabinet approved the draft telegramappended to W.P. (44) 430, subject to the following amendments : &apos;-(a) Paragraph 3. Add at end:  &quot;The object of these con-ditions was to ensure fulfilment of their duty tosafeguard the interests of the racial and religiousminorities and of the depressed classes, and their treaty obligations to the Indian States.&quot;(b) Paragraph 4. -Second sentence : after the words &quot; andthat until &quot; insert the words &quot; the invasion peril is removed.&quot;(c) Paragraph 4- Last sentence :  before  &apos;&apos; arrangements &apos;&apos;insert &quot;financial.&quot;(d) Paragraph    5. Fifth    sentence :    amend    to    read:&quot; . . . . agreement in principle between Hindus andMuslims and all important elements as to the method bywhich the new Constitution should be framed.&quot;India.financial questions.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 111thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. Exactly a year ago the War Cabinet had appointed a standing Committee on Indian Financial Questions under theChairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with thefollowing terms of reference : &quot; The Committee&apos;s first task is to consider steps to combatinflation in India. This enquiry should cover such questions as whether some part of India&apos;s capacity, now devoted towar production, should not be switched back to the manufactureof consumer goods.The Committee&apos;s second task is to examine the growingindebtedness of the United Kingdom to India.&apos;&apos;The War Cabinet now had before them a report from theCommittee (W.P. (44) 398), the conclusions of which are summarisedas follows : (a) Inflation..Considerable progress has been made by the Governmentof India towards securing command of the situation, but thequestion how much further assistance is required from outside,if India is to stand the strain involved in the South-East Asiacampaign, cannot yet be answered.(b) United Kingdom Expenditure.It is inopportune to propose any amendment of the defence expenditure Plan. Nor can the supplies which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are drawing from India be foregone. It is possible,for the present, only to ensure that the terms of contracts underwhich supplies are obtained are as favourable as circumstancesallow, and to aim at keeping down inflation, with its inevitablerepercussion upon costs.
(c) Sterling Balances.The future growth of the balances cannot be eitherestimated or prevented, and we must rely upon effecting a settle-ment in respect of India&apos;s abnormal balances at a morepropitious time. Meanwhile, nothing should be done to prejudice this ultimate settlement.The main point dealt with in discussion was the growth ofIndia&apos;s sterling balances.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that some part ofIndia&apos;s large holding of sterling was accounted for by the excess ofIndia&apos;s exports to, over imports from, other countries in the sterling area, or Canada and the United States. These were commercialtransactions, and the proceeds of the sales, whether in sterling ordollars, had been, credited to us, and we had therefore received goodvalue.There was no doubt, however, that a considerable part ofIndia&apos;s sterling balances was the result of war transactions whichwere sterile in the sense that we had received no commercial benefittherefrom. Moreover, these transactions had taken place at a timeof inflation in India, and, apart from inflation, in certain cases wehad paid altogether excessive prices. This aspect of the matter wasbeing fully examined.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had no doubt that in the endwe should be able to &quot;make a strong case for scaling down ourliabilities and for making repayments by easy stages, subject to thecondition that in the meantime this country would secure an ampleshare of the volume of Indian trade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that no obligations hadbeen entered into as regards payment of interest on these balances.While the task of negotiating a settlement of this matter would bea formidable one, he saw no reason why a settlement should not bereached on the lines which he had indicated, which would not involve us in an undue burden.This led to discussion of the Defence Expenditure Plan, whichgoverned the incidence, of military expenditure as between Indiaand the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that this plan had been drawn up in 1940 before Japan had entered the war. Ithad never since been revised,&quot; and now imposed an altogether unfairburden on this country. We were entitled to put in a counter-claim which would include such items as the part played by British naval,military and air forces in the defence of India against invasion.(Previous The War Cabinet were reminded that this matter had been reference:        considered in September 1942.  At that time it had been decided toW.M. (42) 129th.   send a communication to the Viceroy, for communication to theConclusions,      Government of India, putting on record the War Cabinet&apos;s viewMinute 2.)        that the entry of Japan into the war had fundamentally changed the situation since the Financial Settlement of 1940 had been negotiated; that, while we did not suggest that a new settlement should be negotiated at the present juncture, a further review andeventual adjustment of financial relations between the UnitedKingdom and India would assuredly be required.The War Cabinet were also reminded that the Viceroy, after receiving this telegram, had strongly advised against communi-cating to his Council what amounted to a formal reservation by His- Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the future treatment of the debtwhich Britain was incurring to India under the present settlement.The Viceroy had urged that to do so might have grave consequenceson the political situation and on the industrial and commercialaspect of India&apos;s war effort. In consequence, no communication onthe matter had yet been made to the Government of India.The Prime Minister said that he felt growing uneasiness at theposition.  He was sure that the facts of the position were not under-stood by Parliament or the public.   Furthermore, he would have[28048] b 2
greatly preferred that we should before now have given some clear indication to the Government of India of our attitude to this matter.He felt strongly that the principle of a counter-claim was justified on merits, and hoped that he would have the support of his colleagues in maintaining this attitude.After some further discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Took note with general approval of the Report of theCommittee on Indian Financial Questions (W.P. (44)398) and of the course of action set out therein. I(2) Reaffirmed the conclusion reached by the War Cabinet in *September 1942 that the basis of the financial settlementof 1940 was no longer appropriate; and agreed that wewere entitled to seek a readjustment of the position ona wider basis, which would take into account, among other factors, the extent to which British forces andmaterial, both in India itself and elsewhere, had contri-buted to save India from invasion.Oil.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 100thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. At their meeting on the 3rd August (W.M. (44) 100th Con-clusions, Minute 1) the War Cabinet had provisionally approvedproposals for dealing with the deadlock that seemed likely to arise in the discussions between British and American representatives atWashington in regard to the proposed oil agreement. Before action could be taken on those conclusions a telegram had been receivedfrom Washington reporting that there had been fresh developments and that a further message should be awaited.The War Cabinet now had before them telegrams Nos. 4179and 4180, dated the 4th August, from the Lord Privy Seal, reporting that, as a result of further discussion, unanimous conclusions hadbeen reached by the joint delegation. While it had not proved possible to secure an amendment to the draft Memorandum of understanding in the sense desired by us, an alternative solutionhad been reached which they considered gave us the substance of our proposed amendment to Article I (3) of the draft Memorandum andwhich they thought in some, respects strengthened our position.They recommended that they should now be authorised to sign theMemorandum with the statement attached to it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that the solution which had been independently reached by Lord Beaverbrook andthe delegation corresponded very closely to that which the WarCabinet had decided on the 3rd August to suggest to the delegation.The effect appeared to be that, while we did not secure our proposed amendment of Article I (3), our position was safeguarded by an agreed statement written into the minutes of the Plenary session and available for publication to Congress and to Parliament. Theterms of the statement appeared to safeguard our exchange positionand appeared generally adequate.-The War Cabinet *Took note with great satisfaction of the outcome of thediscussions and, subject to urgent consideration of the specific drafting alterations which the delegation had recommended in telegram No. 4180, agreed that authority should be given for the signing of the Memorandum withthe statement attached to it.
Man-power inthe First year after the defeat ofGermany.(previous reference erence  :W.M. (44) 96thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. At th,e meeting of the War Cabinet on the 26th July, 1944(W.M. (44) 96th Conclusions, Minute 2), the Prime Minister had undertaken to prepare a draft directive indicating the lines onwhich provisional man-power allocations for Stage II could be made IS 9j basis for forward planning.The War Cabinet now had before them a draft directiveprepared by the Prime Minister (W.P. (44) 431).The directive proposed that it should be assumed that therewould be a cut of 1,100,000 on Service and munitions requirements and that the effect of this cut should be worked out. The cut would still leave a very substantial deficit; and it would have to be decidedlater how far it would be necessary to impose further cuts on military demands and how far the deficit could be met by reducingcivil requirements or by increasing the supply of man-power. Inthe meantime, a further scrutiny of civilian claims should be madewith a view to reducing their total by about 200,000. In theallocation of man-power available for civil purposes, the restorationof the export trade should have first priority, and it should be laiddown that we could not fall short of the tentative provision madefor the first year of the building programme. Other civil standardsshould be restored where the need was greatest, but these shouldhave a lower priority. The broad lines on which the effects of the cuts on Service and munitions requirements should be worked outwere that there should be a cut of 200,000 men in the Navy, 300,000in the Army and 200,000 in the R.A.F., leaving 400,000 to be found by reductions in the output of munitions.The Prime Minister stressed the provisional nature of the directive and said that he would be glad to study the militaryproposals further with the Chiefs of Staff when they had had timeto work out the effects of the cuts. It would be for the Chiefs ofStaff to consider how the available man-power could be used to thebest advantage and, having done this, to point out the consequences of the cuts to the Government, who would then have to decide whether to accept any risks involved. Within the next month ortwo it should be possible to get a clearer view of the military tasks which still remained to be carried out.The War Cabinet-Agreed that W.P. (44) 431 should be accepted as a general basis for planning in Stage II, subject, as regards themilitary proposals, to the procedure indicated by the PrimeMinister.The provisional allocations of man-power resulting fromthis paper would, of course, be subject to review in the lightof further decisions affecting the distribution of our war effort, including the man-power review which was due totake place towards the end of August.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,4th August, 1944.
