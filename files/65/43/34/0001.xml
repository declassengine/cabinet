Channel Islands.Plan forEeocoupation.(previous reference:W.M.&apos;(40) 191stConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a report by the Chiefs ofStaff (W.P. (44) 491) setting out the plans which were being madefor the occupation of the Channel Islands when the Germans were ready to surrender, and inviting the War Cabinet to take note ofthose plans and to give approval to the expedition concerned being-held at not less than seven days&apos; notice to sail.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theChiefs of Staff fully recognised the desirability on political grounds of the occupying force moving in as soon as possible after capitula-tion. The seven days&apos; notice for which they asked could, hoAvever,be reduced only at the cost of interference with military operations.It was possible that we might receive news of the impendingGerman surrender before it became public property, in which event the interval between publication of the news and the arrival of therelieving expedition could be reduced.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security acceptedthe &quot;force of the military considerations which weighed with theChiefs of Staff. There was, however, a risk of damaging political criticism if the occupying force could not move in almost at once.From this point of view it would be helpful if, once the germans had undertaken to surrender, arrangements could be made to despatch food and other necessary supplies immediately, either by air or by sea. He asked that this suggestion should be discussed between the Home Office, the Service and other Departmentsconcerned.The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff pointed out that, unless the quantities involved were very small, pressure on air carrying spacewould be almost as great as on shipping.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the plans for the despatch of a force to theChannel Islands in the event of the surrender of theGerman garrison, set out in W.P. (44) 491.(2) Approved that the expedition should be held at not less than seven days&apos; notice to sail.(3) Invited the Departments concerned to consult with theHome Office (a) as to the possibility of sending in supplies in advance of the arrival of our forces; and (6) as to thearrangements for announcing the German surrender.Hungary.armistice terms.(previous reference:W.M.(44)36thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 499) explaining the position as regards armistice terms for Hungary, to which was attached a statement of the armistice terms proposed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recommended that,if the terms were approved, (a) they should be communicated to theEuropean Advisory Commission if the Soviet Government agreedto discussion in that body; (b) if, however, the Soviet government made any difficulty about adopting the European Advisory Commis-sion procedure, that they should be communicated to the UnitedStates and Soviet Governments by the Foreign Office.It was suggested in discussion that the following draftingpoints might be considered in connection with the armistice terms asset out in the Annex to W.P. (44) 499 :-(i) Article 8. For &quot;for political reasons&quot; substitute &quot;for political or racial reasons.&quot;(ii) Paragraph 8. -Amend last sentence to read :   &apos;&apos; such legislation to be repealed and the effect of such legisla-tion to be reversed.&quot;
&quot; Grossbow.&quot;(previous reference:W.M. (44) 116thConclusions,Minute 3.)RocketConsequences.&apos;.&apos; CrossbowCounter-Measures.3.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : -(a) A Note by the Home Secretary and Minister of home security coverings the Report of the Rocket ConsequencesCommittee (W.P. . (44) 500). In&apos; his Note the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security suggested thatno further action on the lines of the Report should betaken, and that Departments should be instructed to suspend or, where appropriate, to reverse any actionalready taken.(b) A Report by the Vice-Chiefs of Staff setting out the policywhich they recommended for dealing with offensive anddefensive.counter-measures against the flying bomb andthe Rocket (W.P. (44) 501).The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthere were certain matters in the production field upon which action was far advanced, and on which it was necessary to decide whetherit would be better to proceed or to turn back. For example, shouldthe making of plans for the dispersal of certain important factoriesbe stopped, and should the preparation of extensions to factories in less vulnerable areas be cancelled ? It might be easier in a few cases to finish what was in progress rather than to cause confusion by bringing it to a sudden close.The War Cabinet approved the policy recommended by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security, it being understoodthat individual cases would be dealt with on their merits oncommon-sense lines.The War Cabinet were informed &quot;that, although the danger toLondon from flying bombs or rockets would shortly disappear, exceptfor the possible airborne launching of flying bombs, there was aremote possibility that Paris or Antwerp or other Continentalobjectives might be attacked. It was for this reason that it was feltthat it would be a mistake to shut down all development of radiocounter-measures. Much of the research would also be of use forgeneral war purposes, and for the future.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that the productionof balloons had now been cut down to 200 a month. He hoped thatit might be possible now to cancel all production and to supply our requirements from stock. This would enable the capacity and labournow being employed on making balloons to be switched to themanufacture of&apos; civilian cotton goods, of which there was a greatshortage.The Minister of Reconstruction supported this proposal.The Minister of Labour and National Service was sympathetic to this proposal, but hoped that action of this kind would not betaken piecemeal.  He was in touch with the President of the Board29 W.M. 118 (44). &quot;(iii) It was suggested that the armistice terms required scrutinyfrom the point of view of their adequacy as regards theposition of displaced persons, obligation to provide food,the obligation of Hungary to furnish any material required by the United Nations free of charge, andpossibly the provisions for preventing Hungary fromrearming.     . .. &apos;After further discussion, the War Cabinet -(1) Approved generally the proposals of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs as set but in W.P. (44) 499.(2) Approved the armistice terms set out in the Annex toW.P. (44) 499, subject to consideration by the official committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administra-tion of the drafting&apos; points that had been raised in discussion and of any others that might arise.
of Trade with a view to securing a list of priorities for the resump-tion of civil industry, and a comprehensive and orderly scheme forthe transfer of labour was most important.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no further action on the lines of the Report bythe Rocket Consequences Committee should be taken, andthat, subject to a common-sense interpretation of thispolicy in individual cases, action already taken shouldbe suspended or, where appropriate, reversed..(2) Approved the proposals of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff fordealing with offensive and defensive counter-measures against &quot; Crossbow.&quot;(3) Invited the Air Ministry to examine the possibility ofcancelling further production of balloons.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,7th September, 1944.
