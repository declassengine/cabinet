Rocket Attack.      1.   In accordance with the decision reached at their meeting on(Previous       the previous day, the War Cabinet reviewed the conclusions set outEeference:      under (2) and (3) of W.M. (44) 97th Conclusions, Minute 2, andW.M. (44)97th considered how the carrying out of the necessary action and theConclusions,    preparation of the necessary plans could best be supervised.Minute 2.) . . . . . .Ine following points arose m the review of the conclusions :  (a) It was pointed out that the evacuation of hospital patientsfrom London should not be allowed to prejudice the treatment ofmilitary casualties in this country, pending the setting up ofmilitary hospitals in France. The Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for War should act in consultation on this.(b) The Minister of Labour and National Service undertook tomake an appeal to imported building workers engaged on first aidrepairs in London not to go home at the August Bank Holiday.(c) The Minister of Information said that he would prefer to postpone the proposed confidential talk with editors until moreprogress had been made with the plans for meeting the rocketattacks.The War Cabinet (1) Confirmed the Conclusions set out under (2) and (3) of w.M. (44) 97th Conclusions, Minute 2.-  . (2), Agreed that it would be the duty of the individual ministers and groups of Ministers primarily concernedwith each of the items recorded in those minutes to seethat the necessary action was taken and plans prepared;and that the Ministerial responsibility for these itemsshould be as set out in the Annex hereto.(3) Agreed that the work of concerting action and plans as awhole should be assigned to a small Committee ofv . -   &apos; Ministers, composed as under : Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (inthe Chair).Minister of Labour and National Service.Minister of Production.Minister of Health.Minister of War Transport. *Other Ministers would be brought into consultation as necessary. This Committee would have discretion tosettle matters brought before them, reporting to the WarCabinet as and when necessary. The Civil DefenceCommittee would, of course, continue to function andwould work in the closest touch with the new Committee.(4) Agreed that the Minister of Production, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour and National Service andthe Supply Ministers, would work out arrangements forthe shifting of production from London factories to factories elsewhere (W.M. (44) 97 Conclusions, Minute 2,Conclusion 2 (d)), keeping in close touch with the main committee.(5) Agreed that questions connected with the accommodation of Government staffs would be worked out by an official committee under the Chairmanship of a Treasuryofficial, reporting to the Committee referred to in (3).Rocket Attack. 2. The War Cabinet had before them a report by the Chiefs of security Staff (W.P. (44) 413) to which was annexed a note by Sir FindlaterMeasures.       Stewart regarding the security measures to be taken in the event ofrocket attack in order to prevent information on the fall of shotfrom reaching the enemy.It was explained that Sir Findlater Stewart had put forward, [27959-2] b 2
two alternative schemes, one of which was designed to deny all information to the enemy for as long as possible and involved verydrastic restrictions, while the other, involving less drastic restric-tions, would merely have the effect of imposing a 48-hour delay onthe leakage of information to the enemy. The Chiefs of Staffpreferred the former plan and suggested that the measures proposed under it should be put into effect when the rocket attacks beganand kept in force for a period of 48 hours within which a decisions would be taken as to whether the measures should be continued and,if so, for how long. .It was pointed out in discussion that it might in certain icircumstances be important to deny the enemy information aboutthe effect of his attack for a week or ten days. Measures such as the holding up of diplomatic communications could be carried out forthe initial period of 48 hours, without any formal intimation tothose affected by them.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that as soon as rocket attacks began the measuresset out in Appendix I of the note by Sir FindlaterStewart annexed to W.P. (44) 413 should be put intoforce and continued for a period of 48 hours, duringwhich a decision on their continuance for a further period might be reached.(2) Agreed that, in so far as was necessary to ensure that therewas no delay in the imposition of the measures proposedwhen the attacks began, Sir Findlater Stewart should now approach in confidence all the authorities responsiblefor putting the measures into force.P^ss. 3.   The Prime Minister said that he had been disturbed to seeSpeculation in the Daily Express a suggestion that jet-propelled fighters mightabout future    be used against flying-bombs.Operations. It was most important that newspapers should mot speculateabout future operations or about the development of new weapons,since even ill-informed guesses might lead the enemy to discover our plans.   .The Minister of Information said that there was no questionof disclosure of information in this case, but it was right that a warning should be given against speculation on topics of this kind.He undertook to convey a warning in the appropriate quarters.Exchange ofPrisoners ofWar withIsolatedJapaneseGarrisons.4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 404) about aproposal, from the United States Government, for an exchange ofsome 25,000 Japanese soldiers and Korean labourers now isolated inthe Central&apos; Pacific area against a corresponding number of japanese-held United States prisoners of war and (if necessary tomake up the number) civilian internees.It was unlikely that the Japanese Government would accept such a proposal, and the physical difficulties of. carrying it out wouldbe great. Were it accepted, there would be great indignation in theEmpire, and no doubt in Netherlands circles, that such an arrange-ment should have been made by the United States government without any similar arrangement in respect of their Allies.If it was impracticable to dissuade the United States Govern-ment from their intention of proceeding with their proposal, it seemed clear that the British Commonwealth should make a similarproposal to the Japanese Government, through the protecting power, for the exchange of the 130,000 troops isolated in theSouthern Pacific against a corresponding number of British (and ifthe Netherlands Government desired it, Netherlands) prisoners ofwar in Japanese hands.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,28th July, 1944.There were two alternative forms in which such a proposal might be made : .(a) That the British Commonwealth (arid  presumably  theNetherlands) should independently make a proposal tothe Japanese Government, through their protectingPowers, similar to that contemplated by the Americans,in respect of such of their own and of the japanese troops as were susceptible of such arrangements.(b) That an attempt should be made to induce the United StatesGovernment to agree that the proposal which they said they intended to make to the Japanese Governmentshould be expanded into a single Allied proposal,whereby Japanese garrisons in the Central and South-West Pacific areas should all be treated as exchangeablefor British, United States and Netherlands prisoners ofwar on an agreed equitable basis.In either event the Foreign Office reply to the United states embassy should welcome any initiative providing for the recovery of United Nations prisoners and internees from Japanese hands,and add that serious ill-feeling would be created in the UnitedKingdom, the Dominions and India by any arrangement which didnot provide for releasing some at least of the very large number ofBritish Commonwealth prisoners of war in Japanese hands.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that there was an overwhelming case against isolated action such as the UnitedStates appeared to have in mind. In agreement with the Chiefs ofStaff he preferred the second alternative method of approach to theUnited States indicated in his memorandum. The Secretary ofState added, on behalf of the Secretary of State for India, that itwas important that the large number of Indian prisoners in japanese hands should be covered by any general arrangement forexchange.The Prime Minister agreed with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs. He felt that the reaction of public opinion to theoriginal proposal put forward by the United States Government, ifit became known, would be most serious.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested that the-concurrence of the Dominion Governments, which had already beeninformed of the proposal, should be obtained before any answer was sent to the United States Embassy.The War Cabinet agreed (1) That the reply to the United States Embassy should be inthe terms recommended by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in paragraphs 7 (b) and (8) of w.P. (44) 404.(2) That the concurrence of the Dominion Governments shouldbe obtained in the proposed answer before its despatch.

Enquiry should . be made as to the considerable movement of population intoLondon which was reported by railways to betaking place, and as to the reasons for this movement, with a view to a decision on whether any steps should be taken to check it.(c) Steps should be taken, without publicity,to move patients from the London hospitals tohospitals in other parts of the country. this might involve drawing on the hospital accom-modation set aside for Service casualties.(d) The process of shifting production fromfactories in London to factories elsewhereshould continue, particular attention being paid to key factories.(e) The 10,000 Government staffs at presenthoused in poor accommodation with no form of shelter should be moved to other accommodationeither in London or elsewhere.(/) In his forthcoming statement on the war situation, the Prime Minister would giveparticulars of the casualties caused by flyin bombs, and would emphasise that members ofthe priority classes would do well to takeadvantage&apos;of the facilities for evacuation. he undertook to consider passages submitted tohim by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security and the Minister of Health.(g) In addition, editors might be remindedconfidentially about the danger of rocket attack in such a way as to keep the public aware ofits possible imminence while taking special carenot to cause alarm.(h) The Lord Presidents Committee would consider whether, from the point of view ofdefence against flying bomb and rocket attacks,it would be advisable to continue double summertime for a further period after the 13th August.(3) Plans should be prepared to meet the contingency of rocket attack on the following lines :--*(a) Transport and accommodation should beavailable in order to enable up to 2 millionadditional persons to be evacuated from london to safe areas within a period of three to four weeks. Alternative plans should also be made,for moving the same number in a shorter period to a distance of some 20 miles from London.

(Uh)    98TH    CONCLUSIONS(28th July,  -\9kk at 3.0 p.m. )The War Cabinet had before them a proposal(0. 0,S.(kk) 652 (0)) that our deception authoritiesshould arrange for information as regards the place and timing of the fall of flying bombs to be conveyed to theenemy- in such a way as to lead them to move the epicentreof their attack to a point further to the South East,It was true that this might result in a larger numberof casualties than at present in certain areas.      Butthe general result would be to cause a smaller numberof bombs to fall in densely built-up areas, and would thus produce an overall reduction in the number ofdeaths occasioned by the flying bombs.Prom the discussion that followed it appeared that the general sense of the War Cabinet was that itwould be a serious matter to assume any direct degreeof responsibility for action which would affect theareas against which flying bombs were aimed.After further discussion,  the War Cabinet:-(1) Agreed that the proposal referred tocould not be accepted.(2) Invited the deception authorities toarrange.that the information conveyed tothe enemy as regards the point of impactand the timing of arrival of flying bombswas such as would create confusion in his mind and present him with an inaccuratepicture,      The draft of any instructionsto be issued on this matter should besubmitted to the Prime Minister forapproval before issue.Offices of the War   Cabinet, S.Y/.1.

Copy Mo...:.......&quot;CROSSBOW&quot; DECEPTIONMinute to -the Prime Minister by the Chairmanof the &quot;CROSSBOW&quot; CoranitteePRIME MINISTER1. I understand, that, at a meeting of the War Cabinet onthe 28th July,  it was decided that efforts should he made toconfuse the enemy as to where his bombs are falling,, withouthowever attempting to induce him to shift his aim in anyparticular direction.2. For the reasons given below, I am convinced that actionon these lines will not be effective and recommend that thisdecision should be reconsidered.    The Chiefs of Staff, whohave further discussed the matter, share this view.3. There is no doubt that the enemy is aiming his bombsat Central London.    However, the brunt of the attack has sofar fallen short to the South-East.    About half of the bombslanding within 30 miles of Charing Cross (which is thought to bethe aiming mark) have fallen within 8 miles of a central pointin Dulwich.4. Owing to this error in aim, an appreciable proportionof these bombs have landed in the more lightly populateddistricts.    It is estimated that if he were to discover hiserror and lengthen his range,  so as to shift the pattern squarelyonto the centre of London, the present total monthly casualtieswould be increased by about i.i.,000.5. If, as is now proposed, we confine ourselves to feedingthe enemy with information of a confused and inconclusive nature,we shall run the risk that he may by other means find, out wherehis bombs are no?/ falling and correct his fire accordingly.6, On the- other hand, our chances of preventing him fromdiscovering the true facts will be greatly increased if, insteadof merely trying to withhold inf ox-mat ion, we were to seekpositively to mislead him.    This could best be done by conveyingto him the impression that his bombs are over-shooting the target.7. This plan might have three possible results:-(i) The enemy might for some reason take no noticeof the information with which we provided him.In that case nothing would have been gained or lost.

(ii) The enemy night,  on the other hand, already have reason to-suspect that his &quot;bombs were fallingshort.    If, however, at the same time he received,*    - through our deception channels, reportsindicating the exact opposite, he might heconfused and decide to make no change in his aim.In this case we   should at least have preventeda serious increase in casualties and materialdestruction.(iii) Lastly, the enemy might he entirely taken in bythese false reports and might in consequencedecide still, further to shorten his range.The result would be that a much larger proportionof the bombs would fall in open country or insparsely populated areas.      Assuming that hemoved his aiming point 6 miles to the south-east,it &quot;is estimated that present total monthlycasualties would he reduced by some 12,000.-8. I attach a table showing the estimated effect upon thecasualty rate of the shifting of the mean point of impacteither north-west to Charing Cross, or, alternatively, to apoint six miles south-east from Dulwich, the centre of the -present patternj9.- Prom this it will be seen that if the enemy were to discover and.correct his present error in range a very seriousincrease in casualties might result.      In the circumstances, i submit that no avoidable risk should ho taken and that accordingly instead of attempting vaguely to confuse the enemya positive deception plan should be adopted.10.. I am sending a copy of this minute to the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Air.(Signed)    DUNCAN SANDYS.2nd August,  19kUMovement of meanpoint of impactEFFECT OF MOVEMENT OF MEAN POINT OF IMPACTEstimated changes in monthly casualtiesTotalProm present position at Dulwich toCharing Cross^From Dulwich to apoint six miles tothe south-eastProm Charing Crossto a point six miles south-east of Dulv/ichKilled     SeriouslyInjured4-      500    + 1,600- 1,600   - b-?6oo- 2,100    - 6,100SlightlyInjuredt 1,900       -f    4,000- 5,8007,800- 12,000- 16,000
