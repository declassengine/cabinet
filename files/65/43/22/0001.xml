Ten U-boats had minute 1.)       been attacked, of which 3 were sunk, 1 probably sunk and 1 possibly damaged, while 5 awaited assessment.   In attacks on shipping,Air Operations.  2 minesweepers had been sunk and 31 other vessels damaged.Home Theatre. A.E.A.F and United States fighters had flown nearly 19,000sorties and dropped 4,753 tons of bombs.No enemy aircraft had flown over the United Kingdom.Over the battle area the enemy had flown about 1,000 sorties by day and 370 by night.The enemy had lost 189 aircraft as against Allied losses of 259.310 flying bombs had been launched, of which 1.57 had been destroyed and only 58 had reached the London area.   3,450 tons of bombs had been dropped on flying bomb installations;In the Mediterranean Theatre Allied aircraft had flown6,800 sorties for the loss of 68 aircraft as compared with 600 enemysorties for the loss of 49.Total confirmed shipping losses for August amounted to25,933 tons. - &quot;Five U-boats had been sunk during August. The germans were now transferring U-boats from their three Northern biscay ports to Bordeaux and La Pallice.Our light forces had had engagements off the French coasts on four nights. Thus, on the night of the 11th August H. M. CruiserDiadem and 2 destroyers had sunk a 6,000-ton Sperrbrecher, andon the night of the 13th August 2 destroyers had intercepted andengaged an enemy convoy between Jersey and Guernsey, many hitspn the enemy ships being observed. Both destroyers in this action had sustained slight damage and casualties.On the 12th August H.M.S. Rodney had bombarded a 12-gunbattery on Alderney with satisfactory results.During the course of the week ending the 14th AugustH.M. Cruiser Frobisher, H.M.

Valiant, which was being docked,had sustained damage.Military A new attack on Fa-laise was being launched from the&apos;north that operations. day. Meanwhile, United States troops were pushing northwardsNormandy. and eastwards from Argentan and thus narrowing the gap of retreatfor the considerable German forces in the area of Flers. The enemy had finally abandoned their counter-attack against Avranches. Theenemy forces were in a difficult position, and the outlook for theAllies was promising.The build-up of our forces was proceeding very satisfactorily.Over 15,000 tons a day had been handled over the beaches. We now had in France 27 days&apos; reserve of rations, 16 days&apos; reserve of petrol and 2 to 3 weeks&apos; reserve of most types of ammunition.There had been little change in the position on the Italian front.Some progress had been made in Florence and by the Polish troops on the Adriatic coast.Italy:[28083]b 2
Eastern.Front; On the Eastern Front the Russians had made a number of smallthrusts in the North and had held German counter-attacks in theneighbourhood of Kovno, Warsaw and Cracow.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Poland. 3.   The Secretary o.f State for Foreign Affairs said that he had(Previous just had three hours&apos; talk with the representatives of the PolishEeference:        Government.   Taken as a whole, the position was by no meansW.M. (44) 104th  unsatisfactory.   It seemed that the atmosphere at the meetingsConclusions,      between Premier  Stalin and M.  Mikolajczyk had been quiteMinute 4.)        favourable.  M. Mikolajczyk had not yet discussed matters with, his cabinet, but inclined to the view that the right way of dealing withthe situation might be that the Presidency should be conferred ona new incumbent, who would choose a new Government representa-tive of all the parties.   He thought that there was a reasonable chance that such a Government would be accepted by the Russians,although the representatives of the Polish National Committeewould resist a solution on these lines. . -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought thatM. Mikolajczyk would have considerable trouble in getting asolution on these lines accepted by his supporters in this country.&quot; He had advised M. Mikolajczyk that he should not let any constitu-tional difficulties stand in the way of seeking a solution of thepresent difficulties. There was nothing more which we could do atthis juncture.Reference was made to the arrangement for sending help by air to the Polish Underground Army in Warsaw.The Chief of the Air Staff said that two squadrons had alreadybeen diverted to this work, and that additional crews and some additional aircraft had been sent to reinforce the Special DutySquadron employed on this work. It was hoped that United states aircraft would shortly start dropping supplies.The War Cabinet was also informed that M. Stalin had promised to send supplies, and was proposing to drop a liaison officer in Warsaw to make the necessary arrangements.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that there was some risk that bitterness as a result of the difficulties of the PolishUnderground Army in Warsaw might lead to something being said which would exacerbate Polish-Russian relations. M. Mikolajczykhad it in mind to make a helpful statement on the matter when he held a press conference. It would be of assistance if the Ministerof Information would encourage M. Mikolajczyk to hold this press conference in the near future.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added that on several occasions the Polish Government had pressed him to issue some statement to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom recognised the Polish Underground Movement as havingbelligerent status. He had taken the line that any such statement,to be of any value, would have to be countersigned by the SovietGovernment. His attitude had evoked protest from certain quarters in this country, and he thought it desirable, therefore, to seek theviews of the War Cabinet on the matter.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the line takenby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was the right one,particularly as Poland was in the area of Russian operationalresponsibility.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of these statements.&quot;
France.ConversationswithM. Massigli. .FrenchIndo-Chlna.ConversationswithM. Massigli.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)25thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the future of French Indo-China (W.P. (44) 444), this being one of the matters which wouldbe dealt with in the forthcoming discussions with M. Massigli. Thepolicy already approved by the War Cabinet was that the french should be allowed to retain these territories after the war, provided they accepted such international obligations as might result from asystem of collective security. The position was complicated,however, by the attitude of the United States Government in thismatter. In the circumstances the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs proposed to leave the initiative to M. Massigli on this subject as far as possible. Discussion showed general agreement with theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; theview was expressed, however, that, in view of the exploratory natureof the talks, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs might wishto be rather more explicit as to the policy in this matter.The War Cabinet-Took note, with general approval, of the line set out in theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Man-Power.Policy in 1944.(previous reference:W.M..(44)90thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 440) about the man-powerallocations for the second half of 1944.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their meetingon the 12th July, 1944, the War Cabinet had approved the pro-visional man-power allocations for the second half of 1944 proposedin W.P. (44) 375 on the understanding that those allocations wouldbe renewed again in August. It had been hoped that it might bepossible in August to make definite assumptions about the date ofthe end of the war with Germany. The present assumption onwhich Departments were working was that regard should be had tothe possibility that the war with Germany might continue after the30th June, 1945. The available man-power was, of course,decreasing, and it was particularly desirable that departments should be able to work on as definite an assumption as possible in deciding how the deficiency should be apportioned. He suggestedthat in the present circumstances it was reasonable to ask Depart-ments to prepare and submit to the War Cabinet revised estimates of their requirements for the second half of 1944 on the assumptionthat the war with Germany, though it might be prolonged beyondthe end of 1944, would not continue beyond the 30th June, 1945. Ithad been suggested to him that it might be better to substitute forthat date the&apos;31st March, 1945.The following points were raised in discussion : (a) The Minister of Aircraft Production asked whether theacceptance of the proposal made by the Chancellor of theExchequer would affect the decisions reached by the WarCabinet at their meeting on the 3rd August, 1944, withregard to the provisional allocation of man-power to theMinistry of Aircraft Production (W.M. (44) 100th Con-clusions, Minute 4).   It was agreed that the acceptance4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 439) setting outthe statement of policy on which he proposed to base himself inspeaking to M. Massigli. Subjects to be discussed included &quot; Franceand the work of the European Advisory Commission; questions concerning the armistice, the Rhineland and the occupation ofGermany.&quot;The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this Memorandum.
of the new assumption would not affect the earlierdecisions.(b) The Secretary of State for War confirmed that, in con-sidering the needs of the Army, account would be taken of the fact that the casualties sustained in France werelighter than had been expected.(c) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Home Security,said that, in view of the additional strain on the civil defence Services in the areas&quot; liable to flying bomb androcket attacks, it might not be possible for the Ministryof Home Security to release as many as 11,000 civil defence Workers by the end of September.There was general agreement that it would be safe to assume that the war with Germany would not. continue beyond the30th June, 1945.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the revised estimates of man-power require-ments for the second half of 1944 might be based on theassumption that the war with Germany would not continue beyond the 30th June, 1945.(2) Invited the Service Ministers and the Minister of Produc-tion to submit estimates of man-power requirements forthe Services and the munition industries on the revisedassumption in time for the War Cabinet to review thepossible requirements before the end of August and to fix firm allocations of man-power for the second halfof 1944.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,14th August, 1944.
