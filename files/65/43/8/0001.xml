DiscussionsunderArticle YII.commercial policy.(previous references:W.M.(44)83rdConclusions,Minute 1;W.M.(44)72ndConclusions,Minute 5;W.M.(44)58thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinetthat a short time ago the State Department through Mr. Winanthad invited our delegation, which was taking part in the conferenceat Bretton Woods on the International Monetary Fund, to go to washington when that conference was over to resume in an informalway the Article VII discussions on commercial policy and com-commodity policy. He (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) had taken the view that we could not refuse this invitation altogether. Asthe War Cabinet were aware, the Minister of State, who was amember of the delegation to Washington for discussions on oil, had gone on in advance of the delegation in order to have discussions on several other matters, including the proposal for replacing the Lend-Lease White Paper of September 1941 (Cmd. 6311). TheChancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the Minister of state should indicate the reasons why it was difficult for us to enter intodetailed discussions on commercial and commodity policy at this moment.A telegram now had been received from the Minister of state to the effect that an extremely unfavourable impression had been created in Washington by our attitude over Article VII. The factthat we had indicated that we were unable to discuss these mattersat the present time, without explaining our difficulties, had causedresentment. This might reflect disastrously on the discussions withthe United States representatives about Lease-Lend in Stage II.The Minister of State pressed that he should be authorised toexplain the reasons why we could not make as rapid progress as the americans wished in the Article VII discussions.The general view expressed in discussion was that the Americanattitude showed some lack of comprehension of our difficulties, andthat it was not reasonable for them to press us so strongly for thecontinuance of discussions at this juncture. At the same time itwas felt that there would be advantage in giving the Americans afrank explanation of our position, and indicating that we shouldbe ready to resume discussion in the course of the autumn.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited tosend a telegram to the Minister of State, authorisinghim to make a communication to the United States,Government on the following lines He should explain that the issues involvedraised considerable political difficulties for us.His Majesty&apos;s Government felt that it was very undesirable that matters involving serious political difficulties should be actively canvassed at a timelike the present, when great battles which might bethe climax of the war were being fought. More-over, the time of Ministers was at the momentwholly taken up with other matters. We were not,therefore, in a position to resume discussions at thepresent time, but we should be ready to do so in theautumn, when a delegation of three leadingMinisters would be ready to discuss the matter withrepresentatives of the United States Government.(2) The Prime Minister undertook to set up a small CabinetCommittee of four or five Ministers to re-examine theCommercial Policy Scheme, with particular regard tothe position of agriculture, and the provisions for bulk purchase thereunder.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th July, 1944.
