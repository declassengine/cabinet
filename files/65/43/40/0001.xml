Demobilisation        1.   The War Cabinet had a short discussion as to the arrange-.and Service     ments for publication of White Papers on these subjects, and pay. reached the following conclusions : &apos;.S0hemenSU1,allCe      W A Press Conference would be held on  Thursday, , the e   &apos; 21st September, to explain the Reallocation Scheme andDates for tjje scrieme for improvements in  service conditions.Presentation of White Papers on both subjects would be released for white Papers.    - publication in  the morning papers of  Friday,  the22nd September.(2) This arrangement rendered necessary some alteration inthe dates of publication of Parts I and II of the white paper outlining the Social Insurance Scheme. TheMinister of-Reconstruction would now hold the press conference for Part I on Monday, the 25th September,and it would be released for publication in the press onthe morning of Tuesday, the 26th September. Therelease of Part II would be correspondingly delayed.munitions production.Effects of- assumption thatthe german war ends by the31st December,1944.(previous reference:W.M.(44)116thConclusions,Minute 8.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (44) 517) setting out the effect on theman-power situation and on the production of munitions of theacceptance of the assumption that the war against Germany wouldnot continue beyond the 31st December, 1944. The Memorandumsuggested that the War Cabinet should decide, in the light of theinformation given, whether the Supply Departments should now take action in accordance with the new assumption by way ofcancelling &quot;contracts or reducing previously proposed orders.The following points were made against the proposal that immediate action should be taken to the full extent indicated in w.P. (44) 517(a) The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthe Chiefs of Staff had been present when the WarCabinet reached this decision. Since that time the vice--Chiefs had not been in touch on this matter withthe Chiefs. The present moment was a particularlyawkward one in which to make a forecast of the endof the war. He asked whether it would be possible forplans and preparations to give effect to the War cabinet decision to continue, but for action to be suspended for two or three weeks, when the present operations wouldhave developed further.   ,(V) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the admiralty were not much affected by the assumption, but he notedthat a recent telegram from the Supreme Commanderhinted at the possibility of more prolonged operations.(c) The Secretary of State for Air said that he had not been present when the War Cabinet took their decision aboutthe assumption as to when the war with Germany would end. He doubted the wisdom of making such large andirretrievable reductions at the present time. They would reduce the heavy bomber force by 12^ per cent, by theend of March and by 25 per cent, by the end of June 1945.They would also cause a loss of 800 fighters betweenthe 1st January and the 30th June, 1945. If a decision could not be deferred he would like, as a measure of insurance, to see half of the proposed cut in Lancastersrestored; the Halifax output continued in the bomberform, instead of being switched to the transport form(though conversion sets would be produced), and halfthe cut on fighters restored. If the war continued into1945, there would be a great demand for bombing inorder to bring about a speedy end, particularly as land operations would be largely held up by the winter[28302-4] b 2
weather. It would be rash to assume that the air fighting would be less intense, and casualties smaller, inview of the great efforts being made by the Germans tobring into service their improved fighters.The Vrice-Chief of the Air Staff said that the case for insurance on aircraft production rested on the probability of considerable heavy fighting in the aircontinuing throughout the winter. The German nightfighter force, was still strong and efficient, and it was,therefore, important to keep up the strength of the bomber force. In fighters the need was for quality. Wewere committed to giving Russia 100 Spitfires a monthunder the Protocol.(d) Commenting  on  (c)  The   Vice-Chief  of  the  ImperialGeneral Staff thought that it would be wrong to suggestthat land operations would not continue into winter onaccount of the weather. The defeat of Germany wouldbe brought about by the combined efforts of all three services, and he did not think that special demandswould be made on the Royal Air Force to the exclusion of the army.In favour of taking immediate action to the full extentindicated in W.P. (44) 517 the following points were made : (e) The Secretary of State for War said that he was preparedto accept the consequences of the assumption that thewar with Germany would end on the 31st December,though it might be necessary to make some adjustments in the ammunition group of munitions as time went on.. (/) The Minister of Supply and the Minister of aircraft production pointed out that any further delay in taking action would mean either the continuation of the pro-duction of munitions that would never be used, orconsiderable unemployment. A start on cutting down the initial processes of manufacture was long overdueif the 31st December assumption was likely to be verified.(g) Sir Robert Sinclair said that the reduction of output toStage II levels could only be carried out by instalments,and it would be most undesirable to delay the first instalment. The plans referred to in the Minister ofProduction^ Memorandum were made before the&quot; Octagon &quot; decisions had been taken, and the latter would still further reduce our munitions requirements for Stage II. Furthermore, the plans did not assumeas great a degree of assistance from the United states as we now had the right to expect.(h) It was pointed out that the insurance suggested by theSecretary of State for Air would have the effect of changing the assumption about the end of the war withGermany to the 1st April, 1945, instead of the 31stDecember, 1944. On this basis the Ministry of Air-craft Production would only be able to release an extra40,000 men before the end of 1944 instead of 100,000,and 240,000 in the first quarter of 1945 instead of300,000. The labour so retained would then have to be released over a short period in May and June.ii) Reference was made to a telegram (Gunfire 198) from thePrime Minister to the Minister of Production in whichhe stated his opinion as follows :-&apos;&apos; I am very doubtful myself whether theGerman war will end by the end of the year. Itmay straggle over in a reduced condition into 1945.Nevertheless, I approve the practical steps youpropose to take subject to War Cabinet and DefenceCommittee agreement.&quot;
It was pointed out that the Prime Ministershypothesis did not mean that the war would continue fora number of months at full intensity, but rather thatthere would be a gradual reduction of the enemy&apos;sresistance, and thus of our expenditure in munitions.This hypothesis, which seemed most likely, would be adequately covered by the production of munitions underthe plans proposed by the Minister of Production.The general view of the War Cabinet was that on balance theneed for making a start with reductions in the output of munitionswas such as to make further delay undesirable. It was also feltthat even if the war continued for a few months into 1945, theslight reductions in the power of our forces which might follow from the proposals in the Minister of Production^ memorandum would not have any material effect upon the outcome. The generalsituation in the air did not seem to warrant the provision of theinsurance asked for by the Secretary of State for Air.The War Cabinet-Reaffirmed their previous decision that, for the purposeof estimating man-power requirements in the second halfof 1944, it should now be assumed that the war withGermany would not continue beyond the 31st December,1944, and agreed that this conclusion should now betranslated into definite action as outlined in the Memo-randum by the Minister of Production.1 3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 527) on the subject ofService pay and allowances in Stage II.Revised Scheme of Pay and Allowances.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the schemewhich he had outlined to the War Cabinet at their meeting on the5th September (W.M. (44) 117th Conclusions, Minute 10) had been revised in the light of the criticism made by the Prime minister that the scale of allowances in respect of Far East service proposed for officers paid at British rates made inadequate provision forthe various steps of rank. Under the revised scheme officers ofall three Services paid at British rates would receive a JapaneseCampaign Allowance at the rates set out in paragraph 3 of w.P. (44) 527, and Army and R.A.F. officers would receive inaddition a combined Field and Colonial Allowance, known as aFar East Allowance, at the rates set out in paragraph 4 of w.P. (44) 527. Since Colonial Allowances were already payable to naval officers serving ashore in India and Ceylon and naval officers serving afloat were eligible for Climate Pay, the Far EastAllowance would be payable only to naval officers serving ashoreelsewhere than in India and Ceylon.With regard to other ranks serving in the Far East at Britishrates of pay, it was proposed to retain the rates of allowance setforth in paragraph 1 (b) (ii) of W.P. (44) 527 but. to pay inaddition a Far East Allowance at the rates shown in paragraph 4of W.P: (44) 527. Since in the case of Warrant Officers the ratesquoted in paragraph 1 (&amp;) (ii) had included an element in respectof Field Allowance, it would be necessary to make an adjustment in those rates now that compensation for Field Allowance was tobe included in the proposed Far East Allowance.The cost of the revised scheme would be substantially higher,but in view of the uncertainty as to the strength of the Forces tobe employed in the Far East no accurate estimate was possible.The following points arose in discussion : (a) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was not satisfied that the revised proposals provided for enoughdifferentiation in the rates payable to other ranks.   The
result of this would be to diminish the incentive topromotion. He would prefer a scheme under whichthe allowances set forth in paragraph 1 (b) (ii) wouldbe Is. 3d. for a leading seaman, Is. Qd. for a pettyofficer and Is. Sd. for a chief petty officer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had understood that all three Service Departments were satisfied with the proposals. The scheme which he had outlined to the War Cabinet on the 5th September didnot provide any greater measure of differentiation thanthe revised proposals. He would see whether any minor adjustments could be made to meet, the Admiralty&apos;spoint, but in its essentials the revised scheme, which hadthe full support of the other Service Departments, must stand.This was agreed to.(&amp;) It was suggested that in presenting the proposals in theWhite Paper care should be taken to avoid any confusionbetween those increases which were, and those whichwere not, subject to income tax.(c) The Minister of Education pointed out that there had notbeen time to consult the Government of India about the revised scheme and suggested that it should be left opento the Government of India to propose increases in the pay of senior officers paid under the Indian Pay Codeif on examination it were found that, having regard tothe increases which officers of corresponding rank paid at British rates would receive by way of JapaneseCampaign Allowance, such increases were justified.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the disparity between the Indian and British rates was so great that it was most/unlikely that any case could bemade out for an increase. He would not oppose an examination of the matter, however, provided that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were not committed to acceptthe Government of India&apos;s proposals.(d) The Minister of Education asked that the announcementof the increases for personnel paid at British rates should make it clear that the Far Eastern allowance was   in   substitution   for   the   Field   and   Colonialv Allowance.  Otherwise there would be a demand foe comparable increases from those paid under the IndianPay. Code, which already provided for an elementcomparable to Colonial Allowance.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved &quot;the proposals in paragraphs 1 to 5 of W.P. (44)527, subject to the points made in paragraphs (b), (c)and (d) above.Should the improvements be taken into account as regards family allowances, dependants&apos; allowances and war service grants tThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Service Depart-ments had all urged that these increases should not be taken intoaccount for the purpose of family or dependants&apos; allowances. Hewas prepared to acquiesce in this view. On the other hand, he was clearly of opinion that the increased emoluments should be takeninto account for the purpose of war service grants. Any other coursewould lead to results which could not be justified. But there would no doubt be some agitation in favour of ignoring the increases nowproposed in the calculation of war service grants.The Minister of Pensions agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s view.   But it must be recognised that a decision in
this sense would lead to appeals being made to Members ofParliament in individual cases. Any decision now reached to take into account the improved emoluments in assessing war servicegrants must be adhered to in the face of such agitation.. The Minister of Pensions said that&apos;he assumed that, as on previous occasions, 4/7ths of the increases would be taken intoaccount in reassessing war service grants. He also added that the review of war service grants would have to be spread over aconsiderable period.The War Cabinet-(2) Decided that the increases now proposed should not betaken into account for the purpose of family and dependants&apos; allowances, but should be taken into account for the purpose of war service grants; and that a state-ment to this effect should be included in the White Paper.Date from which the improved emoluments should take effect.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that it had alreadybeen agreed that the introduction of the proposed improvementsshould not be deferred until after the armistice with Germany but should take effect from a current date.The Minister of Labour and National Service urged that thenew benefits should be introduced with effect from the 3rd Septem-ber, 1944, and pointed out that there would be considerable advantage in making increases on account of long service payableas from the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the war.On the other hand, it was represented that it would be adminis-tratively difficult to arrange for payment of the increased amountsto be made before the 1st November, 1944. It was also generally feltthat to make special additions in respect of service in the Far Eastpayable from the same date would not be readily acceptable to thosewho were now engaged in hard fighting in North-West Europe. Onthis ground there was a good deal to be said for making the special allowances for those who undertook service in the Far East take effect from the 1st November, 1944.The War Cabinet decided *(3) That the improvements in respect of long service shouldtake effect from the 3rd September, 1944; but that the improvements in respect of service in the Far East shouldtake effect from the 1st November, 1944.Proposal to grant an additional period of paid leave to men held for service in the Far East.Discussion followed on the proposal which had been put forward for consideration by the Prime Minister that, to meet the anxiety ofmen held for service in the Far East as to whether they would find employment on their ultimate return, an undertaking might be given that any man who failed to secure employment within his periodof paid leave after demobilisation should continue to receive his service pay and. allowances while unemployed, within a period of12 months from his demobilisation.The War Cabinet gave very careful consideration to this matter.It was generally agreed that it might well take longer to find employ -ment for men on final demobilisation than for those demobilised atthe end of the war with Germany.&apos;&apos; If this proved to be the case,there would be mUch to be said for some extension of the period ofpaid leave, to the extent and subject to such conditions as might befound to be necessary when the time came.On the other hand, it was felt that to promise at this juncture aperiod of paid leave considerably in excess of the period of 56 days(plus the foreign service addition) already included in the demobili-sation scheme, would have serious disadvantages. There was a risk that men who had a firm promise of a long period of paid leavemight be disinclined to take jobs offered to them, more especially ifthe pay of the job was below that which they would receive during
paid leave. Further, to give an undertaking now of a year&apos;s paidleave might also have a bad effect on public opinion by making it appear that the conditions of service in the Far East must be veryunpleasant if it were necessary to offer such great inducements. Itwas also pointed out that the period of 56 days which was includedin the general scheme was already regarded in many quarters as avery generous provision. In the last war no such provision had beenmade. . .The general conclusion of the War Cabinet on this point was asfollows  *(4) On balance it was undesirable at this stage to make any provision for a special increase in paid leave on demobilisation for those who had served in the far east, beyond the provision already included in thegeneral scheme. The matter was one for examination-in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the endof the Japanese war.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,lQth September, 1944.
