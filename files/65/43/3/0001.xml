Air Raids.Attacks by flying Bombs.(previous kef erence:W.M.(44)85thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. Some discussion took place about the attacks by flying1bombs, in the course of which the following points were made : (i) The Prime Minister said that a considerable proportion ofthe letters received from the general public urged that counter-measures should be taken against Germany in respect of the use ofthis indiscriminate form of attack.(ii) It was important that steps should be taken to look to the daily cleansing of the shelters in use. The Home Secretary and minister of Home Security undertook to raise this point with theMinister of Health, with whose Department the responsibilityrested.(iii) It was stated that the term &quot; seriously injured &quot; coveredall cases admitted to hospital, even for a very short period, and thatthis use of the term made the casualty list look worse than it was.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the present system ofcategorising casualties had been in force for a long time, and thatthere would be difficulties and disadvantages in adopting a newcriterion at this stage. The Home Secretary and Minister of home security undertook to examine this point in consultation with theMinister of Health.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.General 2.   The War Cabinet were informed that General AlexanderAlexander. had arrived in this country for a short visit. The view was generallyexpressed that, provided there was no objection on military orsecurity grounds, his visit to this country should be made public andthat, if possible, General Alexander should make an appearance atsome public gathering or ceremony which would provide an oppor-tunity for some recognition of his achievements.The Prime Minister undertook to find out from the militaryauthorities whether any objection was seen to a public announce-ment of General Alexander&apos;s visit to this country. Provided noobjection was seen, the Prime Minister also undertook to consider what arrangements could be made to give effect to the War Cabinet&apos;suggestion as to General Alexander&apos;s appearance at some publicceremony.Post-Wa?FinancialCommitmentsand social insurance.3.   The War Cabinet had before them the following : (i) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer onour post-war financial commitments (W.P. (44) 353).(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstructioncovering a draft of Part I of the White Paper on social insurance (W.P. (44) 356).(iii) A Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security and the Minister of Recon-struction covering Part II of the draft White Paper on social Insurance (W.P. (44) 357).The War Cabinet had a general discussion of our post-warfinancial commitments, in the course of which it was pointed outthat to a very considerable extent the social security scheme andother plans for improving the standard of life were dependent on building up a satisfactory volume of export trade after the war.It was also urged that there was need for caution in accepting any fresh financial commitments until we could see our way clearlythrough the grave difficulties of the post-war period.On. the other hand, it was urged that the introduction of a social security scheme would provide an element of stability afterthe war which would make an important contribution to industrialcontentment and efficiency.
The main point dealt with in discussion was whether Parts Iand II of the draft White Paper should be presented to Parliamentforthwith, with a view to debates in both Houses before the Recess.In favour of this course, it was pointed out that, if the white paper was not presented in time to enable a new Ministry of social security to be established by the end of the summer, there might bea year&apos;s delay in passing the necessary legislation. It was alsourged that there was considerable public interest in the scheme,particularly among the fighting forces, and that delay in publishing the White Paper might be misinterpreted.On the other hand, it was argued that, owing to otherpreoccupations, the schemes, if published now, would not receive theattention which they deserved from Parliament, the Press or thegeneral public. Moreover, the Parliamentary time-table until the recess was very tight, and, while it seemed just possible to find timefor debates on the White Paper and for other essential businessbefore the House rose for the Recess (the 4th August on present plans), there was no margin for unforeseen contingencies. It wasalso felt that a considerable volume of public opinion might feelthat the Government was out of harmony with public feeling if, atthe present juncture, it were to present a White Paper dealing withso far-reaching a scheme.The War Cabinet-(1) Decided that publication of Parts I and II of the white paper on Social Insurance should take place when theHouse reassembled after the Recess.(2) Agreed that the Leader of the House should, on an appropriate occasion, state that the White Paper wouldbe presented when the House reassembled after the recess, and should add that His Majesty&apos;s government did not consider that the present was an appropriate moment to publish particulars of so far-reaching ascheme.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,UK July, 1944.
