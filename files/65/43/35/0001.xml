The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security informed the War Cabinet that two missiles had fallen the previous evening one in Chiswick and one near Epping. From investigation, itappeared almost certain that these missiles were rockets of the typeexpected. They had caused large craters, but there was less blastthan from the flying bomb, and there had been few casualties.The. Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been noradar trace of these rockets, but the sound-ranging organisation had plotted them, and their observations showed that they had come one from the neighbourhood of Eotterdam and the other fromthe direction of Amsterdam. Owing to the lack of radar trace, nowarning was received, and therefore no jamming could be put intooperation. The Vice-Chiefs of Staff had considered the positionearlier in the day, and counter-measures in accordance with the previously arranged plan had been put into operation, i.e., Intrudershad patrolled during the night, and armed reconnaissance had beensent out early in the morning. So far, there were no reports, and nofurther rockets had arrived. The Vice-Chiefs of Staff had arranged for the Service Staffs to consider immediately whether steps shouldbe taken to send mobile radar sets or sound-ranging and flash-spotting equipment to Belgium, from where there would be a better chance of locating the firing-points.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained to theWar Cabinet the military situation in Belgium and Holland, andthe probable course of operations. He said that he had telegraphedto Field-Marshal Montgomery asking him to give an estimate ofwhen the area Rotterdam-Utrecht-Amsterdam would be sealed offor captured. The reply to this would enable the Staffs to form an opinion as to whether apparatus could be got to Belgium in time tomake it worth while sending it. The^ Chiefs of Staff had previouslyrecommended to the War Cabinet (W.P. (44) 413) that, if rocketattacks started, certain drastic measures should be taken to preventinformation leaving the country. They now felt that the conditions were entirely different from those in which their previous report had been made, and that no such drastic steps were called for. Theirsuggestion was that the only security measure that need be takenwas to instruct the Press that no reference should be made to thefirings, or, if this could not be done, at least to the fall of shot. the vice--Chiefs of Staff felt that no serious attack could be developedby the enemy, whose organisation in Holland must have&apos; beenhurriedly improvised, and any attacks would probably be of shortduration.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security then putforward certain points on which decisions were required, asfollows : (a) Publicity. There were arguments for and against a state-ment to the public at the present time. On the whole, he was inclined to recommend that there should be no publicity for at least24, and perhaps 48, hours, but that information should be givenconfidentially to the Press. If in the meanwhile further rocketattack developed, it might be necessary to reconsider the matter, andhe asked that some discretion should be given to himself, in con-junction with the Minister of Information, to act as might seem necessary.(b) Warning of A attack. It was clearly impossible in presentcircumstances to give a warning of the arrival of rockets. He had considered whether to sound the alert in the evening, so as to inducepeople to take shelter at night, but he had decided against this course the previous evening, and he proposed that there should be nosounding of the alert unless a more serious attack developed.&apos; (c) The Closing of the Tube -Under present arrangements thetube under the river between Waterloo and Leicester Square was closed to the public on the sounding of an alert, though this precau-tion had not been thought necessary at the beginning of the attack by flying bombs.  There would obviously be no sounding of the alert
33W.M. 119 (m).for the fall of each rocket, and there was the danger that one mightpenetrate the tube,, with disastrous results. The chances were extremely small, however, and he recommended that for the moment the tube should remain open.(d) Evacuation. The Minister of Health would require toknow whether any change was to be made in the present planswhereby no further evacuation was being made, but people werebeing discouraged from returning. He suggested that this policy should remain unchanged.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note that all possible counter-measures were beingtaken, and that, if possible, apparatus for the location of firing-points would be moved to Belgium, so as toimprove the chances of getting warning of attack.(2) Agreed that the security measures set out in Appendix I toW.P. (44) 413 should not be applied.(3) Agreed that for the present there should be no publicity ofany kind the matter to be reviewed on Monday unless attacks on an appreciable scale developed in the interval, when the Home Secretary and Minister of home security, in consultation with the Minister of Informa-tion, should use his discretion in the matter. In the meanwhile, confidential information should be given tothe Press.(4) Approved the proposals of the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security set out at &quot; X &quot; above.(5) Invited the Vice-Chiefs of Staff to instruct S.O.E. toendeavour to obtain information from the ResistanceMovement in Holland of the rocket storage, handling,and firing arrangements, so that air attacks could beprofitably directed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
