Fire Services 1.   The Home Secretary and Minister of  Home SecurityRegulations. explained that through an oversight, which he very much regretted,Need for Bill there had been a failure to lay before Parliament a number ofof Indemnity. Regulations made under the Fire Services (Emergency Provisions)Act, 1941. Although it might be argued that this did not invalidateaction taken under the Regulations, since they came into force assoon as they were made, he had come to the conclusion, afterconsultation with the Attorney-General, that the proper course was to introduce a Bill of Indemnity. He hoped that it would bepossible to get the necessary legislation through Parliament beforethe Recess.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security.Man-Power inthe First year after the defeat ofGermany.(previous reference:W.M.(44)48thConclusions,Minute 4 (2).)2. The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on Man-Power in the First Year after the Defeat ofGermany : (i)*By the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (44) 380) giving a revised estimate of the minimum forces required to fulfil our military commitments;(ii) By the Minister of Production (W.P. (44) 373) giving thelabour required to provide munitions for these forces;(iii) By the Minister of Labour and National Service and theMinister of Reconstruction (W.P. (44) 362) giving anestimate of civil requirements;(iv) By   the  Minister   of  Labour   and   National   Service(W.P. (44) 379) giving the estimated supply of man-power ;(v) By the Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  (W.P. (44) 381)focussing the main issues arising out of the abovememoranda;(vi) By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (44) 410) statingthat the figure given in W.P. (44) 362 for agriculturalman-power- in Stage II was inadequate.In the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ memorandum it was shown that there was a gap of If millions between the estimatedman-power supplies and the requirements which would have to bemet if we were to meet our four main objectives in Stage II. the objectives were : (a) To make our contribution to the Japanese war and theForces of occupation in Europe.(6) To re-expand our contracted export trade so that we canbegin to move towards the. position where we canpay with exports for our necessary imports.(c) To rebuild our cities and begin to overtake the arrears of housing and maintenance.(d) To raise somewhat the greatly reduced standards of civilconsumption.This calculation assumed that we should receive from theUnited States and Canada the lend-lease aid for which we intendedto ask.The main question at issue was how this deficiency of If millions in man-power should be distributed. The Chancellor of theExchequer proposed in his memorandum that an allocation of man-power to the Services and their Supply Departments should first be fixed.Several Ministers took the view that the allocations proposedto meet (&amp;), (c) and (d) above represented a bare minimum. thus it was pointed out that the allocations proposed would only restore the standards of civil consumption to about 4/5ths of the pre-war
level. Since these allocations were susceptible of little if any reduction, the most practical course would, therefore, be to decide that the total man-power allocation to the Services and munitionsshould be reduced by 1 million or, say, 1^ million, and to invite theService and Supply Departments to prepare revised plans on that basis.It was also pointed out that production programmes had to befixed some considerable time ahead. The Americans were busyrevising their production programmes, and unless we made knownour needs for munitions under lend-lease there was grave danger that the American programmes would be fixed on a basis whichwould not make adequate provision for them. A decision wastherefore required in the near future.On the other hand, it was urged that, while there miglit well have to be some reduction in the allocations proposed for the Servicesand munitions, it was not enough to give the Chiefs of-Staff a globalfigure. The Service Departments were entitled to be given more precise guidance as to the commitments against which provision hadto be made. In many respects the Chiefs of Staff, in preparing their memorandum, had to proceed on assumptions on matters on whichhitherto guidance had not been afforded to them.The following points were mentioned as relevant to the forces required for occupying Germany : -(i) The conditions which it might be assumed would exist inGermany after the defeat;(ii) The extent to which we should be able to rely on GermanCivil authorities to keep order;(iii) The extent to which Allied man-power could be used toprovide forces of occupation.It was also suggested that the limiting factor on the forces which we could deploy and maintain in the Far East might well prove to be the shipping available, and that this aspect of theproblem would repay closer examination.Another suggestion made in discussion was that the rightmethod of dealing with the problem would be to make a high-levelapproach to the Americans and reach a, firm agreement with them,as to the minimum forces, land, sea and air, which they would expectus to deploy in the Pacific in Stage II. It was pointed out, however,that this course might be attended by some dangers, since there were signs that certain authorities in the United States would take theview that any man-power released from the British forces in stage II should be employed in munitions production, and that theonly munitions which we could expect to receive from the UnitedStates on lend-lease in Stage II would be articles which we were unable to manufacture ourselves.No formal conclusion was recorded. The Prime minister unertook to prepare a draft directive in the light of the discussion,indicating the lines on which provisional man-power allocations for stage II could be made, as a basis for forward planning.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2$th July, 1944.
