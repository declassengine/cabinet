operations in Italy.Statement byGeneralAlexander.1.   The Prime Minister, on behalf of the War Cabinet, extendeda welcome to General Alexander.   He was sure that the WarCabinet would like to hear from General Alexander an account of-the Italian Campaign.General Alexander gave the War Cabinet an account of themain outstanding points of the winter campaign in Italy, of the battle which had resulted in the capture of Rome, and of the future prospects in this theatre. A record of this account is contained inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.At the conclusion of General Alexanders statement, The PrimeMinister thanked him for the extremely lucid account which he had given. The War Cabinet had the highest admiration for GeneralAlexanders achievements, and the fullest confidence that he would achieve still further success. On their behalf he wished general alexander all good fortune.&quot;Overlord &quot;Security.(previous reference:W.M.(44)84thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. At their meeting on the 29th June (W.M. (44) 84thConclusions), when the War Cabinet had discussed the withdrawalof the special Overlord &quot; security restrictions, some objection hadbeen taken to the withdrawal of restrictions in oases where a public announcement would be necessary, and it had been agreed that sir Findlater Stewart should report further on these cases.The War Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (44) 374) covering a report preparedby Sir Findlater Stewart in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned and with S.HA.E.F.Visitors&apos;&apos; Ban.The report pointed out that without a public announcement itwould be impossible to reduce the area subject to the visitors&apos; banand very difficult to relax restrictions on entry into the banned area in favour of particular classes. S.HA.E.F. were agreeable to thewithdrawal of the ban in the area to the west of Southampton andto a public announcement about this change, but they would prefer that no addition should be made to the classes allowed to enter theareas left subject to the ban. On the other hand, the Ministry ofHealth and the Scottish Office asked that women and children fromareas liable to attack by flying bombs should be allowed to enter theareas left subject to the ban.The War Cabinet felt that it should be possible without a public announcement to arrange for some administrative relaxation of therestrictions on entry into the areas subject to the ban, in favour ofpersons from areas liable to attack by flying bombs. It might, forexample, be possible for the local authorities of the areas liable toflying bomb attacks to inform persons in these areas that no objection,would be taken to their entering&apos; the areas subject to the visitors&apos; ban.In fact, a certain number of people from East London were alreadyfinding their way into areas in Essex subject to the ban; and thePolice Authorities were not stopping this movement.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal to remove the visitors&apos; ban fromthe area west of Southampton and agreed that a public announcement about the change should be made.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security,in consultation with the Secretary of State for War,the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland, to consider what steps might be taken withouta public announcement to relax the restrictions in theareas left subject to the visitors&apos; ban, in order to permit the entry of persons from areas liable to attack by flyin bombs.[27830]b2
Overseas Travel.No general relaxation of the restrictions on overseas travelcould be made without a public announcement and to this S.H.A.E.F.were strongly opposed. S.H.A.E.F. had agreed, however, that theHome Office should reinstate compassionate reasons in the list ofcriteria justifying the grant of an exit permit and should make an announcement to this effect.The War Cabinet (3) Agreed that the restrictions on overseas travel should beretained, subject to the addition of compassionatereasons to the list of criteria justifying the grant of anexit permit, and that an announcement of this limitedconcession might be made.Irish Travel.A public announcement would be necessary if travel on ordinary business between Great Britain and Ireland was to be facilitatedand if encouragement Avas to be given to the flow of Irish workers to Great Britain. If no public announcement were to be made and S.H.A.E.F. were strongly against any such announcement allthat could be done was to relax the present stringent control oftravel for compassionate reasons.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that if theIrish travel ban were relaxed generally at the present time, therewas a danger that large numbers of Irish workers now in thiscountry would immediately return to Ireland. He would thereforeprefer that the ban should remain in force until the August bank holiday.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe present stringent control of travel should be relaxed and cases of hardship or great inconvenience might be considered as well ascases based strictly on compassionate grounds. He would probablybe questioned in Parliament, and his reply would have to be onthe lines that it was realised that the complete ban on travel toIreland had imposed hardship on certain classes and that for thisreason the Government were making certain relaxations of therestrictions.It had been necessary to arrange for the transfer of a largenumber of the Gibraltarians who were now in London to NorthernIreland. Difficulties had arisen in finding accommodation for theseGibraltarians in Gibraltar and La Linea, and for this reason it.was not possible to send all of them immediately back to their homes.The War Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the general restrictions on travel betweenGreat Britain and Ireland should be retained.(5) Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of home security to relax the present stringent control of travel in order to cover certain types of cases in which the banwas causing hardship and great inconvenience; and, if need be, to make an announcement to this effect.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to take up with the Governor of Gibraltar the question of sendingback to Gibraltar a larger number of the. Gibraltariansnow in this country.Air Lines.If the Aer Lingus Teoranta and the Swedish A.B. AeroTransport Services were reopened the fact would become knownimmediately, and for this reason it was suggested that the services should remain suspended for a further period. S.H.A.E.F. were infavour of this proposal and the Departments concerned accepted it.
The War Cabinet-(7) Approved the proposal to defer the reopening of theAer Lingus Teoranta and the Swedish A.B. AeroTransport Services for a further period.Telephone Calls to Ireland.Although it would -be possible to relax the restrictions ontelephone calls between Great Britain and Ireland by adminis-trative action, the relaxation would be bound to become known in avery short time. If, therefore, the general restrictions on Irishtravel were maintained, the restrictions on telephone calls betweenGreat Britain and Ireland should also remain.The War Cabinet-(8) Agreed that the restrictions on telephone calls betweenGreat Britain and Ireland should be retained.Expeditionary Force Messages.If the ban on Expeditionary Force Messages were removed theenemy would soon know that the service had been restored, eventhough no public announcement were made. S.H.A.E.F. saw noobjection to an announcement, since it was unlikely that the enemy would attach much importance to the reopening of the service.The War Cabinet-,(9) Approved the restoration of the E.F.M. service.Air Mail.The air mail services to foreign countries and Gibraltar and to prisoners of war in Germany should be restored and that a public announcement to this effect should be made. S.H.A.E.F. would not object to a public announcement.The War Cabinet-(10) Agreed that the air mail services to foreign countries and gibraltar and to prisoners of war in Germany shouldbe restored.Second-Class Mails to Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.An amendment to the Control of Communications Order wouldbe necessary in order to remove the restrictions on the export ofparcels and local newspapers to the troops in Northern Ireland and gibraltar. The enemy would attach little, if any, significance tothis step.The War Cabinet-(11) Agreed that the Control of Communications Order shouldbe amended so as to remove the restrictions on theexport of parcels and local newspapers to the troops inNorthern Ireland and Gibraltar.Further Review of Restrictions.It was suggested that the position should be reviewed in amonth&apos;s time with a view to deciding, in the light of the situation,whether the restrictions which had not already been removed mightbe withdrawn. If in the meantime the situation changed the relaxation of the restrictions could be considered forthwith.The War Cabinet-(12) Agreed that on the 1st August Sir Findlater Stewartshould review the restrictions still in force, inconsultation with the Departments concerned and withS.H.A.E.F.
Turkey.(previous reference:W.M.(44)65thConclusions,Minute 2.)Future world organisation.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet of the latest developments as regards our policy towards Turkey. A record of the discussion is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The War Cabinet had before them, a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on Future World Organisa-tion (W.P. (44) 370) to which were appended amended versions of memoranda A and B (previously circulated as annexes toW.P. (44) 220).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we were under an obligation at some stage to communicate to the UnitedStates and Soviet Governments Memoranda giving our views about future World Organisation, with a view to non-committaldiscussions at the official level in Washington. In their revisedform the Memoranda now before the War Cabinet took into account the views expressed by the Dominions Prime Ministers and were broadly in line with the wishes of the Dominions.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs did not anticipatedifficulty with the Dominions. Canada had already agreed, subjectto minor amendment. New Zealand and South Africa had agreed at the official level; Mr. Curtin, however, wished to submit the papers to his Government, and some delay might be inevitable there.He suggested that he should be authorised to telegraph to theDominion Governments the amendments now proposed, and thatthe instructions ultimately given to our Delegation to washington should also, when the time came, be communicated to theDominions.Lord Halifax pointed out that paragraph 46 of Memoran-dum B provided that there should be &quot; no attempt to lay down inadvance any rigid definition of the occasions on which such action should be taken &quot; for the maintenance of peace and security, thoughthat action when taken should be in accordance with the principles and objects of the World Organisation. It had recently beensuggested to him that there would be advantage in distinguishing between the enforcement of the terms of peace to be imposed upon germany and Japan, and general security. The enforcement of thepeace terms might be expected to ensure the peace of the world formany years, and to become a matter in respect of which thePresident of the United States at the time could act in the same way as he had been able to act over the Nine-Power Treaty.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theMemorandum had, not been intended to exclude an arrangement ofthis nature. He would consider further the wording of Section 46so as to ensure that it did not exclude action to enforce Treaties.The War Cabinet-. (1) Approved the revised version of Memoranda A and Bappended to W.P. (44) 370, and Memoranda C, D,and E appended, to W.P. (44) 220.(2) Invited the Armistice and Post-War Committee to considerthe points in regard to which those Memoranda set outalternative solutions, and to make recommendations tothe War Cabinet upon them.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tocommunicate the amendments to Memoranda A and Bas circulated under W.P. (44) 370 to the DominionGovernments, and agreed, that the instructions to our delegation at the informal discussions at washington should also be communicated to them in due course.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7th July, 1944.
