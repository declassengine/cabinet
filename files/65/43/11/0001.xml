The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bad weather had again interfered with bombing operations,but our bombers had flown 5,500 sorties and dropped 18,000 tons of bombs, a third of which had been on Germany. 5,000 tons had been dropped in the preliminary bombardment before the Allied attacksouth of Caen.Bomber Command had also attacked synthetic oil plants in the ruhr and &quot; Crossbow &quot; targets.  Mosquitoes had attacked Berlin.United States heavy bombers had flown 6,200 sorties and dropped 12,400, tons of bombs, 8,700 tons of them on targets inGermany, which had included experimental stations atPeenemunde and Zinnowitz, aircraft factories and oil installations.British and American heavy bombers had had a record week,dropping in all 30,500 tons of bombs.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 7,500 sorties.The enemy had lost 192 aircraft against Allied losses of 283.During the week 802 flying-bombs had been launched, of which349, or 43 per cent., had been destroyed and 263 had reached London.The fighters had accounted for 60 per cent., A.A. guns for 30 percent, and the Balloons for 10 per cent, of those destroyed.In the Mediterranean, Allied aircraft had dropped 8,500 tonsof bombs, mainly on oil plants, aircraft factories and other targets in South-East Europe.During the previous week there had been no shipping losses dueto enemy action. Total losses for July to date,-including belatedreports, amounted to 51,273 tons.Six U-boats had been destroyed so far this month.The Prime Minister said that,- at the request of the Admiralty,he had suggested to President Roosevelt that, before the nextmonthly statement* on U-boat warfare was published, an interimstatement should be made emphasising the notable achievement ofour small craft and aircraft in holding off attacks by U-boatsagainst shipping engaged in the &quot; Overlord &quot; operation. ThePresident had replied deprecating this suggestion, mainly, hethought, on security grounds.The Prime Minister asked the First Lord of the admiralty to send him the material which&apos; the Admiralty wished to publish on this matter, and said that he would then consider making a further approach to the President.Reference was also made to the clearance of mines in Cherbourg-Harbour, which had been done by British divers. This feat deservedpublic acknowledgment.The Prime Minister said that, provided security reasonspermitted, he would consider including some reference to this matter in his forthcoming speech to Parliament on the war situation.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff described the attackmade by the Second British Army on the 18th July southwards fromCaen. Some delay in getting our forces across the river, togetherwith the fact that the Germans had been very quick in organising. an anti-tank screen, had limited the success of this operation. west of St. Lo the United States forces had made some progress. bad weather was hampering operations on the whole front.The Prime Minister said that during his visit to Normandy hehad visited a great number of troops and never had he seen an army which looked so well or so happy. General Montgomery had expressed his great satisfaction with the equipment and supplieswith which, thanks to our military authorities, the army had been supplied.&quot;In Italy we had advanced along the whole front and bothLeghorn and Ancona had been captured.See W.M. (43) 96th Conclusions, Minute 1.
Russia. The Russian offensive had made great progress during theprevious week. That day the Germans had admitted their retire-ment from Siedlice and Jarosiaw. Russian forces were very close to Brest Litovsk. The German Armies in Estonia and Latvia stillshowed no signs of attempting to withdraw.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.2. The Secretary of State for War said that a Court ofEnquiry had been held on the 7th July, 1944, to investigate the deathat Audrieu, in Normandy, of certain Canadian and British officers.The Court had found as followrs : (a) one Canadian officer, 23 other ranks and 2 British soldiersmet their death at or near the Chateau d&apos;Audrieu on or about the 8th June, 1944;(b) the Canadian officer and 18 of the Canadian soldiers wereprisoners of war in the custody of the German army;(c) they had been murdered by members of the 12th S.S.Reconnaissance Battalion of the 12th S.S. PanzerDivision (Hitler Jugend) under the direction of certain of their officers;. (d) five Canadian and 2 British soldiers were in all probabilityprisoners of war in the hands of the same unit and suffered a similar fate to the officer and 18 soldiers.This report had been forwarded to the Combined Chiefs ofStaff, and up to date no information had been received as to what action was being taken by them. A copy of the report had also beenfurnished to the Canadian Military Headquarters in London. Itwould be necessary to reach agreement with the Canadian Govern-ment as to what should be said on this matter.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Prisonersof War.Foreign Affairs.Germany.Poland.(previous reference:W.M.(44)47thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the attempt which had been made on Hitler&apos;s life. Authentic infor-mation was very difficult to come by, but there seemed little doubtthat there had been, and perhaps still was, a movement of consider-able force in Germany behind the Generals. It was still impossibleto judge what the consequences would be, but, if the GermanGovernment wrere successful in repressing the movement, the resultfor the time being would be to rivet the Nazi machine still morefirmly on the German nation.A discussion followed as to what line the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should take in the matter in the House ofCommons on the following day. The general sense of the WarCabinet was that at this stage the less said the better. Thus itmight be stated that as to a great deal of the affair everyone couldjudge for himself, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government had not yet reached a point in the assessment of the evidence at which a public statement on their behalf would be appropriate.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported to the WarCabinet the latest developments in Russo-Polish relations. a record of the discussion and the conclusions reached is containedin the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
Air Raids.(previous reference:W:M.(44)91stConclusions,Minute 7.)Attacks, by flying-Bombs.4. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security statedthat up to 6 a.m. that morning the total casualties from flying-bombsreported were 4,089 killed, 12,126 seriously injured, 14,460 slightly injured and 46 unclassified, making a grand total of 30,721.Arrangements in the reception areas under the evacuation scheme were going better. He would be able to give an encouraging report at the confidential meeting with Members of Parliament fixed forthe following day.Air Raids.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 89thConclusions,Minute 8.)Attacks byFlving-Bombs.Public warning system.5. At their Meeting on the 10th July (W.M. (44) 89th Con--elusions., Minute. 8) the&apos; War Cabinet had invited the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security to bring before the civil defence Committee the question of improving the public warning system, with particular reference to the possibility of an extensionof the system of giving warning of imminent danger.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 401)reporting the result of the consideration given to the matter.by theCivil Defence Committee.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security pointedout that, as experience was gained by flying-bomb attacks, theperiod of the alert was becoming more and more closely adjusted tothe period of actual danger. There was, however, a considerabledemand for some sort of imminent danger warning within the alert.The Civil Defence Committee had been unable to reach agreement on whether a system of imminent danger warning should or shouldnot be instituted, hut their view was that, if any system were to beadopted, it should consist of the display of a red storm cone onpremises connected to the industrial alarm system, supplemented bya bell signal audible to the public in the neighbourhood of thepremises. It would be impossible to cover the whole of London bya system of this kind, nor would it be infallible in its operation;and this would have to be made clear by the Government should itbe decided to adopt the system. Whatever decision was taken, it seemed very desirable to standardise the unofficial and unco-ordinated system of warnings on private premises which had grownup since the flying-bomb attacks began.It was generally agreed in discussion that any system ofimminent danger warnings should be based on the industrial alarmscheme, which had reached a very high state of efficiency. It was felt, however, that a visible signal was open to considerable objec-tion, particularly from the point of view of road traffic, and that asystem under which localised signals would be given by the ringingof bells or the sounding of klaxons would be preferable.The following additional points were raised in discussion : (a) The Minister of Aircraft Production stressed the fact thatworkers who received imminent danger warnings in factories weredissatisfied because their families did not receive the same warnings.(b) The Minister of War Transport said that bus drivers werein favour of a system of imminent danger warnings within the alert.(c) The Minister of Production pointed out that the productionof the necessary equipment for the proposed system of audiblewarnings might present some difficulties.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was desirable to institute a system oflocalised audible warnings of imminent danger within,the alert, based on the existing industrial alarm scheme.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security,the Minister of Aircraft Production, the Minister ofWar Transport and the Minister of Works to settle
6. On the 24th May the War Cabinet had before them aMemorandum (W.P. (44) 262) about the Report from the SelectCommittee on National Expenditure on Tank Production, and had decided that an interim reply should be sent to Sir JohnWardlaw-Milne.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum(W.P. (44) 400) containing-(i) A  draft letter  for the Prime Minister  to  send toSir John Wardlaw-Milne,(ii) A draft reply to the Select Committee&apos;s Report preparedby the Minister of Production, the Secretary of Statefor War and the Minister of Surjply as an enclosureto (i).(iii) A summary of the reports received on the performance ofBritish tanks.The War Cabinet-&apos; Expressed general agreement with these documents and invited the Prime Minister to despatch the letter and theenclosure to Sir John Wardlaw-Milne, subject to such modifications as might be settled in consultation with theMinisters concerned.*Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,24th July, 1944.* Note. The letter and enclosure were despatched as drafted on the2nd August, 1944.SelectCommitteeon national expenditure.Reporton tank production.(previous reference:W.M.(44)68thConclusions,Minute 4.jurgently by what means such a system could be most effectively and quickly provided. The assistance of other ministers should be called on, as- required, and a reportof the conclusions reached should be submitted to thePrime Minister.(3) Agreed that any announcement regarding the system shouldmake it clear that it would be neither universal norwholly effective.
