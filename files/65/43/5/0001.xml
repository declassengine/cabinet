Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)85thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Normandy.Flying BombsItaly.naval operations.MilitaryOperations.Normandy.Prisoners ofwar andDelayed ActionMines. .Italy.Eussia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the events of the previousweek.Bad weather had interfered with bombing operations, but our bombers had flown 3,900 sorties, dropping 13,600 tons of bombs.Considerable damage had been done to the four &quot; large sites &quot;thought to be connected with the long-range rocket and to the cavesin which flying bombs were stored. Forty-three out of 86 flyingbomb launching sites had been hit and 4 out of the 7 supply siteshad been badly damaged.Our bombers had taken a successful part in the preliminarybombardment before the attack of the Second Army on Caen.United States heavy bombers had flown 4,500 sorties, dropping7,700 tons of bombs on oil plants and targets in Germany.2,200 tons of bombs had been dropped on &quot;Crossbow&quot; targets,railways and airfields in occupied territory.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 22,300 sorties and dropped 3,700 tons of bombs.The enemy had lost 344 aircraft as against Allied losses of147 bombers, 81 fighters and 7 Coastal Command aircraft.During the week 786 Flying Bombs had been launched, of which427 (or 55 per cent.) had been destroyed. Our fighters had destroyed156 over the sea and 190 over the land.In Italy, Allied aircraft had flown 13,600 sorties and dropped9,000 tons of bombs. Targets included oik plants in South-east europe. Enemy losses amounted to 170 as against 108 allied aircraft.During the previous week confirmed shipping losses due to enemy action amounted to 13,520 tons. Total losses for Julyamounted to 33,466 tons.During July 4 U-boats had been destroyed and 2 probably destroyed.Several minor naval actions had taken place in the North sea and the Channel, during which a number of enemy E-boats andother craft had been destroyed. Attacks had been made by humantorpedoes in the British Assault Area.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff described the fighting in Normandy. American forces, having cleared the CherbourgPeninsula, had now attacked due south. In spite of difficultcountry, progress had been satisfactory. British and Canadianforces had started an attack on the previous Saturday west of Caen;good initial progress had been made on either flank. The position at the moment was that our troops occupied a line along theRiver Odon from Verson through Caen. The enemy still held the portion of the town which lay south of the river, So far,51,000 prisoners had been taken in Normandy.The Prime Minister said that, on several occasions , inNormandy, the enemy, after setting a number of delayed actionmines, had surrendered. He asked the Secretary of State for war to consider whether special steps should be /taken to ensure that german prisoners disclosed the location of mines, within their knowledge, timed to explode after their surrender.In Italy there had been hard fighting on either flank, and thebest progress had been made in the centre. The Germans were probably fighting a delaying action before falling back to the Pisa-Rimini line.Since the Russian offensive north of the Pripet Marshes had begun on the 22nd June, their forces had advanced in some places asmuch as 200 miles. The capture of Vilna was important, since theGerman forces to the north could now only be evacuated by onerailway line or by sea.The Prime Minister said that while the news from the variousbattle-fronts was good, the public should not be led to expect that[27841] :f    b 2
the war against Germany would end this year. He had noticedsome over-optimism in the press which needed to be corrected.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Casualties.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)85thConclusions,Minute 2.)Total sufferedin Campaignsagainst Italy.Turkey.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)88thConclusions,Minute 3.)Greece.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)76thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Prime Minister said that he thought it might benecessary to publish the total casualties suffered by all three services in all campaigns against Italy since the beginning of the war.Figures had been furnished to him by the War Office in respectof the Army. He asked the First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for Air to furnish corresponding particulars forthe Navy and Royal Air Force.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs informed theWar Cabinet of the latest developments about Turkey.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the arrangements which we had hoped to make,under which the leading role in Greek matters would have beenplayed by His Majesty&apos;s Government and in Roumanian mattersby the U.S.S.R., had broken down. The Soviet Government, on being informed of the conditions attached by the United States totheir acceptance of that proposal, had indicated that they con-sidered it necessary to give it further consideration and to makea direct approach to the United States Government. Failure toobtain this understanding could only add to the difficulties ofdealing with a rapidly-changing situation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added that the WarCabinet would be familiar with the latest developments in theGreek situation. E.A.M. had put forward demands which theGreek Government were quite unable to accept. M. Papandreouhad asked that he should have an assurance of support from HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the line he was taking. It seemed clearthat in existing conditions it was our duty to supportM. Papandreou and his Government. Subject to the approval ofthe War Cabinet, he would take that line in Parliament.The War Cabinet Took note of the position, and approved the course ofaction proposed by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.France.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)85thConclusions,Minute. 3.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s visit to Washington seemed to have gonevery well.The Prime Minister said that President Roosevelt appeared tohave avoided discussing matters of detail and also the questionwhether the French National Committee should be styled a, pro-visional Government. General de Gaulle had been received with allhonour, but as a Commander-in-Chief and not as the Head of aState: He thought that, after the General had left the United States,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should enquire throughthe State Department what had passed, and thereafter press for acceptance of the arrangements for the control of civil affairs inFrance that had emerged from the Vienot conversations in London.He hoped that the United States Government would be willing to
agree to a settlement on this basis. If they were not, we might haveto consider taking independent action.The War Cabinet Approved the action proposed by the Prime Minister.Town and country planning.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 86thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, after consulting the Lord President of the Council, he recommended thatwe should not proceed with the Money Resolution of the Town and country Planning Bill until near the Committee stage. It had beenarranged that on the first day&apos;s debate on the second reading theMinister of Town and Country Planning should open and theParliamentary Secretary should reply. It might be necessary thata member of the War Cabinet should speak on the second day&apos;debate. He thought that the Government should press to get aSecond Reading of the Bill, making it clear that there would beample time for discussion of points of difficulty after the SecondReading. He hoped that some of his War Cabinet colleagues wouldbe able to be present on the Bench during the debate.The War Cabinet-Expressed general approval of these arrangements.Air Raids.(previous reference:W.M.(44)87thConclusions,Minute. 1.)Attacks byPlying Bombs.[27841]7: The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave the War Cabinet the latest casualty. figures, namely, 3,197 killed,8,954 seriously injured, 10,023 slightly injured and 36 unclassified,making a total of 22,210. Earlier in the day he had visited his constituency, where a bomb had recently fallen, causing considerable damage to small houses. Although the Civil Defence Services were working well and everything possible was being done for the victims of the attack, there was a certain amount of discontent and atendency to criticise the Government for not doing more to preventthe attacks.The Minister of Health said that a recent visit to Croydon had given him the impression that, on the whole, morale was extremelygood and that people were standing the attacks with more fortitudethan in the first week or two. He had formed the same impressionwhen visiting, the East End in the previous week.The Prime Minister said that it would be wrong to hold outhopes that the attacks would diminish in scale in the near future.The Civil Defence Services had done excellent work and must continue to do everything possible to comfort and help people wholost their homes. Such people should be offered accommodation in areas outside London,: and it was for consideration whether theyshould not be pressed to leave London.The following points arose in discussion : (a) Although the accommodation in the Rest Centres wasexcellent, persons whose houses had been damaged often preferred to stay in the damaged houses or to go to friends. It would helpsuch homeless persons if arrangements could be made to distributehot meals; to them by means-of mobile canteens.(b) The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he was afraid that, if pressure were put on homeless persons to move into other areas, this might have: an adverse effect on production! TheWar Cabinet were informed: that the Ministry of Production^ inconsultation with:the Supply Departments, were preparing a reportfor submission to the Lord Presidents Committee on the loss ofproduction due to flying bomb attacks.(c) The Minister of Health reported that the total number ofpersons registered for evacuation; in the London region and in the rural areas affected1 by the attacks was 120,000, of whom 45,000 hadbeen moved out.b 3
(cl) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityreported that the street shelters continued to be popular. Hepromised to furnish a report showing the number of casualties among persons using street shelters.(e) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat he would be glad if Ministers who had occasion to makespeeches would pay tribute to the spirit with which Londoners weremeeting the attacks.The War Cabinet-Took note of the information given by the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security and of the points raised in discussion.Ail? Raids.(previous reference:W.M.(44)85thConclusions,Minute 4.)Attacks by flying Bombs:Public warning system.8. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 377)and by the Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 378)about the public warning system.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe had carefully considered whether the warning system could be modified so as to reduce to a minimum interference with workand, at the same time, prevent avoidable casualties. Under existing \arrangements in the Greater London area, the siren was normally not sounded in the day time for isolated flying bombs, and an Iattempt was made to give the raiders passed signal as soon as \possible. When a warning was given at or near dusk, the raiderspassed signal was not normally given until an opportunity occurredafter 6 a.m. the following day. So far as the rest of South-east england was concerned, warnings were not normally given for flying bombs passing over the area. It had been made clear to thepublic that the siren was an alert and not an alarm and it was generally treated as such. The sounding of the siren was usefulas a warning to those in charge of children and to elderly people,and experience had shown that workers attached importance to itas a warning to their families. Moreover, it was an advantage ofthe present system that once the raiders passed signal had soundedthe public were able to relax. On the whole, therefore, he was ofopinion that the siren should continue to be sounded. If the WarCabinet felt that it was desirable, he was prepared to try the experiment of cutting down the length of the warning by half.The Prime Minister said that there appeared to be no objectionto the sounding of sirens at dusk, and in the daytime when numbersof flying bombs were approaching London.   It was, however, worth considering whether there should not be an extension of the systemof giving some warning of imminent danger.   He suggested thatthe whole question of the public warning system should be examined further by the Civil Defence Committee.The War Cabinet-Invited  the Home  Secretary  and Minister  of home security to bring before the Civil Defence Committee thequestion of improving the public warning system, withparticular reference to the possibility of an extension ofthe -system of giving warning of imminent danger.&quot; Overlord &quot; 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecurity. Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 385)(Previous about evacuation into the protected areas.Reference: The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security recalledW.M.(44)88th    that at their Meeting on the 7th July the War Cabinet had invitedConclusions,      him in consultation with other Ministers concerned to considerMinute 2.)        whether administrative arrangements could be made to allowpersons not falling within the permitted classes to enter and remainin protected if they came from areas liable to attack fromflying bombs, on the understanding that no public announcement
U.S.S.R.parliamentary delegation.(previous references:W.M.(43)23rdConclusions,Minute -1; andW.M. (42) 174thConclusions,Minute 2.)10.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (44) 376), proposing that the necessarytravel facilities should be given to a delegation from the, National Executive Committee of the Labour Party to visit Russia in order to establish contact and enter into negotiations with the Communist Party of the U.S.S.R.(ii) a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster (W.P. (44) 383), suggesting that it would be preferable if the delegation were an all-Party Parlia-mentary one.would be made of the relaxation. Prior to this decision steps hadalready been taken to prevent the police from expelling or prose-cuting persons in priority classes who came to the banned areas from London. The arrangements made with the police, however,could only be temporary, and the present situation, under which persons who ignored the law were allowed to remain in the areaswhile law-abiding persons who had friends or relatives in thebanned areas were deterred from leaving London, was indefensible.He accordingly proposed that it should be stated in Parliament onthe following day that, although for operational reasons thevisitors&apos; ban must be retained, there would be added to the classesof persons already permitted to enter the protected areas underthe Protected Areas Orders, an additional class, viz., persons in the priority classes from London and certain other evacuable areas in southern England evacuated under the Government EvacuationScheme or holding an evacuation certificate from a Local authority under that Scheme. The War Cabinet should know that S.H.A.E.F.would prefer that no public announcement should be made aboutthe addition of this class. In his view, however, which was shared by the Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Health, it was essential that a public announcement should be made.The Secretary of State for War supported the proposal of theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security. He pointed outthat at their meeting on the 7th July the War Cabinet had agreedthat the ban should be lifted in the area west of Southampton. Inorder to facilitate the evacuation of organised parties of schoolchildren to that area, no announcement had yet been made of thelifting of the ban and it had been suggested that an announcement should be deferred for a further week. He would have to answerParliamentary Questions on the subject of the ban the following day, and it would be convenient if he could announce at that time that the ban on the area west of Southampton was to be removed.The Minister of Health said that he would raise no objectionto an announcement the following day to the effect that fromWednesday the ban on the area west of Southampton would be lifted.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that on the following&apos; day it should be announcedthat the ban on the coastal area west of Southamptonwould be lifted from Wednesday, the 12th July, 1944.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State for War should makeit clear that, while the ban on the remaining protectedareas must be retained for operational reasons, personsin the priority classes from London and certain otherevacuable areas in Southern England would be allowedto enter these areas for the purpose of taking upresidence, if they were evacuated under the GovernmentEvacuation Scheme or held a certificate from the LocalAuthority under the Scheme.
It was explained that when this proposal had first been raised in December 1942, it had been thought that it would be difficult forHis Majesty/s Government to facilitate a visit to Eussia by a dele-gation representing only one political party. &apos; Consideration had therefore been given to arranging that a delegation representingeach of the main political parties, and both Houses of parliament should visit Russia. Difficulties had, however, arisen and theproposal had never been carried out. Since then the soviet ambassador had intimated that the Soviet Authorities welcomed aproposal made by the National Executive Committee of the LabourParty to send a delegation to Moscow, and the Secretary of theLabour Party had accordingly approached the Foreign Office.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that a visit by representatives of a single political party would be liable to mis-representation, and that it was most desirable that a further attempt should be made to arrange for an all-party parliamentary delegation to visit Russia. Any such delegation would, of course,visit not the Communist Party of the Soviet Union but the SupremeSoviet. The delegation should include representatives of each ofthe political parties supporting the present Government.In discussion, reference was made to a proposal that theCo-operative Union should send a delegation to Russia and a dele-gation to China. It was explained that the Co-operative union was distinct from the Co-operative Party, and that visits from theUnion to foreign countries would not be regarded as having anyspecial political significance.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State forAir and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to consult together, with a view to arranging a visit to theU.S.S.R. by a Parliamentary delegation, representativeof the parties supporting the present Government.(2) Agreed that no objection should be taken to the proposal that delegations from the Co-operative Union should visit Russia and China.11. The War Cabinet again had under consideration thequestion whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should make a declara-tion in general terms about the restoration of a free and independentSiam after the war, and had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 365) containing the text of a revised declaration in which the Dominion Govern-ments had expressed their concurrence.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) The Supreme Allied Commander, S.E.A.C., was strongly infavour of a declaration on the lines suggested.(&amp;) The declaration was in unduly favourable terms, bearing that mind the attitude of Siam in going to war with us notwith-standing the treaty of non-aggression between the two countries.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that thePresident of the United States had already made a statement which went a good deal further than the revised declaration set out in w.P. (44) 365, and that it was felt that some statement should be&quot;made to restore the balance.(c) Sir Firoz Khan Noon stated that, if a declaration weremade in the terms proposed about Siam, we should be asked to makecorresponding statements about neighbouring territories *forexample, certain of the Malay States. It was also urged that it was undesirable to make a statement about the future of Siam until wehad made one about the future of Burma.
The Maharaja 12.   The Prime Minister said that this was the last meeting ofof Jammu and the War Cabinet which His Highness the Maharaja of Jammu andKashmir. Kashmir, who was leaving for India on the following day, would attend. On his return he was going to visit the Indian troops in italy, who had fought so well under General Alexander. He hopedthat the Maharaja would convey to them the War Cabinet&apos;s highappreciation of their achievements.The Prime Minister said that it had been a great pleasure thatHis Highness should have attended the War Cabinet and theimportant discussions with the Dominion Prime Ministers earlier in the summer. It was a source of satisfaction that the ruler ofone of the leading Indian States, who had contributed in fullmeasure to the common cause, should have been a representative ofIndia in the War Council of the Empire at such a critical time.The Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir thanked the PrimeMinister for what he had said. He would convey the War Cabinefsmessage to the Indian troops. He would also be in a position to tell them in India something of the greatness of the war effort and ofthe spirit of the people of this country in the fifth year of thisprolonged struggle.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,10th July, 1944.(d) It was also felt that it would be better not to make adeclaration of this kind until we had recovered some of the terri-tories which we had lost in the Far East.(e) The Minister of Economic Warfare doubted whether theproposed declaration would be of much assistance so far as con-cerned S.O.E.&apos;s operational projects.For these reasons, the War Cabinet reached the conclusionthat it would be premature to make a declaration about Siam inthe terms proposed at this juncture.
