The Vice-Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events ofthe previous week.  *Bomber Command had flown 4,960 sorties and dropped15,900 tons of bombs. 4,400 tons had been dropped on targets inGermany and 11,500 on Occupied Territory, including airfields,U-boat pens, shipping targets, &quot; Crossbow &quot; targets and operations in support of the battle.United States heavy bombers had flown 4,000 sorties and dropped 8,400 tons of bombs, 4,900 of which had been on targets inGermany.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 24,000 sorties,practically all of which had been in close relation to the battle andin exploitation of the enemy&apos;s withdrawal. This force claimed tohave destroyed 264 tanks, 3,800 motor transport vehicles, 132 loco-motives and 900 railway trucks. Many others had been damaged.These claims had not so far been checked.The enemy had lost 235 aircraft (including 76 on the ground).Allied losses amounted to 193 fighters and 82 bombers.647 flying bombs had been launched, of which 464 had been destroyed.In connection with the operations in the South of France,3,400 sorties had been flown in addition to airborne operations.5,800 tons of bombs had been dropped on airfields and enemycommuni cations.During the previous week confirmed shipping losses due to enemy action amounted to 3,000 tons. Confirmed shipping losses forAugust amounted to 28,900 tons.Eight U-boats had been sunk and one probably sunk during august.Enemy shipping had been intercepted in the Bay of Biscay anda number of ships sunk and driven ashore. In the assault areasthere had been attacks by human torpedoes, 9 of which had been destroyed by our aircraft.Cruisers and gunboats had bombarded targets in connectionwith the landing operations in the South of France. A number of enemy corvettes, E-boats and M.T.Bs. had been sunk.In North-West France the advance of United States forces had met with little opposition and their chief problem had beenmaintenance. They had now established a bridgehead across theSeine between Mantes and Vernon and were moving north towardsElbeuf. British and Canadian Forces had now joined with american Forces in the Argentan area and had closed the enemy&apos;sescape route to the west. Perhaps 12 German divisions, including4 Panzer, were trapped in this pocket, from which they were stilltrying to escape.Between the Loire and the Seine the enemy might have36 divisions, 5 of which had not been in the main battle. In the pas de Calais area and in the Low Countries there were 7 divisions,on the Atlantic Coast 1 only, in the Marseilles area 7 and 2 in Savoy.If we were able to prevent the enemy from crossing the Seine, wxcept perhaps in small numbers, his main field Army would have ceased to exist, and we could claim complete victory.Our forces were now reported to have reached Rians on theRiver Durance, and there had been an unconfirmed report that theyhad reached Aix. Opposition had been light and 12,000 prisoners had been taken. It was probable that the enemy would stand andfight in Toulon and Marseilles. In the Rhone Valley and to thenorth of it the Maquis was adding to the enemy&apos;s difficulties.On the Italian Front there was little to report, but slightprogress had been made on the extreme right of our line.In the Northern Sector the Russians had crossed the borderbetween Lake Peipus and Lake Pskof. Further south they had advanced towards Riga on a wide front to a depth of about20 miles. German attacks in the neighbourhood of Kovno had beenheld. North-east of Warsaw the Russians had lost a little ground,out to the south they had extended their bridgehead across theVistula and claimed to have annihilated three German divisions.[28124]b 2
The Germans had reported Russian attacks on the Lower Dniesterbut these had not received confirmation from the Russians.The &quot;War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Air Raids.Attacks by flying-Bombs.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 99thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Deputy Prime Minister informed the War Cabinetthat casualties in the past week had been relatively light. The totalcasualties since the beginning of the attacks were : &apos;Killed    ......Seriously injuredSlightly injuredUnclassifiedTotal5,46515,83220,81321............      42,131During the week 36,094 houses had been damaged and 62,561had received first-aid repairs. Since the beginning of the attacks1,027,269 houses had been damaged and 952,495 had receivedfirst-aid repairs.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Poland.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 108thConclusions.)The PolishUndergroundArmy.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 106thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet of the latest developments in the Polish situation.Very severe fighting was taking place in Warsaw, and he proposedto circulate to the War Cabinet certain reports which we hadreceived. Difficulties had arisen with the Soviet Government overthe proposal that United States airmen should land on Russianaerodromes after dropping supplies on Warsaw, and the Poles were aware of this. They had again seen him to-day and had represented the urgent need for supplies. Arrangements had, in fact, been madefor a small number of planes to drop supplies nightly for the present.This would be an encouragement to the Poles. He suggested thathe, the Secretary of State for Air and the Vice-Chief of the Air staff should meet the Poles on Tuesday, the 22nd August, and discusswhether anything further could be done in this connection. he remained uneasy about the political repercussions of the difficulties that had arisen over Russian assistance.&quot;   (1) The War Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and approved the suggestion at &quot;X.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to thePolish request that their Underground Army should be recognisedofficially as a fighting force. When this matter was previouslydiscussed it had been felt that, for such a declaration to be of value,the Russians must be associated with it. Their support had not,however, been forthcoming. He was now advised that without using the phrase &quot; belligerent status &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government, on thebasis that it was they who had been supplying the Poles, could makea statement which would give some cover to the UndergroundMovement. He suggested that the draft of any such statement, withwhich he would be quite ready to ask the United States to associate themselves, should be agreed with the Secretary of State for Warand the Secretary of State for Air. It would not, in any event, go beyond what we had said in respect of the Maquis. Nor would it beanti-Russian in character.The point was made in discussion that a statement at this point might well give rise to misunderstanding or criticism of the Russianattitude in the United States, while, unless it was framed in termsstronger than could probably be contemplated, it might be of little value to the Poles.
After further discussion, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs suggested that the draft statement, when prepared, shouldbe brought before the War Cabinet.(2) The War Cabinet-Approved the action proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.&quot; Overlord &quot;Security.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 104thConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Deputy Prime Minister said that, in accordance withthe decision of the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 9th August,Sir Findlater Stewart had taken up with Supreme Headquarters,Allied Expeditionary Force, the question of the removal of thevisitors&apos; ban and that S.H.A.E.F. had now agreed to the removal ofthe ban from the 25th August, on the understanding that no public announcement on the subject was made before that date.The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office could make the necessary arrangements to remove the ban from the25th August. No announcement need be made until the morning ofthe 25th.The Minister of Aircraft Production recalled that at their meeting on the 9th August the War Cabinet had agreed that theproposal to remove the special restrictions on telephone calls betweenGreat Britain and Ireland should be reconsidered in two to threeweeks&apos; time. These restrictions imposed great inconvenience on the transaction of business by the Ministry of Aircraft Production andhe hoped that they could be removed.It was explained that the intention was that the question of theremoval of the restrictions should be brought before the War cabinet for consideration early in the following week.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the visitors&apos; ban should be removed from the25th August, on the understanding that no public announcement on the subject was made before that date.(2) Took note that the question of the removal of the special restrictions on telephone calls between Great Britain andIreland would be brought before them early in thefollowing week, and agreed that, in the meantime, all practicable steps should be taken to exempt GovernmentDepartments from the restrictions.Blockade.Belief forOccupiedEurope.(previous reference:W.M.(44)43rdConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 446) on the subjectof relief supplies for occupied Europe.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the WarCabinet that they had several times considered proposals that relief supplies should be allowed to pass through the blockade and that upto the present time no concession had been.made beyond the reliefshipments to Greece which had been authorised in February 1942.There had been constant pressure both in this country and, toa greater extent, from the United States for some further concessionand, although it had been hoped that the United States Governmentwould be content with a proposal, which had been discussed duringthe recent visit of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare to Washington, that relief from within theblockade area should be permitted to go to certain internment campsselected by the International Red Cross, Mr. Hull had now intimated that, largely for political reasons, the United States Government felt bound to press for the setting up in London of an Anglo-american committee to examine the possibility of providing limited amounts of foodstuffs for distribution to children and nursing and expectant mothers. It would be recalled that on the 30th June the Belgian,Netherlands and Norwegian Ambassadors had proposed a scheme
involving about 20,000 tons of foodstuffs a month and some60,000 tons of shipping.Experience snowed that at least four months were required for examination, agreement by the enemy and planning before any action could be taken, and, in view particularly of the presentmilitary situation, which might result in nothing having to be done,it seemed expedient to agree to the proposal made by the UnitedStates Government. If the proposals were agreed to, the first step would be to set up an Anglo-American Committee in London to draw up a scheme for submission to the British and United states government.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Economic Warfare,said that, although on merits the Minister of Economic Warfarewas opposed to the proposal, he agreed that in present circumstances it would be expedient to meet the views of the United StatesGovernment. The proposed Anglo-American Committee would haveto examine not only the question of finding the necessary supplies and shipping, but also the arrangements for dealing with whatexperience in Greece had shown to be the difficult problem of ensuring effective control. If the Committee was set up, theMinister of Economic Warfare attached great importance to its being empowered to consider not only relief in kind but alsomonetary relief. At present the War Refugee Board were payinghard currency to persons in enemy and occupied territories withoutany consultation with the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and it was desirable that the machinery of the Committee should be used toensure that the giving of relief in monetary form was properlycontrolled. In suggesting this extension of the Committee&apos;s functions we should, of course, have to make it clear that our object was not to widen the scope of monetary relief but to secure a greaterdegree of co-ordination.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Food, pointed outthat the amount of foodstuffs of the kinds contemplated which wouldbe available during 1944 was already insufficient to meet the needsof civilian consumers in this country, of the Armed Forces and ofthe liberated areas during the military period. Unless, therefore,the United States Government were willing to cut consumption bytheir own civilians or Armed Forces, it was difficult to see wherethe necessary supplies could be found.The Minister of War Transport said that, since it was proposedto carry the supplies in neutral vessels, no question of Alliedshipping arose. So far as Swedish vessels were concerned, it was extremely doubtful whether the German Government would allowneutral shipping to leave the Baltic.The War Cabinet *(1) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should return a favourable reply to Mr. Hull&apos;s letter andshould agree to the setting up of an Anglo-american committee in London to draw up a scheme of relief for submission to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to theUnited States Government.(2) Agreed that it should be suggested to the United StatesGovernment that the Committee should consider also thequestion of controlling the grant of monetary relief to persons in enemy and enemy-occupied territory.Relief. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFinance of Minister of State (W.P. (44) 455) on the finance of supplies to Italy.Supplies to The relief supplies sent to Italy by His Majesty&apos;s Government andItaly. the United States to prevent disease and unrest had been financedon our side by a Vote of Credit, and on the American side by a war department Appropriation. An undertaking given to Congressmade it impossible for the War Department any longer to acceptfinancial responsibility for supplies to Italy.   The Americans had
proposed accordingly to make available to the Italian Governmentthe dollar equivalent of the United States troops&apos; pay in Italy, thusputting the Italians in a position to pay for supplies from theUnited States.   This procedure was objectionable (i) as possibly implying a breach of the Armistice terms;(ii) since it would be impossible for us to follow the Americanexample and make the sterling equivalent of Britishtroops&apos; pay available to the Italian Government.In addition, the American Government, in order to attract theItalian votes in the forthcoming Presidential election, had expressed a wish to extend the field of supplies to Italy to cover general economic rehabilitation. This would result in treating Italy betterthan the smaller Allies.The matter had been discussed by the Minister of State in washington, after the Americans had agreed not to announce their proposed policy until the War Cabinet could be consulted. Theperiod assigned for such consultation having expired, a telegram had now been despatched, after consultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for War, which made it clear that (a) in no circumstances could we agree at the present time toany programme of rehabilitation for Itedy;(b) we would agree to the Americans making United States&apos;troops&apos; pay available to the Italian Government, pro-vided that if any further statement had to be made itwould contain no reference to rehabilitation, and wouldmake it clear that such payment was by way of advance,was without prejudice to the final settlement with Italy,and represented a difference not of policy but of financialprocedure.The Minister of State said that he had little to add to theMemorandum he had circulated on this subject. The arguments against the course advocated by the Americans in respect of troops&apos;pay were very strong, but he thought that the arrangements whichhad now been made sufficiently safeguarded our position. Equally,there were decisive arguments against any proposal to agree to a programme of rehabilitation for Italy. The telegram that had beensent made that clear, and brought out also that, if American press comment came out too strongly in favour of rehabilitation, we musthold ourselves free to make our own position clear.The War Cabinet   -Took note of the position, and approved the action whichhad been taken by the Minister of State.Liberation of 7.   The Deputy Prime Minister informed the War CabinetParis, that the Lord Mayor of London had asked whether authority mightRinging of be given for ringing the bells of St. Paul&apos;s and the City Churches onChurch Bells. the liberation of Paris.It was explained that there was no objection to the ringing ofbells from the point of view of the Ministry of Home Security.The War Cabinet-Agreed that, although it would be inexpedient at thepresent time to take any action which could be regarded asa general celebration of victory, there was no objection tothe limited proposal to ring the bells of St. Paul&apos;s and theCity Churches on the occasion of the liberation of Parisas a compliment by one great capital to another.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,list August, 1944.
