Post-War Relief.      1.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFinance in the Minister of State (W.P. (44) 459) on the finance of relief in theMilitary Period military period.   The War Cabinet on the 20th January, 1944, had(Previous        accepted a figure of  80 million or 1 per cent, of our NationalEeference:      Income as the maximum United Kingdom contribution to relief in w.M.(44)9th   all areas and at all times.   The United States had subsequentlyConclusions,     dissented strongly from the suggestion that our contribution of 1 perMinute 1.)      cent, of our National Income could be used to finance relief in themilitary period.   The House of Commons had in consequence beeninformed that an additional burden in respect of relief in themilitary period might fall upon us.A proposal for the division of the cost of procurement betweenthe United Kingdom and the United States in the relative propor-tion of our respective contributions to U.N.R.R.A. had provedunacceptable to the United States.The United States Government now proposed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government, the United States and Canada should agreeto procure supplies for military relief up to a total of $1,000 million,this being a provisional estimate of the supplies necessary, duringan initial period of six months, for the civilian populationfor which the Anglo-American forces would be responsible. Thethree countries would agree the proportion in which each wouldoarry such part of the outlay as was not recovered in repaymentfrom the recipient countries. The burden falling on the UnitedKingdom seemed likely to be between 22 and 27 per cent, of the total(say,  55 to  69 million), of which an unknown percentage wouldbe recovered.The American proposal bore more heavily on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment than that which we had put forward ourselves. Onthe other hand, we were committed to. carry some share of theburden. The memorandum recommended that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should accept the United States proposal, and that lord Halifax should open negotiations in Washington with a viewto the question being disposed of before the Second Council meetingof U.N.R.R.A. at Montreal on the 15th September.The Minister of State briefly reviewed the arguments containedin his memorandum. He also suggested that it would be well to associate the Canadian Government with the proposed negotiationswith the United States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that when the matter&apos;had been discussed in the Cabinet in January 1944 the decision hadbeen that an overall obligation limited to  80 million to cover relief in all forms should be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. TheUnited States Government had suggested that such a decision wouldmake it very difficult for them to secure the approval of congress to their own participation. In consequence it had been made clear in the House of Commons that the burden of a measure of reliefmight fall upon us in respect of the military period which inpractice might turn out to be in addition to our  80 million. when that statement had been made, it had been contemplated that themilitary authorities would cease to be directly responsible for civilrelief at quite an early stage, and that the additional obligationlikely to fall upon us would not exceed, say,  8 to  10 million. Hecould not regard our share of the net cost of procuring supplies tothe extent of $1,000 million as within the limits of the statement made in the House of Commons.In the second place, how could we reconcile acceptance ofa commitment of this order with the financial picture we had topaint to the United States ? In undertaking our original obligation of  80 million; we had gone further than was justified by our financial position. . &apos; 4He suggested that we should inform the United States Govern-ment that we could not go beyond the statement in the House of&quot; \ &quot;     I Commons; that we should reiterate our acceptance of a figure of 80 million, or 1 per cent, of our National Income, as our contribu-tion to U.N.R.R.A.; and say that we were prepared to interpret
the statement in the House of Commons in terms of a fixedadditional sum of  8 to  10 million if so much was needed afterallowance had been made for repayment by recipient Allies.Furthermore, in our view the Allies who were to benefit by relief in the military period, and could afford to pay for it, should becalled upon to make payments for relief as they received it. Thiswould have the effect of making the money last longer.The following further points were made in discussion : (a) The line of demarcation suggested between the operations of U.N.R.R.A. in the post-military period and those of the militaryduring the military period was artificial. &quot;We had already agreedto contribute 1 per cent, of our National Income to U.N.R.R.A.Would it not be possible to find the additional funds for thepurchase of commodities for the military period by using the credit of U.N.R.R.A. in the first instance, to be made good by the refundsexpected from paying countries ?It was explained that this would not be practical politics untilU.N.R.R.A. was established on a firm financial footing. In anycase U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s funds were probably inadequate for the purpose.(&amp;) U.N.R.R.A. had no responsibility in respect of the militaryperiod. They would enter the field in that period only when invited by the military authorities.(c) Recipients of relief who were in a position to do so, should pay for relief as they received it. On that assumption the contribu-tions promised by the United States and Canada, plus a UnitedKingdom undertaking to underwrite a possible gap of not morethan  10 million between receipts and expenditure might well meetthe case.It was pointed out in reply that it was difficult to reach a firmestimate of the probable gap between receipts and expenditure. &apos;Canada had accepted her obligation on the basis that it would be redeemed by the provision of Canadian supplies. If sufficienttransport could not be found to carry such supplies, it was question-able whether she would be willing to accept a financial obligationfor supplies from elsewhere.(el)- As matters stood, we were financing relief in liberated countries from military votes. The cost of doing so, on theassumption, which it was suggested would otherwise rule, that weshared it equally with the United States, represented a much heavierburden than we should incur under the scheme before the WarCabinet. It was pointed out, on the other hand, that we had animplied right to recover from the beneficiary in respect of reliefprovided by the military. It was also contended that no arrange-ment as to the basis of adjustment had so far been made, eitherbetween the United States and ourselves, or between the two of us and countries liberated or to be liberated.(e) It was urged that it was inequitable that the whole burdenof finding the requisite supplies should fall on the United Statesand the United Kingdom and Canada.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the cost of relief in the military period, failing other arrangements, was treated aspart of the cost falling on the countries conducting the militaryoperations.(/) Under the constitution of U.N.R.R.A., countries which hadbeen occupied by the enemy were required to pay for the cost of relief which they themselves received to the extent of their ability,but they had no obligation to contribute to the cost of relief inother countries.After further discussion the War Cabinet Approved in principle the method of approach suggestedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer at &quot; X &quot; above, and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to elaborate  *proposals on these lines with the Minister of State, and toreport back to the War Cabinet.
U.N.R.R.A. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theInstructions to Minister of State (W-P- (44) 466) asking the approval of the WarUnited Kingdom Cabinet to the general line which he suggested should be taken byDelegation to the United Kingdom Delegation at the Second Session of theSecond Session U.N.R.R.A. Council, to be opened on the 15th September inof U.N.R.R.A. Montreal.Council. After the Minister of State had developed the main points in his memorandum, discussion turned mainly on the question of u.N.R.R.A. and enemy countries. The Minister of State in his memorandum suggested that it would be better to try to avoid theissue being raised of UN.R.R.A. being allowed to undertake relief of enemy or ex-enemy populations, though we should do nothing toprevent such a development in the future, since if relief became necessary in, for example, Austria, the use of U.N.R.R.A. mightwell be less costly for us than any alternative open to us.The Lord Privy Seal thought that the United States would seek to extend the scope of U.N.R.R.A. to cover enemy countries, butthe Minister of State thought that this was not the case.The view generally expressed by Ministers was in support ofthe line taken in the Minister of State&apos;s memorandum.The question was then raised whether it would not be to our advantage that relief in Italy should be brought within the scopeof U.N.RR.A.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that Sicily was now no longer under military government, and that Southern italy would shortly be in the same position. Unless relief in these areaswas to be found by U.N.R.R.A., what alternative was there exceptthat it should be financed by the United States and United Kingdomtaxpayers, the probability of any repayment being remote?The Secretary of State . for Foreign Affairs said that ifU.N.R.R.A. was now to start making relief available in Italy,this would be extremely unpopular with the Greeks and Yugoslavs.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that if therelief of Italy was once brought within the scope of U.N.R.R.A.we should find it difficult, if we should wish to do so, to withdrawrelief from Italy. He found it difficult to separate relief of ex-enemy countries from the general settlement to be made withthese countries, and he thought that we should, therefore, retainwithin our full control relief arrangements in enemy or ex-enemy countries. He adhered to this view, which was generally shared by Ministers, even though it meant that, for the present, we shouldhave to take our share of financing relief in Italy.The view was expressed by the Minister of Food that thearrangements in Italy ought to be reconsidered in order to ensurethat the Italians did all they could to pay their way. The present arrangements were not, he thought, satisfactory, and it might bea good thing if the military authorities showed some inclinationto limit the amount of help given to Italy.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he knew that the Prime Minister was not satisfied with the position in Italy,and he would wish to review the arrangements in tb,at country. Hethought that the position with regard to Italy should be reserved.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) It was agreed that the United Kingdom delegation to theforthcoming meeting of the Council of U.N.R.R.A.should. (a) Do all possible to uphold UN.R.R.A. and encourage the Administration to take a line oalculated to gain the confidence of the Allies.(b) Encourage the Director-General to go ahead withthe things he had to do, rather than try to strike a balance now between his assets and liabilities.
France. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFrench Partici- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 474).  The Frenchpation in the    Committee of National Liberation had raised the question of theEuropean        participation of France in  the proceedings of the european advisory        Advisory Commission with the Chairman of the Commission.   in commission.    view of the special position of France as regards German affairs,the Secretary of State proposed to instruct the United kingdom representative to support the request of the Committee that a french representative should attend meetings of the Commission whenGerman affairs were being discussed.The War Cabinet-Approved this proposal.Parliament. &apos; 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadBusiness of the received several letters, including one from Sir Herbert Williams,House. M.P., suggesting that Parliament reassemble before the date fixed(26th September). He proposed to reply that it was not proposedto make any change in the arrangements already made.This was agreed to.France.Visits byMembers ofParliament.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that he had been approached by a Member of Parlia-ment with a request for permission to visit France to make contact with his friends. While another Member had recently enteredFrance in his capacity as a War Correspondent, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs suggested that it would be desirable tomaintain the position that permission should be required for anyvisit to France by a Member of Parliament, and that he should reply that in present conditions in that country it was not possibleto arrange for any private visits by Members.The War Cabinet Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs at &quot; X.&quot;(c) Adopt a sympathetic attitude to Allied demands for supplies, but explain that United Kingdomconsumption standards could not be reduced,though we might, be prepared not to raise themafter the European Armistice as far as we shouldotherwise have felt necessary.(d) Not raise the general question of U.N.R.RA. in enemy countries, but propose that U.N.R.R.A. beauthorised to undertake-(i) care and repatriation of displaced persons(excluding  enemy  nationals)   in  enemy territory;(ii) fighting of epidemics in enemy territory;(iii) evacuation from Allied liberated territory of enemy or ex-enemy nationals settled there.(2) The position as regards relief arrangements for Italy wouldrequire special examination by the War Cabinet, andwas reserved for further consideration.
Poland. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the(Previous War Cabinet that the United States Government had now agreedEeference: to the proposed declaration recognising the Polish UndergroundW.M.(44)lllth Army as a fully combatant force, and would associate themselvesConclusions, with the declaration. He had told the Soviet Government of ourMinute 7.) intention and of the terms of the declaration, which would now beissued.The War Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,29th August, 1944.
