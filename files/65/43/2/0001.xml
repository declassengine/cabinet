Jewish 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFighting Secretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 344) on the formation of force. a   Jewish   Force   to   participate   m   operations   in   Europe.(Previous        Dr. Weizmann, on behalf of the Jewish Agency, had urged the reference:      formation of a Jewish fighting force within the British Army toW.M. (42) 162nd take part in the liberation of Europe, and had suggested that theConclusions,     existing Palestine Jewish units should be joined together into a minute 8.)      division Or brigade group to provide the bulk of such a force, whichwould be supplemented by Jewish recruits from other sources.   TheSecretary of State for War felt, however, that the creation of a jewish fighting formation, whether division, brigade group orinfantry brigade, would inevitably cause a diversion of effort fromthe task of defeating the enemy in the shortest possible time. He wasuneasy, too, at the political objections that could be urged to such proposals.The Secretary of State for War said that, besidesDr. Weizmann&apos;s project, Lord Strabolgi had now tabled a motion,for discussion in the Flouse of Lords on the 4th July, urging thatall Jews in all Allied countries should be organised into a singlevery substantial Jewish fighting force. It was necessary to considerthe line to be taken by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor War in the debate. In his own judgment the formation of a jewish division was quite impracticable for quantitative reasons.He felt grave doubt as to the practicability even of a brigade group,from the formation of which he was averse for reasons which couldbe developed on another occasion. He suggested that theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State should take the line thatthe creation of a division or any larger force was not practicable.The Prime Minister felt that in view of the sufferings whichthe Jewish people were at present enduring there was a strong case for sympathetic consideration of projects in relation to them. he accepted the objections to a Jewish division, but felt that we shouldnot refuse to examine the possibility of a brigade group.A general discussion followed consequent on which the WarCabinet Agreed that the Government spokesman in the debate inthe House of Lords on the following day should take theline that the creation of a Jewish division was impracticable because of the adverse effect which it wouldhave on our organisation, but that the possibility of forming a smaller unit, such as a brigade group, would be carefully examined.Town and 2.   The Lord President of the Council said that there had besnCountry considerable criticism of the provisions of the Town and country planning. Planning Bill and many suggestions were being put forward for its(Previous amendment.  The attitude of many members of the Labour Party onEeference: the debate on the Second Reading would be influenced by the linesW.M.(44)78th which the Government took in regard to such criticism.   TheConclusions, position would be eased if it could be indicated that the variousMinute 1.) points of view put forward would be fully considered on theCommittee stage.The War Cabinet Agreed that there was no objection to its being indicated that it was the Governments intention that there should bethe fullest discussion of the points raised on the committee stage of the Bill.Offices of the War Cabinet. S.W. 1,3rd July, 1944.
