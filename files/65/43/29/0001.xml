Killing of l.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the survivors of the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (44) 476) on the killing of thes.s. &quot;Peleus.&quot; survivors of the s.s. Peleus by members of the crew of U-852.(Previous In his Memorandum the First Lord of the Admiralty asked that reference: the conclusions reached on this subject by the War Cabinet at theirW.M.(44)91st  meeting on the 17th July should be varied in two respects  -Conclusions, ^ Tjje War Cabinet had then decided that the whole crew ofMmute 8.) U-852 should be kept in the United Kingdom.   It was, now desired to repatriate to Germany an engine-roomrating who was seriously injured and who there was noreason to suppose was implicated.(b) The War Cabinet had agreed that there was no advantage in making any formal protest to the German government at that stage. As three Greek survivors had now reached this country who knew the facts, the,position would getknown. The First Lord Of the Admiralty proposed thatthe Foreign Office should now approach the GreekGovernment and suggest a formal protest by them to theGerman Government.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the First Lord of the Admiralty.until after the Summer Recess.The War Cabinet now had before them-Demobilisation. 2. At their meeting on the 12th July the War Cabinet hadScheme for decided that publication of the scheme for the Reallocation of Man-Reallocation Power after the end of the war with Germany should stand over of Man-Powerafter the end ofHostilities withGermany.(previous reference:W.M.(44)90thConclusions,Minute 2.)(i) A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService urging that the scheme should bo published atthe earliest possible moment (W.P. (44) 470).(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService, to which was attached a revised draft of theWhite Paper (W.P. (44) 481).The War Cabinet first considered the revised draft of the white paper.(i) The Minister of Labour and National Service had receiveda letter from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofEducation strongly urging that a specific reference should be madein paragraph 11 to releases of men in Class B for educationalpurposes.The War Cabinet decided that specific reference in thisparagraph to education would throw the draft out of balance, andwould raise the question why a number of other important services were not mentioned.(ii) The question was raised whether the last sentence inparagraph 11, which referred to men being &quot; mainly required to supplement the labour force available for building houses againstthe time when sailors, soldiers and airmen would be returning in large numbers to civil life,&quot; was in conformity with the PrimeMinisters directive on Man-Power in Stage II (W.P. (44) 431),which assigned first priority among civil purposes to the restorationof the export trade.The view of the War Cabinet was that it would be undesirable to refer specifically to the export industry in the White Paper; andthat, since the building trade was the outstanding trade in which large-scale releases in Class B would be necessary, the reference should stand as drafted.The War Cabinet then turned to consideration of the date of publication of the White Paper.
(iii) There was general agreement with the view advanced bythe Minister of Labour and National Service that the scheme oughtto be published at an early date. This was all the more necessary because a large number of articles were being published, purporting to give particulars of the scheme, but often grossly inaccurate; andthere was a danger of confusion if publication was further delayed.(iv) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, for reasons of administration, the War Office wanted the schemepublished in the very near future. Before long it was hoped towithdraw certain Divisions from France in order to prepare themfor service in the Far East. It would be important to know which men in these Divisions qualified for demobilisation under theGovernment Scheme, and it would take some months to go throughthe Army and apply the appropriate demobilisation group or codenumber to each man. This work could not be started in advance of publication of the scheme without the scheme becoming known.(v) On the other hand, the Secretary of State for Air and theFirst Sea Lord urged that it would be far better that, simultaneously with the publication of the reallocation scheme, an announcement should be made in regard to the improvements in pay and conditionsof service to be granted to those who were retained for service, andin particular to those called on for service against Japan.(yi) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the service ministers differed in their views as to the extent of the increasescalled for, the Admiralty scheme being on a more generous scale than that proposed by the Army. He had made endeavours to reach agreement on this matter with the Service Ministers, but an early settlement was made more difficult by the absence of several ministers from London. A further meeting with representativesof the Service Departments had been arranged for Monday, and hesuggested that the outcome of this meeting should be awaited.The War Cabinet \s conclusions were as follows : -(1) The revised draft White Paper set out in W.P. (44) 481 was approved, and it was agreed that it was desirable thatit should be published at a very early date.(2) If possible, simultaneously with the publication of theWhite Paper, a statement should be made as to the improvements in the conditions of service of menretained in the Armed Forces after the end of the warwith Germany. The Chancellor of the Exchequer under-took to report to the War Cabinet at an early date theprogress made on this matter.Rocket Attack. 3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security(Previous reminded the War Cabinet that at their meeting on the 28th JulyReferences: they had agreed to assign to the Rocket Consequences CommitteeW M (44)98th the work of concerting action and plans to meet rocket attack on conclusions,     the scale which then seemed possible.Minute 1  &apos;    -      He hoped shortly to be in a position to report to the Warand 104th       Cabinet on the work of the Committee; but before doing so he had conclusions     felt it right to ask the Chiefs of Staff for a revised appreciationMinute 9.)&apos;     Qf the scale of attack in the light of the later information whichhad been obtained about the rocket and of the general progress ofour Armies.   If the War Cabinet agreed he would propose thatthe Rocket Consequences Committee should in making their plans. . base themselves on this new appreciation.A discussion followed which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the proposal of the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security that the Rocket Consequences Committeeshould base their plans on the revised appreciation.
social insurance.(previous reference:W&apos;.M.(44)87thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Reconstruction (W.P. (44) 457) regarding the publica-tion of the White Paper on Social Insurance.The Minister of Reconstruction recalled that at their meetingon the 4th July the War Cabinet had decided that the publicationof Parts I and II should take place when the House reassembledafter the Recess, and that on the 11th July the Prime Minister had announced in reply to a Question that it was the Government&apos;intention to publish the White Paper in time for it to be discussedwhen Parliament reassembled after the Recess.It was desirable that Members should have a reasonable timeto study the White Paper before it was debated, and if publicationwas delayed until the House reassembled it might prove difficult tohave a debate in the first three or four weeks. This in turn woulddelay the passage of legislation to set up a Ministry of social insurance, the early establishment of which was necessary to enableprogress to be made with the legislation implementing the white paper proposals. He accordingly suggested that the White paper should be published on the 16th September, which would give an interval of ten days before the House reassembled.The texts of both Parts of the White Paper had been verythoroughly examined by the Reconstruction Committee and had been before the War Cabinet (W.P. (44) 356 and 357) at their meetingon the 4th July (W.M. (44) 87th Conclusions, Minute 3). He hopedthat the texts might be regarded as approved by the War Cabinet.Popular versions of both Parts were ready for publication.There was general agreement that it was desirable to publish the White Paper before Parliament reassembled, and. it wassuggested that the Minister of Reconstruction should consult theJoint Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury as to the date whenthe debate on the White Paper was likely to be taken with a viewto selecting a date which would give a reasonable period before the debate, without allowing too long a time to elapse. It was also pointed out that there would be advantages in publishing the social insurance White Paper shortly after the White Paper on theReallocation of Man-power.The Minister &quot;of Labour. and National Service asked whether,with a view to expediting the preparation of legislation to imple-ment the White Paper proposals, it would not be possible to passat an early date the Bill establishing a Ministry of Social Insurance.It was pointed out that it would not be possible to introducethis Bill before the debate on the White Paper. In the meantime,however, it was desirable that as much preparatory work as possible should be done.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the publication of Parts I and II of the white paper on Social Insurance, subject to such minor amendments as might be agreed between the ministers concerned.(2) Agreed that the White Paper should be published beforethe reassembly of Parliament, and authorised theMinister of Reconstruction to settle the date of publica-tion after consultation with the Joint parliamentary secretary to the Treasury.(3) Invited the Minister of Reconstruction to consider whether,pending the establishment of a Ministry of social insurance, more rapid progress could not be made withthe preparation of the legislation necessary to implement the White Paper proposals.
Administration 5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theof Forestry Chairman of the Machinery of Government Committee (W.P. (44)Policy. 420) making the following recommendations about the future arrangements for the administration of forestry policy (i) that there should continue to be a single Forestry Commis-sion covering England and Wales and Scotland on theunderstanding that there would be appropriate devolution-: tion of responsibility in different parts of Great Britain;(ii) that Ministerial, responsibility for, and control over, thework of the Forestry Commission should be assigned tothe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theu v,, Secretary of State for Scotland acting jointly; thepresent statutory powers of the Treasury being reducedto the normal powers of control in establishment andfinancial matters;(iii) that the statutory provision whereby one of the membersof the Forestry Commission must be a Member of theHouse of Commons should be repealed and that Membersof the House of Commons should be disqualified from being members of the Commission.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the main reasons infavour of (ii) was that there was likely to be a great expansion inthe Commission^ operations after the war which could not becarried out effectively unless the Commission was under directMinisterial control.-The following were the main points made in discussion : (a) Was it right to assign to the Agricultural Ministersresponsibility for forestry, seeing that the interests of forestry and agriculture sometimes conflicted ?It would no doubt be urged against the scheme that, sinceagriculture was a more important industry than forestry, thearrangement would result in the latter&apos;s being unduly subordinate to the farmers. But this argument was based on a misconception.The right way of dealing with the conflict of interests betweenforestry and agriculture was to entrust to the same Minister a clear-cut responsibility for ensuring a properly balanced policy and thenecessary power to enforce it.(6) It was important that, although, there should be the closestco-operation between the staffs of the Agriculture Departments andthe Forestry Commission, it should be made clear that the forestry commission should be responsible directly to the Ministers them-selves without any intermediary.(c) The Position of Scotland. Gn the understanding that therewould be appropriate devolutions of responsibility in different partsof Great Britain, the scheme proposed the continuance of a singleForestry Commission covering England, Wales and Scotland. Thiswas of importance in the interests of securing a unified forestrypolicy and a unified research, education and information service.The Secretary of State for Air said that there would be a strong demand in Scotland for a separate Forestry Commission forScotland. The conflict of interest between forestry and agriculturewas of particular importance in Scotland, and for this reason he strongly favoured the scheme put forward by the Machinery ofGovernment Committee, under which the Secretary of State forScotland would be responsible for both agriculture and forestry andfor securing a due balance between the two interests. He did not,however, think that the proposal that there should be a Commis-sioner instead of an Assistant Commissioner for Forestry inScotland would weigh with those sections of Scottish opinion whichdesired a separate Forestry Commission.(d) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries supported thescheme and endorsed the arguments set out under paragraph (a)above. Between the wars the Forestry Commission had bought land
piecemeal when they could get it cheap, and had not been in a strong enough position to ensure that land was selected for afforestation ona balance of the best interests of both forestry and agriculture.(e) The Minister without Portfolio said that he had discussed the matter with both Forestry Societies. He agreed it was necessarythat the Forestry Commission should be brought under ministerial control if it was to carry out the greatly increased programme ofafforestation now contemplated, but he feared that the scheme proposed might prove somewhat controversial.(/) Reference was made to the recommendation that theprovision whereby one member of the Forestry Commission must bea Member of the House of Commons should be repealed, and that members of the House of Commons should in future be disqualified from being members of the Commission. Some regret was expressed about the abolition of the present arrangement. The general viewof the War Cabinet was, however, that its continuance was notcompatible with the arrangements proposed for Ministerial controlof Forestry.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the issues raised should be submitted to thePrime Minister before a final decision was taken.Subject to this (2) Approved the recommendations of the Machinery ofGovernment Committee set out at &quot;X.&quot;(3) Authorised the Ministers concerned to arrange for detailed discussion, in consultation with the Forestry Commis-sion, of the legislative and &quot; administrative changesrequired to implement these recommendations, with aview to the introduction of legislation as soon as possible after the Recess.Civil Defence. 6.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidRelaxation Qf that he had come to the conclusion that a substantial relaxation ofFireguard fireguard duties should now be made. A new appreciation of theDuties. likely scale of air attacks against the United Kingdom had recently(Previous       been made, on the basis of which he had decided, after consultationReference:      with the Civil Defence Committee and the Regional Commissioners,W.M.(4l)92nd that the requirement to carry out fireguard duties in all parts of conclusions,     the area North and West of the line Humber to Southampton WaterMinute 12.)     could now be removed.  In parts of the area South-East of that lineit would also be possible to reduce fireguard duties to some extent in rural areas.  In London and South-East England fireguard duties would have to be retained for the present, but the position would bekept under review.There would be consultation with the Government Depart-ments which were appropriate authorities under the Fire Guard(Business and Government Premises) Order, 1943, so that theymight be informed of the proposal and invited to take similar actionin respect of the premises for which they were responsible.It was important that the public should not be informed ofwhat was proposed until the necessary arrangements for the relaxation-tion had been made.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the intentions of the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security with regard tothe relaxation of fireguard duties.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,31st August, 1944.Canada. 7.   The  Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the WarFinancial Cabinet that in 1942 the Canadian Government by the &quot; billionArrangements dollar gift &quot;&apos; had put at our disposal dollars to pay for our orderswith the United in Canada. This sum, however, had left a deficit which had beenKingdom. covered by our making a payment to Canada in United States(Previous       dollars ($150 million).Reference: In 1943-4i4 Canada had altered the arrangements.   They had.M. (42) 10th provided food and munitions as Mutual Aid and had voted an conclusions, appropriation of $1 billion. This arrangement had just seen usMinute 9.) &apos;     through the year.For 1944-45 they had voted a further Mutual Aid Appropria-tion, but had reduced their $1 billion to $800 million. In the early summer it had become clear that this sum would be quite inadequate for our expenditure in Canada. The Canadian Government had made certain proposals which, however, were obviously unacceptable to us in our present financial position. The Treasury representa-tives at Bretton Woods had gone to Ottawa for further negotiations,where they had been joined by an officer from the Ministry ofProduction..The total deficit in our balance of payments with Canada forthe current financial year was about $550 million. Under theexisting accounting arrangements, a substantial part of the expendi-ture on- the Canadian forces in the field was, in fact, being borneby the United Kingdom, and the Canadian Government had readilyaccepted the principle that Canada should pay the full cost of itsown fighting forces. To this end they had agreed to a number ofadjustments, back-dated to the 1st April, 1943. The result of these various adjustments was that the Canadian Government had accepted a financial liability which not only covered the $550 million. deficit, but provided us in addition with a further $200 million,which would discharge an agreed liability to Canada in respectof the first Air Training Scheme. The attitude of the Canadian ministers and Departments had been based on a real unstanding of our position. Lord Keynes, Sir Wilfrid Eady of the Treasury,and Mr. R. W. B. Clarke of the Ministry of Production, were tobe congratulated on the successful outcome of the negotiations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to send a message, accepting the arrangements proposed, and he hopedthat in doing so he could express the warm thanks of the WarCabinet to the Canadian Government for their generous attitude.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed.
