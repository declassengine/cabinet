The Chiefs of Staff reported the events of the previoussix days.Bad weather had interfered with all air operations. . Apartfrom an attack by Mosquitoes on three oil plants in Germany, theoperations of Bomber Command had been confined to targets in occupied Territory. Two-thirds of the effort had been against&quot; Crossbow &quot; targets.United States heavy bombers had dropped 4,350 tons of bombs.During June, Bomber Command bad dropped 57,000 and theAmerican heavies 51,488 tons of bombs.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 14,800 sortiesduring the week, dropping 1,485 tons of bombs oh transport, fueldumps and railway targets in the battle area.The enemy had lost 207 aircraft and the Allies 142 during theprevious six days.In the Mediterranean Theatre 10,000 sorties had been flown asagainst 1,200 by the enemy. 5,400 tons of bombs had been dropped on oil refineries and railway targets in the Balkans. The bombing of the oil refineries had been particularly successful. Enemy losses amounted to 179 as against 99 Allied aircraft.During the previous week confirmed shipping losses due to enemy action amounted to 2,386 tons. Total losses for Juneamounted to 36,200 tons, of which total 21,500 tons had been lost in&quot; Overlord &quot; operations.During June 14 U-boats had been destroyed and 11 probably destroyed.The First Sea Lord stated that the Minesweeping Flotilla had now sunk over 10,000 mines during the war.The First Lord of the Admiralty was invited to send acongratulatory telegram to the Flotilla on this achievement onbehalf of the War Cabinet.The United States forces in the Cherbourg Peninsula had been-grouping for an attack south-west, which had now begun.29,000 prisoners had been taken in this area. The total number ofprisoners taken in Normandy was now about 50,000. British troopswest of Caen had delivered an attack across the River Odon towhich the Germans had reacted strongly by making a series of counter-attacks, all of which had been held and heavy losses in personnel and tanks inflicted on the enemy. Eight Panzer divisions were concentrated in this area. A statement was made of thenumber of troops, vehicles and supplies which had been landed inNormandy. The Prime Minister congratulated the War Office onthis very fine feat of organisation which deserved publicrecognition.In Italy an advance had been made along the whole front.Allied forces were approaching Ancona on the east and Leghornon the west coast.The Russian offensive north of Pripet Marshes had made rapid progress. The main direction of the northern thrust was towardsDvinsk, of the middle thrust towards Vilna, and the southernthrust towards Barabowicze. This advance was begining to threaten the German forces in the north.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.2. The War Cabinet was informed that the total casualties,both American and British, in Normandy, so far reported, were about 56,000. Of these, 7,700 (2,443 British) had been killed, some35,000 wounded and some 10,000 missing.These figures might be compared with the 6,000 casualties,missing and killed, sustained by Bomber Command since the &quot; Over-lord &quot; preparatory operations started in April, out of a standingforce of 10,500. Of this figure of 6,000, it might be assumed thatsome 5,000 were missing and 1,000- were prisoners of war.   .[27815]b 2
The Secretary of State for Air was asked to consider what publicity could safely now be given to these figures of the casulties sustained by Bomber Command.german atrocities.(previous reference:Foreign 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the affairs. War Cabinet that, without consultation with us, the United StatesArgentina.      Government  had  decided  to  withdraw  their  Ambassador  to(Previous       Argentina and had thereafter asked us to follow suit.   We had reference:      agreed in the interests of Allied solidarity, but the Prime MinisterW.M.(44)26th had made it clear to the President that we were not at all satisfiedConclusions,     with the line that had been taken.   He himself was uneasy at the minute 4.)      turn of events, since the situation might become a serious one from our point of view.   Moreover, he felt that the State department were by no means clear as to what their next move would be.Ambassador Kelly was, however, to see the Argentine Minister forForeign Affairs before leaving and might then be able to ascertainsomething more positive about the general attitude of the Argentine.The War Cabinet-Took note of the Statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that freshreports had been received to the effect that massacres of Jews in hungary were taking place on an unprecedented scale. The king of Sweden had protested to Admiral Horthy. Distressing as theW.M. (43) 137th situation was, he doubted if there was any effective action we couldConclusions, take. By issuing warnings to which we could not give effect weMinute 2.)      tended to reduce their value.The Prime Minister suggested that consideration might be givento a public statement (to be linked with the recent murder of 50 airofficers by the Gestapo) that we proposed to employ 50 leadingGerman prisoners in our power on reparatory work, such as forced labour, for a period of ten years after the war, the prisonersconcerned being so informed. One effect might be to sow troublebetween the military authorities in Germany and the Gestapo.While the possibility of some form of retaliation could not whollybe excluded, it would be very difficult for the Germans to retaliateeffectively in respect of a threat by us that we should take certainaction on the conclusion of the war. During the war the treatmentof all prisoners in our hands would, of course, continue to be governed by the Red Cross Conventions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to look into the Prime Ministers suggestion.France. The War Cabinet had before them a joint  memorandumCivil Affairs (W.P. (44) 366) by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theAgreement. Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Secretary of State for War,(Previous reporting the outcome of the work of the special committee set upReference: by the Secretary of State for War to discuss arrangements for theW.M.(44)79th control of Civil Affairs in France with M. Vienot, and stating that conclusions, certain of the French representatives at the recent discussions had minute 4.) returned to Algiers to obtain approval for their work, and werehopeful that this would be given.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the out--come of these discussions had been conveyed to Washington, and weawaited the reactions of the United States Government, pendingwhich no action was in view. He enquired whether the PrimeMinister would see advantage in making a personal communication on the subject to the President.The Prime Minister was of opinion, however, that the balanceof advantage rested with the use of the official channel, and theWar Cabinet agreed that this should be done.
Air Raids:Attacks by flying Bombs.(previous reference:W.M.(44)84thConclusions,Minute 2.)4.   The War Cabinet had before them : (i) A memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security (W.P. (44) 358) on the subject of thepublication of air raid casualty figures for the month ofof June; and(ii) A memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security (W.Pi (44) 359) proposing that, subjectto appropriate safeguards, the Press should be permitted to indicate that London had been the target of the enemy attacks and had borne a share of the resulting casualties and damage.The Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security gave theWar Cabinet figures of the weight of bombs dropped and thenumbers of casualties caused in the flying bomb attacks. The weightof high explosive dropped in London in the two weeks ended29th June was 650 tons as compared with 770 tons dropped inLondon from aircraft in the worst fortnight of the 1940-41 raids.(October 1940.) A map which had been prepared to illustrate the incidence of the attack in the London area up to 27th Juneshowed that the main weight had fallen on the boroughs South ofthe river, Lewisham, Croydon, Greenwich and Southwark havingsuffered particularly. The total number of casualties up to datewas 17,328. Although the number of killed was relatively small, about 2,000, the total number of killed and seriously injured in London for the 14 days up to the 29th june was 7,403 as compared with 16,456 for the whole month ofSeptember 1940. The fact that many of the bombs fell in daylight,when people were going about their business, no doubt led to ahigher casualty rate. The bombs had a high blast effect and many casualties were due to broken glass.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that, although the damage to factories in the London area had not been great, the attacks were having a serious effect on output.The Prime&apos;Minister said that so far as the Civil defence services were concerned it was clear that they were doing excellentwork in London. There should be no hesitation in bringingreinforcements to London from other parts of the country. Thefullest possible facilities should be provided for the evacuation from london of persons whose work did not require them to remain, and particular care should be taken to provide help for people who couldnot afford to make their own arrangements. The carrying out off first aid repairs on damaged houses should be treated as a matterof the utmost urgency, and a scheme for the transfer of suchcasualties to hospitals in other parts of the country should be worked out. It was also necessary to consider the possibility of changes in the warning system.A discussion followed as to the line to be taken in dealing with questions which had been put down for answer by the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House ofCommons on the 4th and 5th July as to the outcome of the conver-sations with the French.The Prime Minister suggested that the general line to be takenshould be that we had on the official level examined and arrived ata certain basis of ascertained conclusions. These had been for-warded to the United States Government, but we had not ourselvesconsidered them governmentally, and would not do so until the^) observations of the United States Government were available to us.The War Cabinet-Agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal and invited theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to discuss with him the actual terms of the replies to be given.
It seemed clear that a general statement on the subject of the flying bomb attacks should be made in the House, and, if hiscolleagues agreed, he would propose to announce on the following day his intention of making a full statement on Thursday, the6th July. Should the House desire to discuss this statement the debate would have to be in Secret Session. The statement wouldgive an indication of the weight of the attacks and would includereferences to the casualty figures and to the fact that London hadbeen the target.The following points arose in the detailed discussion of thepoints touched on by the Prime Minister : (a) Repair of Damage to Houses. The Minister of Healthexplained that on average the attacks were destroying about 500houses and damaging 21,000 each day. In the first twelve days ithad been possible to carry out repairs on about 8,000 houses a day,and, although the rate of repair had now risen to around 12,000 aday, this meant that arrears were accumulating at the rate of9,000 houses a day. Moreover, the work was being concentrated onthe most lightly damaged houses, and the progress of repairs wouldbe slower when the more heavily damaged houses were reached.The labour employed in the London area was at present about30,000 men, as compared with 40,000 men in the heaviest raids of1940-41. In his view the labour force should be raised to 50,000or 60,000 men. Some difficulties had arisen at first in the billetingof workers brought into the London area, but the position now wasthat room could be found immediately for 10.000-15,000 additionalworkers.The Minister of Labour and National Service and the Ministerof Works explained that every effort was being made to bringadditional labour into the London area. It was hoped that by theend of the week the labour force would have risen to 40,000 men,and a further 10,000 would be brought in the following week. TheMinister of Works said that in addition to the labour forceemployed on the repair of damaged houses, about 15,000 men were employed on the repairs to factories. The work of repair was making heavy demands on materials, and special steps had had tobe taken in order to collect materials (e.g., tarpaulins) from otherparts of the country.The Prime Minister suggested that the Ministers concerned should confer with a view&quot; to settling what number of building workers was required in order to keep pace with the damage to house property and to decide what steps were required to providethe necessary labour.(b) Rehousing and Evacuation-It was generally agreed that every effort should be made to make the maximum use of any avail-able accommodation in London including any accommodationvacated by the United States forces. It was pointed out, however,that in many cases homeless persons did not desire to move to other districts in London.The Minister of War Transport said that the numbers ofpersons travelling out of London at the week-end had been unprecedented-cedentedly high and that the railway companies had been given full authority to run additional trains. Although there had beenlarge crowds at the stations and many people had had to wait forlong period, the railways had been able to cope with the traffic.The Minister of Health said that, with the agreement of thePrime Minister and the Home Secretary and Minister of home security, he had decided to start the organised evacuation of schoolchildren from London and from the area immediately to the southin the line of fire of flying bombs. Once the evacuation of schoolchildren had been carried out, it would be necessary to considerthe evacuation of mothers with young children, although it mustbe remembered that difficulties arose in billeting mothers. Evacua-tion by private arrangement was also being encouraged.
There was general agreement that any persons who did not require to remain in London and in the areas immediately to thesouth of London, in the line of fire of the flying bombs, should be encouraged to move to other areas; and it was suggested that theMinisters concerned should consider what further facilities couldbe provided.(c) Casualties. It was generally agreed that it would bedesirable to arrange for the removal from London hospitals of anycasualties who could be transferred. Battle casualties had been lessthan expected and there ought to be enough accommodation to sparein hospitals outside London.The Minister of Labour and National Service pointed out that,if necessary, accommodation could be made available in hostel sickbays in other parts of the country. /- The Minister of Health said that he would look into thequestion of the transfer of casualties from London hospitals as amatter of urgency.(d) Warning System. The Prime Minister suggested thatalternative arrangements should be made for the sounding ofwarnings both in the area outside London in the line of fire and inthe London area itself. He doubted whether the present system ofsirens was suitable to the nature of the attacks, and felt that itmight be desirable to substitute some system under which the warn-ing would be given only when a bomb was approaching and only inthe limited area where the bomb was likely to fall. If a system ofthis kind could be devised, it would be easier to give people specificinstructions about taking cover.It was also pointed out that, although there were objections tothe firing of guns in the London area, the sound of guns gave an indication of the approach of flying bombs.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe would consider the suggestions made, but that it was extremelydifficult to find any adequate substitute for the existing warning system. In general, the siren warned people to be on the alert and,by and large, as experience of the attacks was gained, people were taking cover without too much interruption of their normal life.The Minister of A ircrafi Production said that he was satisfiedthat the factory warning system was operating very efficiently.In connection with the warning system reference was made tothe fact that a number of ships loaded with ammunition were atpresent in the Thames Estuary.The Minister of War Transport said that he had already arranged to transfer a number of these ships elsewhere and would look into the question of transferring the remainder.In the course of discussion, reference was made to a numberof operational matters, including the question of counter-measures.A record is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement made by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security as to the extent and weightof attack by flying-bombs and of the information givenby the Secretary of State for Air and the Joint Parlia-mentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply, on the counter-measures which would be adopted, and of their estimateof the probable scale and duration of the attacks.(2) Agreed that in the present situation we should concentrateresources from other areas on relieving the position in greater London.
(3) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service, inconsultation with the Minister of Production, the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security, the Minister ofWorks and the Minister of Health, to settle the size of thelabour force required to keep pace with the damagecalling for first-aid repairs in London, and to decide what further steps should be taken to secure the necessarybuilding workers.(4) Invited, the Minister of Health to ascertain whetheraccommodation could be provided for homeless personsby the use of premises in the London area vacated by theUnited States forces.(5) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security,in consultation with the Minister of Health and theMinister of War Transport, to consider (a) what steps could be taken to expedite the evacuation of the priority classes from London and from theareas south of London in the line of fire of flyin bombs; and(&amp;) whether facilities could be offered for the evacuation from the London area of persons whose work didnot make it necessary for them to remain there.(6) Invited the Minister of Health to arrange for the transfer -on the largest practicable scale of casualties fromhospitals in the London area to hospitals in other partsof the country.(7) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to consider, what modifications could be made in thewarnino- system, both in London and in the areas outside london affected by the, flying bomb attacks, with a viewto reducing to a minimum the interference with workwhile at the same time preventing avoidable casualties.(8) Took note that the Minister of War Transport had taken steps to divert ammunition ships from the London Dock.(9) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a compre-hensive statement on flying bomb attacks in the Houseof Commons on Thursday, the 6th July. If the Housedesired to discuss the statement, the debate would haveto be in secret session.(10) Approved the proposal in W.P. (44) 358 that the casualtyfigures for the month of June should be published inthe usual way, and the proposal in W.P. (44) 359 that,subject to appropriate safeguards, the ban on references to the London area in connection with these attacksshould be lifted; and took note that in his statement tothe House, the Prime Minister would include references to the casualty figures and to the fact that London hadbeen the target of enemy attacks.(11) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Chiefs of Staff to consider and report on. possiblecounter-measures against Germany, in respect of the deliberate use of an indiscriminate form of attack.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,3rd July, 1944.
