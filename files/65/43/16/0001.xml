IndianMinister atWashington.(previous reference:W.M.(44)74thConclusions,Minute 2.)-  [279862. On the 9th June the War Cabinet had considered a proposalset out in a Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 221) thatthe Agency-General of the Government of India in washington should be made into an independent Mission headed by a Minister.It had been decided to postpone consideration of this proposal untilLord Ffalif ax&apos;s next visit to this country.Consideration of this matter was now resumed.-2] b 2Oil. i.   The War Cabinet had before them three telegrams from(Previous Washington (Nos. 4136, 4137 and 4138) about the discussionsEeference: between the British and American delegates in regard to theW.M.(44)93rd proposed oil agreement. The Lord Privy Seal reported that theConclusions, American delegates had seen strong objection to our proposal to minute 1.)      amend Article 1 (3) in the Memorandum of Agreement by theaddition of the words &quot;.....with due regard to the right of each country to draw its consumption requirements to the extent thatmay be considered necessary from the production in its territories,or in which rights are held by its Nationals.&quot; Our delegation saw no prospect of getting this amendment accepted. It seemed thatthe Americans suspected us of seeking at all costs to excludeAmerican oil from British markets.It was also reported that the Americans now took the view thatthe words &quot; relevant economic factors &quot; excluded any limitation onforeign oil imports to Britain on account of exchange difficulties.The views of the delegation on the situation which had arisenwere reported and instructions sought as to the line which shouldbe adopted.The War Cabinet also had before them a draft reply to these three telegrams (attached to the minutes as an Annex), preparedby a Committee of Ministers. The purport of this draft was thatthere could be no question of accepting any arrangement whichwould prejudice our exchange position. Provided, however, wecould get satisfaction on this point, and in a form which we could make public, we should not, in view of the possible repercussions on other issues, press for the proposed amendment to Article 1 (3).Several Ministers took the view that we should be weakeningour position, not only in the oil negotiations, but also in negotia-tions on other commodities if we agreed to drop the amendment to article 1 (3). It was also urged that, since it looked as thoughthe negotiations would in any case break down, there was nothing to be gained by making a concession in regard to the proposed amendment.On the other hand, it was urged that the consequences of a breakdown at this juncture in the oil negotiations would be veryunfortunate, and that, if a break was to come, it was important thatit should be on inexpugnable grounds. Furthermore, it was urgedthat, provided we insisted on a clear statement that we should haveto take exchange difficulties into account in deciding the sources of our oil supplies, we should, in fact, secure all or virtually allthe liberty of action which we desired.Further discussion showed the latter to be the preponderantview of the War Cabinet, and it was decided to despatch the draft telegram, subject to two minor amendments (a) the insertion in paragraph 5, line 9, of the words &quot; it mightbe&quot; before &quot;by circumstances&quot;;(b) the addition of the following new concluding paragraph : &quot; If as a result of this telegram you find thatthe United States delegates desire postponement ofthe discussions, this would suit us very well.&quot;Note. Before action could be taken on this conclusion,a telegram was received from Washington reporting that there had been fresh developments, and thata further message should be awaited.
The main argument in favour of this proposal was that a minister who was head of an independent Mission, instead of being a member of the Embassy staff, would carry more weight as arepresentative of the Government of India, and that this wouldbe helpful to us in getting a better appreciation in America of theIndian position.- On the other hand, it was argued that if this change was made,reciprocal facilities in India might be asked for with consequences which might be embarrassing, and that there was no particularadvantage to be gained by making the change proposed at thepresent time.The War Cabinet-Agreed that no change should be made at the present time,but that the proposal could, if necessary, be brought up again in six months&apos; time.3.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (44) 426) containing a copy of correspondence withthe Viceroy as to the reply to be given to Mr. Gandhi&apos;sletter of the 27th July to Lord Wavell.(ii) A report by the India Committee (W.P. (44) 429, Revise)containing revised paragraphs which it was suggested should be substituted for paragraphs 3-5 of the draft reply proposed by the Viceroy (Appendix IV toW.P. (44) 426).The India Committee also recommended that, in order to keepthe initiative in our hands, the correspondence should be releasedas soon as Mr. Gandhi had received the Viceroy&apos;s reply, and that theViceroy should be so informed and asked to make it clear toMr. Gandhi, in whatever way he thought fit, that immediatepublication was proposed.The Prime Minister expressed grave uneasiness as to theposition which had developed. It was most undesirable that theViceroy should find himself in correspondence with Mr. Gandhi or that matters should have taken a turn that could be represented asa renewal of negotiations between Mr. Gandhi and The King&apos;representative. Mr. Gandhi had consistently been a bitter enemy ofthis country. The proposals which he had now put forward involvedacceptance on our part of &apos;&apos; immediate independence &apos;&apos; coupled witha readiness to accept a so-called &apos;&apos; National Government&apos;&apos; for theperiod of the war. We were to be allowed to continue militaryoperations from India, but on the understanding that no financial burden would fall upon India. Propositions of this nature were quite unacceptable, and he was disturbed to think that we shouldbe corresponding with Mr. Gandhi regarding them. Was therenot the risk of our being misunderstood by the minorities and byMr.- Jinnah % Would it not be better that any reply should take theform of an acknowledgment by the Viceroy or his private secretary,to be coupled with a public statement by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto which Mr. Gandhi would be referred ? In any event it was surelyessential that a very firm line should be adopted and no risk run of our giving the impression that we were truckling to Mr. Gandhi.The Secretary of State for India said that the Viceroy had notconsulted him before informing Mr. Gandhi, in his letter of &quot;the27th July (WT.M. (44) 426, Appendix I), that he would be glad toconsider a definite and constructive policy if put forward by him.It was in reply to that letter that Mr. Gandhi had put forward his present proposals, and it was impossible, in the Secretary of State&apos;judgment, to avoid a reply being sent to them. It would be difficult,too, for that reply to be sent by anyone but the Viceroy. It was truethat Lord Wavell was under instructions not to enter into negotia-tions with Indian political leaders.  But it was equally very difficultIndia.Gandhi.(previous reference:W.M.(44)90th   .Conclusions,Minute 4.)
for the Viceroy to decline to have any conversations with, or respond to any overtures from, prominent political personages. And there could be no question of Mr. Gandhi&apos;s political importance. he agreed that the draft which the Viceroy had proposed was open toexception in certain respects. The revised draft prepared try the india Committee was firm and dignified, and he strongly urged its acceptance. The matter was one of urgency, since the Viceroy wasto go on tour on the 5th August and was anxious to despatch his reply to Mr. Gandhi before doing so. Mr. Gandhi was likely tomeet Mr. Jinnah in the course of the next three or four days, andLord Wavell favoured the despatch of his reply to Mr. Gandhibefore the meeting took place.The Lord President of the Council said that the India Com-mittee fully recognised the difficulties of the position to which thePrime Minister had drawn attention. On the other hand, we were faced with a situation in which we could not easily avoid a replyto Mr. Gandhi. The reply proposed was entirely in line with thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as recently restated by theSecretary of State for India in the House of Commons. It wasalso within the terms of Sir Stafford Cripps&apos; offer of 1942 whichwe had again reiterated as our policy.Other points made in discussion were : (a) Even as amended by the India Committee, the proposed reply was much too forthcoming and in much too friendly andconciliatory a spirit. We had to consider the reaction of correspondence of this nature on other parties. It would be best to stiffen the tone of the reply.(&amp;) A neutral statement in the third person by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment or the Government of India, setting out the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, would be preferable to an answer bythe Viceroy.(c) Attention was drawn, on the other hand, to the importancein dealing with Indians of combining the utmost firmness withgreat politeness and of scrupulous observance of form. Mr. Gandhihad, after all, written his letter in response to a letter from LordWavell. It would be difficult, without giving rise to misunder-standing, and given our general policy of encouraging indians to get together to reach agreement on India&apos;s problems, to refuse to let him have a reply.(d) It was also urged that a statement by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be too great a compliment to Mr. Gandhi.(e) Attention was drawn to the absence of any reference tothe position of the Indian States. While the government of theStates might be open to criticism, we were under great obligations to them and they were entitled to full consideration. It was explained, however, that the correspondence had reference only tothe transitional stage and to the government of British India. TheStates would not be affected at this point and reference to them was therefore not called for. They had not been mentioned in mr. Gandhi&apos;s letter or in the Viceroy&apos;s telegrams under reply.Discussion ensued on the terms of the draft reply as amended by the India Committee.   The following suggestions were made :  (i) In general the draft should be stiffer and less forthcomingin tone, and more concise in statement.(ii) Paragraph 3.Attention was  drawn to the phrase  &apos;&apos; offer of complete and unqualified freedom.&quot;(iii) Paragraph 5.(a) The suggestion was made that paragraph 5 of thedraft as amended should stop at the end of thesecond sentence, with the words &quot; on that basis.&quot;(&amp;) The Prime Minister suggested further examinationof the words &quot; moving fast towards a victoriousconclusion.&quot;
(c) The suitability of the words &quot;India can hardlyplay her proper part in the post-war settlement &quot;&apos;in the last sentence (if retained) of paragraph 5was questioned.(iv) Paragraph 6.(a) In several passages the third person would be more appropriate than the first person.(b) It was suggested that for the fourth and subsequentsentences a passage on the following lines shouldbe substituted:  &quot; I should be glad to help to achieve agree-ment if I thought I could do anything to help.But the Indian problem cannot make progressuntil the Indian Leaders are closer togetherthan they are now. It is, therefore, on thoseLeaders that there rests the primary responsi-bility. Let me remind you too that minorityproblems are not easy. They are real and canbe solved only by mutual compromise andtolerance.&quot;The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatIndian policy raised issues of great delicacy and political importance and called for very careful handling. He would still have preferred that a situation in which the Viceroy was in correspondence with Mr. Gandhi should not have arisen. As it hadin fact arisen he agreed that a reply to Mr. Gandhi should go fromthe Viceroy, and in general he accepted the soundness of the lineproposed by the India Committee. He invited them, however, to reconsider their draft in the light of the discussion and of the specific suggestions for amendments which had been put forward,and to submit for consideration a revised draft. Meanwhile, hewould himself communicate privately with the Viceroy and explain that a matter of this importance called for fuller consideration andthat, despite any inconvenience caused, we must ask him to await the considered reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s proposals at &quot; X.&quot; .Man-Power 4.   At their meeting on the 12th July the War Cabinet hadin 1945. approved the provisional allocations proposed by the Man-PowerAllocation to Committee for the last six months of 1944, subject to certainthe Royal Air provisos. One of these provisos had been that the provisional alloca-Force and tion proposed for the Ministry of Aircraft Production should beMinistry of reviewed in the light of an examination of the assumption as to theAircraft strength of the Royal Air Force in 1945 to which the current aircraft production in programme should be related. Thus, should it be assumed that the1944. strength of the Royal Air Force would not be expanded in 1945(Previous beyond the strength which it was planned to reach at the end ofReference:        1944?W.M.(44)90th The War Cabinet now had before them a note by the SecretaryConclusions,     of  State  for  Air  and  the Minister  of Aircraft  ProductionMinute l.)      (W.P. (44) 423)   giving  particulars  under  the  following  threeheads: (a) The planned expansion of the Royal Air Force between now and the end of 1945 on the assumption that thewar with Germany continues.(&amp;) The effect on this planned expansion of the cut in man-power for Ministry of Aircraft Production proposed in w.P. (44) 375,(c) The effect on the man-power requirements of the RoyalAir Force and of Ministry of Aircraft Production ofa decision that the Royal Air Force should not be expanded beyond the size to be reached (under present plans) by the end of 1944.
After a short discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the assumption which should govern the current aircraft programme should be thatthe Royal Air Force would not be expanded beyond the size to be reached (under present plans) by the end of1944, that is to say, 522 squadrons.(2) Agreed that the detailed implications in this decision shouldbe worked out by the Minister of Labour and NationalService, the Minister of Production, the Secretary ofState for Air and the Minister of Aircraft Production,any unresolved difficulties being submitted to the WarCabinet for final settlement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,3rd August, 1944.. -ANNEX.Oil.Draft Telegram to Washington.Following for Lord Beaverbrook : Your telegrams Nos. 4136, 4137 and 4138 have been considered by Ministers.1.   The words in dispute in Article 1 (3) of the Memorandum of- agreement were inserted for two reasons : (a) To protect our exchange position in determining the sources of our oil imports.(b) To meet the criticism that the arrangement as originally framed wasone-sided in character since, while the United States domestic production was assured of a protected market, we had no corresponding right to draw the oil we required from our own sources.2. So far as concerns the safeguards of our military and strategic position,we understand that no difficulty arises.3. There can be no question of accepting any arrangement which would prejudice our exchange position; and if we cannot obtain satisfaction on thispoint there will be nothing for it but to make it clear that we are unable to sign the agreement.4. On the other hand, we regard it as important not to break with theUnited States, save on the most vital issues, bearing in mind the repercussionsupon the other vital discussion which we are about to enter into on Stage IIaffecting munitions, food and shipping.5. We suggest, therefore, that you should take the following attitude. you should make it clear that we cannot enter into any arrangement which would tieour hands with respect to any measures we may find it necessary to take in orderto protect our exchange position. It should, therefore, be made clear beyond doubt that the phrase &apos;&apos; relevant economic factors &apos;&apos; includes exchange difficulties,and that we may be forced, by circumstances over which we have no control, totake into consideration exchange questions in deciding the sources of our oil supplies. The justification for such a stipulation as this has been recognised bythe Americans in discussions on other matters. So long as this point is clearly understood and we are free to state this publicly, then, rather than break at this juncture, when good relations are so important, we would reluctantly agree to drop the amendment to &quot;Article 1 (3) now in dispute. In reaching this decisionwe are influenced by the consideration that the contemplated arrangements areconcerned primarily with production, and with this distribution only so far asrelevant to production.6. We trust that an explanation on these lines will overcome the difficultieswhich have arisen. While emphasising that your instructions represent theminimum safeguards for which any Sovereign Power could ask, you should makeit clear how reluctant we should be to see these important negotiations breakdown. If the Americans have any adequate alternative, they will no doubt put it forward now before a rupture becomes inevitable.7. If you should think that the Americans suspect us of harbouring anysinister designs against their oil interests, you will no doubt disabuse them.
