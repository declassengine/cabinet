Naval,Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.(44)99thConclusions,Minute 1.)Aii-Operations.Home Theatre.Plying Bombs.naval operations.MilitaryOperations.Normandy.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious nine days.Bomber Command had flown 6,856 sorties and dropped22,700 tons of bombs.United States heavy bombers had flown 10,400 sorties and dropped 19,700 tons of bombs, 11,000 of which had been on Germany.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 29,000 sorties and dropped 6,000.tons of bombs. They had also destroyed 187 tanks,177 locomotives and a considerable number of motor transportvehicles and railway trucks.The enemy had lost 232 aircraft as against Allied losses of 335.During the previous nine days 539 flying bombs had been launched, of which 51 per cent, had been destroyed. 16,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on flying bomb launching sites and storagedepots.During the week ending the 7th August there had been noshipping losses due to enemy action. Total losses for July amountedto 74,020 tons.Eight U-boats had been destroyed and four probably destroyed during July.The Prime Minister said that what might prove to be a battle of great importance was now being fought in Normandy. TheBritish and Canadian attack south of Caen was proceeding satis-factorily and our armour was now within 6 or 7 miles of Falaise.The American forces, moving with great daring, were engaged ina wide encircling movement. To avoid encirclement of part of his forces the enemy might have to make a considerable withdrawal.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Air Raids.Casualties.(previous reference:W.M.(44)99thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave the War Cabinet the following figures as to the attack by flyin bombs. Casualties since the inception of the attack up to 6 a.m., the9th August: -Killed    ...      .........      ...       5,194Seriously injured        ...       ...      ...      14,971Slightly injured .........      19,36539,530Air Raids.(previous reference:W.M.(44)99thConclusions,Minute 6.)Attack byPlying Bombs.Public warning system.Poland.(previous reference:W.M.(44)99thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat there had been some criticism that the time for which the sirensounded for the &quot; alert &quot; or &quot; raiders past &quot; was rather on the longside. He proposed gradually to reduce the time of the signal,perhaps by as much as 50 per cent. He did not suggest making any public statement, but would observe what the reactions of the publicwere.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security.4. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a personal telegram which he had received from Premier Stalin about histalks in Moscow with M. Mikolajczyk, Grabski and Romer.M. Mikolajczyk and his colleagues had then had discussions witnrepresentatives of the Polish National Committee. No final decisions had been reached, but the outlook seemed more promising.[28045-2]b 2
The Prime Minister said that he would communicate this telegram to President Roosevelt.Reference was made to the battle in progress in Warsawbetween the Germans and the Polish Underground Army. ThreePolish aircraft had succeeded in dropping weapons for the latteron the previous night. It would clearly be much easier for help tobe sent by the Russians instead of from Western Europe; but a previous approach had been rather coldly received.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to submit to the Prime Minister the draft of a telegram which he might send to Premier Stalin on this matter.Italy. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theProposed War Cabinet that  the Daily   Worker had asked the  ItalianArticle in the Communist Party fbr permission to appoint a correspondent toBaity Worker.     Italy, and had invited Signor Togliatti to cable an article on thepresent position in Italy.In his view it was undesirable that the Daily Worker should obtain material from Italy, and it would be embarrassing if theMinister of a Government with whom we were not yet at peace wereto write articles for the British Press.He had accordingly instructed Sir Noel Charles to request theItalian Prime Minister to take steps to prevent any messages from being sent to the Daily Worker.The War Cabinet-Approved the action taken by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Jewish 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the refugees. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 434) about an offerHungarian made by Admiral Horthy to the International Red Cross that,offer to allow provided accommodation could be found by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-Jews to leave ment and the United States Government, the Hungarian authoritiesHungary. would allow all Jewish children under 10 years.of age in possession(Previous of a visa for foreign countries, and all Jews (both adults andEeference: children) covered by Palestine immigration certificates, to leaveW.M.(44)71st Hungary.   (This offer was quite distinct from the approach madeConclusions, about two months ago by the Gestapo for the transfer of Jews fromMinute 3.) Yugoslavia, Roumania, Czechoslovakia and Poland, in return forthe delivery of motor lorries and certain commodities.)The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs gave the War Cabinet the main facts about the offer. TheUnited States Government had informed us that, in their view, our two Governments should undertake to care for all Jews who were permitted to leave Hungary, or who reached neutral or united nations territory. This went beyond acceptance of the &quot; Horthyoffer.&quot; The matter had been discussed by the War CabinetCommittee on Refugees, and the general view had been that weshould take joint action with the United States Government on thismatter, but that we must make it clear to the Americans that inpractice we were not in a position to accept an indefinitecommitment.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that we could takeanother 11,000 refugees in Palestine without any conflict withpledges which had been given in Parliament as to the continuanceduring the war of the White Paper policy. The War Cabinet were informed that Switzerland had undertaken.to take 50,000 children,and possibly a greater number, though in that event additional imports would be needed. This was a very generous offer whichwould go far to relieve the situation.
Palestine. 7.   Reference was made to the attack made on Sir HaroldMacMichael, the High Commissioner, who was due to retire shortly,while travelling to attend a farewell function in his honour.The Prime Minister said that he thought it should be made clear to the responsible Jewish leaders that we looked upon them totake all practicable steps in their power to stamp out the gangsresponsible for such outrages.W.M. (44) llth The War Cabinet also agreed that consideration of the general conclusions, issues affecting our policy in Palestine should be resumed at anMinute 4. &apos;      early date.Jewish - .8.   On the 3rd July the War Cabinet agreed that the Govern-Fighting Force, ment spokesman in the House of Lords should announce that, while(Previous the creation of a Jewish Division was impracticable, the possibilityEeference: of forming a smaller unit, such as a Brigade Group, would beW.M. (44) 86th   carefully examined.Conclusions, Arrangements were in train for the formation of a brigadeMinute i.)        which could later be expanded into&apos; a Brigade Group.Discussion centred on three points.   The first was whether the brigade Group should be available for general service in any theatreor part of the world.The Prime Minister said that the Jewish Brigade would infact be called upon to serve against the Germans, but not against japan.The Secretary of State for War said that there was no intentionto employ the force in the Far Eastern war; but he thought that the brigade ought to be free from any express limitations of service.General agreement was expressed with the view that the extentto which we had made provision for refugees since the outbreak ofthe war was not realised by the United States Government, andthat, if the present offer of the Hungarian Government to allow jews to leave Hungary resulted in a considerable exodus, we should haveto press them strongly to undertake their fair share of the burden.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he was prepared to consult the Dominion Governments on this matter asproposed in paragraph 7 of the Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, but thought it was unlikely that theywould see their way to help.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The draft telegram to the United States Government(Annex IV to W.P. (44) 434) was approved subject tothe addition to paragraph 2 of the words &apos;&apos; and take their fair share of the burden.&quot;(2) In addition, a further telegram should be sent suggesting the terms of the declaration to be made jointly by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the United States Govern-ment. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government areconcerned, this should be to the effect that to the extentof their resources they will co-operate with the UnitedStates Government in caring for Jews who are permitted to leave Hungary and who reach neutral or united nations territory.(3) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited toarrange for the preparation by the Departments con-cerned of a short statement, setting out what we had done to provide accommodation for refugees since thewar, as a basis for a communication to the United StatesGovernment on this matter.
The Prime Minister suggested, and the War cabinet agreed, that this matter should be dealt with by means of aprivate letter, which would state that there was no intention of employing the brigade in the Far East, but that it would be undesirable to make any specific announcement to this effect,since this might be embarrassing vis-a-vis the United States.The second point was whether the brigade would serve inPalestine or would be brought there for demobilisation.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that if the JewishBrigade was brought back to Palestine this would lead to widedisturbances.The Prime Minister said that he agreed that the brigade wouldnot serve in Palestine.The third point concerned the question whether the Jewishforce should be allowed to carry a special flag.It was agreed that this matter should be further considered when a design for the flag had been prepared.Rocket Attack. 9. At their meeting on the 28th July (W.M. (44) 98th Con-Security elusions, Minute 2) the War Cabinet had agreed that, in the eventMeasures. of rocket attack, certain security measures, set out in Appendix I(Previous of W.P. (44) 413, should be put into force and continued for a periodReference: of 48 hours.W.M. (44) 98th The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theConclusions, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 435) pointing outMinute 2.) that under these measures all foreign governmental organisationsin this country would be absolutely prevented from communicating with their Governments or officials outside this country for a periodof at least 48 hours. He proposed that an exemption should begranted to Allied Governments resident in this country and to theUnited States and Soviet Ambassadors. The Foreign Ministers ofthese Governments and the Ambassadors would, however, be askedto make themselves personally responsible for ensuring that no information about rocket attack was sent out of this country byordinary cypher telegram and courier, and steps would also betaken to ensure that such information was not sent out by the UnitedStates Embassy over their direct lines or by the private wirelesstransmitter at the Soviet Embassy. The Foreign Office would agreethe terms of the request to the Allied Foreign Ministers and the ambassadors with the Home Defence Committee.The War Cabinet Approved the proposal made by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in W.P. (44) 435.&quot; Overlord &quot; 10.   At their meeting on the 7th July (W.M. (44) 88th Con-Security, elusions, Minute 2) the War Cabinet had agreed that on the(Previous 1st August Sir Findlater Stewart should review the &quot;Overlord&quot;Reference: security restrictions still in force in consultation with the Depart-W.M.(44)88th    ments concerned and with S.H.A.E.F.Conclusions, The War Cabinet now had before them a note by the MinisterMinute 2.) of Production (W.P. (44) 432), annexed to which were extracts froma report by Sir Findlater Stewart giving the result of a review whichhe had carried out.It was explained that, as a result of the review, it had beenagreed that the visitors&apos; ban should be lifted from the Firth of Fortharea and that an announcement to this effect had been made. It had also been agreed that the restrictions on overseas travel and on travelbetween Great Britain and Ireland should be removed, and theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security, had made a state-ment in Parliament indicating that there would be a relaxation ofthese restrictions.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,9th August, 1944.With regard to the remaining measures, S.H.A.E.F. had agreedthat the restrictions on telephone calls between Great Britain andIreland might be removed on or about the 15th August, and that the eire authorities might be informed about the same date that theAer Lingus Teoranta Service might be reintroduced. The security service and the security authorities in the War Office had strong objections to the restoration of the Swedish A.B. Aero TransportService, and it was proposed that the Departments concerned should consider this matter further with the Security Executive.^ S.H.A.E.E.-had urged that the visitors&apos; ban on the area fromv the Wash to Southampton should be retained for a further period,which might amount to a matter of months. On the other hand, theCivil Departments, who were prepared to accept the continuance ofthe ban for a few more weeks, were of opinion that it imposedconsiderable hardship on the population and should be removed assoon as possible.In discussion, it was pointed out that, in view of the recentcourse of operations, the arguments adduced by S.H.A.E.F. infavour of the retention of the ban had lost much of their force. Theban undoubtedly imposed inconvenience on the civil population bydebarring them from holiday areas, and the general feeling of theWar Cabinet was that it would be desirable to explain to S.H.A.E.F.that in all the circumstances they hoped that the request for thecontinuance of the ban for a further period would not be pressed.The Secretary of State for War explained that, long before theimposition of the general ban in the interests of &quot;Overlord&quot;security, the public had been excluded from certain coastal areas in kent. He assumed that, despite the raising of the general ban, thepublic would continue to be excluded from these areas.The Secretary of State for War also undertook to consider what steps might be taken, by the removal of barbed wire and otherobstructions, to give the public freer access to the sea in areas wherethere was no longer any reason for excluding them from the beaches.With regard to the removal of the restrictions on telephone callsbetween Great Britain and Ireland and the restoration of the AerLingus Teoranta Service, it was urged that there might be consider-able security objections to making any change in the present positionso soon as the 15th August. It was also argued that there were strong security objections to the restoration of the Swedish A.B.Aero Transport Service,The War Cabinet-(1) Invited Sir Findlater Stewart to explain to S.H.A.E.F. thegrounds on which the War Cabinet felt it desirable thatthe ban should be lifted and to express the hope that inthe circumstances the request which had been made forits continuance would not be pressed. The generalremoval of the ban would be without prejudice to thecontinued exclusion of the public from certain coastal areas in Kent and elsewhere for special military reasons.(2) Agreed that the proposals (a) to remove the special restric-tions on telephone calls between Great Britain andIreland, and (6) to inform the Eire authorities that theAer Lingus Teoranta Service might be resumed, shouldbe reconsidered in two to three weeks&apos; time.I (3) Took note that the Security Executive would consider with-   the Departments concerned the question whether theSwedish A.B. Aero Transport Service might be restored.

COPY&quot;NO.,lti.;. IQli/JH CONCLUSIONS9oil August, ISUiIl,  at G vja.CROSSBOW. The war Cabinet were informed that the jointp-po^jbsed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply had&quot;jecVVGion addressed to the Prime Minister a minute (copy attached)Plan? about the decision taken by the War Cabinet on the 28th Julythat efforts should be made to confuse the enemy as to where his flying bombs were falling without attempting to induce him to shift his aim in any particular direction.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Supply &quot;was convinced that action on these lines wouldnot be effective andsaidthatthe Chiefs of Staff shared his view.    There was no doubt that the enemy was aiming hisbombs at Central London, but in fact about one-half of the bombs landing within 30 miles of Charing Cross had fallenwithin 8 miles of a central point in Dulwich.    If the enemycould be induced to believe that he was shooting over the target and thus to shift the point of impact south-East from Dulwich, there would be a very considerable saving incasualties and damage.    lie accordingly suggested that theproposal which had been before the War Cabinet at their meeting on 28th July that a deliberate attempt should he madeto convey to the enemy the hnpression that his bombs were over-shooting the target should be adopted.In favour of the proposal made by the joint parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply the followingarguments were adduced;-(i) A shift of the mean point of impact to a point Gmiles south-east from Dulwich would mean that avery much greater number of the bombs would falleither on completely open country or on lessthickly built areas.    It was estimated that thiswould lead to a reduction of 1,G00 a month inthe numbers killed and of over 10,000 in thenumbers injured.    Conversely, if the enemy wereto adjust his aim in such a way as to makeCharing Cross the mean point of impact, the numberskilled each month woiild rise by 500 and the numbersinjured by 2,500.(ii) Since the areas to which the enemy&apos;s fire would .be diverted were more openly built, less damagewould be suffered to property.(ili) It was essential that the agents on-whom the enemydepended should supply him with some information.Olf the information given by these agents was merely of a vaguely confusing kind, the agentswould be discredited and the enemy would be driven to seek information by other means.    Inthe result he might well discover that his bombs were, in fact, falling short and adjust his aim.Thus,  if the policy proposed did nothing else,it would at least prevent the present position from deteriorating.-1-

0 M.08S(iv) It was not proposed to make any abrupt change inthe information conveyed to the enemy, but togive him selected information about actualincidents,  so as to lead him to build up a patternwhich would gradually convince him that he was over-shooting.    Up to the present he had beengiven the impression that lie was achieving amee:a point of impact at Charing Cross.The following arguments were brought forward againstthe proposal:-(i) The Government would be taking a very seriousresponsibility in diverting the enemy&apos;s fire from one area to another, and before attempting to do so they should be satisfied that their action would be of substantial advantage.    this had not been established.(ii) The type of property in the south-eastern areas towhich the greater weight of bombs would be diverted if the enemy were misled, was largelyof light construction,  and, despite the factthat the houses were more openly spaced, thetotal damage from any particular incident might in the result be found to be higher.(iii) The result of diverting the enemy&apos;s aim wouldprobably be that a larger number of bombs wouldland in East London.(iv) If the enemy found that his agents, after indicatingto him for over six weeks that trie mean pointof impact was Charing Gross, were suddenlysuggesting that his bombs were over-shooting the mark, he might suspect that the information given to him was deliberately misleading.    Inany event there was no guarantee that he did notcheck the agents&apos;  reports against other sources of information.Bo conclusion was reached.    It was decided thatthe policy marsued hitherto (i.e. that of giving the enemy the impression that he was achieving a mean point of impactat Charing Cross) should be maintained for the presentand that the War Cabinet should resume consideration ofthe matter later.11th August&apos;.&apos; 19UH-2-
