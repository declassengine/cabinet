United States heavy bombers had fkrwn 4,500 sorties andAir Operations, dropped 9,000 tons of bombs practically all on armament factoriesHome Theatre. and industrial targets in Germany. The synthetic oil plant atLudwigshafen had also been attacked&apos;. The Allied ExpeditionaryAir Force had flown 10,000 sorties, mostly in support of land operations. They also claimed to have destroyed 1,100 motor transport vehicles, 22 armoured fighting vehicles, 20 tanks, 36 oiltrucks, 600 railway wagons and 300 locomotives. Enemy losses hadbeen 44 aircraft destroyed in the air and 281 on the ground, asagainst 157 Allied losses.Mediterranean. Allied aircraft had flown 10,500 sorties and dropped 9,000 tonsof bombs.  Enemy losses amounted to 105 aircraft (93 on the ground)as against 65 Allied.  The Italian liner Re,x had been set on fire andwas reported a total loss.Naval Confirmed shipping losses due to enemy action for the monthOperations.       of September amounted to 23,000 tons.Home Theatre. Two U-boats had been sunk and one probably sunk so far thismonth.Warspite and Erebus had bombarded Havre with good results.Channel Ports. The first troop convoy to be sailed direct from America had arrived at Cherbourg on the 7th September.   Ostend had been considerably damaged by the enemy.    Antwerp was virtuallyundamaged, but could not be used until the estuary had been cleared.Mediterranean. -United States cruisers and destroyers had bombarded enemystrong points in the Monaco area.   On the east coast of Italy our destroyers had bombarded enemy positions and batteries in theRimini area in support of military operations.Military Canadian troops moving up the coast in the Pas de Calais had operations.       met determined opposition, but had now reached the line Bruges-Northern Ghent-Antwerp.   Enemy troops were endeavouring to cross the france. Scheldt to the Dutch Islands.   Enemy forces were still holding outin Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.   British forces had met con-siderable opposition on the line of the Albert Canal, but had established two bridgeheads across it.   Further south the UnitedStates First Army, meeting little opposition, had advanced to theline Maastricht-Luxembourg.  Further south still General Patton&apos;s army had been strongly opposed.  Metz and Nancy were still in thehands of the enemy.  The maintenance situation on the whole frontwas stretched to its limits, but would be eased as soon as we could obtain ports further east.Southern The enemy forces which had been pursued up the Rhone Valley,France.           where they had put up a determined resistance, would probablyretire towards Belfort and Mulhouse.Italy. The main thrust on the extreme right of our line was meeting with strong opposition in country which favoured the defence.   In&apos; the Florence area the enemy was withdrawing, but probably meant to stand on the Gothic line. .Russia. A Russian offensive, north of Warsaw, had met with limitedsuccess. The main Russian effort had been concentrated onoccupying Roumania and pushing into Bulgaria and Transylvania.They had reached Turnu- Severin on the Yugoslav frontier. Therewere indications of large enemy withdrawals from the Dodecaneseand also from the islands west of Greece and from Southern Greece,though it seemed likely that the enemy intended to hold on to certainkey-points. The enemy&apos;s withdrawal would be difficult if theRussians pushed on into Yugoslavia.&apos;     The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 116thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat the casualties, as a result of attacks by flying bombs, rockets and enemy shelling from the French coast, for the previous week hadbeen as follows : Killed      ......Seriously injured ...Slightly injured  ...The War Cabinet Took note of this statement.524393. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home security informed the War Cabinet that there had been two or three furtherincidents since their previous meeting on Saturday one in Kentand two in Essex.  Little damage and few casualties had resulted.The Yice-Chief of the Air Staff said that the latest informationshowed that all three incidents were caused by rockets, and slightRadar traces had been recorded. It seemed that they had been launched from the area between Rotterdam and Amsterdam, andan Intruder aircraft the previous evening reported seeing a trailof fire, probably of a rocket. He detailed the steps taken to institutecounter-measures as a result of the Staff discussions on Saturdayand Sunday.As a result of these measures, some kind of warning might bereceived of the approach of missiles, but it was uncertain how longit would take to install equipment on the Continent.Discussion followed as to whether the ban on publicity shouldbe maintained. The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefsof Staff favoured this course, since so far there was nothing toindicate that the Germans had been able to control or track theirrockets. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, on balance, favoured the continuance of silence, subject to daily review.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Information, saidthat the Minister of Information favoured the continuance of theban, and the Press editors supported the Government action. Thesituation might change if the Germans started publicising their attacks.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, shouldany question arise of imposing a drastic ban on information leaving the country, it would be necessary to issue a warning to the French,as their communications would now have to be placed in the samecategory as those of the American and Russian Governments. Thiswas agreed to.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the operational measures which had been takenby the Chiefs of Staff.(2) Agreed that for the present the ban on publicity should bemaintained.Attack by rockets.(previous reference:W.M.(44)119thConclusions.)Former PolishCabinetMinisters inRoumanla.(previous reference:W.M.(44)71stConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thePolish Government had enquired whether we could assist in getting the ex-Ministers of the Polish (1939) Government now in Roumaniaout of that country and grant them transit facilities. Later, theyhad asked whether we could arrange to fly these persons out of roumania. He thought it was clear that we should not attempt toarrange for them to. leave Roumania, and he proposed so to informthe Poles. On the other hand, these Ministers belonged to theGovernment which had declared war in 1939. If they succeeded in leaving Roumania it would, he suggested, be desirable that we shouldgrant them transit visas, and also, if that proved unavoidable,permission to go to some place in the Empire, but not the UnitedKingdom.   If the War Cabinet agreed, he would consult the
Secretary of State for the Colonies as to the choice of a place in that event.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Germany. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we proposed were informed that Mr. Morgenthau was much disposed to take theTreatment hne that we should let German economy break down after herafter defeat. defeat. It was possible that this and other issues connected withthe, future of Germany would be raised with the Prime Minister- at Quebec. If the War Cabinet agreed, he would, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and one or two other of hiscolleagues who were principally concerned, as also with the Vice-Chiefs of Staff, prepare a note for the Prime Minister, a copy ofwhich would be circulated to the. War Cabinet.After discussion, the War Cabinet -Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.possible german threat to MurderPrisoners ofWar.6. The War Cabinet had before them a report by the Vice-Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (44) 512) on a possible German threat tomurder prisoners of war. The Memorandum concluded that no action could be taken unless and until organised military resistancehad ceased or Hitler had issued a threat to murder prisoners ofwar. In that event, a warning in terms advised by the ForeignOffice should be employed, and certain other action (set out in para-graph 12 of W.P. (44) 512) might be taken.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial Gerieral Staff said that therewas at present no concrete indication that Hitler Was likely to makea threat of this nature. The issue was, however, one which mightbe raised in the Quebec discussions, and the proposals in the papernow before the War Cabinet had been drawn up with a view to their being despatched to the Chiefs of Staff, subject to the approval ofthe War Cabinet, for use in that event.The War Cabinet-   -Approved the proposals of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff as setout in paragraph 12 of W.P. (44) 512, and agreed that,subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, the report should be used at the Quebec discussions if the matter were raised by the Americans.Poland.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)117thConclusions,Minute 1.)Jet-PropelledAircraft.Question of afurther Anglo-AmericanStatement.(previous reference:W.M.(44)99thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The War Cabinet discussed the position of the Under-ground Army in Warsaw and the steps which could be.taken to aidthem.The discussion and conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the vice--Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (44) 502) on a proposal by General Arnoldfor a second joint Anglo-American statement regarding jet-propelled aircraft.The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff reminded the War Cabinetthat in January 1944 a Joint Anglo-American statement had beenissued to prevent speculation, in the press. It had then been agreed between the Chief of the Air Staff and General Arnold that nofurther official statements would be made and that publicity wouldso, far as possible be discouraged, Now; that the Germans were using jet-propelled aircraft, there was strong pressure from the
.press for information, and General Arnold had asked that the banshould be reconsidered. The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff agreed thatthis would be desirable, and if the War Cabinet approved, he would agree an announcement with General Arnold, in consultation withthe Ministry of Aircraft Production.The Minister of Aircraft Production- supported the proposal,but asked that the strongest pressure should be brought on GeneralArnold to secure permission for the publication of a photographof the original jet-propelled aeroplane. That would ensure thatthe credit for it was attributed to us while no information of value would be disclosed to the enemy.   This was agreed.It was suggested in discussion that &quot;an announcement of thekind envisaged was unlikely to dispose of criticism that the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom were behind Germany in the matterof jet-propelled aircraft, and that it would be well to bring outthat such aircraft had been used by the R.A.F. against the flyin bombs. On the other hand, it was pointed out that it would be undesirable to make exaggerated claims that might not admit ofbeing substantiated.The War Cabinet- .   ,Approved the proposal of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff as setout in paragraph 8 of W.P. (44) 502.Returned 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the prisoners of Secretary of State for War (WP. (44) 456) explaining that it wasWar. thought that about half o&apos;f the released prisoners of war might desireto have some form of rehabilitation treatment, and that he had instructed his Department to plan courses varying from six weeks to three months. The courses would include lectures, films, discus-sions and an element of physical rehabilitation, and would be-planned in consultation with the other Departments concerned.After a short discussion the War Cabinet Took note with approval of these arrangements.social insurance.(previous reference:W.M.(44)113thConclusions,Minute 4.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a note by the Ministerof Reconstruction covering final proofs of parts I and II of theWhite Paper on Social Insurance (W.P. (44) 503).The War Cabinet-Approved these proofs and authorised the Minister of reconstruction to settle the date of publication, afterconsultation with the Joint Parliamentary Secretaries to-the Treasury.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th September, 1944.
