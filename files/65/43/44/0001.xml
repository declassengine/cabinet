91W.M. 128 (44)r.Channel 1.   The War Cabinet were informed that a telegram had beenIslands. received from the Swiss Government to the effect that food for the(Previous civilian population of the Channel Islands was exhausted, and that reference: the German Government were prepared to allow the immediateWM (44) 118th removal of the civilian population (other than men capable of conclusions bearing arms) or to permit importation of food by means of RedMinute l.)&apos;     Cross ships.The Chiefs of Staff considered that as under present conditions the Islands had no military importance and British subjects were involved, no objection need be raised to acceptance of the Germanoffer. They preferred the proposal that food should be importedby Red Cross ships to the evacuation of the civilian population.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security concurred in preferring this alternative.The War Cabinet were also informed that the alternative of evacuation would involve employing for three weeks two shipsspecially built for the Channel Islands service, which were now being used in the build-up of our forces on the Continent. Furthermore,the evacuation of the population would give rise to difficulties, owingto the shortage of housing accommodation in this country.It was argued that if we were to send food to the civilian population this would enable the German garrison to hold out longer,since they would almost certainly requisition for their own usesome at any rate of the food grown by the Islanders. Moreover, itwas politically undesirable to allow this large German garrison tohold out indefinitely.On the other hand, it was felt that if we were to send in food,we could stipulate that this would be subject to agents of the red cross being allowed to go to the Islands with the food supplies and make sure that it was only distributed to the civilian population.The Prime Minister said that an occupying Power was responsible for the civilian population, and if they were unable tomaintain them it was their duty to surrender. We should, therefore,reply that so long as the German garrison remained in occupationX &quot; I we held them responsible for feeding the civilian population, andthat if they were unable to fulfil this duty we called upon them to surrender forthwith.After further discussion the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited tosend a reply to the Swiss Government on the lines proposed by the Prime Minister at &quot;X.&quot; consideration would be given by the Air Staff in consultation with theForeign Office to the&apos; possibility of dropping a messageby air, over the Channel Islands, indicating the termsof the reply which was being sent to the swiss government.(2) In the event of our failing to secure a settlement of thematter on these lines, and, of the civilian populationbeing in immediate danger of starvation, we should then take the line that we were willing to agree to food supplies being sent to the civil population of the Islands,provided that agents of the Red Cross accompanied thesupplies and remained in the Islands in order to ensurethat they were only used to feed the civil population.[28376-1]
2. The War Cabinet gave further consideration to theproposed legislation to prolong Parliament for a year from the25th November, 1944.The view was expressed that, at the present stage of the war,prolongation for as long as a year might be the subject of coh-siderable criticism and that it might, therefore, be advisable to limit the period of prolongation to six months.On the other hand, to prolong the life of Parliament for onlysix months would tie the Prime Ministers hands unduly and tendto arouse party feeling by raising the expectation that a GeneralElection was likely to take place in the first half of 1945. while there would no doubt be some criticism in the House, the balanceof advantage appeared to lie in favour of prolongation for a year.Parliament.prolongation of the life ofthe UnitedKingdomParliamentand of theHouse ofCommons ofNorthernIreland.(previous reference:W.M.

An additional period ofpaid leave would be an earnest Of the Governments intention to seethat the men who served in the Far East secured employment ontheir return, notwithstanding that those released at the end ofthe German war stood the best chance of getting good jobs.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he hoped that no. decision would be taken on this proposal until theWar Cabinet had had an Opportunity of considering a note whichhe proposed to circulate, setting out the very comprehensive pro-visiOh which was being made for the resettlement of men released from the Services.The War Cabinet-Took note that the Minister of Labour and NationalService would circulate a memorandum setting out compre-hensively the provision made by the various schemes forthe resettlement of men released from the Forces, and agreed to resume the discussion when this memorandum was available.
Quebec 5.   The Prime Minister gave his colleagues a brief account of conference. certain of the outstanding points dealt with at the Quebec(Previous        Conference.Reference:W.M.

He therefore proposed that,in lieu of the condition referred to above, there should be substitutedan understanding that the revised formula should be applied to all supplies .for Italy within programmes agreed from time to time between the United Kingdom and the United States Government,but that we should not be committed to bear any part of the cost ofsupplies to Italy outside the scope of agreed programmes.The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion,, and invited the Secretary ofState for Eoreign Affairs, in consultation with the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer, to arrange for revised instuctions in this sense to be sent to the Minister of State.Abolition of 7.   The War Cabinet discussed whether any further action the Blackout, could be taken to ensure that full advantage was taken of the recent(Previous        relaxation of lighting restrictions.Reference: It was explained that in the provinces, apart from those coastalW.M. (44) H6th areas where the fear of raids persisted, full advantage was beingConclusions taken of the relaxation, but that in London there had been littleMinute 7) &apos; change. So far as domestic lighting was concerned this was due partly to the fear of raids by piloted aircraft, partly to the require-ment of full blackout on the alert, and partly to the difficulty ofobtaining alternative curtain material. With regard to street lighting, representatives of the local authorities in the County ofLondon had made it clear that they did not think it was worth whileadapting street lighting systems to comply with the modifiedstandard now permitted, in view of the possibility that in a short time a complete relaxation of restrictions would be possible.All evidence went to show that in London public opinion wouldnot&apos;favour any further relaxation of the restrictions at present.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,27th September, 1944.

(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C RETNO CIRCULATION RECORDPROLONGATIONOP THE LIPEOF PARLIAMENTW.M.(UU)  128TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2)Wednesday, 27th September, 19hkTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he feared thatthere might he some criticism of the proposal to prolong the life of Parliament for as much as a year at the present stage of the war,      It was important that the Government should not give the impression that they were clinging to office.      There would nodoubt be critics of the Government who would pointout that the present Parliament had been electednine years ago and that of the present population noo ne under the age of 31 had had an opportunity of voting.      In view of this would it not be better tomake the period of prolongation six months and to seek a further prolongation next spring,  if, as might well be the case, hostilities with Germany hadnot come to an end in 19h4?On the general question of the continuance ofthe present Government, his own view was that it v/ould be in the best interests of the country that thepresent Government should remain in office until theend of the Japanese War, although he doubted whether inthe event this would be possible.      He was clear, however,that when the time came for a General Election, themembers of the present Government must agree on thefairest way of presenting the issues to the countryand of setting the field for the contest, and that thereshould be no question of seeking party advantage bysurprise tactics.-1-

Reference was made to a &quot;Coupon Election&quot;,under which the parties constituting the Governmentwould allocate the seats among themselves and avoidcontesting the same seats.      He did not himselffavour this course.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL expressed general agreement with what the Prime Minister had said about the manner in which any General Electionwould have to take place.     With regard to the prolongation of Parliament, he felt that the choice of a period of six months would tie the PrimeMinister&apos;s hands unduly and would he likely to exciteparty feeling in the Spring of 1945 &quot;by raising the expectation that a General Election would he heldnot later than May 19*4-5*     Another disadvantage onthe choice of a period of six months was that itmight encourage the public to expect a quicker end to the German war than seemed likely.THE HOME SECRETARY said that last year there  had&quot;been seme criticism of the legislation prolonging the life of Parliament until November 19h4, andthere might he rather more criticism this year ofthe proposal to prolong the life of Parliament fora further year.     He agreed, however, with the lord president of the Council that the period of pro-1 ongation should he twelve months.      A furtherdisadvantage of making the period six months wasthat, unless a further prolongation was agreed to,it would he necessary to hold a General Election atan awkward time from the point of view ofParliamentary &quot;business.The new registration arrangements would not he in operation until the 1st of December, 19UA, and

preparations for a po3.1 would not &quot;be completeduntil at least two months after that date*THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION suggested,as a compromise, that the proposed legislation should provide for a period of prolongation of sixmonthss which could, &quot;be extended for a further sixmonths on an affirmative resolution of the House.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE,said that, in accordance with the line which he had adopted in other cases of applications for release from the Services, he had informed the political parties that any requests for the release ofpolitical agents should be postponed until the endof September.In further discussion agreement was expressed with what the Prime Minister had said as to themanner in which any dissolution should be carried out.With regard to the proposed legislation, thegeneral feeling was that the balance of advantage layin favour of prolongation for a year,.The War Cabinet -Confirmed the decision reached at their meeting on Monday, 25th*September, that legislation should be introducedprolonging the life of Parliament fora year from 25th November, 19*4-3*Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.-3-
