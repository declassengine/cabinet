Unemployment       1.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theInsurance.       Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 535) proposing(Previous        legislation to increase the rates of unemployment benefit.Reference: Minister of Labour and National Service stressed theW.M.(43)144th imp0rtance of ensuring that adequate provision was made for conclusions,     persons who found themselves unemployed during any dislocationMmute 2.)      ^ue ^Q ^e cnange-0Ver of production from war to peace.   It was proposed that the new rates, which were set forth in paragraph 2of W.P. (44) 535, should come into force at the end of hostilities in Europe.   The Government Actuary had agreed that, in viewof the short-term nature of the proposals, it would be proper in- the present circumstances to refrain from making any increase inthe rate of contribution.   It was proposed to make one furthersmall modification in the rate for married women, the effect ofwhich would be to entitle a married woman, who wholly or mainlymaintained an infirm husband, to receive 22s. a week instead of 20s.The Secretary of State for Scotland pointed out that theproposals would increase the disparity between rates of sickness benefit and of unemployment benefit. He hoped that the presenta-tion of these proposals would be done in such a way as to allayany dissatisfaction at this disparity.The War cabinet authorised the Minister of Labour and National service to introduce legislation increasing the rates of unemploy-ment benefit on the lines proposed in W.P. (44) 535.Housing.(previous reference:W.M.(44)25tbConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Reconstruction (W.P.(44) 536) covering the report ofthe Committee appointed by the Prime Minister to make a plan for the production of prefabricated houses.The Minister of Reconstruction explained that the noteappended to paragraph 8 giving Lord Portal&apos;s estimate of thenumber of houses which the programme proposed would produceby the 31st December, 1946, did not form part of the Lord PrivySeaFs report.The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that the Committee had cometo the conclusion that, provided that there was no delay in puttingin hand the production of Portal steel houses, about 50,000 couldbe secured within two years of the launching of the programme.The Committee also recommended that orders should be given forthe production of Uniseco houses (asbestos cement on a timberframe) and Arcon houses (asbestos cement on a light steel frame).The firms concerned estimated that about 100,000 of these housescould be produced within two years of the launching of the scheme.The Committee felt that in the absence of any method of checkingthe estimates they must be accepted. The Committee had alsoexamined the Tarran house (concrete panels on a timber frame)and recommended that it should be rejected. The Committeestressed the importance of planning the production without delay,of securing an adequate flow of labour for the erection&apos; of thetemporary houses on the site, and the utmost drive and resourcein carrying out the -programme. They regarded the programme asinadequate for the needs of the population and suggested that new projects for the provision of temporary accommodation should beundertaken at once.The War Cabinet discussed first the size of the temporaryhouse programme.It was urged, on the one hand, that the production of 150,000temporary houses in two years was inadequate for our needs, and thequestion was raised whether more houses of the Portal, Uniseco andArcon types could not be secured. The use of other firms to produce[28375-2] b 2
houses of the Uniseco and Arcon types, the employment of theTarran firm, subject to the making of satisfactory financial arrangements, and the possibilities of other types (e.g., the Braith-Avaite three-storey flat unit) should be explored.On the other hand, stress was laid on the fact that the mainpublic demand was for permanent houses. While there would be noobjection to increasing the programme of temporary houses to, say,250,000, in the first two years, there was a danger that any greaterconcentration on temporary houses would slow down the productionof permanent houses, since both types would be competing for thesame fitments and for labour for erection on the site. The Ministryof Works had carried out a promising experiment in the productionof a permanent house at Northolt with a great saving in man-hours,and it Avas urged that it would be better to use labour and materialson this type than to concentrate too much on temporary houses.Further points in discussion were : (a) The Lord Privy Seal confirmed that urgent enquiries werebeing made into the possibility of designing a house of aluminium construction.(b) The Tarran firm had built a house which had received theapproval of the Burt Committee on house construction.A model of this house had been erected in an exhibitionof temporary houses which was about to be opened at theTate Gallery. In these circumstances it Avould bedifficult to reject the Tarran house altogether, and it wassuggested that the best course might be to state that thepossibility of its production on a large scale was being investigated.This was agreed to.(c) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Works, said thatthe production of temporary houses would be subject tostrict costing arrangements in order to ensure that costs were kept down to a minimum.The War Cabinet (1) Approved the programme of Portal, Uniseco and Arconhouses proposed in the report circulated with.P. (44) 536.(2) Agreed that the possibility should be explored of supple-menting the programme by the production of houses ofthe Tarran and other types, in so far as this could bedone without substantially interfering with theprogramme of permanent houses.(3) Agreed that an announcement based on (1) and (2) mightbe made during the resumed debate on the SecondReading of the Housing (Temporary Accommodation)Bill.The War Cabinet next discussed the production of kitchen units and fitments for temporary and permanent houses.The Lord Privy Seal explained that preparations had beenmade to order 175,000 kitchen units of the standard type requiredfor temporary houses.Fitments were, of course, required for permanent houses, andthe question was raised whether provision for these houses shouldbe made by ordering additional kitchen units together with otherstandard fitments.The Minister of Health said that is would be impossible to use the standard temporary house kitchen unit in all the types ofpermanent houses which local authorities would desire to build. Inthe Housing Manual which had just been sent to local authorities,however, a substantial measure of standardisation of fitments hadbeen recommended.
The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that every endeavour should be made to secure the maximum standardisation offitments, and that, although the temporary house kitchen unit mightnot be suitable for all permanent houses, it should be used wherever possible. Even where it could not be used as a whole, the componentsmight be used separately. Stress was also laid on the importanceof placing bulk orders for housing fitments, including fitments for permanent houses, well in advance of the time when they would berequired. The question was raised whether this would be feasibleif local authorities were given any considerable measure of latitudein selecting the types of permanent house to be built in their areas.The War Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the necessary orders should be given as soonas possible for the production of kitchen units and otherfitments for temporary houses;(5) Invited the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to examine as a matter of urgency andreport to the War Cabinet on the possibility of stan-dardising the fitments for permanent houses and of placing bulk orders for the necessary supplies.The Minister of Reconstruction raised the question of the pro-cedure for placing orders for the production of temporary houses and of housing fitments. Under the present arrangements too many Departments were concerned. He asked whether, now thatthe Ministry of Works had given their advice on the question of design, the Health Departments could not in future deal direct with the Ministry of Supply.The War Cabinet-(6) Agreed that this matter required examination, and invited the Minister of Reconstruction to submit his views onthe matter to the Prime Minister.The Secretary of State for Scotland stressed the importanceof ensuring that the sites on which the temporary houses would be.erected were serviced in good time. Delays had occurred in theservicing of sites, due partly to the difficulty of obtaining adequatetechnical staffs to supervise the work.The Minister of Health said that he did not expect any diffi-culties over the servicing of sites in England and Wales.The War Cabinet-(7) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to discuss withthe Minister of Labour and National Service the pro-vision of additional technical staffs.The Minister of Production drew attention to the statement in the Prime Minister&apos;s directive (W.P. (44) 188) that the emer-gency housing programme should be carried out by exceptionalmethods, on the lines of a military operation. In order to strengthenhis own position and that of the Minister of Labour and NationalService in face of competing demands for war production and forprojects for the &quot;reconversion of industry, he asked that the WarCabinet should reaffirm this statement.The War Cabinet-(8) Reaffirmed this statement in the Prime Ministers directiveof the 5th April, 1944.The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the resumeddebate on the Second Reading of the Housing (Temporary Accom-modation) Bill.The War Cabinet-(9) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Scotland should open the debate and that the Minister of Production shouldwind up.[28375-2]    . B 3
3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Town and Country Planning about the finance of open spaces (W.P. (44) 531). This matter had been discussed by theReconstruction Committee on the 30th August. It had then beenagreed that, subject to consultation with the Departments primarily concerned and the concurrence of the War Cabinet, an assurancewould be given in the House of Commons &quot;that Parliamentaryauthority would be sought to provide Exchequer assistance, whereit was shown, that a local authority could not without financialhardship acquire land for open spaces up to an approved minimum standard owing to the cost of the land in relation to the resourcesof the financial authority.The Ministers memorandum set out the statement which it was proposed should be made.The followdng points were made in discussion :  (a) The 3rd sentence  of  the statement read  as  follows:&apos;&apos; The provision of adequate open space is, in their view,a local not a central function; the benefit accrues almostentirely to the local population and only very indirectlyto the nation as a whole.1&apos; Several Ministers felt thatthis sentence was open to challenge and it was agreedto omit it.(b) The statement should refer to &quot; . . . cases in built-up areas where it can be shown to the, satisfaction of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that a local planning authority could not,without undue financial hardship, conform to the requisite standard ...&quot;(c) A sentence on the following lines should be inserted :&apos;&apos; Grants from the Minister of Education will also beavailable under the provisions of Section 3 of the physical Training and Recreation Act, 1937, as amended by Section 53 (4) of the Education Act, 1944.&quot;The War Cabinet Approved the draft statement subject to these and minordrafting amendments.4. The War Cabinet had before them a joint memorandumby the Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister of Labourand National Service (W.P. (44) 532) suggesting measures toimprove the serious housing position in London due to flying bomb attacks..Restrictions on the taking of Service leave in London.    ,The Minister of Reconstruction proposed that London shouldbe placed out of bounds for troops on leave, other than those whosehomes were in the area.The Secretary of State for War said that this was the rule forBritish troops, but that it was becoming increasingly difficult toenforce it as the danger from flying bombs and rockets decreasedand in view of the fact that it did not apply to the United Statesand Dominions Forces.The Secretary of State for Air said that Dominions forces must be treated in the same way as United States Forces.The Parliamentary Secretary, Admiralty, said that theAdmiralty were willing to accept the proposed restriction, provided an exemption were granted to personnel on 48 hours leave fromPortsmouth and Chatham. It was pointed out, however, that suchan exemption would detract greatly from the value of the proposedrestriction.
The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, in viewof the serious housing position in London, the proposed restrictionshould be imposed but that in the first instance an attempt shouldbe made to secure the agreement of the United States authoritiesto the placing of London out of bounds or to some limitation ofthe numbers of United States troops allowed to take leave in London.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to approach the United States Ambassador on the lines indicated at &quot; X &quot; above.Surrender of Requisitioned Property.The Minister of Reconstruction proposed that the service departments should surrender any requistioned property in theLondon area which was not in use and should consider sympatheti-cally applications for property still in use.The Secretary of State for War stressed the importance of having hostel accommodation in London in order to provide for troops now overseas who would be released from service or whowould be given leave in the near future. Although these troops were so far as possible routed away from London, it was inevitable that considerable numbers should pass through London, and therewould be serious criticism if accommodation for them was notavailable.The Minister of Health asked whether further steps could notbe taken to release small dwelling-houses requisitioned in theLondon area by the Service Departments.The War Cabinet-(2) Invited the Service Ministers to make every effort to releaserequisitioned property in their possession in the london area.Staffing of Hostels.The Minister of Reconstruction said that it would be of great assistance if the Service Departments would make available women from the Women &apos;s Services to act as cooks and to undertake domesticduties in hostels for building operatives.The Secretary of State for War and the Parliamentary Secre-tary, Admiralty, said that the War Office were already short oftheir requirements of women with the necessary qualifications.Moreover, if any staff were to be supplied, it would have to be on theunderstanding that the conditions of work were satisfactory.The War Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service, inconsultation with the Service Ministers, to consider what assistance in the staffing of hostels could be provided bythe Service Departments.Use of Italian Prisoners of War.The Minister of Reconstruction proposed that the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Allocation of Prisoners of war should examine the possibility of releasing, for emergency housingwork in London, Italian prisoners of war who had experience oferecting huts.The Secretary of State for War said that, while he was notopposed to the suggestion, he was very anxious that the twoConstruction Companies which had been lent for work in london should be returned to the Army, since they were urgently requiredfor operations-abroad.The War Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the Inter-Departmental Committee on theAllocation of Prisoners of War should examine the
possibility of the release, for emergency housing work inLondon, of Italian prisoners of war now employed by theService DepartmentsCivil Building by Government Departments.The Minister of Reconstruction pointed out that it had beenagreed that, for a- period of six months, no licences should begranted for building work in the London area, except war damagerepairs and the remedying of urgent sanitary and structuraldefects.He asked the War Cabinet to give a ruling that the same principle should apply to work carried out or sponsored by government Departments, which was not subject to licensing.The War Cabinet-(5) Agreed to the proposal made by the Minister of Recon-struction.Decorations and Minor Repairs in Government Departments.The Minister of Reconstruction invited the War Cabinet toagree that all work on decoration and minor repairs in GovernmentDepartments should be virtually suspended during the next sixmonths. The War Cabinet&apos;s ruling would, be applied by theMinistry of Works.The War Cabinet (6) Agreed to the course proposed by the Minister of Recon-struction.A llocation of Houses.The Secretary of State for War said that concern was beingexpressed among the Forces overseas about the allocation of houses,particularly in the London area. It was felt that persons now inthis country would get priority and that no houses would beavailable for men when they were released from the Services. Itwas desirable that some reassurance should be given to the Forces.The Minister of Reconstruction said that the British Legionhad suggested that a statement should be issued to the effect that men who had been in the Forces would have first priority. It was,of course, impossible to give any promise of-this kind.The War Cabinet (7) Invited the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor. Scotland to prepare a statement to meet the point raised by the Secretary of State for War. .Closer UnionbetweenSouthern andNorthernRhodesia and nyasaland.(previous reference:W.M.(44)90thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum bythe Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and for the Colonies(W.P. (44) 521). When this matter had last been considered by theWar Cabinet they had decided that no announcement should be made about the setting up of a permanent inter--Territorial Council, or about the related issue of amalgamation, until the results ofSir Godfrey Huggins&apos;s consultations with his colleagues, on his return to Southern Rhodesia, were known.Attached to the joint memorandum was a letter fromSir Godfrey Huggins dated the 8th August, in which the idea of a standing Inter-Territorial Council was accepted, but somewhatgrudgingly. It seemed as though pressure from Southern Rhodesiafor amalgamation might be resumed again before long.The Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and for theColonies concluded that the best course would be that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should make an announcement, as soon as possible afterthe Southern Rhodesia Legislative Assembly met in October, on thelines of Appendix B to W.P. (44) 521.    It was proposed to
communicate the draft to the Southern Rhodesia Government inadvance. Their concurrence would not be expressly asked for, but any comments which they made would, of course, be considered.The War Cabinet-Approved the course of action proposed in W.P. (44) 521.6. The Deputy Prime Minister informed the War Cabinetthat, at the meeting of the Lord Presidents Committee on the22nd September, approval had been given in principle to theestablishment of a^ College of Aeronautics on the lines proposed byan inter-Departmental committee. Subject to any alterationsnecessary on security grounds the report of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee would be published, and it was intended that an earlystart should be made with a scheme for a temporary college atAbingdon. The Deputy Prime Minister thought that the WarCabinet should be aware of this development.The Secretary of State for Air said that he regretted that theAbingdon airfield would not be available : but the scheme could be initiated on the Aldermaston airfield, which the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee had envisaged as suitable for the location of thepermanent College.Several Ministers expressed regret that an alteration should befound necessary in the scheme which had been submitted to, and approved by, the Lord Presidents Committee only three daysearlier.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production to arrange for examination at an early date of the point raised by theSecretary of State for Air, as to the availability of theAbingdon airfield for the proposed College.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that severalfurther telegrams had been exchanged since this matter was con-sidered by the War Cabinet on Friday. The President had beenvery anxious that the joint statement &quot;should be released for publi-cation in the papers that morning, the 25th September, but had now agreed to postpone publication until the morning papers ofWednesday, the 27th September.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that thiscourse should be accepted. He added that the amendments whichwe had put forward in Cordite 393 had all been accepted. he also proposed to ask the President to make a further minor amend-ment in the text of the paragraph about the provision by U.N.R.R.A.of medical aid and other supplies for Italy.The War Cabinet Approved the course proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theWar Cabinet would be aware that some difficulty had arisen as tothe grant of facilities for non-official civilians to visit France. Ithad been alleged in some quarters that more favour had been shown to United States than to British civilians.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a temporary arrangements had now been made whereby S.H.A.E:F. undertook togrant facilities for such visits to non-official civilians whose names
were communicated to them by the &quot;War Cabinet Offices as havingbeen vouched for by the appropriate authority. The War cabinet offices in this matter would act on behalf of the War Cabinet andon the recommendation of the Foreign Office.The War Cabinet Took note with approval of this arrangement.Reallocationof industrial capacity.9. The Minister of Production said that Mr. Stokes, M.P.,had put down a question to the President of the Board of Trade for answer on the following day, referring to an American decision toswitch over 40 per cent, of total production to peace purposes onthe conclusion of hostilities with Germany; and enquiring whatcorresponding action we proposed to take. He (the Minister ofProduction) had already prepared, for consideration by the WarCabinet, a statement on this subject which he suggested should bemade in Parliament in the following week. He hoped that although this draft statement had not yet been circulated, the War cabinet would agree that the President of the Board of Trade could answerMr. Stokes&apos;s question on the following day by saying that theMinister of Production hoped to make a statement in parliament at an early date.The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
