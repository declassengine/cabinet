Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.(44)95thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Flying-Bombs.Mediterranean.naval operations.Clearance of mines inCherbourgHarbour.MilitaryOperations.Normandy.Italy.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command had flown 4,900 sorties and had dropped6,636 tons of bombs on Germany and 5,764 tons on occupied territory. Stuttgart had been attacked on three nights and greatdestruction caused. Hamburg, an oil plant in the Ruhr,&apos;&apos; Crossbow &apos;&apos; targets and targets on the Normandy battle front had also been attacked.United States heavy bombers had flown 5,750 sorties and dropped 8,200 tons of bombs, half of them on targets in Germany.Bremen, the oil plant at Leuna and tactical targets in Normandyhad been attacked.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 27,000 sorties and dropped 5,380 tons of bombs on tactical targets on theNormandy front.The enemy had lost 241 aircraft against Allied losses of 290.During the week 712 flying bombs had been launched, of which372, or 52 per cent., had been destroyed and 234 had reached London.In the Mediterranean, Allied aircraft had dropped 7,600 tonsof bombs, more than half on targets in South-Eastern Europe.12,270 sorties had been flown as against 1,210 by the enemy. Alliedlosses amounted to 97 aircraft as against 240 by the enemy.During the previous week confirmed shipping losses due to enemy action amounted to 10,263 tons. Total losses for July,including belated reports, amounted to 66,801.Six U-boats had been destroyed and 4 probably destroyed during July.Reference was made to the clearance of mines in CherbourgHarbour.The Prime Minister asked the First Lord of the admiralty to report what casualties had been suffered by British diversengaged on this work.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff described the progressof the battle in Normandy. On our right wing the Americans had made a very good advance, and one of their combat groups had beenreported in Avranches. The previous day the 2nd British army had attacked and had made considerable progress in a drive southof Caumont. Heavy casualties had been suffered by the enemy, andit was considered that two of their Divisions could be written offentirely. Out of 12 enemy Armoured Divisions in the West, 10 hadalready been engaged. In the recent fighting 7,200 prisoners hadbeen captured up to the 28th July, making a grand total of 70,000in the Normandy campaign.The Prime Minister said that, in his speech in parliament on the 2nd August, he proposed to refer to the Allied casualties in Normandy. He would be glad if the Secretary of State forWar would furnish him with the percentage of losses suffered by the British and American forces,In Italy the bulk of our advance had been in the centre of thefront, opposite Florence, where stiff opposition had been met.The Russian offensive had made progress all along the 500-600-mile front. The German forces north of Riga were in dangerof being completely cut off. The German divisions at Brest-Litovskhad been liquidated; the capture of this place would make it easier for the Russians to switch their troops to different parts of the front.The thrust towards Warsaw continued, but it was probable thatthe Russians would try to outflank the city.The War Cabinet-^Took note of these statements.[27986-1]
Jet-PropelledAircraft.(previous reference:W.M.(44)98thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. Mention was made of the fact that enemy jet-propelledaircraft had been encountered by R.A.F. aircraft over Germany.Some discussion ensued as to the rate of production of jet-propelledaircraft in this country.The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for air and the Minister of Aircraft Production, in consultation, toprepare and submit to him a report on this matter.The Minister of Information again undertook to take stepsto discourage all references or speculations in the Press aboutthe operational use of these aircraft.Poland.(previous reference:W.M.(44)95thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he had sent a telegram on the 26th July to Premier Stalin informing him of the departure for Moscow of M. Mikolajczyk. He read to theWar Cabinet the text of the reply, dated the 28th July, which hethought was generally satisfactory.The War Cabinet--Took note of this statement.Greece.(previous reference:W.M.(44)89thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thatthe Soviet Air Detachment stationed at Bari had been givenpermission to carry out a training flight over Greece. They hadtaken advantage of this to drop a Soviet Mission with E.A.M.,without prior notification to us.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added that he took a serious view of this development and proposed to make represen-tations to the Soviet Government.The Prime Minister suggested that our representations should cover not only the absence of prior notification, but also theprocedure adopted.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed.Parliament.Business of theHouse.5. The War Cabinet were informed that on Wednesday, the2nd August, on the motion to fix the length of the recess,Mr. Shinwell, M.P., intended to suggest that the House should onlyadjourn till the 26th August. If this led to a discussion lasting for more than a very short while, it would interfere with the timing ofthe Prime Ministers speech.A proposal was made that, if it looked as though there wouldbe considerable discussion on Mr. Shin well&apos;s suggestion, arrange-ments should be made to carry on the debate until 2 p.m., at which time the Prime Minister would speak. If, on the other hand, littlediscussion was provoked, the Prime Minister might make his speechbefore lunch.The Prime Minister said that he would discuss the matter further on the following day with the Leader of the House andthe Chief Whip.
Air Raids. 7.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gaveCasualties and the War Cabinet the following figures as to the attack by flying-Damage, bombs.   Casualties since the inception of attack by flying bombs up(Previous to 6 a.m. on the 31st July : reference;   *                    Killed     ............... 4,640W.M.(44)95th Seriously injured        ...       ...       ... 13,571Conclusions,                   Slightly injured         ......... 17,083Minute 4.)

Of this number, 546 had been completely repaired, 637 had been repaired so that 80 per cent, ormore of capacity was usable, 231 partly repaired but less than 80 percent, of capacity was usable; 28 had been completely destroyed.Air Raids.Attacks by flying-Bombs.Public warning system.(previous reference:W.M.(44)95thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet were informed that the. Home secretary and Minister of Home Security proposed to make a statement inthe House the following day about the institution of a publicwarning signal in addition to the &quot; Alert.&quot; The statement included the following paragraph, which was designed to give guidance todrivers and conductors of public transport vehicles : &quot; My noble friend the Minister of War Transport has had discussions with the employers and the Trades Unions engagedin public transport, and it has been agreed that drivers andconductors will use their discretion as to the action they willtake when the danger signal is given. In fact, the government consider it better to rely on the good sense of the people to takethe course each considers best from his own experience and thecircumstances at the time rather than to attempt to issuedetailed instructions covering all conditions.&quot;It was pointed out in discussion that the proposed paragraphmight lead to a certain amount of confusion, since it did not make clear whether in any given situation the views of the driver andconductor or those of the passengers should prevail.The Minister of War Transport pointed out that there hadalready been discussions with the London Passenger transport board and the Unions and that the paragraph in the statement bythe Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security representedwhat had been agreed. It was essential that bus drivers should begiven discretion whether they should proceed with their journeyafter the sounding of the danger signal, or stop and take shelterthemselves. At the same time it was clearly desirable that if, whenthe signal was given, a passenger desired to dismount he should beallowed to do so.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the last paragraph of the statement shouldbe confined to making it clear that, after the signal hadbeen given, drivers were bound to stop, whether at are recognised stopping-place or not, in order to allow anypassenger who desired to do so to leave the vehicle. Forthe rest, it would be within the discretion of the driverwhether he then continued his&apos; journey or stopped the vehicle and himself took shelter.
General satisfaction was expressed with the position as shown by these figures.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that at alater date it would be necessary to organise another labour force todo the work needed to make damaged houses fit for occupationthrough the winter. He thought that this work could not be dealtwith by the ordinary method of employing private building con-tractors, but would require some special type of organisation. Hewould make proposals to the War Cabinet at a later date.Black-outRestrictions.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 115thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The War Cabinet had before them the Report of theCommittee on Blackout Restrictions (W.P. (44) 417).The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe Committee had been advised by the Air Ministry that, if anyrelaxations were made in the blackout restrictions, there was acertain danger of attacks by piloted aircraft, but that the northern and western counties were less likely to be attacked. Although thepublic would no doubt welcome any relaxation, it was clear both from general soundings and from the evidence of the supply departments as to opinion among the workers that there would be considerable criticism of the Government if the relaxations were followed by enemy raids. The Committee therefore proposed that,in the first place, the relaxation should extend only to an area northand west of a line roughly St. David&apos;s Head-Bletchley-Goole-Falkirk-Dingwall-Tongue. In this area it was proposed to allowconsiderable improvements in street lighting and to substitute a&quot;dim out&quot; for the blackout in the case of internal lighting inhouses, factories, offices, &amp;c. There would also be improvements inexternal lighting for industry and in car and cycle lights, though itwas not proposed to make any change in the regulations governinghead-lamps. The relaxation would come into force at the end ofSeptember, but local authorities and other bodies-concerned in thearea covered by the relaxation, and in certain adjacent areas towhich the relaxation might next be extended, should be told to putin hand their preparations. No priority beyond that existing atpresent should be given for labour and material needed to install thehigher standards of street lighting.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that, in view of the bomber strength of the German Air Force and the extent to which our night fighters (and anti-aircraft batteries) were. occupied incountering flying bombs and in the protection of the Normandybridgehead, there was some risk even in the limited relaxationproposed by the Committee. While he was prepared to accept this risk, he would strongly advise against any extension of the relaxation-tion to eastern and southern counties. The relaxation of theblackout in London and the more vulnerable counties would undoubtedly be regarded by the enemy as a challenge and might well lead him to combine, attacks with piloted aircraft with his flyingbomb attacks on London.In discussion, several Ministers expressed the view that therewould be serious disappointment if at the present stage of the warthe Government were to announce that the restrictions were to be relaxed over a limited area only. The relaxation would, in fact,help those areas which were least directly affected by the war, andwould lead to discontent in the remaining areas, and particularlyin London, where some measure of street lighting would undoubtedlymitigate the effects of flying bomb attacks. Since, in any event, nochange was proposed until the end of September, would it not be preferable to make no announcement at the present time, but toproceed with preparations in all areas, leaving a decision as to thedate and geographical extent of the relaxation to be taken in thelight of the circumstances prevailing in September ?
The Minister of Aircraft Production said that there mightbe difficulties in supplying the necessary electric lamps to enable a resumption of street lighting and that the question of priority wouldhave to be considered.The War Cabinet-&apos; (1) Agreed that no announcement about the relaxation ofblackout restrictions should be made at the present timeand that the date and extent of any relaxation shouldbe considered by the War Cabinet at the end ofSeptember.(2) Agreed that in the meantime local authorities and other bodies concerned in all parts of the country should be told that they could make preparations for a resumptionof street &quot;and industrial lighting on the scale suggestedin W.P. (44) 417 in order that, if at the end ofSeptember the War Cabinet should decide that therestrictions might be relaxed, they might be in a better position to carry out the decision.(3) Invited the Minister of Information to take steps to ensurethat no reference to the preparations was made by thePress.(4) Agreed that any questions of priority for labour andmaterial should be dealt with through the usual channels.Building.(previous reference:W.M.(44)45thConclusions,Minute 2.)National FireServicesRegulations(Indemnity)Bill.(previous reference:W.M.(44)96tk .Conclusions,Minute 1.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (44) 411) regarding the temporaryembargo on building labour and the allocation of building labour.The Memorandum explained that the transport situation nolonger required the retention of the embargo, and that it wastherefore proposed to discontinue it forthwith. In view, however,of the particularly acute position in the London area, due to flyingbomb attacks, and of the general shortage of labour throughout thecountry, it was proposed that in the London area major works should be started only if they were urgently needed in connectionwith operations or were of equal priority with first-aid repairs,while outside the London area departments should put forward only those projects which they regarded as most urgent.In view of the uncertainties created by the present emergencydemands for building labour, it was not practicable to put forwardimmediately any realistic allocation of labour between the Depart-ments for the second half of 1944. It was hoped, however, that proposals would be submitted shortly.The. War Cabinet-Endorsed the proposals put forward by the Minister ofProduction in W.P. (44) 411.10. The Home Secretary&apos;and Minister of Home Security saidthat when the second reading of this Bill was taken on the following day an amendment would be moved in the following terms : 1&quot; Where it is provided by any enactment that any regula-tions or orders shall be laid before Parliament, such regulations or orders shall cease to be valid unless they are laid beforeParliament in accordance with the provisions of such enact-ment within twenty-one days after the date upon which such regulations or orders are made.&quot;He had discussed the matter with the Lord President of theCouncil, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General, and had reached the conclusion that the right course would be.that on thefollowing day he should give an undertaking that legislation wouldbe introduced to provide that, in future, any Statutory Rule and
Order which might be subject to a negative resolution should cease to be operative if it was not laid before the House within twenty-oneParliamentary days.On the other hand, it was argued that ample amends hadalready been made by the Home Secretary&apos;s apology in the House,and by the introduction of an indemnity Bill, and that it was undesirable to make a specific provision which might have the effectof invalidating some order which had become the basis for a whole structure of rights and obligations.It was pointed out, however, that the Government spokesmanwould be pressed to say whether the Orders were valid, notwith-standing that they had not been laid. This was not an easy question to answer. There was some doubt about the legal position inasmuch as the Fire Services Regulations had been made under a provision which required the orders made under it to be laid before Parlia-ment &quot; as soon as may be.&quot; Moreover, there seemed every likelihood that, unless a satisfactory answer was given to the movers of theamendment, there would be pressure to make subordinate legislation the subject of an affirmative resolution to an increasing degree.After some further discussion, the War Cabinet -Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of home security to indicate sympathy with the point of view ofthe movers of the amendment, and to undertake to giveconsideration at an early date after the Recess to the best means of meeting the issue raised, whether by legislation on the lines proposed, or otherwise.Sir Firoz 11.   The Prime Minister said that this would be the lastKhan Noon. meeting of the War Cabinet to be attended by Sir Firoz Khan Noon,who was returning to India at the end of the week. He was surehis colleagues would wish him to say what pleasure it had been tohave him at their meetings, and to express their thanks for his advice and help.He would also like to ask Sir Firoz, as Defence representative on the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council, to convey to his colleagues theWar Cabinet&apos;s appreciation of India&apos;s great contribution to thecommon cause, both in the field of supply and in the achievementsof her fighting men during the five years of this war. Sir Firozcould well take pride in the deeds of his countrymen on the battle-fields of Asia, Africa and Europe.Sir Firoz thanked the Prime Minister for what he had said.He would carry away with him a deep impression of the heavyresponsibilities resting upon the Prime Minister and his colleagues,and of their ability to carry this burden. India was whole-heartedlybehind the people of this country in the war.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,&quot; &apos;   31s* July, 1944.
