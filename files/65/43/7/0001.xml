The Chiefs of Staff reported the chief events of theprevious week.Bad weather had again interfered with bombing operations,but our bombers had dropped 8,000 tons of bombs, including5,000 tons on flying-bomb targets. Mosquitoes had carried outseveral harassing attacks on targets in Germany.United States heavy bombers had dropped 9,000 tons of bombs,practically all on Germany. 6,000 tons had been dropped onMunich, causing very heavy damage.Fortresses had successfully dropped supplies to the Maquis.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 15,000 sorties,dropping 2,200 tons of bombs.The enemy had lost 91 aircraft as against Allied losses of173 aircraft.In Normandy 25,000&apos; Allied sorties had been flown as against2,700 by the enemy.During the week, 593 flying bombs had been launched, of which259 (or 44 per cent.) had been destroyed, 180 of them by fighters,57 by A.A. guns, and &apos;22 by balloons. 168 flying bombs had reachedLondon compared with 265 in the previous week.In the Mediterranean, Allied aircraft had dropped 7,500 tonsof bombs, half of them on communications targets in Italy, Franceand Hungary. Most of the bridges over the River Po had been destroyed.During the previous week, confirmed shipping losses due to enemy action amounted to 7,174 tons. Total losses for July to dateamounted to 40,640 tons.Four U-boats had been destroyed and 3 probably destroyed sofar this month.The First Sea Lord was asked to report, in a week&apos;s time, on the anticipated improvements in German U-boatconstruction.The clearing of Cherbourg harbour was going on well.Some advance had been made along almost the whole Normandyfront. American forces had made progress on the right flankalthough handicapped by difficult terrain. British forces had made some advances in the Caen area. The enemy were resisting strongly,and whenever we gained ground counter-attacked immediately. Upto the 11th July, 54,665 prisoners had been captured.In Italy, an appreciable advance had been made along the whole front.The Russian offensive had made good progress during the week,the advance having averaged 50 miles between the River Dvina andthe Pripet. Bridgeheads had been established across the Niemen.The German Armies in Estonia and Latvia still showed no signsof withdrawing.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Casualties. 2.   The War Cabinet were informed that the total casualties,(Previous both American and British, in Normandy up to the 11th July were reference: 84,000, 33,000 (4,800 killed) being British and 51,000 (7,800 killed)W.M.(44)89th United States forces.Conclusions,Minute 2.)Bread for 3.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a reportBritish Forces in the Daily Mail that our forces in Normandy were not receivingin Normandy,   a sufficient ration of bread.The Secretary of State for War&apos; undertook to look into thisquestion.   He thought that the solution might be to accelerate the[27881-] b 2
shipment to Normandy of further mobile bakeries. Six of the twelvebakeries earmarked for this theatre were already in Normandy.It was pointed out, however, that shipping priorities were theresponsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander.Press.Speculationabout future operations.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)10thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The War Cabinet had some discussion regarding theoperation of the censorship by SHAEF Censorship authorities inNormandy. It was stated that messages from Press correspondentsin Normandy forecasting the direction of future operations had been passed by the SHAEF censors. It was generally felt that the censorship machinery in Normandy required tightening up.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that thepublic would T-eact very strongly if they felt that any news appearing in the Press endangered the lives of our troops in France.The view was generally expressed that all speculation by war.correspondents on future offensive movements should be discouraged.The Secretary of State for War and the Minister ofInformation undertook to provide the Prime Minister with astatement about present censorship arrangements in Normandy.The Prime Minister said that, on receipt of this statement,he would take the matter up with General Eisenhower or general Bedell Smith.Turkey. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the(Previous War Cabinet of the latest developments in connection with Turkey.reference: A discussion  and conclusions are recorded in the Secretary&apos;sW.M.(44)89th Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Conclusions,Minute 3.)Prisoners 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heof War. and the Secretary of State for War had had under considerationDisposal of the disposal of the 1,500 or so Russians who had been captured inEussians France fighting for the Germans.  He suggested that we should handcaptured in them back to the Russians. But in order not to discourageNormandy.      surrender on the part of others impressed by the Germans to fight against us, we should ask that no steps should be taken to deal withthese Russians until the end of hostilities.It was suggested that we might use these men on agricultural work.&apos; After some general discussion the Prime Minister, summing up, said that he thought we should inform the Soviet Governmentthat we had captured these prisoners; and add that, while we didnot know how they came to be fighting- on the German side, theyhad shown every desire to be hostile to Germany. We should ask the Soviet Government what they would like us to do with thesemen. If they replied asking for repatriation, we should have toagree, but should point out that, for reasons of transport, it mightbe a considerable time before the men could be sent to Russia. we might, as an alternative, say that these men would be of some use to us as agricultural labourers and enquire whether the SovietGovernment would be prepared to agree to our using them for thatpurpose for the time being.If this course was agreed to, any difficulties in regard to findingaccommodation in this country for these men should be overcome.The War Cabinet-Agreed with the Prime Ministers suggestion, and invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretaryof State for War to proceed accordingly.
189w,M. 9i (44)-.Ail Raids.Attacks by flying Bombs.(previous reference:W.M.(44)89thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave the War Cabinet the latest information about the flying bomb attacks. In London the main weight was still concentrated on areasSouth of the river. Casualties up to date were 3,693 killed, 10,537seriously wounded, 12,192 lightly wounded and 14 unclassified.The Minister of Health reported that out of a total of roughly2ij million houses in London, about 14,000 had been destroyed and554,000 damaged. In the past week, thanks to the increased labour force available and the diminution in the weight of the attack ithad been possible to reduce the arrears of houses requiring repairfrom 211,000 to 182,000. The Ministers concerned had agreed to aim at a labour force of 50,000 on repairs, and this figure shouldbe achieved shortly.The evacuation arrangements were working smoothly. a section of the Press had given prominence to difficulties in certain areas, but the response from householders in the reception areashad been remarkably good. He would be glad if the Prime minister could, at some suitable opportunity, express appreciation of thepart which they were playing.Besides organised evacuation, many people had left london under their own arrangements. The Ministry of Food were trying to estimate the extent to which the population of London haddecreased.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply,reported that a rearrangement of the active defences had beenput into force with a view to reducing the extent of interferencebetween the A.A. guns and the fighters. It was believed that thenew arrangements, which had been made with the agreement of bothCommanders, would reduce interference between guns and fighters.The Chief of the Air Staff, who expressed some doubts whetherthe rearrangement would in practice prove to be an improvement on the previous system, said that attacks on launching sites and supply depots were continuing in so far as weather conditionspermitted.Reference was made to the threat of rocket attack. The WarCabinet were informed that an appreciation had been prepared inthe Air Ministry for submission to the Chiefs of Staff.Attention was drawn to the importance of assessing the likelihood and probable scale of rocket attack from the point ofview of the strain on man-power resources, particularly building-labour.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe had intended to submit a memorandum to the War Cabinet on new civil defence problems in the event of rocket attacks.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that on thefollowing day he would have to state the attitude of the Govern-ment to the suggestion that there should be a debate in secret session on the subject of the flying bomb attacks. He thought thatthe House as a whole did not want a debate in Secret Session. Itmight, however, be advisable if the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security and the other Ministers concerned were to havea further meeting with Members whose constituencies were affectedby the attacks, on the lines of that held on the 11th July.In discussion it was suggested that it might be convenient iftwo meetings were held. At one the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security, together with the Minister of Health and other ministers concerned, could deal with civil defence matters. At theother the Secretary of State for Air and the Joint parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Supply, could explain our active defence measures. It would be preferable if both meetings could be deferred until the following week, but if the general feeling of the house was in favour of an earlier meeting the civil defence meeting mightbe held in the present week. Arrangements would be made to admit to the meetings any members of the House of Lords who desired to attend.
The War Cabinet (1) Took note of the reports made to them on the progress of measures to counter the flying bomb attacks and to mitigate their effect on the civil population.(2) Agreed that the proposal for a debate in Secret sessions should not be accepted, but that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should offer to arrange for twoinformal confidential..meetings between members whoseconstituencies were affected by the attacks and theMinisters concerned. At one meeting information wouldbe given about the measures taken to mitigate the effect ^fof the attacks on the civil population, while at the other information would be given about active defence measures.Killing of 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the survivors of    First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (44) 388).s.s ** Pclsus &quot;by U 852 ^he First Lord of the A dmiralty explained that the Greeks.s. Peleus had been torpedoed and sunk in March by a U-Boatwhich had attempted to kill all the survivors, three of whom had escaped by shamming dead. Later, intelligence had come to handthat this cold-blooded murder had been carried out by a german-Boat which had been sunk in May, nearly 50 survivors havingbeen captured and fallen into our hands. Affidavits had been taken from the three survivors of the s.s. Peleus and from some of theU-Boat prisoners, and further statements would be taken.It had been arranged with the War Office that the crew shouldbe retained in the United Kingdom instead of being sent to Canada.In due course those against whom there was evidence would be puton trial.It was not proposed that trial should take place until the endof hostilities. But in order to protect our merchant seamen againstthe repetition of such an incident,- it was proposed that the GreekGovernment should be invited to protest strongly to the GermanGovernment about this atrocity. It was also proposed that weshould inform the German Government that we held in our handsthe survivors of the U-Boat which appeared to be responsible forthe incident which was the subject of the protest by the GreekGovernment, that we were making further investigations, but thatwe must insist that the most categoric instructions were given toU-Boat commanders to prevent the repetition of such an incident.The course of action proposed by the First Lord of theAdmiralty had been the subject of consultation with the ForeignOffice and was supported by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.In discussion, the view was expressed that the action proposed was unlikely to have any deterrent effect upon the Germans, and thatthe only result of a protest on the lines suggested would be to makethe facts known, including the fact that we had made a protestwhich (it was argued) would prove ineffectual. The really important point was to make sure that the men against whom we had evidenceof this crime were securely guarded and that there was no risk oftheir escaping.On the Other hand, it was pointed out that if the men inquestion were kept in special confinement we were bound to disclose the fact to the Protecting Power, who would have to be told thereason.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that action should be taken to retain the whole crew of the U. 852 in the United Kingdom, and that care should be taken to separate those believed guilty of this:
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1, -17th July, 1944.crime from those who had given testimony. Stringentprecautions should also be taken to prevent the escapeof any member of the crew.(2) For the present, at any rate, no advantage was seen in any public disclosure of information on this matter or inany formal protest to the German Government throughthe Protecting Power, and action should not therefore betaken on the lines suggested in paragraph 11 of w.P. (44) 388. The position could be reconsidered,however, if fresh circumstances arose.
