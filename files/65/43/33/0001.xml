Poland.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 115thConclusions,Minute 2.)Finance of relief.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 112thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. At their meeting on the 29th August (W.M. (44) 112th Con-clusions, Minute 1) the War Cabinet had asked the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to report further, in the -light of the views thenexpressed, on the United States proposals for sharing the cost of relief in the military period. They now had before them aMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 486),to which was attached a draft telegram prepared in consultationwith the Minister of State, suggesting the line to be taken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the draft telegramcontemplated a possible commitment ( 12,500,000) slightly in excessof the figure which he had had in view when the matter was last discussed in the War Cabinet. He was ready to go as far as this and recommended the telegram for the approval of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Approved   the   draft   telegram   recommended   by   theChancellor of the Exchequer and appended  to W.P.(44) 486.U.N.R.R.A. andItaly.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 112th&apos;Conclusions,Minute 2.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Ministerof State (W.P. (44) 497) asking for guidance on certain issues inregard to Italy likely to arise at the forthcoming meeting of theCouncil of U.N.R.R.A.The Minister of State asked for confirmation that it was the wish of the War Cabinet * s(i) that he should not propose that U.N.R.R.A. should conductgeneral relief work in Italy (including the provision of foodstuffs);&apos; (ii) that he should not oppose U.N.R.R.A. functioning in italy in looking after displaced persons other than enemynationals and in fighting epidemics;He also asked-(iii) for discretion to support a proposal, likely to be^putforward by the Americans, that U.N.R.R.A. should look- after displaced persons of enemy nationality as well as of Allied nationality in Italy, and should render certainassistance there for the preservation of public health andin the care of children, at a total cost not exceeding$50,000,000.The following points were made in discussion : (a) While arguments might be advanced in favour of u.N.R.R.A. assuming responsibility for relief in Italy,U.N.R.R.A. was most unlikely to be willing to take thisover. In any event, very strong exception would be takenby our Allies to admitting Italy to the benefits of u.N.R.R.A. while their own claims were still unsatisfied.(p) If it were necessary to continue to spend money on relief in italy, the matter should be handled by some organisationspecialising in relief, so as to ensure competent manage-ment and avoidance of unnecessary expense.(c) The suggestion was made that a paper should be preparedsetting out the present position as regards the arrange-ments for administration of relief in Italy, and the incidence of such expenditure, and explaining whatwould be the incidence of expenditure on measures of relief and rehabilitation in areas which passed from thecontrol of the military authorities to that of the ItalianGovernment.[28268-1]* 21. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet of the latest developments in the Polish situation. a record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.
(d) The Minister of State informed the War Cabinet that theWar Office had asked for confirmation that the proposals in his paper as to the scope of U.N.R.R.A. would besubject to the following conditions : .(i) that U.N.R.R.A. should operate as the agent of themilitary authorities and under the control of theA.C.C. so long as the A.CO. continues to exist;(ii) that a definite scheme should be put forward forapproval (the proposals on the American side were still very broadly stated);(iii) that SACMED&apos;s agreement should be sought before there was a final commitment.On this the view of the War Cabinet was that The Minister of State should put forward the War Officepoint (i), but should not press it if any difficulty seemed likely to arise; and that the War Office points (ii) and (iii)should be accepted.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Minister of State should base himself generally on thepropositions contained in W.P. (44) 497, and summarisedearlier in this minute.(2) The Secretary of State for War was invited to submit aMemorandum to the War Cabinet dealing with thefollowing points : -(a) The existing arrangements governing the adminis-tration of relief in Italy and the incidence ofexpenditure thereon in areas under military control; in areas vacated by the troops but notyet handed over to the Italian Government; in areas handed over to the Italian Government.(b) The total expenditure so far incurred on relief in italy.(c) What steps were being taken to get agricultural andindustrial production restarted in Italy.Prime Ministers        4.   The Minister of State enquired whether the terms of the directive as      Prime Ministers Directive (W.P. (44) 469) could be communicatedto the State Department; or whether, failing this, there would beany objection to his making a public reference at Montreal to thefact that such a directive had been issued.regardsU.N.R.R.A.Question of publication.The War Cabinet Decided that the Directive should not be communicated tothe State Department, and that no public reference shouldbe made to it. The Minister of State might, however, say-that the Prime Minister had shown his personal interestin the work of U.N.R.R.A., but without indicating in what manner.Personnel for 5.   The Minister of State said that Governor Lehman hadU.N.R.R.A. asked Sir Ronald Campbell to lend a British civil servant to serve as Deputy Director-General of U.N.R.R.A. The civil servant inquestion was very highly qualified, but he understood that therewould be great difficulty in making him available even if he washimself anxious to serve. On the other hand, if he was not madeavailable, this important post might be filled by an American citizen.He was anxious to inform Governor Lehman that this matter hadbeen considered by the War Cabinet.After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : *(1) The Minister of State should tell Governor Lehman that theparticular civil servant for whom he had asked couldnot, unfortunately, be spared, but that alternative names
were under consideration, and that we. were doing our utmost to find a man fully competent to fill the post.(2) It was of the utmost importance that we should make available for this post a man of the requisite attainments.Ministers were invited to forward suggestions to theChancellor of the Exchequer in the course of the nextfew days.armistice terms.Arrangementsfor Signature.(previous reference erence :W.M. (44) 111thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 495) proposing that he should try to arrange that the armistice with the AxisSatellites should in each case be signed by one military representa-tive on behalf of all the United Nations Governments who were at war with a particular satellite. This would be without prejudice to the Instrument of Surrender for Germany, which clearly stoodby itself.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Roumania.armistice terms.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 47thConclusions,Minute 2.)7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 496) reporting theSoviet Governments proposed armistice terms for Roumania and&apos;the comments which we had made in reply.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that discussions were still proceeding. The Russian attitude had been reasonable,save possibly on the matter of their reparations demand, which was still under discussion.The War Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Man-power.Policy in 1944.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 106thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 487) containing proposals by the Ministerial Committee on Man-power for allocations duringthe remainder of 1944. These proposals had been framed after consideration of memoranda put in by the Service and SupplyMinisters and by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securitysetting out,their requirements.The following points were made in discussion : Civil Defence.(a) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat he was satisfied that the net reduction of 50,000 over the year1944 could now be realised. In view of the fact that the WarCabinet had&apos; agreed that policemen should be released as soon aspossible from the forces in order to take up their previous oceupa-tion, he suggested, however, that it would be unwise to call up forthe Services further men from the Police Force.A dmiralty.(b) The Parliamentary Secretary,&apos; Admiralty, said that theprevious deficit of 6,400 men on Vote A would be increased by theproposed allocations to 31,500. Steps had already been taken topay off older ships, and further economies could only be made atthe expense of the build-up for the war against Japan. It was essential to man new construction, and the closing of bases in theUnited Kingdom would give little help, as the men released were mainly unfit to go abroad or came in the categories for early release.The Admiralty had a requirement for 8,500 specialists. This wouldnot be met by the proposed intake of 7,000 men; and the position
was made worse by the fact that they had already anticipated theirallocation for the period by taking in 1,900 men, many of whom werenot specialists. He suggested that the intake of 50,000 to the army should be reduced by 5,000 in favour of the Navy.(c) The Admiralty would find it difficult to release 10,000volunteers&apos; for the mines, since experience had -shown that a verylarge proportion of the volunteers were rejected as unsuitable. t Hethought that 7,000 suitable men might be obtained, but he suggestedthat the Navy should be given the 10,000 replacements in the formof new intake, the balance of 3,000 being made up by compulsorytransfers to the Army.(d) With regard to the Admiralty labour allocation, he pointedout that the reduction of 18,000 men involved would be a serious matter and would delay the build-up of Naval forces in theTar East.i The view of the War Cabinet on these proposals was that the cuts proposed in the Admiralty service and industrial allocationswere not disproportionate compared to those of the other Servicesand were not unreasonable having regard to the view expressed bythe Prime Minister that the strength of the Navy should be decreased by 200,000 men during the first year after the defeat of Germany.It was pointed out that it was, of course, open to the First Lord ofthe Admiralty to address representations to the Prime Minister onhis Departments allocations of Service and Industrial man-power.War Office.(e) The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that inthe existing war situation the War Office were prepared to acceptthe revised allocation of 50,000 men for the Army, but added thatthere were certain points that the War Office would take up withthe Minister of Labour and National Service.Air Ministry.(/) The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Airsaid that the Air Ministry were satisfied with their allocation of2,000 men.Supply Departments.W.M. (44) 116th .(g) The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply,Conclusions, and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Aircraft Production,Minute 8. said that, in view of the recent decision of the War Cabinet that plans should be made on the assumption that the war with germany would end by the 31st December, 1944, the proposed reductions inallocations for the Ministry of Supply and Ministry of aircraft production could be achieved, and might be improved upon later inthe year.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested thatany further releases from the munition industries should be appliedto increase the labour available for civil industries.this view was endorsed by the War Cabinet.Industries and Services in Groups II and III.(h) The proposals for the allocations to these industries were generally approved, subject to such minor adjustments, e.g., in the gas industry, as might be found desirable. HiThe War Cabinet- -   ,Approved the proposed allocations set out in the Memo-randum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on theunderstanding that when the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Man-power Survey became available in October, and when therehad been time for further study of the implications of thedecision that plans should be made on the basis of the warwith Germany coming to an end by the 31st December,1944, some review of the allocations to the munition industries would be necessary with the object of increasingthe amount of labour available to the civil industries.
Service Pay.improvements in conditions ofservice for menretained in the armed Porcesafter the end ofthe war withGermany.(Previous &apos;Reference:W.M. (44) 113thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the WarCabinet that at their meeting on the 31st August the view had been recorded that, if possible simultaneously with the publication of theWhite Paper, a statement should be made as to the improvements in the conditions of service of men retained- in the Armed Forcesafter the end of the war with Germany. He had undertaken toreport to the War Cabinet at an early date on the progress made onthis matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the War Cabinet an outline of the scheme which had emerged from the discussions whichhe had had with the Service Ministers and the Secretary of Statefor India and the Minister of Labour and National Service. Atthe moment the scheme was provisional only, but he hoped that itwould be finally accepted by the Service Ministers and the Govern-ment of India.After a preliminary discussion, the War Cabinet recordedthe view that an announcement on the lines indicated bythe Chancellor should be made at the same time as thepublication of the White Paper setting out the scheme forthe reallocation of man-power. The Chancellor of theExchequer was invited to communicate in this sense withthe Prime Minister.** This telegram was despatched as Cordite No. 3.The Home 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theGuard. Prime Minister had asked that further measures to stand down theHome Guard should now be taken. He had consulted the Vice-Chiefof the Imperial General Staff earlier in the day, and, as a result, thefollowing measures were proposed : (a) That the call-up and medical examination of furtherentrants to the Home Guard should now be suspended.(6) That, subject to the outcome of a conference withCommanders-in-Chief to be held the following day,compulsory drills should be suspended.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained thatit was hoped that there would be enough volunteers from the home guard to continue the manning of certain &quot;anti-aircraft defenceswhich were still necessary and to help the Civil Defence authorities with urgent work in connection with bomb damage in London. TheChiefs of Staff had already called for a report upon the guardingof vulnerable points by the Home Guard and hoped shortly to beable to recommend the termination of these duties.In response to a suggestion by the Minister of Labour and national &quot;Service, the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry ofSupply, undertook to examine the present measures for guardingRoyal Ordnance Factories with a view to reducing as much aspossible the man-power employed.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals at (a) and (b) above, and invited the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff to inform theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the outcome ofthe conference with the Commanders-in-Chief, and of theterms of the statement which the War Office would proposeto issue to give effect to these decisions.
11. The War Cabinet were reminded that it had been decidedthat arrangements should be made for a visit to the U.S.S.R. of a parliamentary Delegation supporting the present Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that under thearrangements made the delegation would probably be leavingtowards the end, of the present month. In the present circumstances it was thought that there might be some advantage if the date of departure were somewhat delayed.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view, and invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to arrange accordingly.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,5th September, 1944.U.S.S.R.parliamentary delegation.(previous reference: &apos;W.M.(44)89thConclusions,Minute 10.)
