The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 472) and the Secretary of State for Air(WP. (44) 473) on the international position.The Lord Privy Seal gave the War Cabinet an account of theexchanges with Mr. Berle. Following the April talks, we had prepared proposals for an international regulating authority basedon the Canadian draft Convention. Mr. Berle had not favouredthese proposals, but had agreed to go to an international conferenceon the basis of the recommendation of the Balfour Committee. Wehad accepted this suggestion. Subsequently, it had appeared thatthe U.S.S.R. were not willing to attend an international conference,and Mr. Berle had come under strong pressure from the operational and manufacturing sides of the United States Air transport industry. In the result he had abandoned any idea of an inter-national conference and now proposed that the United States andwe, so far as possible in collaboration and on a non-exclusive basis,should move out on to the civil air routes of the world. A good dealof pressure had been applied to get us to accept this proposal.We had now sent a telegram to Mr. Berle asking him to postpone his project and offering to call an international conferenceourselves in London. No reply had yet been received to this, but a recent utterance on the subject by Mr. Cordell Hull showed thatthere was clearly no hope of a favourable reply. Meantime, eventswere moving rapidly. 5,970 aircraft were now being built in theUnited States for air transport purposes and the United Statesoperating companies were pushing on with applications for licences.Unless we took drastic action we should be left behind. He saw no alternative now to our going forward with the development of airlines on our own, working in agreement with the United States sofar as we could and making every effort to build up our own aircraftmanufacturing industry.1] &apos; b 21. The War Cabinet resumed the discussion on future depart-mental responsibility for civil air transport, and had before thema Note by the Prime Minister (W.P. (44) 480), to which was attachedminutes by the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State for Air.The Prime Minister stated in his Note that he was willing that anadditional post of Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the AirMinistry should be created in order to deal exclusively with civilaviation while it remained under the authority of the Air Ministry,and that at the close of the war civil aviation should pass to theMinistry of Transport. This was endorsed by the War Cabinet,although the view was expressed that Parliament might not view with any great favour the creation of a third post of Under-Secretary of State. - The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he would report this view to the Prime Minister.The view was also expressed that the decision that civil aviationshould remain with the Air Ministry until after the end of the war might evoke considerable criticism in Parliament. It was thereforeurged that the decision reached should be so presented as to make clear that ultimate transfer to the Ministry of Transport was contemplated, but that, since this was not feasible during war time,special arrangements were to be made for the interim period.The Secretary of State for Air said that he hoped the positionwould not be presented in this way. If it were, the result might wellbe some tendency to divided loyalty.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought a decisionon this point should be reserved for the Prime Minister. Clearly,much would depend on the terms of the announcement issued whenthe new arrangements were made.Subject to a report being made to the Prime Minister as to thesetwo points, the War Cabinet Endorsed the views set out in the Prime Ministers Note(W.P. (44) 480):
The Secretary of State for Air said that, if we abandoned theproposed international conference, we should be going back on thestatement made by the Lord Privy Seal in the House of Lords onthe 10th May. Such a step would be- extremely distasteful to theDominions and would shake the confidence of our European Allies.We had strong grounds of principle for adhering to our views, andwe should find support among foreign countries, who feared UnitedStates domination in the field of civil aviation. There was, in fact,good reason to believe that Mr. Berle&apos;s present proposal was at leastpartly due to his having failed to persuade foreign Governments to reject the idea of restricted regulations before entering the proposed international conference. If we could expedite the production ofconverted bomber aircraft (such as the York, the Tudor and theAvro XXI) and of the Brabazon types-, so as to be able to offer themto foreign countries, we should be in a strong position. In his view,the reply to Mr. Berle should be on the lines of the second alterna-tive in the Washington Embassy telegram No. 4560. This was thatwe should tell the Americans that, while we could not prevent theirnegotiating with other Powers for air transit rights and facilities,we adhered to our belief that an international authority with teethwould ultimately be found essential, and therefore that we wereprepared to grant only temporary facilities in British territory priorto any such agreement being concluded. Further, that we would notgrant any facilities which would be likely to tend to retard theinterests of smaller Powers.Although it was clear that the United States Government wouldnot at this stage agree to come under any international authorityfor the regulation of quotas, frequencies, &amp;c, they would, he felt sure, agree to an international authority for the purpose of radiosafety regulations, &amp;c. Would it not be possible to work towards an international authority which would have full power of regula-tion so far as we ourselves, the Dominions and other foreigncountries were concerned, and which the United States government might join only for the purposes of the control of radio safety regulations, &amp;c, on an international scale?The Secretary of State for India supported the Lord Privy Sealand said that any attempt to create an international authority forthe purpose of regulation was doomed to failure and would onlycreate suspicion in the United States that we were combining withother countries to oppose them. He thought that the Dominions&apos;interest in an international regulating authority was largely due toour lead, and that they would not press strongly for such an authority to be set up unless we also favoured this course.The Parliamentary -Under-Secretary of State for the Dominionsdoubted whether the Dominion Governments would favour a policywhich was likely to bring us into collision with the United StatesGovernment.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that any proposalfor an international regulating authority, excluding the UnitedStates, would be bound to antagonise the United States Governmentand would lead to competition with them in which we should behandicapped. Requests for facilities were already&apos; being receivedfrom the United States Government by Colonial Governments and adecision on the issue of policy should be reached as quickly aspossible.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested that before any final decision was taken as to our course of action thereshould be a high-level approach to the United States Governmentwith a view to making quite sure that the proposal made byMr. Berle did in fact represent their settled policy. He attached great importance to this from the point of opinion in the LabourParty in this country. Unless it was abundantly clear that theproposals for the international regulation of civil aviation had been definitely turned down by the United States Government, suspicionand dissatisfaction would be aroused. -
Civil air transport.requirements for Progress in design and manufacture.&quot;(previous reference:W.M.(44)81stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The developments in the international position in regardto civil aviation led to a discussion on the steps which could be takento expedite the development and manufacture by this country of aircraft for civil use after the war.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Aircraft Production,said that the position as regards the so-called converted bombertypes was by no means unfavourable, but could be considerably improved if rather more design staff could be made available. Atpresent one York a fortnight was being manufactured and we were working up to an output of twenty a month by June 1945. It was hoped that the prototype of the thin Tudor would fly at thebeginning of 1945, of the fat-bellied Tudor about March 1945, andof the converted Halifax at Christmas 1944. AH these types werecompeting with military types for draughtsmen and there was animmediate need for 250 more trained draughtsmen over those previously allocated.The Brabazon types were, of course, a much more long-distanceproject. Four of the seven Brabazon types had been allotted to particular firms and it was hoped to allot the remaining threeshortly. It had been contemplated that flying trials of type III a would start three years after design work started, but by a greatIf it was clear that the United States Government were opposedto an international conference, then he would not be averse to ourtaking steps to develop our own air lines in co-operation with theDominion Governments and friendly foreign Governments. Hesuggested that the whole question of what action should be taken inthe event of a negative reply from the United States Governmentshould be examined as a matter of urgency while steps were beingtaken to obtain a final answer from the United States Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that, inthe first instance, we should await a reply from Mr. Berle.Thereafter the Prime Minister might be advised to approach thePresident in order to get an authoritative statement of the UnitedStates Governments attitude. Should it be clear that the UnitedStates were unwilling to agree to an international conference, weshould make it plain that we must then proceed to make agreements with the Dominions and foreign countries.&apos;This, however, should be done by separate negotiations and discussions, and we should not attempt to convene an international conference to which the United States Government would not be a party. The War &quot;Cabinet expressed agreement with the course ofaction outlined by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, subject to the terms of the reply received fromMr. Berle, the Prime Minister should be invited to approach the President with a view to obtaining a clear statement of the position of the United StatesGovernment.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, toprepare and submit to the War Cabinet a draft telegram which the Prime Minister might send to the President.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Air, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, toprepare a report for consideration by the War Cabinetelaborating in the light of the discussion the policy whichwe might follow if the United &apos; States Governmentadhered to the views expressed by Mr. Berle.
effort it,might be possible to reduce this period to two and a half years, or even to two years. The main cause of delay was theshortage of draughtsmen: Of 2,500 draughtsmen employed on aircraft design work, it was believed that about one-third were employed on modifications, including a number working on twentyAmerican types for use in this country. The target dates forBrabazon types which had been approved by the War Cabinet couldbe met if the further 250 draughtsmen referred to could be madeavailable.Discussion centred round two main points : &apos;(a) The steps which could be taken to accelerate the programme.(b) The adequacy of the programme.As regards the steps to accelerate the present programme, theSecretary of State for Air said that the Ministry of aircraft production, by a great effort, was in process of meeting the targetdates submitted to and approved by the War Cabinet, but an acceleration was now required. Besides the 250 further draughts-men which the Ministry of Aircraft Production asked should betransferred from military to civil aircraft work, he thought that500 skilled engineering draughtsmen should be made available forthis work. (The total number of skilled engineering draughtsmenin this country was 32.000.) He also thought that it would also benecessary to increase the labour force in certain aircraft factories,particularly Avros. Finally, it would be necessary to obtainauthority from the Chancellor of the Exchequer for placing produc-tion orders for certain of the Brabazon types before the prototypeshad flown. This involved a risk of nugatory expenditure, and wasa matter on which the Chancellor would be entitled to have the considered views of himself and the Minister of Aircraft Produc-tion. He was certain, however, that this was the best way of makingreally rapid progress.In further discussion the Minister of Labour. and NationalService stressed the importance of not overloading the factories in which these civil types were to be produced. In particular, heenquired whether it is necessary for Avros to be engaged on so many different types.The War Cabinet agreed that the measures proposed foraccelerating the progress on the development and manufacture ofcivil aircraft should be examined as a matter of urgency.Discussion then turned on the adequacy of the existing programme. The Lord Privy Seal expressed the view that theYork was of no value at all for civil purposes and the Tudor of very little value. The real need was for the whole Brabazonprogramme to be greatly accelerated, particularly the BrabazonType I.In the course of further discussion certain doubts were expressed as to whether in present circumstances the Brabazon typesmet our needs. . One or two Ministers suggested that the right course would be that, instead of developing new British designs,we should take American proved types and build aircraft on those lines. This, it was urged, would enable us to manufacture the types of aircraft which were preferred by civil users in the shortest time.The general view of the War Cabinet was, however, in favourof proceeding with the design, development and manufacture ofBritish types. It was stated, however, that many British userswere expressing dissatisfaction with the Brabazon types, and theattitude of B.O.A.C. itself to the Brabazon types was called inquestion.It was pointed out that the outline specifications of the brabazon types had originally been drawn up eighteen months ago.The Lord Privy Seal said that in his view the proper course wasthat the Brabazon types, or some of them, should now be revised to bring them into accord with the latest developments and experience.
Civil Air 4.   In Annex II to W.P. (44) 480&apos; the Secretary of State for transport.  .    Air stated that he thought it would be necessary to inform Parlia-Ownership of   ment that a decision had been reached that B.O.A.C. was to remainCivil Airlines,   the single chosen instrument for the development of our overseasair transport.The Secretary of State for Air pressed for an early opportunityfor the discussion of this issue. The Government must be in aposition to give a clear answer as soon as Parliament reassembled,and the issues involved might be found to require examination bya Committee of the. War Cabinet before final conclusions were reached.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was out of the question to attempt to reach a solution on the difficultissues involved at the present meeting. He suggested, however,and the War Cabinet agreed, that .the matter should be brought forward for discussion within a fortnight.Aircraft 5.   The  Minister  of  Labour and  National Service  drewProduction attention to the procedure which was being adopted by the MinistryProgramme. 0f Aircraft Production in connection with the displacement of transfer of labour from the Coventry &quot;shadow &quot; factories engaged in theLabour from production of Hercules aero engines. Owing to production cuts itCoventry had been decided to abolish the night shifts at these factories, withShadow the result that about 10,000 workers would be displaced.   ThereFactories. was a settled procedure for dealing with cases of this kind, whichhad been evolved by the Ministry of Production and the Ministryof Labour and National Service with a view to ensuring the orderlymovement of labour to other production. The Ministry of aircraft production&apos; were, however, apparently arranging that their Parlia-mentary Secretary should visit Coventry and intimate the decisionto cut production to the workers concerned before any arrangements had been made for their transfer to other work. Any action of thiskind was likely to lead to labour troubles, and he asked that theWar Cabinet should agree that nothing should be done until it hadbeen possible to work out transfer arrangements through the usualmachinery.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) Great importance was attached to steps being taken to accelerate the design, development and production of aircraft for civil use. The Minister of Production, theMinister of Labour and National Service, the Secretaryof State for Air and the Minister of Aircraft Produc-tion, or their representatives, undertook to examine, asa matter of urgency, the steps necessary to achieve thisend, and to report back to the War Cabinet.(2) This examination should proceed on the basis that somediversion was now justified from the war effort in orderto bring about an acceleration in the production of aircraft for civil use.(3) It would be desirable, however, that any steps taken in thismatter should be so arranged as to avoid publicity. thus the types in question might be described as transporttypes.(4) The Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of aircraft production were asked to submit a report to the WarCabinet comparing the British and United States types of aircraft now being designed and manufactured for civil purposes. The report should deal with the questionwhether the British designs were adequate, and shouldembody the considered views of the B.O.A.C. as to the adequacy of the Brabazon types.
The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Aircraft Production,said that the action arose out of a War Cabinet direction that theMinistry of Aircraft Production should cut their labour force. he agreed, however, that action should be postponed until the necessary arrangements were made for the transfer of the workers to other employment through the usual machinery. He assumed, however,that, once this had been done, there would be no objection to hispaying a visit to the factory in order to explain to the workers thereasons why they were being transferred to other employment.The Minister of Labour and National Service confirmed thatthere would be no objection to this.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Ministry of Aircraft Production should postpone any action in order to enable the matter to bedealt with by the usual machinery.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
