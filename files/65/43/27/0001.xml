The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command had flown 3,100 sorties and dropped8,500 tons of bombs, 5,400 of them on Germany. Targets in Germanyincluded Russelsheim, Darmstadt, Kiel and Konigsberg. Theprevious day Bomber Command had carried out, without loss, their first daylight attack on Germany. Targets had included the oil plant at Homberg.United States heavy bombers had flown 4,814 sorties and dropped 7,150 tons of bombs on oil plants, aircraft factories inGermany and the experimental stations at Peenemunde and Rechlin.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 16,000 sorties.In the battle in Northern France they claimed to have destroyed68 tanks, 2,048 lorries, 193 locomotives and 133 railway trucks andto have damaged many others. The enemy had lost 298 aircraft(including 127 on the ground). Allied losses amounted to 239aircraft, including 59 British and 56 United States heavy bombers.Allied aircraft had flown 13,000 sorties and dropped 8,000 tonsof bombs on enemy oil plants, airfields, communications and inconnection with the operations in Southern France. Enemy losses amounted to 212 aircraft as against 128 Allied.During the previous week confirmed shipping losses due to enemy action amounted to 17,007 tons. The total for August to datewas 53,402 tons.Eight U-boats had been sunk and 3 probably sunk during august.There had been considerable light craft activity off the FrenchChannel ports and in the Bay of Biscay. A number of E-boats,R-boats and merchant ships had been either sunk or damaged.On the 25th August H.M.S. Warspite had bombarded forts at brest in support of the land battle.About 15,000 tons a day were now being unloaded at Cherbourg.A convoy of 33 ships had reached Russian ports safely on the25th August.American, French and British battleships and cruisers had carried out&apos;frequent bombardment in support of attacks on Toulonand other objectives.United States forces had occupied Troyes and were reported tobe in Vitry and Meaux. Further north, British and Canadian forces had made a considerable advance from the Falaise pocket. TheSeine had been reached and we had established two bridgeheadsacross it at Vernon and Elbeuf. There were still, however, pocketsof strong enemy resistance west of the river.In Brittany it was estimated that there were about 20,000Germans in Brest, 10,000 in Lorient and 10,000 in St. Nazaire.Since D-day a rough estimate of casualties suffered by the enemy was 200,000 prisoners, 40,000 killed and 200,000 wounded.A considerable area of territory had been liberated in the past week. Toulon and Marseilles had been cleared (except for a fewpockets) and Allied troops had advanced as far west as Avignon.In the north, Grenoble had been reached and the Rhone Valleyoccupied round Loriol. 17,000 prisoners had been counted, but thenumber captured was probably by now not far short of 30,000.On the 26th August General Alexander had started a newoffensive on the right of our line.  This had made good progress.In the north the Russians had made an advance towards LakePeipus but had lost Tukums. Round Warsaw the Russians had made small gains. Further south the two main Russian thrusts intoRoumania had converged and surrounded about 10 or 12 german divisions.The War Cabinet-Took note of the above statements.

(44) 104thConclusions,Minute 3, andW.M. (44) 97thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat during the last few days the Press had been very optimisticabout the destruction of flying-bomb sites by Allied Forces in North-West France. If this attitude continued he and the Minister ofHealth might have some difficulty in keeping evacuees fromreturning to London before it was safe for them to do so.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of theAir Staff said that in their opinion attacks by flying bombs wouldprobably continue for some time longer, though probably on a reduced scale.The Minister of Information undertook to do what he could to restrain the Press from fostering the belief that flying bomb attacks would cease altogether in the immediate future.4. The Minister of Information informed the War Cabinetthat the Prime Minister had agreed that, as the Americans had justpublished their total casualty figures to date, the total Britishcasualties sustained since the war began should be published on the3rd September. The Minister suggested that there might be advantage in also publishing at the same time the total number ofmen and women in the Armed Forces and Auxiliary Services.Hitherto security considerations had precluded any such publica-tion, but he thought that it might now be found possible to relax therestrictions previously in force.The Chiefs of Staff undertook to examine this aspect of thematter.The Minister of Labour reminded the War Cabinet that the fullman-power figures had been withheld from the House of commons on security grounds. The Government must be careful not to exposethemselves to criticism by publishing such figures for the first time during the Recess.After further discussion, the- Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the general sense of the War Cabinet was infavour of publication on the 3rd September of our total casualties,military and civil; but that the question of publishing figures ofthe total numbers in the Armed Forces should be left for decision by the Prime Minister on his return, after consideration of thepoints raised in discussion.*The War Cabinet-Agreed to the course proposed by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.* The statement published on the 3rd September was confined tocasualties, it being agreed that publication of total numbers in the armed forces should be deferred until a later occasion.Publicity.Casualties andStrength of forces.(previous reference:WM.

Grant of travel facilities fromthe UnitedKingdom.(previous reference:W.M.(44)34thConclusions,Minute 8.)       -5. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat a Member of Parliament had applied for permission to travel to Turkey on business grounds (his firm was interested in engineering contracts), and also to visit Egypt, Palestine, Iraq, Italyand Algiers, returning via Paris.An application from the same Member of Parliament to visitTurkey had been rejected by the War Cabinet in March last.The War Cabinet were reminded that in July 1943 they had decided that permission to travel to neutral countries should begranted only where the Government were satisfied that a definitepublic advantage would be served by the journey, or that theapplicant had urgent and important bona fide domestic business which could not be transacted without a personal visit.It was also pointed out that at the time when the previousapplication had been rejected we had been taking all practicable steps, on security grounds connected with the Second Front, toensure that people did not leave -this country to visit neutral countries.  These grounds no longer existed.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the application should be granted only in sofar as it rested on business grounds which could be sub-stantiated, .and which complied with the general testprescribed by the War Cabinet.Bulgaria. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theArmistice Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 475) reportingTerms. recent developments in connection with the preparation of draftarmistice terms for Bulgaria.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we andthe United States had been broadly in agreement throughout, butthere had been delay in receiving a final answer from the Russians.The matter had, however, been discussed in the European advisory commission on the 26th August, when M. Gousev had undertaken to make a recommendation to his Government on the general lines set out in the Memorandum before the War Cabinet. It was hopedthat agreement between the three Powers could be reached almost immediately. If not, we might have to go ahead without the formalconcurrence of the Soviet Government, who, after all, were not at war with Bulgaria. Our other Allies would be consulted before theterms were communicated to the Bulgarians. No decision had yetbeen reached as to the actual venue of discussions with the bulgarians.The War Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Poland. 7.   The War Cabinet were given the latest information about(Previous the position of the Polish Underground Army fighting in WarsawReference: and relations between Poland  and Russia.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecurity. Minister of Production (W.P. (44) 468) dealing with the following(Previous &quot; Overlord &quot; security restrictions :-Reference: (i) The special restrictions on telephone calls between GreatW.M. (44) 109th Britain and Ireland;Conclusions, (ii) The suspension of the Aer Lingus Teoranta ServiceMinute 4.) ^       between Great Britain and Ireland; and(iii) The suspension of the Swedish A.B. Aero TransportService between Great Britain and Sweden.
The Minister of Production explained that neither S.H.A.E.F.nor the Security Service raised any objection to the removal of thespecial restrictions on telephone calls between Great Britain andIreland, or to the resumption of the Aer Lingus Teoranta Service.The question of the resumption of the Swedish A.B. Aero TransportService had been examined by the Security Executive,. who had ascertained that the Departments concerned were strongly in favourof a resumption of the service and that neither S.H.A.E.F. nor theSecurity Service would object to its restoration. In-these circum-stances he proposed that, subject to the views of the Prime Minister,*the restrictions should now be removed.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and thePostmaster-General supported the proposal made by the Minister ofProduction.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the proposal of the Minister of Production.Parliament. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum byRedistribution the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and theof Seats.  . Secretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (44) 460) dealing with the(Previous representation of the City of London and the number of seats to be reference: assigned to Scotland and to Wales and Monmouth.W.M.(44)94thConclusions,      Representation of the City of London.Minute 2.) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security recalled that at their meeting on the 20th July the War Cabinet had taken the view that it would be desirable to avoid a decision on the questionof the representation of the City of London at the present stage,and had agreed that it should be left to the Boundary commissioners in the first instance to consider whether a special case existed forleaving the City as a double-Member constituency, with the resultthat the question would not arise for decision until a Bill was introduced to give effect to a general scheme of redistribution recom-mended by the Boundary Commissioners.For the reasons given in the Appendix to W.P. (44) 460,however, it did not seem practicable to adopt this course.It was accordingly proposed that the forthcoming redistribution-tion of Seats Bill should provide that the City should return suchnumber of Members, not exceeding two, as might be determined bythe subsequent Act which would have to be passed in due course togive effect to the first general scheme of redistribution recommendedby the Boundary Commissioners. Thus the issue was in no way.prejudged, and the eventual decision would have to be taken only when the second Redistribution of Seats Bill came forward andwhen the whole question of the representation of London Boroughswas under review. This would presumably be after a GeneralElection. The first Redistribution of Seats Bill would also provide that there should be no alteration of the boundaries of the Parlia-mentary constituency of the City of London, so that there wouldbe no question of its being combined with any neighbouringconstituency.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the forthcoming Redistribution of Seats Billshould provide that there should be no alteration of the boundaries of the Parliamentary constituency of theCity of London, and that the City should return suchnumber of Members, not exceeding two, as might bedetermined by the subsequent Act which would have to-be passed in due course to give effect to the first generalscheme of redistribution recommended by the BoundaryCommissioners.* The Prime Minister endorsed this proposal.
(2) Took note that the Home Secretary and Minister of home security would make it clear in introducing the Bill that nothing was being done which in any way prejudged theissue whether,- in any subsequent redistribution scheme,the City of London should return two members.Representation of Scotland and of Wales and Monrnouth.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security explainedthat the Speaker&apos;s Conference had recommended that, while thetotal number of Members of the House of Commons for GreatBritain should remain substantially as at present (i.e., 591,excluding University seats), there should be no reduction in thepresent number of Members of the House of Commons for scotland or for Wales and Monmouthshire (i.e., 71 and 35 respectively). TheWar Cabinet, however, at their meeting on the 20th July had decided, subject to a report being made to the Prime Minister, thatfor the purpose of the first general redistribution the principle should be accepted that there should be no reduction in the presentnumber of Members for Scotland or for Wales and Monmouth, butthat the Government should not commit themselves to the acceptanceof this principle thereafter.The Secretary of State for Scotland felt strongly that to limit the assurance of the continuation of the present Scottish and Welshrepresentation would excite apprehension and controversy and had suggested that the right course was to accept the recommendationof the Speaker&apos;s Conference without modification, leaving any subsequent adjustment in the total Membership of the House ofCommons, or in the representation of England, Scotland or Wales,to be effected by legislation if a situation arose in which such an adjustment became imperative.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security himselffound it difficult to advise that such a permanent commitmentshould be accepted. He suggested that the right course was toprovide on the forthcoming Redistribution of Seats Bill that thenumber of constituencies in Scotland should be not less than 71 andin Wales and Monmouthshire not less than 35 until parliament should otherwise determine; and to add a statutory requirement that each of the three Boundary Commissions should review annuallythe aggregate number of electors for the whole of - Great Britainand for England, for Scotland and for Wales and Monmouthshirerespectively, and should make a special report to Parliamentwhenever the number of electors obtained by dividing the aggregatefor England, for Scotland or for Wales and Monmouthshire by thenumber of Members assigned to that country differed by more than25 per cent, from the number of electors obtained by dividing theaggregate for Great Britain by the total number of Members forGreat Britain.The Secretary of State for Air said that there would be very strong opposition in Scotland, where great importance was attachedto the question of Parliamentary representation, to any proposalto depart from the recommendation of the Speaker5s Conference.This opposition was bound to show itself in the House and theGovernment would be faced with the alternative of withdrawing orof putting a very great strain on the loyalty of their supporters.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster supported theSecretary of State for Air and pointed out that the fact that theGovernment were throwing over the recommendation of the speaker&apos;s Conference was likely to be an issue at the next election and to encourage the Scottish Nationalist Movement.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that the proposal made by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security thatthere should be annual reviews by the Boundary Commissioners was likely to excite unnecessary controversy, and that in the forthcomingBill it would be preferable simply to provide that the number of constituencies in Scotland should be not less than 71 and in Wales
and Monmouthshire not less than 35. In introducing the Bill theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security would make it plain that this provision could not, of course, be binding on futureParliaments. Nor, indeed, could the possibility be excluded thatsome future Parliament would decide to increase the total numberof Members of Parliament for Great Britain as a whole- contraryto the recommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference.The &quot;War Cabinet-(3) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to proceed on the lines indicated at &quot; X &quot; above.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,28th August, 1944.
