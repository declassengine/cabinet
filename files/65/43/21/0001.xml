India. At their meeting on the 4th August the War Cabinet hadGandhi. approved the terms of a draft reply to be sent by the Viceroy to(Previous Gandhi. This telegram had been despatched to the Viceroy as reference:       No. 17258 of the 5th August.W.M. (44) 102nd      The War Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theConclusions,     Secretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 441), to which were attachedMinute l.)      two further telegrams  from the Viceroy.    The first of these telegrams (No. 1546-S.)  raised certain objections to the draftapproved by the War Cabinet, while the second (No.  1547-S.)contained a further suggested redraft of the reply to Gandhi.These telegrams had been considered on the 12th August bythe India Committee, who had taken the view that, if the Viceroystill saw strong objection to the draft contained in No. 17258, theonly alternative appeared to be that he should send a very shortreply, the terms of which were suggested in telegram No. 17797(Appendix IV to W.P. (44) 441).The War Cabinet also had before them a further telegram fromthe Viceroy, dated the 12th August (No. 1560-S.), in reply thereto,raising objections to the shorter draft, and again urging that hisown suggested redraft (No. 1547-S.) should be approved.The War Cabinet also had before them a telegram from thePrime Minister approving the proposed short reply (No. 17797).(i) The first point dealt with in discussion was the Viceroy&apos;ssuggested further redraft (No. 1547-S.).The Secretary of State for India said that, in his view, no issueof policy was raised by this redraft which was in line with WarCabinet policy. Since the oiily difference was one of. wording, hethought that the considered judgment of the man on the spot shouldbe accepted.On the other hand, the general view of the War Cabinet wasthat the difference was not entirely one of wording. The draftcontained in telegram No. 17258 had been the result of prolongedconsideration by the War Cabinet when a decision had been deliberately taken to stiffen the tone. Several members of the WarCabinet who had held strong views on the matter were not now available for immediate consultation. In these circumstances there could be no question of accepting the Viceroy&apos;s further suggestedredraft.(ii) The next point dealt with was choice between the dr,aftapproved by the War Cabinet and despatched as telegramNo. 17258 and the alternative shorter version proposed, by the india committee (telegram No. 17797).The Minister of Education favoured adoption of the shorterdraft. In his view the present moment was not a good one forpresenting the Indian leaders with a lengthy document on whichthey would comment in detail. The Prime Minister had also expressed strong approval of the short telegram.On the other hand, the view was strongly expressed that the longer telegram approved by the War Cabinet would almost,certainly be preferred by the Viceroy; and, moreover, that there was considerable advantage in putting on record the points set out inthe longer answer.(iii) The question was raised whether it would be possible tosend no reply until the outcome of the Gandhi-Jinnah conversationswere known. It was pointed out that the Viceroy had stressed theimportance of Gandhi receiving a reply before his meeting withJinnah. Moreover, the Viceroy had asked Gandhi to make a pro-position and had received his letter on the 27th July, and a prolongeddelay would put him in the wrong, and might create an impression that gandhis offer merited careful consideration.(iv) The view of the War Cabinet was thus that the viceroy should have the option between the longer and shorter replies

It was felt, however, that he shouldbe given an explanation of the reasons which had weighed with theWar Cabinet when authorising the form of reply despatched to theViceroy in telegram No. 17258.(v) In this connection the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs felt that international and not only Indian opinion had tobe borne in mind. It was of great importance that paragraph 3 ofthe War Cabinefs redraft (No. 17258) should be retained as setting out our case to the world. He did not feel that the Viceroy&apos;sredraft was acceptable.(vi) The Chancellor of the Exchequer favoured recapitulationof the main features of the Cripps offer, which Gandhi&apos;s letterdeliberately ignored. It was important to bring out also that therewould be no change in the constitutional position during the war.The Viceroy&apos;s answer suggested that he was more concerned withthe present constitutional position than with adhering to the essentials of the Cripps offer, including the keeping of faith withthe minorities, the depressed classes and the princes. Our duty toIndia compelled us to bring out that those were terms which mustbe accepted as the necessary condition of any advance at all.(vii) The War Cabinet agreed to the following amendment tothe longer draft approved by them on the 4th August, viz. : (a) That paragraph 2 of the redraft in telegram No. 17258 ofthe 5th August should be amended to read as follows : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government remain most anxious that a settlement of the Indian problem should bereached. But proposals such as those put forward by you, &amp;c.....&quot;as in the draft;(&amp;) That consequentially paragraph 5 of the same draft shouldbe amended to read &apos;&quot; It is clear in these circumstances that no purpose would be served by discussion on the basis which you suggest.   If, however, the leaders of, &amp;c. . . . .&quot;   -The War Cabinet conclusions were as follows : (1) The Viceroy should be invited to send,to Gandhi either the longer draft approved by the War Cabinet (telegramNo. 17258) subject to the amendment proposed above,or the shorter draft (No. 17797).(2) A further telegram should be sent to him, giving an explanation of the reasons which had weighed with theWar Cabinet in preferring their longer draft to thedraft proposed by the Viceroy.Draft telegrams on these lines were prepared and, after an adjournment, were approved.   Copies are appended to this record.The Secretary of State for India wished his dissent to be recorded on the ground that on a matter, not of broad policy, but ofwording and tone, the earnest and repeatedly expressed opinionof the Viceroy, in touch with the whole Indian situation, shouldnot be overridden.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,14th August, 1944.88
APPENDIX.From the Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, dated 14th August, 1944.(Most Immediate.)(17968.)1.   Your telegram of 12th August, 1560-S.2. Cabinet have again considered the question with full understanding of points you have put to them. I have already explained difficulty they feel in anysubstantial revision of draft contained in my telegram in absence of ministers who were present when it was prepared. These objections are still, in their view, decisive. They must therefore ask that reply to Gandhi should be either in terms of draft contained in my 17258 of 5th August, subject to amendments in paragraph 3 below or in terms of alternative draft contained in my 17797of 11th August, and they leave choice as between these two drafts to you. reasons which weigh with them in preferring draft in my 17258 to draft proposed by you are contained in my immediately following telegram.3. Should you decide in favour of longer draft as against short draft, they propose following amendment to meet point taken by you.Paragraph 2 of my 17258 of 5th August.Amend beginning to read as follows : (1) &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government remain most anxious that a settlement ofthe Indian problem should be reached. But proposals such as those putforward by you, &amp;c.....&quot; as in draft.(2) Consequentially, amend first three sentences of paragraph 5 of draftcontained in my 17258 of 5th August to read :- &quot;It is clear in these circumstances that no purpose would be served by discussion on the basis which you suggest. If, however, theleaders of, &amp;c. . . . .&quot;From Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, dated 14th August, 1944.(Most Immediate.)(17969.)My immediately preceding telegram. Cabinet are anxious that you should realise that fullest consideration has been given to your proposals. They differ from you with reluctance and only because of their strong sense of importanceof the issue. Drafting amendments suggested in my immediately preceding telegram meet a point you have raised. They wish you to know that the following were the reasons for their decision in favour of the longer draft in my 17258in particular of the inclusion of paragraph 3 &apos;(1) They see in Gandhi&apos;s letter a deliberate attempt to ignore essentials ofthe very generous offer made on their behalf by Cripps. They regard it as their duty to themselves and to India to restate those essentials, and to make it clearthat they must be accepted as the necessary condition of any advance.(2) In particular, they think it necessary to bring out their responsibilityfor fulfilling their obligations to minorities, depressed classes and States.(3) They feel that it would be very dangerous to allow Gandhi&apos;s referenceto finance to go unchallenged. He is quite capable of claiming afterwards thatsilence represents acquiescence on our part in his proposals.(4)) While most anxious to be conciliatory and polite, reaction oh other elements in India and on world opinion cannot be overlooked. As regards India,Gandhi has not withdrawn policy which resulted in his imprisonment, and hehas just again advocated symbolic civil disobedience. Proposals he has put toyou are outrageous in character. Minorities and States will be watching our reply. While polite we must be firm, and Cabinet feel that their longer draftdoes not at all go too far.(5) Finally, reactions on international opinion are of great concern to them.Foreign Secretary feels, and Cabinet agree, that those reactions make it essentialto restate their case fully and firmly and to leave no room for any suggestion thatwe are moving from position we have taken up or, on the other hand, adopting a weak line with Gandhi. &apos; It is for that reason that they have thought itnecessary to stiffen the tone of the proposed reply. They feel sure that you will appreciate the need of this from the broad point of view to which. Cabinet haveto give weight.
