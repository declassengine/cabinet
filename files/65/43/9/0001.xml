1.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) a note by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 393) to whichwas attached the Draft Memorandum of Understandingon Oil as submitted subsequent to the official discussions- in Washington and as now proposed to be amended;(ii) .a note by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 394) covering a statement proposed for use by the Ministerial Delega-tion to the forthcoming Anglo-American oil discussions in Washington;(iii) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (44) 395) covering draft instructions to the ministerial Delegation.The Lord Privy Seal asked for approval of the papers beforethe War Cabinet, which represented agreed conclusions as to thepolicy to be pursued in the forthcoming discussions.Points raised in discussion were :-(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested the followingdrafting amendments in the statement attached to W.P. (44) 394 : .(i) Section 14. Eor &quot; may amount to  3,000 million beforethe war is finished &apos;&apos; substitute &apos;&apos; which will amount to 3,000 million before the end of this year, and cannot be measured until the war is finished.&quot;(ii) Section 16. We had disposed Of our more marketableinvestments but had not lost the whole of the 200 million referred to. Some slight modification of. - wording might be considered to bring this out.(b) The Lord President of the Council said it was important not to create in the minds of the Americans any impression that thediscussions in view about oil were general economic discussions.They were, of course, quite separate from any general economic discussions that might take place, and were directed to the reachingof a settlement on a specific issue.(c) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to theParliamentary position in relation to the outcome of the forth-coming conversations. On the 13th July, in answering questions inthe House of Commons, he had made it clear that the position inregard to the outcome of these discussions would be exactly the sameas that in connection with any other meeting between Ministers oftwo countries. Arrangements, if they were arrived at, would ofcourse be presented for the approval or disapproval of the House.But he had brought out that any administration must have powerto meet and discuss, and if it so desired arrive at arrangements with others. The Government had been scrupulously careful on allthese matters to see that they presented to the House the results oftheir work at the earliest possible moment. He had felt that itwould not be possible to refuse the House the opportunity to discussthe outcome of these arrangements, but he had made it clear thatthat was without prejudice to the power of the Lord Privy Seal andhis Delegation to conclude and to sign an Agreement. If there was a debate subsequently in the House it would be on the Agreement asconcluded. There was no reason why the Lord Privy Seal need say anything to the Americans about what was entirely a matter ofour domestic procedure. The Agreement contemplated would not take the form of a treaty and would not require ratification; butthe issue was too important to be disposed of without the Housebeing cognisant of it.The Lord Privy Seal said that the one danger was&apos; pressure onthe United States Government to report to Congress. They wouldnot, however, wish to send the present document to Congress, andwould, he felt, be anxious to sign an understanding if reached. the precedent of the Anglo-Russo-American Agreement, which hadbeen in the form of an Agreement between Foreign Ministers, andwhich had not gone to Congress, was a valuable one.Oil.(previous reference:W.M.(44)79thConclusions,Minute 2.)
The Prime Minister wished the Delegation all success in theimportant negotiations which they were about to undertake.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the statement appended to W.P. (44) 394, subjectto consideration of the drafting points raised by theChancellor of the Exchequer as a paper to which the delegation would speak.(2) Approved the draft instructions to the MinisterialDelegation appended to W.P. (44) 395.(3) Took note with approval of the view expressed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to the Parlia-mentary position in regard to the outcome of thenegotiations with the United States Government on oil.2.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P.(44) 360) on our Overseas Resources and Liabilities. Tothis was attached a memorandum by Lord Keynes about&quot; Our External Finance in the Transition.&quot;(ii) a memorandum by the Secretary of State, for India (WP.(44): 368) on the Sterling Problem.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had felt it his duty to bring before his colleagues the result of prolonged study inthe Treasury of various aspects of our probable post-war financialposition. In exposition of his paper, the Chancellor of theExchequer drew attention to the following points : (1) We should make an approach to the United StatesGovernment in order to impress on them the gravity of the position,which, perhaps they hardly realised. The means and time for thediscussion could be settled later. There was no intention of goinghat in hand to the United States and asking for favours. Weshould tell the United States frankly what our situation was, making it clear that we were determined to do our best to grapple with it.We should not make any suggestion as to the help to be given, but should bring out that we expected the United States to treat usfairly as to.the cost of the war.(2) We must develop our export trade without delay to thefullest possible extent.(3) Our agricultural and import policies must be so framed, asto relieve the external financial position to the fullest possible extent.(4) We should open consultation with the Dominions and withother members of the sterling area about their accumulations of sterling balances.(5) The question of bringing gold sales in India and the middle east to an end was already under consideration. We should try to persuade the United States, on the other hand, to increase theirgold sales in India. -(6) The matter of clearing our gold liabilities to neutrals waswell in hand.A good deal could be done if the War Cabinet agreed with thegeneral approach, of which he had sketched the salient points andthe detail of which was contained in W.P. (44) 360. The situation with which we had to deal was one of potential danger. Butproperly handled it might result in a strengthening of the bondsbetween the different constituent elements in the Commonwealth.There was a new community of interest to-day to the extent that itwas to the interest of all of us to see sterling strong. He wasconscious that the picture which he had to paint might be regarded&quot; by some as too gloomy. He should put it on record that certain of his&apos; advisers regarded it as too optimistic.The first point discussed was whether the Chancellor&apos;sMemorandum gave a balanced view of the position.[27898] b 2OverseasResources and liabilities.
The Lord Privy Seal thought, that the presentation of theposition in W.P. (44). 360 was too gloomy.   Thus :(1) our present debt was a sterling and not a dollar debt, andtherefore much easier to handle than our debt at the endof the last war.(2) the dollar also was depreciating, perhaps as quickly assterling. The latter might over a period of years prove to be very much the sounder currency of the two.(3) confidence in our own situation was all-important.(4) the change in the value of money made it unwise to attemptto draw exact comparisons between figures now and figures in 1919.If we went to the United States in a suppliant attitude, we might only alarm them as to our credit. An optimistic approach would be much more to our interest. He himself would have liked to see a statement prepared on more optimistic lines, to set against that prepared by Lord Keynes.The sterling group was a strong and firm one, and if we could hold it together our position in the post-war manufacturing world would be greatly eased. He thought it unfortunate that any state-ments should have been made by Lord Keynes in the United states as to funding our debts. Such statements could only be damaging to sterling and they were not in fact, in his judgment, justified.The Secretary of State for India agreed with the Lord privy seal that a more balanced picture would have been desirable. Allholders of our sterling credits were in the same position as we wereourselves. They would have to choose between depreciating sterlingby buying in too large quantities outside the sterling area (therebydepreciating the value of the credits they held) or buying from the sterling area. This might well be of great advantage to us andmight give a great impetus to Empire trade and development. Itwas most important to maintain general confidence in sterling andto get others to work with us. Moreover, this country should bothbuy, so far as possible, from the sterling area, and also develop itsexports to the sterling area, thus bringing about a gradual reductionin the total amount of the sterling debt held in that area. he agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that an orderlyliquidation of these problems was in the interests of us all.The Prime Minister felt that we could not reasonably regardour sterling indebtedness as on the same footing as ordinary com-mercial debts to a bank. We had no assets to set against our debt and we started at a heavy disadvantage when it was rememberedthat, over and above the problems presented by our overseasindebtedness, Great Britain had to import and to pay for. halfher food supplies and most of her raw materials. Unquestionablyby developing our export trade we should ease our obligations tothe sterling area, and help in solving the post-war problem ofunemployment. But a lot would have to come back in imports tofeed the worker who had produced our exports.  .Again, we should bear in mind the risk that (e.g., in regardto India) if we accepted the financial help of the United States we might also be parting with political authority and control. Financewas interwoven with the power and the sovereignty of the State.Finally, he felt strongly that in any ultimate settlement of this problem of war indebtedness, we must press that the fullest weight should be given to the contribution we had made to the victory of the Allies and to the preservation of those who were fightingwith us. Their survival would be very largely due to the factthat we had held the enemy at bay for a year and half single-handedand to the assistance we had given in men, money and materials.Those considerations could not be ignored, and we should be entitledto present the other side of the account in terms of these imponder-ables when the question of settlement was under consideration.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that if we did not succeed in getting some portion of our war debt funded it would
not be possible to control prices at the level necessary to meet theneeds of people in this country.The Minister of Labour and National Service dealt mainly withthe Export Trade. He said that the million or more men who hadbeen idle in the years before the war, if now diverted into production,could produce enough goods to buy a large proportion of the foodwhich we had to import from overseas. Generally, he agreed thatwe should proceed on the lines recommended by the Chancellorof the Exchequer without delay particularly as regards the stepsto stimulate the Export Trade. At the end of the war, the firstdisposition would be to develop the home market. But the rightproportion of our productive capacity must be set aside for theexport market. Industry to-day did not know what facilities itwould get, or what it ought to do after the war. On all these mattersit looked for guidance to the Government.Discussion then turned on the opening of conversations with theUnited States.The Minister of Production said that when we started discus-sions with the United States about the provision of munitions, food,&amp;c, on lend-lease to this country in the period after the conclusionof the war with Germany, we might be faced with the suggestionthat we, on the one hand, expected the United States to continuesuch supplies on a very substantial scale (a sum of  600 millions for non-warlike stores had been mentioned) while on the other wewere demobilising some two to three million men with a view tore-starting and developing our export trade.The United States Government took the line that our needsafter the conclusion of the war with Germany would be less thanthey were now. There was always the risk that they might enterinto commitments about future programmes before learning thefull facts of our position.  That made early action important to us.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs remarked withreference to the Minister of Production^ point that Mr. Stettinius,in the conversations that had taken place with him, had accepted that it was in the interests of the United States that we shouldhave a flourishing export trade after the war. -We should remember in that connection the possibility of anarrangement between the United States and the U.S.S.R. in respectof the post-war period. The United States might be willing togive long-term credit to the U.S.S.E,. where we could not afford to do so, and moreover on a very large scale.After further discussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer saidthat he wished to deal with two points which had arisen in discussion.(1) As regards the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s point, there was no suggestion that there should be any funding operation in the nearfuture. In the long run there would have to be funding operationsbefore sterling was accorded full convertibility, but he did not knowhow long the interval might be before such a stage was reached. Itwould, in his judgment, be essential to distinguish between fruitfuland productive debt, such as arose in the ordinary course of com-mercial transactions, and sterile debt such as that which had beencontracted for the purposes of fighting, the war, and to treat them on a different footing.(2) Our prestige both on the continent of Europe and outside europe stood very high to-day. We were trusted in financial matters. The smaller countries were, in his experience, very anxious lest they should be drawn into the United States financialvortex, and had confidence in us. He urged that we should use noword, either in public or in conversations with representatives ofother countries to suggest that we despaired of our financial future.He did not underestimate the difficulties which we would have to face; but he had every confidence that things would work out welland that the outcome would be satisfactory.
In conclusion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked theWar Cabinet to approve the proposals contained in W P- (44) 360.If adopted, they would enable a preliminary scrutiny to be made asto the best method of dealing with the issues involved. The resultsof such examination could be submitted to the proposed ministerial committee on Exports, and thereafter, if necessary, by other appropriate bodies such as the Lord Presidents Committee or theWar Cabinet itself. The position of India and the Indian sterling balances was an issue which he proposed should be consideredindependently in the light of a report which would shortly be madeto the War Cabinet by the Special Committee on Indian Finance.After a brief further discussion, the War Cabinet reached thefollowing conclusions, and agreed that the Departments concerned should proceed with action on the lines indicated : Negotiations with the United States Government.(1) Negotiations should be undertaken at an early date withthe United States Government about the extent ofUnited States help to us after the end of the war withGermany. These negotiations should be based on a full statement of what we should require both in the field ofmunitions and of non-munitions supplies, with a fullexplanation and justification of our needs.Matters of Internal Policy.(2) It was important that a few key men should be released from war work for planning and designing, and thatsmall amounts of raw material for development work should be released, so that our exporters should be in aposition to make a flying start at the right moment.(3) Consideration should be given to the administrative machinery required to ensure that merchants sell abroad in Stage II the right proportion of their output.(4) We should also aim at getting a large fleet under theBritish flag as soon as possible.(5) Various measures (including the provision of any speciallyqualified staffs needed in the Departments concerned)would be necessary to ensure that existing industries were brought up to a higher pitch of efficiency and that new industries were created.(6) A Ministerial Committee (backed by an official committee)should be set up to advise how best exports could be promoted.The Prime Minister undertook to consider the composition ofthis Committee.(7) Our agricultural policy and import programmes of manu-factured goods should, as soon as shipping could bemade available, be adjusted with a view to saving themaximum amount of foreign exchange.Monetary Arrangements with Other Countries.(8) The existing sterling area arrangements would needrevision. The War Cabinet agreed that this was mainly for the future, but were of opinion that it needed earlyexamination with the Deparements concerned.(9) Note was taken that the policy of gold sales was already under review; and the view was expressed that existing arrangements with foreign countries (some of which involved gold liabilities) should be discussed with theGovernments concerned.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th July, 1944.
