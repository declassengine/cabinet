1.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (44) 375) setting out the results of the considera-tion given by the Ministerial Committee on Man-Powerto the man-power allocations for the second half of 1944.(ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (44) 316) dealing with the man-power require-ments for the Army in 1944-45.The following were the main points in discussion : Service Allocations.(a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the Man-Power Committee proposed to give the Army an intake of 49,500men in July and August. This would consist of 28,300, representingthe whole of the balance of the new call-up, 6,000 men from theR.A.F. deferred list, 4,000 additional men whose call-up would bebrought forward to July and August and who would be replaced byreleases from the R.A.F. deferred list later in the year, andtransfers of 6,200 and 5,000 trained men from the Navy and theRAP. respectively. The men transferred from the Navy and theRAP. should be Grade I and, so far as was necessary, compensation should be given to the Navy and RA.F. by the transfer to them ofmen of a lower medical category from the Army.The Committee proposed that the intake of women into thethree Services for July and August should be 1,500 to the W.R.N.S.,4,500 (including 3,500 on account of the allocation for the first sixmonths of 1944) to the A.T.S. and 1,500 to the W.A.A.F.For the rest of 1944 the provisional allocation for all three services should be 75,000 men and 10,000 women, making a totalcall-up for the six months of 123,000 men and 17,500 women.(b) The Prime Minister said that he was glad, to note that theCommittee had been able to provide for an intake of 49,500 meninto the Army during July and August.(c) The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that if only4,500 men were provided for the RAP- in July and August, itwould be necessary either to reduce the number of front line squad-rons or to place an increased strain on the men serving in these squadrons. Every effort would be made to avoid any reduction inthe front line squadrons but it should be realised that it would benecessary to make increased use of skilled men to perform unskilledwork.(d) The Prime Minister said that he doubted whether themaintenance of the Navy at its present strength could now bejustified, having regard to the great reduction in the naval forcesof our enemies and to the size of the United States naval forces inthe Pacific. Although the figures proposed by the ministerial committee should be accepted provisionally, it was desirable thatthe Defence Committee should consider whether a substantial reduction of, say, 200,000 men, should not be made in the Navy overthe next twelve months.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that a very largecut had been made in the Navy in the previous year. Since then theNavy had been called on to undertake new tasks in connection withthe invasion of the Continent in the shape of bombarding the enemycoasts, manning landing craft and providing beach and port parties.It was also necessary to provide against the new submarine offensivewhich was threatened, and to build up Naval forces for theJapanese war.Civil Defence.(e) The allocation made by the War Cabinet in December, 1943,involved a reduction in the Civil Defence Services of 50,000 during[27853] s 2Man-Power.Policy in 1944.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 164thConclusions.)
1944, 27,000 being non-replaced wastage and 23,000 actual releases.Wastage was taking place at the estimated rate but it had beenfound necessary to postpone the planned releases and the committee considered that they could not ask the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security to release more than 11,000 by the end ofSeptember. They recommended that the Chiefs of Staff should,make a new appreciation of the risk of air attack and that, in themeantime, the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityshould prepare a scheme for the release of personnel in certain ares which could be put into operation without delay if and when theWar Cabinet decided some disbandment in those areas could takeplace. Similar plans should be prepared by the Chiefs of Staff forthe release of personnel from A.A. defences and fighter stations inthe less vulnerable areas.(/) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat he had. taken into account the fact that London and the neigh-bouring area formed the main target of attack and had encouraged the maximum mobility and adaptability among Civil Defenceworkers (e.g. by training firemen in rescue work). The Civil defence forces in the less vulnerable areas had already been reduced very substantially and reinforcements were being drawn on from these areas for London. If it was decided that additional risks might betaken in certain areas, it would be possible to effect savings both inCivil Defence personnel and in the personnel of the regional organisation.(g) The Prime Minister suggested that the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security might consider the possibility ofawarding a civil defence medal to Civil Defence personnel who hadvolunteered for service in any part of the country.Supply Departments.(h) The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that theMan-Power Committee were satisfied that owing to the newoperational demands which the Ministry of Supply had to meet, itwas impossible to secure the original planned reduction of 220,000,and it was proposed that the reduction in the second half of 1944should be 110,000, making a total reduction during the year of170,000. The Admiralty and the Ministry of Aircraft production had already reduced their labour forces to the full extent of the reductions originally planned for 1944, but further reductions of37,000 in the Admiralty labour force and of 112,000 in the Ministryof Aircraft Production labour force should be made in the second half of the year. The Supply Departments should forthwithconsider, through the Joint War Production Staff, how, assuming that the war against Germany continued into the first half of 1945,their programmes could be related to the Service intakes in the&quot; remainder of the year and the probable strengths of the Services inthe. first half of 1945. The Supply Departments should work to theprovisional allocations since, even if some slight relaxation were found possible in the August review, it would only postpone the reductions by a short time.(j) The Minister of Supply explained that one of the main reasons why it had not been possible for the Ministry of Supply tomake the planned reductions in their personnel was the additional demand for ammunition chiefly 25-pounder which had been madeearlier in the year. This alone had meant the employment of 30,000additional workers and there had been additional demands for alarge range of other supplies. With the help of the Ministry OfLabour the task of manning the filling factories, in order to produce the new supplies of ammunition, bad been carried out smoothly.The Minister of Production said that the ammunition positionappeared to be satisfactory. The figures at the 1st June showedan increase in stocks despite the expenditure of ammunition in the battle of Italy.
(k) The Minister&apos; of Aircraft Production said that he had madea provisional estimate showing the effect on the output of aircraft of the reductions proposed by the Ministerial Committee. Oncethose reductions were made it would not be possible to increase theoutput programme again.In reply to a Question by the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState for Air said that the target for the Royal Air Porce was500 squadrons by September 1944 and 529 squadrons by September1945. The present strength of heavy bombers was 80 squadrons athome and overseas, which were clue to increase to 95 squadrons by september 1944 and to 128 squadrons by September 1945. the cuts proposed would mean a reduction of 3 Halifax squadrons and1 Lancaster squadron below the target for December 1944, and of9 Halifax and 3 Lancaster squadrons below the target for June1945.(I) It was pointed out that the War Cabinet had hithertoproceeded on the assumption of the maximum impact in 1944, andthat it was impossible to plan on the assumption that the strengths of the Services should continue to rise during 1945. In these circum-stances the planned expansion of the R.A.F. in 1945 ought to be reviewed.(to) The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the cutswhich the reductions have required to be made in the allocationcould not be made at the expense of shipbuilding or heavyengineering and must come from the manufacture of equipment.The result would be that there would be delay in the completionof ships for the Navy.Industries and Services in-Groups II and III.(n) The Committee recommended a reduced global allocation of 75,090 men, as compared with an original allocation of 123,000;and for industries and Services in Group III a global allocation of35,000, as compared with an original allocation of 49,000. InGroup IT the allocations for coalmining and the merchant navy would have to be met in full. If the global allocations for Groups and III were approved it would be necessary to consider theirdistribution among the industries and services concerned. It wasnot now expected that the industries and services in Group IIIwhich were due to give up labour, would be able to conform to theoriginal allocations, but Departments should continue to regardthese allocations as targets and make every effort to achieve them.(o) The Minister of Food said that since the ^beginning of theyear there had been a reduction instead of an increase in theman-power employed on food production. Particular difficulties were being experienced in the production of flour and margarineand in oil crushing, and the hours worked in these trades wereexcessive. He hoped that in the distribution of the global allocation to Group II the needs of the food industries would be kept in mind.(p) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the peak demands for agricultural labour would arise in August and september, and that it was impossible for the agricultural industryto await the proposed review at the end of August. It had been impossible to find suitable recruits- for the Women&apos;s Land Armyup to. the number allocated, and he suggested that it would be helpful if additional prisoners of war were allocated to the agricultural industry. He understood that most of the German prisoners ofwar were being sent to the United States and that it had hitherto been found impossible to employ German prisoners of war on agricultural work in this country because of the prop( rtion ofguards required.The Prime Minister said that the possibility of employingGerman prisoners of war on agricultural work should be explored,as a matter of urgency, and that in the meantime no further batchesof prisoners of war should be sent to the United States.
The War Cabinet&apos;&quot;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The intakes into the three Services and the transfersbetween the Services during July and August proposedin sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph 28 of w.P. (44) 375 were approved.(2) The -provisional man-power allocations for the six months,the 1st JulySlst December, 1944, proposed in para-graph 27 of W.P. (44) 375 were approved, on the general understanding that these allocations would, be reviewedtowards the end of August, and subject also to the specific points referred to below.(3) As regards Civil Defence, it was agreed that before the august review -(a) the Chiefs of Staff should prepare a new apprecia-tion of the risk of air attack;(b) the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security and the Chiefs of Staff would prepare a schemefor the release of personnel from Civil defence and A.D.G.B. in the less vulnerable areas whichcould be put. into immediate operation if andwhen the War Cabinet decided that the risk ofdisbanding these services in those areas could beaccepted.(4) For the purpose of the review in August 1944 the Supply.Departments should consider through the machinery ofthe Joint War Production Staff the implications of theprovisional intakes and allocations approved, and should review their programmes for the first half of 1945 onthe basis that still further cuts in the munitions industries would then become necessary.(5) The provisional allocation proposed for the Ministry ofA aircraft Production was also subject to the proviso thatit should be reviewed in the light of an examination tobe undertaken by the Defence Committee of the assump-tion as to the strength of the Royal Air Force in 1945to which the current aircraft programme should be related. Thus, should it be assumed that the strengthof the Royal Air Force would not be expanded in 1945beyond the strength which it was planned to reach atthe end of 1944 ?(6) Note was taken that the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Minister of Food contemplateddifficulties if further cuts were made in agriculture and food industries. The points raised would be taken intoaccount in the allocations to Group II Industries.(7) In connection with agriculture, attention was drawn to thequestion whether further help, could be found fromprisoners of war.(8) The Minister of Labour and National Service was asked toexamine, in consultation with the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security, the Secretary of State forWar, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland, the possibility of employing German prisoners on agricultural work.(9) Pending this enquiry the Secretary of State for War was asked to take steps to see that further batches of german prisoners were not sent from this country to the UnitedStates.(10) Note was taken of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that he proposed to ask the Defence Committee to considerwhether a substantial reduction could not be effected inVote A over, say, the ensuing twelve months.
DemobilisationScheme forReallocationof Man-Powerafter the endof hostilities in Europe.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. At their meeting on the 17th February, 1944 (W.M. (44)22nd Conclusions, Minute 2), the War Cabinet had approved inprinciple a White Paper setting out a scheme for reallocation ofman-power after the end of the war with Germany, but had deferreda decision as to the date of publication.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 386) statingthat he would like to start consultations with both sides of industry on this matter as soon as possible, but could not do so pending-publication of the scheme.After a short discussion the War Cabinet-Decided that publication of the scheme should stand over until after the Summer Recess.Closer Union 3    The War Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum bybetween the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of StateSouthern for the Colonies (W.P. (44) 363) reporting that, as approved by the rhodesia, War Cabinet on the27th April (W.M. (44) 58th Conclusions, Minute 3)Northern they had discussed the question of closer union between SouthernRhodesia and Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland with the PrimeNyasaland. Minister of Southern Rhodesia during his recent visit to this(Previous country, and had informed him that the United Kingdom Govern-reference:. ment considered amalgamation of the three territories underW.M. (44) 58th existing circumstances to be impracticable.   They had at the sameConclusions, time put to him proposals for a permanent Inter-TerritorialMinute 3.) Council.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that sir Godfrey Ffuggins, while disappointed at the decision, did not seem to be surprised or unduly upset by it. He had indicated thathe would have to consult his colleagues about a public announce-ment. There were arguments for and against such anannouncement, but on balance if the Southern Rhodesian Govern-ment should favour one, he and the Secretary of State for theColonies recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree.The Prime Minister suggested postponement of a decision onthis matter until the result of Sir Godfrey Huggins&apos;s consultations with his colleagues was known, when the matter should again beconsidered by the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Approved the Prime Ministers suggestion.Gandhi: Place 4, The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theof Detention if Secretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 371) reporting that theRe-arrested. Government of India were anxious to have plans ready in the eventof its becoming necessary to rearrest Gandhi, and that they favouredhis internment, in company with the Congress Working Committee,in Ahmednagar Fort. The Aga Khan&apos;s palace was no longeravailable.The Secretary of State for India said that the proposal beforethe War Cabinet represented the considered view of the viceroy and the Government of India, whose judgment he felt might properly be accepted on a matter such as this.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Government of India&apos;s proposal shouldbe accepted.
The War Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forIndia.Palestine. 6.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that theHigh -question of the succession to Sir Harold McMichael when his termCommissioner, of office as High Commissioner for Palestine expired some monthshence had been under consideration, and informed them of the namewhich he had it in mind to submit for His Majesty&apos;s approval whenthe time came.The War Cabinet Expressed full agreement with the Prime Ministersproposal.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,12th July, 1944.India. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePosition in Secretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 372) describing the presentBengal and position as regards ministerial government in Bengal and Orissa.Orissa. ^n Bengal there was a possibility that the ministerial government,which Mr. Casey had so far with difficulty been able to keep going,might in the near future collapse. In that event he considered, andthe Viceroy agreed, that if the Ministry were to fall in thecircumstances described in W.P. (44) 372, Mr. Casey would be fully justified in taking over the administration under Section 93 of theGovernment of India Act.The Secretary of State for India felt that the War cabinet should be aware well in advance of the possibility that it might benecessary to resort to the provisions of Section 93 in the case of bengal, and he proposed to inform the Viceroy of his general approval of the policy recommended by him &quot;and by the Governor.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the position in Bengal and approved the course proposed by the Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for India informed the War Cabinetthat in Orissa, for local reasons, the Ministry had resigned and ithad not been possible to form an alternative Ministry.
