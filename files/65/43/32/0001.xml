In particular, he recommended (a) that the scheme for the evacuation from London of furthermembers of the priority classes should now be discontinued;that the movement of patients from London hospitals tohospitals in other parts of the country should be stopped.(These points were in accordance with proposals he had receivedfrom the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health.)(c) that the basis on which the Rocket Consequences Committeehad made their plans, and which had been revised theprevious week, called for further review in the light ofthe increasing unlikelihood of this form of attack.The War Cabinet-Approved the action proposed by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad received some further letters suggesting that Parliament shouldreassemble before the date fixed. He thought that we should adhere to the view that no change was called for in the arrangementsalready made.This was agreed to.Parliament.Date ofReassembly,(previous reference:W.M.

Abolition of theBlackout.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)99tkConclusions,Minute 8.)(1  Man-Power and production in1943.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 106thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The War Cabinet were reminded that at their meetingon 14th August, it had been decided that revised estimates of man-power requirements for the second half of 1944 might be based onthe assumption that the war with Germany would not continuebeyond the 30th June, 1945.The Minister of Production said that this decision had enabledsome substantial cuts to be made in the allocations to the supply departments; but he suggested that the time had come when a moreoptimistic view might be taken.7. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 490)reviewing the position as regards the relaxation of the blackoutin the light of the improvement in the war situation, and urging that if relaxations were made it would be desirable that they shouldbe announced before British Double Summer Time ended] on the17th&apos; September, 1944.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that much the simplest course would be to allow the whole country to benefit at the same time and to the same extent. There were, how-ever, security and practical arguments in favour of a distinctionbetween London and the south-eastern counties and the remainder of the United Kingdom.In the course of discussion it was urged that the case for avoiding discrimination against London and the south-eastern counties, which had been severely tried, was very strong.Admittedly the risk of further raids could not be wholly excluded,and there might be criticism from the areas affected in the eventof a raid. This should, however, be set against the very great generalrelief which relaxation of the blackout would present. Rather thandiscriminate against London and the south-eastern area it would bebetter to postpone relaxation until it could be made of general appli-cation to the country  IS  1 whole.It was urged on the other hand that it would be a pity to postpone relaxing the blackout at once where no further risk was involved.The President of the Board of Trade said that in the eventof a decision to relax the blackout on the lines recommended by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security,, immediate action should be taken to stop the manufacture of blackout material andswitch to other production.After further discussion the War Cabinet agreed as follows (1) An announcement should be made at an early date thatthe blackout would not be continued throughout thecoming winter in any area in this country; and that stage by stage, as circumstances permitted, the follow-ing relaxations would be made : (a) The substitution of a dim-out for the blackout inrespect of domestic lighting, on the lines set outin W.P. (44) 490.The relaxation of industrial and vehicle lighting onthe lines recommended in W.P. (44) 490 and 417.(c) The introduction of - improved street lighting up tothe standards recommended in W.P. (44) 490.(2) The question of prosecution would, of course, be handledin a reasonable spirit.(3) The President of the Board of Trade was invited, in thelight of the above decision, to arrange for the diversion of capacity forthwith from the manufacture of blackoutmaterial to other types of material appropriate to theconditions which would prevail when effect had beengiven to those relaxations.
The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that for the purpose of estimating man-power requirements in the second half of 1944, it could nowbe assumed that the war with Germany would not continue beyond the 31st December, 1944.It was also suggested that steps should now be taken to switchsome labour and productive capacity from war production to theproduction of articles for civil consumption crockery, hollow ware,furniture, clothing and the like now in very short supply.The President of the Board of Trade said that the necessary    Iplans and programmes had been prepared.  What was now required was a decision for the diversion of the necessary labour and rawmaterials.The Minister of Production said that the necessary arrange-ments could be made by the Ministers concerned acting, in&apos;collaboration if the principle was approved by the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-(2) Agreed that some diversion should now be made from war production to production of articles for civil consump-tion, and invited, the Ministers concerned to take thenecessary action to this end.The President of the Board of. Trade said that it would be ofgreat assistance to him if the Supply Departments could nowfurnish him with particulars of the more important factory units at present engaged on war production which would be turned overto civil production early in Stage II.The War Cabinet-(3) Invited the Supply Departments to take steps to furnish -this information to the Board of Trade as a matter of urgency.War Criminals.       9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(Previous       Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 484) about a reference:      warning to neutrals against granting asylum to enemy leaders and.W.M. (43) 103rd war criminals.   The matter had been considered in the summer of conclusions,     1943 when the War Cabinet had felt that it would be prematureMinute 2.)      to raise it.   A stage had now been reached, however, at which afurther  authoritative pronouncement  seemed  desirable,  at thehighest level and on behalf of the three major Allies.  The Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs recommended a joint Declaration inthe terms of the draft annexed to W.P. (44) 464 by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the United States Government and the Soviet Govern-ment, and asked for authority to consult the United States and theSoviet Governments in this sense.The general sense of the War Cabinet was in favour of thecourse recommended by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.In the course of discussion the following points were made : (a) The position of Quislings. The War Cabinet took note that the words &quot; accomplices in other countries &quot; in paragraph 3of the draft Declaration appended to W.P. (44) 484 sufficientlycovered the position of Quislings.(p) The suggestion was made that paragraph 5 of the revised draft should be omitted on the ground that it might be consideredby neutrals as a threat to their independence and provoke&quot;X&quot; I embarrassing counter-declarations; and that the point would be suffiently covered if after the word &quot; retribution &quot; in paragraph 4of the draft Declaration the words &quot; wherever they may be &quot; wereinserted.
The War Cabinet Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in W.P. (44) 484, and agreed to the draft declaration subject to the amendment at &quot; X.&quot;(Previous The Prime Minister said.that he was increasingly impressedEeference:      with the need for a very.early Declaration, of the kind that he had.M.(44)83rd previously urged, regarding the grand criminals whose crimes had conclusions,     no geographical location.  He felt that the effect of such a Declara-Minute 4.)      tion might be of great value as dividing the Nazi leaders frompopular feeling in their country.   We need anticipate no difficulty with the Russians in this matter, and he would propose to discuss it personally with the President.The Lord Chancellor said that with the Attorney-General andthe Minister of Aircraft Production he had, as desired by the WarCabinet, been drafting a formula for this purpose. He undertook to let the Prime Minister have a copy of the draft at once.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,. 4th September, 1944.17 w.m. 116 (my.
