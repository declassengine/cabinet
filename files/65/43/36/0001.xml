demobilisation and Service Pay.ProposedAnnouncements.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 117thConclusions,Minute 10.)At their meeting on the 31st August the War Cabinet had agreed that, if possible simultaneously with the publication of theWhite Paper about reallocation of man-power after the end ofhostilities with Germany, a further statement should be made as tothe improvements in the oonditions of service of men retained in the armed forces after the end of the war with Germany.At their meeting on the 5th September the War Cabinet had heard from the Chancellor of the Exchequer an outline of the schemewhich had emerged from the discussions he had had with the service ministers, the Secretary of State for India and the Minister ofLabour of National Service, and had invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to communicate it to the Prime Minister.The War Cabinet now had before them a telegram from thePrime Minister (Gunfire No. 26) raising certain points about thescheme and suggesting that an announcement on this subject and onthe reallocation scheme should be postponed until the scale of our effort against Japan had been ascertained, and until the climax ofthe struggle with Hitler was over.The War Cabinet also had before them a telegram from theGovernment of India (No. 7167) urging that further time was required for consideration of the scheme, and that in its applicationto India any increase should be divided into two elements, of which one part should be given in cash and the rest as deferred pay to begiven at the end of hostilities.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : *(1) The Press Conference which had been arranged forMonday, the 11th September, at which the Minister ofLabour and National Service had intended to explain the reallocation scheme to the Press (prior to its issue inthe Press on the following morning), should be postponed for a week, and the Prime Minister should be informed accordingly.(2) Further telegrams should be prepared for despatch to thePrime Minister setting out the following points whichhad been raised in discussion : (a) Without a public announcement work could not be started on picking out the men in the earlydemobilisation groups. This further delay would seriously endanger the despatch by the due dateof troops for the Burma campaign.(b) The Service Departments reported that Commandersin the field pressed strongly for an early announce-ment of the demobilisation scheme, and therewere indications that the troops. attached greatimportance to knowing where they stood on thismatter.(c) The reasons in favour of making both announcementssimultaneously.(d) Various points as regards details of the improve-ments in conditions of service, e.g., that theAdmiralty and the Air Ministry, on advicereceived from their Commanders-in-Chief, pressed strongly that the whole improvement should begiven in immediate cash rather than that part ofthe increases should take the form of deferredbenefits.Note. Telegrams on the lines indicated in (2) were prepared,but they were not despatched, as in the meantime furthertelegrams on this subject were received from the PrimeMinister.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th September, 1944.
