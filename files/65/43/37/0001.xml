demobilisation and service pay.Proposedannouncements.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 120thConclusions.)1. At their meeting on Saturday, the 9th September, the WarCabinet had agreed that telegrams giving explanations on certain points should be despatched to the Prime Minister. Telegrams onthe lines agreed had been prepared but had not been despatched, asin the meantime further telegrams had been received from the PrimeMinister.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet -Agreed to the despatch of a telegram to the Prime Ministersuggesting that one of his colleagues should proceed toQuebec to give him a full explanation in person of theproposed scheme for improvements in Service emoluments.Explosion in the bombay Docks.(previous reference erence:W.M. (44) 51stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Education, circulated on behalf of the Secretary of Statefor India and the Minister of War Transport (W.P. (44) 511), aboutthe report of the Commission set up by the Government of Indiato enquire into the Bombay explosion.The Commissioners had issued a report which set out the causes of the disaster and contained a number of statements reflecting onthe Ministry of War Transport and its representative in India.The Government of India had, in setting up the Commission,committed themselves to publishing the report, except such partsas in the opinion of the Commission would be detrimental to thepublic interest. Publication had been approved and would takeplace in India on the following day. Furthermore, it had beenarranged that a statement should be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to controvert the incorrect, and in some casestendentious, statements made regarding the Ministry of war transport&apos;s organisation.In discussion, the arrangement made by the Government ofIndia which committed them to publish the report (except such partsas the Commission itself considered should not be published) was criticised as unfortunate. It was also felt that the procedure proposed, whereby simultaneously with the report a Resolutionshould be issued controverting some of the statements in theCommissioners&apos; report, was open to considerable objection. TheWar Cabinet felt that, given the possibility, of political reper-cussions in India and of damaging criticism in the United Kingdomand the United States, they should have been consulted before these arrangements had been concluded. It was also felt that the proposal that the Minister of War Transport should telegraph an expression of his confidence to Mr. Masson (the head of the Ministry&apos;s organi-sation in India) shortly after the publication of a report by independent persons, strongly criticising Mr. Masson&apos;s actions, andthat the message of confidence should be published in the IndianPress, ought not to be proceeded with until the War Cabinet had had an opportunity of reading the report and considering thematter.Later, the Minister of Education reported that it was too late to alter the arrangements made for publication of the report and ofthe resolution of the Government of India commenting thereon. TheMinister had, however, arranged that action should be deferred onthe proposed message from the Minister of War Transport toMr. Masson until the matter had been further considered.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th September, 1944.
