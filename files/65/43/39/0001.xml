On the night of the10th/11th September an attack by &quot; X &quot; craft had successfully sunkthe dock at Bergen.On the previous Saturday a German ship the Rostock whichclaimed to be a hospital ship but was not so recognised by us, hadbeen intercepted and brought into Plymouth.  The German wounded ihad been disembarked and were being treated as prisoners of war.Except for certain types of mines, Havre and Ostend were clearfor navigation.In operations north of Crete a small enemy convoy had been destroyed.    &apos;Operations during the previous week had been governed by the.maintenance, problem. In the Belfort area Allied forces from theSouth had joined up with forces from the West. Epinal andLuneville were in our possession, but Metz was still in the hands ofthe enemy. The First United States Army had penetrated germany at a number of points between Trier and Aix. The most importantthrust was just south of the latter town.    ,(On the British sector Havre had been taken, with 10,000prisoners, and Canadian forces were now attacking Boulogne, whichwas expected to fall at any moment. There had been considerableactivity south of Eindhoven, where strong German counter-attacks had been repulsed with heavy casualties.On the previous day airborne troops had landed in Holland.The object of the operation was to capture the bridges at Arnhem,Nijmegen,- Grave and Heumen. It was as yet too early to get a clear view of the situation, but one report stated that the GuardsDivision had already made contact with the airborne troops atEindhoven.On the Adriatic sector some advance had been made and bridge-heads established over the Marano River. In the neighbourhood ofFlorence the Gothic line had been penetrated at two places. TheGermans were showing no signs of withdrawal; and prisoners had stated that they had received orders to fight to the last.In North Finland the Germans were disengaging and their force of some 9 Divisions, which was endeavouring to withdraw intoNorway, was being followed up by the Russians. In Russia theGermans had reported Russian attacks between Valka and Riga.North of Warsaw the Russians had captured Lomza. &apos; In Warsawitself, where there had been fighting in the suburbs, the Russians hadnot yet succeeded in crossing the Vistula.&apos; Further south theRussians had reached the Czechoslovak frontier and controlled thegreater part of Transylvania. Sofia had been occupied but noRussian advance had yet been made into Yugoslavia.-3] b 2
Greece.Pacific.China.Broadly speaking, the enemy was withdrawing from certainislands but retaining troops in others. On the Greek mainland thegreater part of the Peloponnese had been evacuated, although theenemy were keeping a bridgehead at Corinth. It was estimatedthat there were some 7 German Divisions in Greece together withancillary troops.American forces had been landed successfully on Palau andMorotai.The recent Japanese advances endangered the Americanairfields at Kweilin.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Attacks by rockets, Flying-Bombs and long-RangeArtillery.Casualties and damage.2. The Home Secretary and Minister of. Home Security saidthat during the week 26 long-range rockets had been launched.These had resulted in 20 incidents in this country -14 in the Londonregion, 4 in Essex and 2 in Sussex.There had also been two phases of flying bomb activity. Thefirst had been on Friday, when 13 flying bombs had operated, ofwhich 6 had crossed the coast and 2 had reached London, 3 being destroyed by fighters. The second phase had been on Sundayevening, when 4 had operated, of which 3 had crossed the coast and1 had reached London, 1 being destroyed by a fighter.From the morning of the 12th up to the night of the15th/16th September there had been repeated shelling of Dover,Folkestone, Deal and neighbouring districts. 143 shells had explodedon land.The total number of civilian casualties sustained during theweek were as follows : Seriously slightly killed.

The only serious incident from flying bombs had occurred at Barking, where extensive damage bad been caused andthe L.N.E.R. line temporarily blocked. There had also been considerable damage to property in Dover from shell fire.The War Cabinet-.Took note of this statement.Attacks by 3.   The Home Secretary and Minister  of Home SecurityRockets. reminded the War Cabinet that a week ago it had been decided that question of for the present the ban on publicity about attacks by long-rangePublicity. rockets should be maintained.   He thought that the general view(Previous of the public, as ascertained by the Ministry of Information, was reference:        now in favour.of continuance of the ban.W.M.(44)122nd In discussion it was urged that a statement that a small numberConclusions, of long-range rockets had landed in this country would&apos; not conveyMinute 3.) any useful information to the enemy, and that it was a serious matter for the Government to suppress the publication of news. TheWar Cabinet were also informed that in other parts of the countryexaggerated rumours were current as to the damage done by therockets.
Parliament:Place of meeting.(previous reference:W.M.(44)116tkConclusions,Minute 5.)Parliament:Times of meeting.4. The War Cabinet decided that the attacks by long-rangerockets did not justify any change in the arrangement, already approved, that, when Parliament reassembled, the House ofCommons should meet in the House of Lords Chamber in the Palaceof Westminster.5. The War Cabinet decided that there was now no objectionto publication of the hours of sitting of Parliament. In thisconnection the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as Leader ofthe House of Commons, undertook to bear in mind a suggestion that,so far as possible, the sittings of the House should not for the present be prolonged after dark. -8. The War Cabinet had a short discussion as to the businessof the House, having regard to the desire for a debate on the warand international situation in the first week after the adjournment.The War Cabinet agreed that, subject to the usual consultation,the main business of the House in the first week should be asfollows : Tuesday, 25th September .Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Bill : Conclusion of second Reading, and Committee Stage of the MoneyResolution.Wednesday, 27th September Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Bill:  Committeeand Remaining Stages.Town and Country Planning (Money Resolution Committee$ Stage).Thursday, 28th September, and Friday, 29th September Statement on the War and International Situationfollowed by a debate.Note was taken of the importance of ensuring that the Housing(Temporary Accommodation) Bill was sent to. the House of Lordsas early as possible, bearing in mind that the House would also becalled upon to deal with the Town and Country Planning Bill beforethe end of the session.Parliament:Business of theHouse.[28302-^3]On the other hand, it was pointed out that the enemy had notyet stated that rocket attacks had been made against this country,,and that any statement published in this country would no doubt be used to bring to the German people the encouragement they somuch required. Again, if an announcement was made at the presenttime, it would not be possible to inform the public that warningcould be given of impending attacks. Finally, if a public statement could be delayed for a further week, the position might well be changed by developments in the military situation.The War Cabinet-(1) Decided that the question of a public announcement aboutlong-range rocket attack should be deferred forconsideration at the meeting of the War Cabinet to beheld on Monday, the 25th September;(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to submit an appreciation of theprospects of the continuance of this form of attack, forconsideration at that meeting.
Quebec 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the war conference.       Cabinet a brief account of the main matters dealt with at theQuebec Conference.At the conclusion of this account, The Deputy Prime ministers aid that the outcome of this Conference was a matter of great satisfaction and&apos; the War Cabinet invited the Deputy PrimeMinister to convey their warmest congratulations to the PrimeMinister.Supplies from 8.   The Chancellor of  the  Exchequer  informed the War&quot;North America Cabinet that it had been -decided at the Quebec Conference to set to Stage II. ap a Joint Anglo-American Committee to work out the principles(Previous agreed on by the Prime Minister and the President on the scope and reference: scale of mutual lend lease aid between the United States and theW.M.(44)r6lst British Empire after the defeat of Germany and during the warConclusions,      with Japan.Minute 4.) The  United States members of the  Committee would beMr. Morgenthau, Mr. Stettinius and Mr. Leo Crowley. after consulting the Minister of Production, he had proposed that theUnited Kingdom members should be himself, normally repmesentedhy Lord Keynes, with Mr. Brand as his alternate, the minister resident lor Supply (with Sir Henry Self as hie alternate) andSir Ronald Campbell.Lord Keynes would be willing to serve, but could not reach theUnited States before the first meeting of the Joint Committee, whichhad been fixed for the 20th September. In these circumstances itwas proposed that the meeting on the 20th September should be onan informal basis, at which we should be represented by the paymaster-General, the Minister Resident for Supply, Sir RonaldCampbell and Mr. Robert Brand. Thereafter the Committee-should adjourn to a date at which Lord Keynes could attend.These proposals had been embodied in a telegram which thePrime Minister had directed should be considered by Lord Halifaxand the Paymaster-General. Subject to this, he hoped that the WarCabinet would approve the proposed membership.The following points arose in discussion : (a) The Secretary of -State for Foreign Affairs asked whethera visit by Lord Keynes might :give undesirable publicity &quot;in theUnited States to the establishment of the Committee.It was suggested that, if any objection could be raised on these grounds, Lord Halifax would take the point.(b) The Secretary of.State for Dominion A ffairs pointed outthat some difficulties might arise with Dominion Governments inthat, although &quot;the text of the -agreement !between the Prime Ministerand the President referred to Oend-iease aid between the UnitedStates and the British Empire,&quot;&quot; they had not been consulted. Hesuggested that the tGhancellor ;of the Exchequer should agree withhim the terms of the telegrams which he proposed to send to theDominion Governments informing them of the agreement.T-he \&amp;h(mc0ttm&apos; 10/ the fEmohegmr -agreed to this suggestion, butexplained the limited extent to which the Dominions which receivelenddease are involved.The War Cabinet -(1) Expressed -their agreement with the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer with regard to the UnitedKingdom membership of the Joint Committee.;(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to settle the terms in whichthe Dominion Governments should he informed of theagreement.
Poland. 9,   The War Cabinet were given the latest information about(Previous the Polish situation.   The discussion and conclusions reached areReference: recorded in  the   Secretary&apos;s  Standard  File  of  War   cabinet.M.(44)l22nd Conclusions.Conclusions,Minute 7.)Jewish FightingForce.(previous reference:W.M.(44)116thConclusions,Minute 6.)[W.M.(44)104th &apos;Conclusions,Minute 8.]10. The Secretary of State for War read to the War cabinet a draft Press announcement about the Jewish Fighting Force whichhe had agreed with the Jewish Agency and which it was proposedto publish on the 20th September. A sentence in the original draftstating that all Jews, wherever they were resident, would be eligible to serve in the Force had been deleted. The statement would makeit clear that the formation of the Jewish Fighting Force had beencarried&apos; out at the instance of the Jewish Agency; that it was intended to despatch the Jewish Battalions of the PalestineRegiment, which would form the basis of the Infantry Brigade, toItaly at an early date; and to provide&apos;the necessary supporting and ancillary troops to complete the Brigade Group as soon thereafteras practicable.The War Cabinet-Approved the issue of a Press announcement in the termsagreed with the Jewish Agency.Re-education ofGermanPrisoners ofWar.11. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister ofInformation (W.P. (44) 519) on the subject of the re-education ofGerman prisoners of war.-It was proposed that the Political Warfare Executive, basingthemselves on the experience gained in dealing with italian prisoners in India and the United Kingdom, should undertake thetask of re-educating the German prisoners of war who were nowbeing retained in the United Kingdom, as well as the german prisoners now in the Middle East. If the Political WarfareExecutive were to accept this responsibility, however, it was essentialthat the necessary facilities in the way of segregation of prisoners and the co-operation of the military authorities concerned should besecured.The Secretary of State for War said that, although he was infull agreement with the policy proposed, he must warn the WarCabinet that, in view of large numbers of prisoners who now hadto be dealt with, and the extent to which it had been necessary tosend experienced staff abroad, the results achieved might bedisappointing.The Minister of Information pointed out that little or nothinghad been done in the way of re-education among the german prisoners in Canada and the United States, although Canada was now taking some steps to improve conditions, and it was intendedto inform the United States Government of our proposals in the hopethat they might take similar steps.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe would like to consider, in consultation with the Political WarfareExecutive, whether anything could be done to re-educate Germans,detained in the Isle of Man.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Political Warfare Executive should under-take the re-education of German prisoners of war andthat all possible steps should be taken to facilitatetheir work.
Civil air transport.TheInternationalPosition.(previous reference:W.M.(44)114thConclusions,Minute 2.)12. The Secretary of Slate for Dominion Affairs informed the War Cabinet that, without any prior consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s Government, the United States Government had invited the Government of Eire to the Civil Aviation Conference which wasto be held in the United States&apos;on the 1st November.&apos; It was proposed to hold inter-Imperial talks in Canada towards the endof October, in preparation for the Conference, and the question arose whether the Government of Eire should be invited to attendthese talks. If the Government of Eire were not invited, they mightbe driven into the arms of the United States Government, and ithad to be borne in mind that they held a key position in civilaviation. It could also be argued that the question of civil aviationwas not directly connected with the war, and that sooner or laterit would be necessary to bring the Government of Eire into Imperialconsultations on post-war questions. For these reasons he felt that,despite the attitude which the Government of Eire had adoptedduring the war, it would, on balance, be desirable to invite them.If the War Cabinet agreed to this course, as a first step he proposedto consult the other Dominion Governments. This was all the more necessary seeing that the invitation would have to be issued by theCanadian Government.The Secretary of State for Air supported the proposals to invite the Government of Eire to the preliminary talks. Thesupport of the Eire Government would be valuable, both inconnection with the reopening of air lines to the Continent and inconnection with the general question&apos; of post-war air routes. Inparticular, it would be of great importance for our trans-Atlanticair routes to obtain the use of airfields in Eire. Another argument for the inclusion of the Eire Government was that before theoutbreak of war proposals had been agreed between the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, Canada, Newfoundland and Eire for atrans-Atlantic service, and these proposals would inevitably come up for discussion at the preliminary talks.The Lord Privy Seal also supported the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs. It was, however, equally important thatNewfoundland should be represented both in the preliminary talksand at the International Conference.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security suggestedthat, if the Government of Eire were represented, it would bedesirable that some representation should be given to the Govern-ment of Northern Ireland, who were . particularly interested inobtaining a share in any post-war civil aviation developments.     *There was general agreement that, as Eire had been invited tothe main Conference, nothing would be gained by excluding her from the preliminary talks. The United States Government ought not, however, to have invited the Eire Government to attend theInternational Conference without prior consultation with HisMajesty&apos;s Government, and it was felt that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should take up with the State Department thewhole question of representation at the Conference, including the omission of Argentina. With regardto Newfoundland and NorthernIreland, there might be difficulties about giving them independentrepresentation, but the matter should be examined. Thus it might-be&quot; possible to arrange for advisers from Newfoundland andNorthern Ireland to be attached to the United Kingdom delegation...(2) Took note that the Home Secretary and Minister of Home-Security would consult with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Minister of Information&apos;aboutthe re-education of Germans detained in the Isle, of Man .
53W.M. 123 (44).   159The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to consult the Dominion Governments on the questionwhether the Government of Eire should be invited to thepreliminary inter-Imperial talks. In doing so he should set out the arguments for and against this course as thematter presented itself to the War Cabinet.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to consult with theSecretary of State.for Dominion Affairs and the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security as to the representation of Newfoundland and Northern Irelandat the preliminary talks and at the Conference.(3) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should take up with the United States Government thegeneral question of the issue of invitations to theInternational Conference.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th September, 1944.9
