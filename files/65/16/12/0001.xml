COPY NO.     SW.M;-(40) SOSth CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex.(12th December, 1940 - 9.45 p.m.)THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the PrimeMinister, who was unable to be present that evening,was in favour of a modification of our bombing policyagainst Germany.     He had asked that the matter should be discussed by the War Cabinet in order that action, if it was to be taken, should not be delayed.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that itwas now widely appreciated that the Germans had altered their bombing policy against this country.The Prime Minister had given instructions for plans to be prepared for retaliation in kind.Up to the present we had never sent morethan 80 bombers to attack one town, and we had neverconcentrated on the destruction of a town as such.We had been faithful to our policy of picking outmilitary targets. /  Usually a degree of dispersionhad resulted from the fact that there had been three or four such targets in the towns which we had visited.The political question for decision by the T/ar cabinet was whether we were to concentrate as formidable a force of aircraft as we could command, with theobject of causing the greatest possible havoc in abuilt-up area.If the political decision was in favour ofa &quot;crash concentration&quot; against a single   Germantown the following military considerations should betaken into account.(1)   The target chosen should be a town of someindustrial importance.(2)   We should rely largely on fires, and shouldchoose a closely built-up town, where bombcraters in the streets would impede the firefighters.&apos;(3)   We should choose a town which we had notconstantly visited, and where the A.R.P.organisation was unlikely to be in goodtrim.AIR POLICY.Operation&quot;Abigail&quot;.

(4)    To save fuel and increase our bomb load,the target should be as near to thiscountry as possible,(5)    Since we aimed at affecting the enemy&apos;smorale, we should attempt to destroy thegreater part of a particular town,,      Thetown chosen should therefore not be too  .large.(6)    In view of weather conditions there mustbe alternative targets.The views of the Air Staff on particulartargets were as follows:-Hanover came first in the order ofpreference.     It was a closely built-uptown.of some 440,000 inhabitants.      Ithad important industries, including oiland rubber.       We could not, however,produce results at Hanover as devastatingas the results at Coventry;    we should notbe able to send over more than 200 aircraft-on one night, whereas the Germans had sentover 500 aircraft against Coventry, a town of some 250,000 people *Mannheim came second.     It was an industrial town of some 275,000 people,comparable with Coventry.Frankfurt had a population of over 500,000,Duisberg was a suitable target, but hadalready been heavily bombed.Dusseldorf. had also been heavily bombed.Munster was a town of suitable size-Emden was too small.      It had a populationof only 34,000,,Cologne was too big.     Its population wasabout 765,000.       It had been bombed onnumerous occasions.The following were the main points made in thediscussion:-(l) The question was entirely one of expediency,and we should be guided by what was the most effective course to pursue.,(2)   One important point was whether, if weadopted the course proposed, the result would be that Germany would bomb thiscountry more heavily than she was doing at th3

present time     The view of the Air staff was that Germany was already putting out hermaximum effort, and that the scale of herbombing attacksjagainst this country wasabout 2^ or 3 times the scale of our attack against Germany.      There was, therefore, noreason to suppose that Germany couldinflict heavier punishment on us.(3)    If we were to devote our main energies toconcentrated attacks on German cities, weshould have to conserve our resources to aconsiderable extent on intervening nights.With the Royal Air Force at its present strength we could probably make one bigconcentrated attack a week, but should haveto sacrifice a considerable part of our long-term plans for destroying, e.g., Germanoil installations.(4)   There was a risk that if we embarked on apolicy of concentrated attacks on one Germancity after another, and Germany adhered tothe same policy, we should become involveg.in an attempt to keep pace with Germany inthis form of attack.      If this happened,our bombing effort would be permanentlydiverted from the military targets against which it was at present directed.(5)   The Chief of the Air Staff said that theintention was that concentrated attacks ofthe kind now proposed should normally be launched on nights when there was littlemoon, relying on the fires started byincendiaries to guide the later aircraftt?o the target.     Moonlight nights would be reserved for attacks on industrial targetsWhich were harder to pick up.       The AirStaff wished however that the first concen-trated attack   should take place in moonlight,so as to make sure of success.(6)   The course of action proposed involved achange of policy - the diversion fromstrictly military objectives to a politicalobjective,    namely, the effect on Germanmorale.    It was for this reason that thematter was being brought before the WarCabinet.(7)   The Chief of the Air Staff said that 200tons of bombs dropped on a closely builtarea in a single night would create morehavoc than 20 tons of bombs dropped on 10separate nights, owing to the cumulative effect of   the spreading of a large numberof fires, the destruction of water mains andthe blocking of streets.

is general agreement was expressed with theview that there was much to he said forour bombing policy including more concen-trated attacks on particular objectivesthan had previously been the general practice.(8)    The Chief of the Air Staff said that hewould anticipate fewer casualties from asingle concentrated attack, than from thesame degree of effort spread over severalobjectives.(9)    The proposal that the first concentratedattack should be directed against Hanovermet with a good deal of criticism.Hanover was the centre of the oldGerman aristocracy, it was strongly anti-Nazi, and had long associations with thiscountry.     An attack on Hanover might well lead to reprisals against say, Oxford orWinchester.(10)    It was suggested that, if the Air Staff wereto depart from the policy of attackingstrictly military objectives, and were tocarry out an attack, the object of   whichwas to affect German morale, they should seek the advice of persons who had exnertknowledge of how German opinion in particular areas would be affected by such an attack.(11)    This led   to a discussion of various targets.Politically there was much to be said for aconcentrated attack on a quarter of Berlin.But the long distance would greatly reducethe effective bomb load.(12)   Discussion then turned on what townsoffered the nearest parallel to Coventryor Birmingham.     It was explained that mostof the industrial towns in the Ruhr warespread out.     For the most part they didnot offer any closely built up areascomparable with cur Midland industrial cities.Of ten, too, the military targets were wellaway from the residential areas.(13)   The Air Staff had taken the view that thisconcentrated attack should be made against- an area which had not already been heavily bombed.       This view was questioned. Althoughthe areas which had been heavily bombed had probably npw got more effective A.R.P. and fire-fighting services   than the areas whichhad not been heavily attacked, their moralewas probably somewhat lowered.     There was thus no reason why a city like Dusseldorfwhich had been heavily bombed, if otherwisesuitable, should not be included in possibletargets. - -

The War Cabinet reached the following conclusions(a) While confirming our existing air policy, agreed that the maximum scale of attack should, by way of experimerbe concentrated, on   one night in thenear future, against a single objective.(b) In selecting this objective, preference should-be given to a town which would berecognised as having a predominantlyindustrial character, was suitablylocated, and offered a target vulnerable to concentrated air attack.(c) Hanover should accordingly be omittedfor the present.     A town might be chosen from the following list:-MANNHEIM,FRANKFORT,DUISBURG,DUSSELDORF and perhapsHAMBURG..(d) No previous announcement should be made that this attack was being carried outby way of reprisal for the German attacks on Coventry, Birmingham and Bristol,and no special publicity should be givento it afterwards.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1
