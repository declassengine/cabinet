APPENDIX.DISTRIBUTION B.TO     GREECE.Cypher telegram to Sir M. Palairet (Athens).Foreign Office.       19th November, 1940.       1.50 a.m.Non 950oMOST IMMEDIATE.Your telegrams Nos. 1154 (of November 17th) and1159 (November 18th).Following from Prime Minister.Promised Gladiator squadrons are being sent to greece with utmost despatch as well as the remainder of thethree Blenheim squadrons.     The effectiveness of theGladiators in the land battle is of course dependent on theserviceability of forward aerodromes*    Information on thispoint should be communicated at once to. Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief Middle East and repeated to London.In addition to Gladiator squadrons Air Officer Commanding*-in-Chief is being requested to ferry over 12 more Gladiatorsfor use of Greek Air Force.     It is useless to talk aboutHurricanes as immediate reinforcement since they cannotland at Crete en route and to fit extra tanks in place of guns and then reassemble them for. operations would be along business.     Moreover we doubt whether Greek personnelcould service or operate Hurricanes without special training.Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East is being informed by Air Ministry.
