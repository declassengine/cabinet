HIS.;IS.,q?KE PROPERTY. OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.MQSfsSEQKBfe^It is requested that special care may betaken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.idFRAITCE.   -The French1 Fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 273rdConclusions,Minute 9.)jggnf idgfltial Annex ^(1st November, 19=10 - 12 noon)The War Cabinet were informed thatfive large French destroyers had been sightedeast of Gibraltar at 0730 on 31st October, makingwestwards.    They had been shadowed by H, Mo ships in order to make sure that they did not proceed in the direction of the French Biscayan ports.We had not been notified in advance ofthe movement of these destroyers,,    On the otherhand, we had been notified in advance of a recent move of French submarines from Casablanca toOran.Reference was made to a report from      ?Tangier (Telegram No, 623)&apos; that it was intendedto bring the JEAN BART to a French Mediterraneanport.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that we couldnot allow either the JEAN BART or the RICHELIEUto enter the Mediterranean,    These two vesselswhen completed would be perhaps the most powerfulcapital ships in the world0    It was a greaterrisk than we could accept to allow   them toproceed to ports under German control (in whichhe included Toulon and French North African ports)where they could be completed and made ready for action against us0    The addition of these vessels to the German Fleet would go far to alter thebalance of strength at sea,-    THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the JEANBART might perhaps take a year to complete^Questions of high policy as- well as Naval factors .had to be taken into account in reaching a decisionSo far as the Naval factors went, there wore riskson both sidesv     On the one hand the risk of thetwo new French battleships being added to theGerman Fleet.-   On the other hand the more immediaterisk that our action in forbidding them to enter the Mediterranean might land us in hostilities with france.    In that event the whole French Fleet as it now stood (which, normally speaking^ was in readiness for sea) would pass under the controlof our enemies,   A very considerable part of that-Fleet was now in Mediterranean waters0

THE PRIME MINISTER said that wo mustnot allow ourselves to become obsessed with theidea that we must never in any circumstancesoffer provocation to the Vichy Governments    Thatobsession might bring great dangers in itstrain.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that wewere conducting our relations with the vichy government in a kind of twilight, in whichwe had-to balance opposing risksD    Our presentsuspicion of Vichy and all its works was naturaland justified.    Yet we had to remember thatcompetent and friendly advisers such as thePolish Charge d&apos;Affaires at Vichy (wliom he had recently seen) viewed the position ratherdifferently,,The Viohy Government had given us anumber of assurances of good behaviour, forexample, on October 22nd the French naval attache at Madrid had conveyed to Sir samuel hoare an assurance that we had nothing to fearfrom the Freach Navy unless we attacked them.It seemed to him that the difficultycould be solved by careful handlings . We must notlet matters come to the point when one or other of these capital ships tried to enter theMediterranean, and a battle ensued.   We shouldprevent matters reaching   this point by tellingthe Vichy Government that we should not alloweither of these ships to enter the Mediterranean,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY drew attention to Tangier Telegram No0  595, which showed that the French Naval Intelligence weroanxious  to ascertain full particulars of all british warships in harbour or under repair at gibraltar,    If the greater part of our warshipswere away from Gibraltar for a time, as theywould be in the near future, the news wouldprobably get back to Vichyc    This might be thesignal for an attempt by the two Frenchbattleships to get past the StraitscIt was suggested that, in the absenceof British capital ships, the French capital ships would have to be held up by our small craft, even if it meant torpedoing them0THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER saidthat there was nothing to prevent the germans from taking the two battleships at any moment,,once they were in a French Harbour,,The War Cabinet:-(a) Recorded the view that theRICHELIEU and the JEAN ?:RT-  . should on no account oe al.lo-.to, fall into German hands *

s(b) Invited the Foreign Secretary tomake it clear to the vichy government that we should not allow either of these two ships to proceed to any port where theymight fall.into German hands: i, e0we should not allow them to enter the Mediterranean or to proceed toany..-- of the. Atlantic &quot;ports on the coast of Metropolitan France.Richmond Terrace, S^W*.1*
