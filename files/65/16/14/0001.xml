(40) 509th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE g.Confidential Annex.(23rd December, 1940 - 12 noon)LORD HALIFAX referred to telegram No, 1595from our Minister at Berne reporting that therewould he no blackout in Switzerland on the night of24th/25th December &quot;in the hope that our (Swiss) ail-space will not be violated on Christmas night&quot;.Our Minister hoped that it would be possible to avoidimpairing the goodwill of the Swiss people by flightsover Switzerland on Christmas night or on Christmaseve.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that from the Air Staff point of view, it would be unfortunate if we were to be debarred from carryingout operations on either of these two nights, sincethe number of nights which were suitable for bombing raids on Northern Italy v/ere few.     At the same time.,he appreciated that there was a big political pointinvolved, and that the War Cabinet might decide thatit was better that we should not carry out bombingflights over Swiss territory on these two nights.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thatthis policy should be applied to bombing operations against Italy and Germany on both nights.     We shouldnot, of course, make any statement in advance as toour intentions in this matter.     If, however, we didin fact refrain from bombing attacks on these two nights, we should get credit for it.The War Cabinet:-Agreed that while the Air Staff must,of course, retain discretion to act as necessary in any unforeseen emergency,Our policy should be not to launchbombing attacks against targets in italy or Germany/on Christmas Eve orChristmas Day, say from dusk on the24th December until after midnight onthe night of the 25th/26th December.No public indication should be given ofour intentions in this matter.:If the enemy should bomb this countryheavily on Christmas Eve, the questionwhether we should bomb Germany or Italyon Christmas Day should be reconsidered.occupiedterritoryRichmond Terrace, SoW.lfl
