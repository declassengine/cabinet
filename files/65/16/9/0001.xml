(40) 296TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(26th November, 1940 - 12 Noon.)AIR DEFENCE.Air Defence ofGreat Britain.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 290thConclusions,Minute 2.)THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF reported thatthe Chiefs of Staff had decided on the followingredistribution of A.A,, gy.ns in order to strengthenanti*-airei3aft defence in the Midlands:-Birmingham districtCoventry-SheffieldDerbyManchesterCrewePresent.64402828248Increased to.9640(no increase)44364016These increases had been made at the expenseof the A.A. Defence of London and the Home Counties.40 guns had been taken from London, leaving 192 inthe inner artillery zone.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION asked that the Air Staff should make arrangements forHurricane Squadrons to be based on aerodromes near tocertain production factories, especially the Austinfactory near Birmingham.     He said that the presenceof fighter aircraft near the factories had a greatpsychological effect on the workers, and gave themsuch confidence that their work improved and their output increased.       It would be impossible to sustain the working force in factories, unless the workersfelt that they were being given adequate protection., THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that hehad /vio4tod the Austin factory duing the previousweekend and there was no doubt that production was going down,     It would continue to decline unless theworkers were given confidence, through feeling thatthey had some form of increased protection.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that difficulties v/ould immediately arise if aircraft units, which were part of the coherent scheme ofdefence of this country, were allocated for theprotection of particular factories,,    The presenceof fighters at an zovofipoms near a factory didnot add to its protection,,    Prom the point   of viewof air fighting it made no difference whether our fighters were based 5 or 50 miles away from a factory.    That the presence of a fighter squadron near a factory was no defence was shown by the fact, that fighter aerod;;cmos had themselvessuffered most severely from enemy attack.    Hewould, however,  endeavour to make arrangementsfor fighters to fly over areas which had suffered from enemy bombing and would see that they flew over Coventry on the following Thursday when theMinister of Labour would be in that,City,THE MINISTER   OP AIRCRAFT PRODUCTIONpressed that other factories should be treated inthe same way.    He suggested that special units mjight be created which could be centred round thosevulnerable areas on which so much of our war effort depended.    He saw no reason why the strategic scheme of the Air Staff should sufferif additional squadrons were created for thispurpose.    It might even be possible to placetrainer Hurricane squadrons in the vicinity of factories.Reference was made to other areas in need of protection, and the MINISTER OF LABOUR saidthat he was worried about the Hillingdon factorynear Glasgow, the defences of which were notvery strong.The general view of the Vfar Cabinet wasthat, while, in order to restore or maintainconfidence it was desirable that fighter aircraft should if possible show themselves frequently nearessential key points,    it was not possible to contemplate a splitting up or redistribution ofour air defence system, to meet a series of requests from work people in particular factoriesTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR saidthat as regards the Austin factory, as theMinister for Aircraft Production attached such importance to it, he would be prepared to make
