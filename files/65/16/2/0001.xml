/TlilS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT. )TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY,MOST    SECRET.It is requested thai si-c-. Mi w e rony betaken togjjsurs the secrecy of this cioeument.COPY NO.W*M.(40) S83ND CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(4th November, 1940 - 5,0 psm.)GREECE.Military-Assistance.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 281stConclusions,Minute le)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Greek Minister had &quot;been to see him that morning, and had made three requests*     First,for aircraft, A.A. guns, anti-tank guns and rifles.Secondly, that we should, through our representative in Washington, give our support to requests theGreek Government would be making to the UnitedStates for the delivery of certain armaments.    Thirdly,that we should allow the Greeks to use the machineryof our British Purchasing Commission in the UnitedStates for the purchase of arms.The Foreign Secretary said that he had promised the Minister an answer as&apos; soon as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER said that over the week-end he had been in consultation with the Chiefs ofStaff over the military assistance which we couldsend to Greece.      It had been decided to take certainsteps, and action, which would take some time tocarry out, was in train.     93iis action couldp ofcourse, be cancelled if the War Cabinet did not agree with the decisions reached.Looking at the matter from the military point of- view, it was of the utmost importance tohelp Greece to resist the Italian attack.      the greeks were now mobilising 14 Divisions, and therewas a reasonable prospect that a Greek front against italy could be built up.      Strategically, he thoughtthat the loss of Athens would be as serious a blow to us as the loss of Khartoum, and a more irreparableone.     If the Italians secured the Greek islands theywould be in a position to dominate the Black Seaapproaches with their air force, and to interfere more effectively with our shipping in the Mediterranean.Our public opinion was most anxious for&apos;British intervention in Greece.     If Greece was over-whelmed, it would be said that in spite of ourguarantee we had allowed one more small ally to beswallowed up.    We could answer such criticisms by pointing out that the guarantee had been a joint anglo-French guarantee, and that the plans for imple-menting it had been in the hands of General Weygand.But no answer would really help if another smallally was overwhelmed.

The Prime Minister then read to theWar Cabinet:&quot;(a) A telegram which he had sent to the.      Secretary of State for War, now in Cairo.(b) A telegram which the Chiefs of Staff had sent to the Commanders-in-Chief, in theMiddle Basto.....  &quot;These telegrams are attached as Appendices^?The substance - of these telegrams wasthat it was only in the air that we were in a    ^position to render sufficiently speedy assistanceto Greece,   It was impossible for anything fromthe United Kingdom to arrive in time, and theonly course was to draw upon our resources in egypt and to replace them from home as quickly as possible.The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle East,had already sent to Greece a composite squadron of Blenheims, consisting of 9 Blenheim fighters and 6 Blenheim bombers.   They had arrived on theprevious day0     His directive to the british authorities in the Middle   East was that 3 moresquadrons (1 Gladiator and 2 Blenheims) were tobe sent from the Middle East to Greece as soon asproperly defended aerodrome s were ready to receivethem0     Our immediate air reinforcements to greece would thus amount to h squadrons in allo   these would be followed by a second Gladiator squadron,as soon as the arrival of Hurricane reinforcements in Egypt made this possible0The necessary ground staff and anti-aircraft guns would be sent to Greece and installedbefore any further squadrons were sent (over and above the composite squadron of Blenheims alreadydespatched).   At the best it would be a week or ten days (according to the availability of gunsand shipping; before these were in position^In addition to air operations from Greece,it was intended to increase the weight of attack from Malta by bringing the number of Wellingtonstemporarily operating from there up tc;.-34*If necessary, a second British battalionwas to be sent to Crete;   one battalion hadalready arrived there.   We should endeavour as rapidly as possible to establish a Naval base in Crete.   Orders were being given for tb.e despatchof the necessary antiaircraft guns, boom defences,etCqi

The Prime -Minister made the following additional points:-(i)   We could not foretell how the Italianswould react to these moves0   It was obviously-essential to keep as secretas possible the strength and the origin ofour reinforcement So   Nevertheless, theItalian Intelligence Service would obtainat any rate part of the facts and this&quot; might decide the Italian Commander in libya to press his attack on the western desert Pronto(ii)   The British authorities in Egypt.thought that we should not send moreair reinfdrcoments tlvm        onecomposite Blenheim squadron.-,        heSecretary of State for Was? endorsedthis views      There... had  been no time to bring the Secretary of Statehome for consultation0   Nevertheless, itwas certain that th^ turn which events had taken made it necessary to accepta risk in the Middle Easto   That riskwas of a temporary nature only, sincelarge air reinforcements, which would more than make good the gap,, were onthe way to Egypt by various routes0These would include 3h Hurricanes whichwould be embarked at once in HoMvSFURIOUS, disembarked at Takoradi, andflown .onwardso   The first of theseHurricanes should arrive in Egypt by aboutthe 2nd Decembero(iii)   The air was already our weakest point &quot;inEgypte   The decision now taken would forthe time being reduce by half our air strength ih that country,,(iv)   The idea of despatching to Greece a largerair contingent consisting of k squadrons of Hurridanes and U squadrons ofWellingtons had been considered andrejectedi     There was ho prospect ofimprovising aerodromes to operate so manysquadrons *(v)   We could not hope to preserve theTurkish Alliance if our reinforcements to Greece were on a smaller scale thannow proposed^

The fallowing were the main points made in discussion:-(a)    THE FOREIGN SECRETARY welcomed thedecisions taken &quot;by the Prime Minister.To have sent no help to Greece wouldhave undermined the will to resist.ofthe other Balkan countries..- (h)    In reply to a question, THE CHIEF OF THEAIR STAFF said that it would he possibleto evacuate from Greece   the aircraft nowto he sent there if that course were laterdecided upon.     But in that case theground staff and ancillary Services wouldprohahly he left &quot;behind.(c) In view of the dangers of leakage, wehad not yet told the Greek Government what assistance we were sending to them.      Thedifficulty was to find a way of hearteningthe Greeks, without disclosing our weaknessin the Middle East.      The Kink&quot; of Greece andGeneral Metaxas, should he told in strict confidence   the number of squadrons we were sending.(d) Since our forces in the Middle East consistedlargely of Dominion troops, it was essentialthat the Dominion Governments should he told,in strict confidence, of our decision andof the fact that we were making good withthe utmost speed the resultant gap in theair defences of Egypt.(e) There was no possibility whatever ofproviding, either from this country orfrom the United States, the munitions forwhich the Greek Government had asked.    Anymunitions provided from the United states would reduce the supplies available to us.(f) THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said thathe would let the Foreign Secretary knowin a few days what could he done to meetcertain of the Greek demands.(g) THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that he was considering whether hecould send a consignment of rifles to -Greece. He had already sent 22 anti-tank rifles from Egypt$ *md he might heahle to send 50 more from this country.

(h)   The Chief of the Imperial General staff undertook to send to Greece a number ofinstructors in dealing with unexplodedbombs.The War Cabinet i-(i) Approved the instructions issued bythe Prime Minister as to thedespatch of five squadrons and A*A*protection to Greece from Egypt.(ii) Approved the action proposed by theChiefs of Staff to make good the resultant diminution in our air forcesin Egypt by the despatch of air reinforcements from this country*(iii) Invited the Foreign Secretary   to instruct Sir Michael Palairet toinform the King of Greece and GeneralMetaxas of the help which we had decided to send to their country,making it clear -(a) That this, information was tobe treated as strictly seeretand personal, and that theywould be endangering the common cause if they disclosed either the extent of the z&apos;.j$xc?jovqqv33Z&amp;&amp;or whence they came0(b) That the date of the arrival ofthe air reinforcements would depend in part on the date atwhich the Greeks would putadequately defended aerodromes at our disposalo(iv)    Invited the Dominions Secretary,after consultation with the service departments, to inform the dominion prime Ministers in strict confidence of the decisions which had beentaken, making it clear to them(a) That we had felt obliged to run certain risks inEgypt for the time beingo(b) That the squadrons now being sent to Greece   from Egypt werebeing vev?r-^A 00 quickly aspossiblesH&apos;.....

Agreeablywith arrival of our air reinforcements aforesaid andat earliest send one more Gladiator squadron.   A.A. guns for airfields in Greece should precede arrival of squadrons.   You should not abandon your special plan,though perhaps some postponement may be necessary.APPENDIX B.Following from Chiefs of Staff to Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, andAir Officer Commanding-iri-^Chief, Middle EastoNo* 23.It has been decided that it is necessary to giveGreece the greatest possible material and moral supportat the earliest possible moment.    Impossible for anythingfrom United Kingdom to arrive in time.   Consequently only course is to draw upon resources in Egypt and to replace them from United Kingdom as quicly as possible.2.     The following plan has therefore been submittedby the Chiefs of Staff and has been approved by the PrimeMinister^    In concert with other Commanders-in-Chief, youwill put this plan in train at once and report yourarrangements and time table.   Plan begins.3*     As a first step aerodromes must be prepared forthe operations of three Blenheim and two Fighter Squadrons.On the information available to us Tatoi and Elousisappear the most suitable.   Adequate anti-aircraftprotection must be established before aircraft arrive*Greeks have very little anti-aircraft artillery.   Theyare, however, being pressed through our Minister toprovide anti-aircraft defence for aerodromes you proposeto use.   Detailed requirements will be made direct by air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle East, or his representative to Greek Commander-in-chief.    In additionone battery H.A.A. guns and one battery LoA.A. -guns shouldbe despatched from Middle East to supplement whatGreeks may provide.    These will be replaced from homeas soon as possible^

Squadrons (including the onealready- sent) and one Gladiator Squadron to hefollowed by a second Gladiator Squadron the momentHurricane reinforcements.permit.     All essentialpersonnel, transport, equipment and ancillary services for these squadrons must he provided from middle east.       To compensate for these withdrawalsreinforcing aircraft will he sent as quickly aspossible under the following arrangements:(a)   Fighters.Thirty-four Hurricanes with pilots willhe embarked at once in H.M.S. FURIOUS,disembarked at Takoradi and flown onwards.First of these Hurricanes should arrive inEgypt about 2nd December.      Ground personnel for these aircraft will arrive about thesame date via Mediterranean.(h)   Bombers.In addition to the replacement and re-equipment programme already in progress,an additional thirty-two Wellingtons willbe sent to Egypt via Malta.      These will goin relays starting forthwith.     Necessarypersonnel and stores for above will arrive in Egypt via Mediterranean about 2ndDecember.5.      In addition to air operations from Greece itis intended to increase the weight of attack from malta by bringing the number of Wellingtons operatingtemporarily from that place to twenty-four.      Thepassing of Wellingtons to Egypt after operating from malta will continue as fast as weather permits transitfrom the United Kingdom.      About 200 personnel9 stores and bombs will be despatched to Malta by cruiserarriving there on 17th November.6. It is fully appreciated that this plan will leave Egypt very thin for a period. Every endeavouris being made to make this period as short as possible.
