S.4.  convo7/ to the Cape and beyond. -This matter was now of added importance, as the admiral SCHEER was at large.    The convoy would shortly arrive at Freetown, and the Admiraltysuggested that it should then be divided into twoparts5 one fast and one slow.    It was proposed thatthe DEVONSHIRE, after fuelling at Lagos, should go out to meet the convoy and should escort half of it asfar as the Cape.    This would leave one D. Classcruiser to watch Duala until the arrival there ofthe NEPTUNE.    The arrangements suggested involved a certain amount of risk in the event of an attackbeing made by the Vichy forces on Duala.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the risk wasone which could properly be taken.The War cabinet agreed that the DEVONSHIRE should beemployed   to escort      part of theW.S.4. convoy from Freetown to CapeTown, as proposed.

MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(12th November, 1940 - 5.0 p.m.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the WarCabinet were very indebted to the Secretary of Statefor War for having undertaken this visit.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatthe defences of Gibraltar had been preventive-f--ly strengthenedin recent months.     There v/ere 4 battalions of infantry,Possibly one might be replaced by sappers.     Jtaothertunnelling company was badly needed, and would be arrfcingshortly.      We were strong in artillery at Gibraltar,though not in mobile artillery.     The chief improvementwhich y/as required in the defences was to put under-ground more of the essential services, particularlyhospitals.The water question should be improved byinstallation of condensers.before these were requirednext summer,,    Work was now in progress. (See W,P.(40) 438).The Governor was anxious for early information in the event of the War Cabinet considering that wewere on the eve of (a) Spain&apos;s entry into the war against us or (b) a German push through Spain.     Hewould then propose to take time by the forelock,first ,    by certain sabotage measLires, secondly, byscuppering the positions which the Spaniards had prepared in La Linea.Our people in Gibraltar took a gloomy viewof conditions in Spain, and did not believe that the spaniards would resist a German attempt to -advancethrough their country.The garrison of Malta (6 British Battalions,2 Batteries of 25 pounders, and a Company of I tanks)now afforded reasonable insurance against an Italianlanding.       General Dbbbie would like two morebattalions, but this was on the assumption that seven days might elapse after an attack on Malta beforehelp was received from the Mediterranean Fleet,possibly a rather pessimistic estimate.     The garrisonwas almost entirely deployed on the beaches, and the mobile reserve had appeared rather inadequate when he(the Secretary of State) had visited the island.Since then one more British battalion had arrived.

The recruiting of Maltese had fallen to 50foof normal, largely, it was understood, on account   oftheir discontent with the pay offered.      This  point was &quot;being taken up.       Up to the present the &quot;bombing of Malta had not been formidable, by London standards and the civil population remained in good heart. T?heSavaiauthorities wanted some mine-sweepers, to prevent theexits   from the harbour from being mined, and somemotor torpedo boats.     These would be valuable in preventing enemy warships standing off the island outof range of the coast defences and bombarding it.They were also anxious for a number of smallsubmarines.All   our   authorities   were      ex;erj.clse&amp;tore:?&apos; the enomy communications   to &quot;Nort....&apos;Africa;Very   little /traffic between Italy and North...-Africabad been detected by air reconnaissance, andit was puzzling to know exactly how the Italianssupplied     their Army in Libya.     Possibly a gooddeal passed over by night.      The Italian vessels were believed to cross over to Tunis, and then tohug the coast to Tripoli or Benghazi.     Very littleshipping had been observed in these harbours.     Ix&quot;the Germans began sending reinforcements to Libya, itwould become a matter of great importance to interrupttheir communications.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that our owncommunications between Alexandria and Malta would be improved by our occupation of Crete.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR gave theWar Cabinet an appreciation of the strategic positionin the Western Desert.     Maps showing the British and enemy dispositions were handed round.     The enemydisposed of 6 divisions between Bardia and Sidi BarrariaGeneral Wilson thought that water supplies and communications presented such difficulties that not morethan 5 divisions were likely to&quot; be brought against us at anyone time.      We had taken steps to break up the road from Mersa Matruh to Sidi Barrani.      General Wilsonthought that any further large scale enemy advance would almost certainly be in two columns:    (a) a columnalong the coast, and (b) another column 10 or 20 miles tothe south along the escarpment.The Secretary of State explained the strengthand dispositions of our forces, and the plan of operations which it was intended to follow in. jfeheeventof an Italian advance on the above lines.       Atpresent there were no indications of any Italianadvance on a major scale.

(previous reference:W.M.(40) 285rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Reinforcements.(previous references:W.M.(40) 272ndConclusions,Minute 2, and.M.(40) 282ndonclusi ons,Minute 2.)116 aircraft the position would he completely alteredif   German forces on a considerable scale, with largenumbers of tanks, arrived to take part in theWestern Desert battle.     Whereas the Italians had always used their tanks in conjunction with infantry,the Germans might adopt Blitzkrieg tactics; forexample, they might contain Mersa Matruh, and attempta rapid advance on Alexandria or Cairo.     In either&quot;case they would have to avoid the large marshydepression of SI Qattara.The Secretary of State described the strategy which General Wilson intended to adopt inthe   event of a Blitzkrieg, and the local defences ofAlexandria and Cairo.     The ground in the immediateneighbourhood of both towns was very unsuitable fortank operations.The position at Siwa was unsatisfactory. Siwahad some small military importance as a possible jumpingoff place for an attack on Giarabub, though none from thepoint of view of the defence of Egypt itself. Except  &amp;?one British company the whole of the garrison ofSiwa consisted of Sudanese troops, with Egyptian Officers&quot;It was extremely doubtful whether these latttetwould stand and fight, and there was a rjroposal toreplace the   Egyptian officers by British officers.Summing up, the   secretary of State saidthat the military position on the Western Desert frontwas far more favourable than had seemed possible a fewmonths previously.     There was little doubt that wecould hold   an attack by Italian   land forces.Indeed, we should, welcome an attack on the MersaLiatruh line.     Our weakness was in the air.     Forsome time after the withdrawal of the fj squadrons to greece we should only have 3 fighter scuadrons available&apos;one Hurricane squadron and one Gladiator squadron at thefront, and one Hurricane squadron, in support covering    aAlexandria and Cairo,    la addition there was a serious shortage of anti-aircraft guns, especially Boforsguns.     The   Italians had been most unenterprising        Jin the air, but we had to bear in mind thepossibility of German air forces operating against our line Of communications, which would create a most dangerous situation^THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out thataircraft. would be reaching the Middle East in successive batches from now onwax&quot;ds.     considerable numbers would have arrived by 2nd December.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF gave figures ofthe air reinforcements which were being sent to theMiddle East.     By 7th December those reinforcementswould have amounted, to -l\2 Hurricanes.32 Blenheims.k3 Wellingtons.

By 25tli January, the reinforcements wouldhave amounted to -12+8 Hurricanes 0116 Blenheims *60 Wellingtons e65 Mohawksa10 Glenn Martinsosay 390 aircraftoT^e planned scheme of reinforcement andre-requipment would he complete hy 1st Marcho     Bythat date there would   be a net effective increase,over our present air strength in the Middle East, of167 aircraft.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION saidthat he wished to enter a serious protest against these proposals,,     To the open drain on our resources which the   Chief of the   Air   Staff had describedthere had to be added a further drain in respect of spare parts.     The central fact of   the militarysituation that autumn had been that this country hadbeen saved by our Hurricanes and Spitfires, and bynothing else.     When the German air   assault againbecame formidable, it would once more be Hurricanesand Spitfires which would stand between us anddefeat.     If they were not available in greatquantities the enemy dive bombers would be able to destroy our aircraft industry.     He did not see thesame objection to the despatch of Defiant fighters,or of bombers, to the   Middle East,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the modifications required in the Defiants before theywere fit for the   Middle East would take a very longtime.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION saidthat if it was decided to send Defiants to theMiddle   East, he would see that they were equipped for tropical service with the maximum speed,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the   questionof sending Defiants   to the Middle East at a later date -should be consderede     He   was satisfied, however,that the present reinforcement of the Middle East byHurricane aircraft should not be interfered with.If it had been a question of parting with, say, 500aircraft to the Middle East, he would not havefavoured this course0     As it was, we were onlyparting with aircraft on a scale which the Ministryof Aircraft Production was in a posit ion * iraaediatelyto make good.,     Again, we should enjoy a certaineasement in the air during the next few months.     Thescale of the operations against this country had beendiminishing for some time paste

(previous reference:\7.M. (40) 268thConclusions,     &quot;A&quot;Minute 1.)The Sudan.Abyssinia.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 281stConclusions,Minute 1.)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said thathe^was in general agreement with the policy of sendinghelp to Greece.     It was important ito &quot;get Greece to       -hold on, from the point of view of wearing down Italyand its effect on Tar key.He would like to see our land forces in theMiddle East considerably increased.     More ships oughtto be made available for this purpose, even if itmeant a cut in rations at home,     The troops themselvesmight fairly be called upon to put up with someovercrowding and discomfort on board the transports, inorder that the strength of our Army in the Middle Eastmight be increased with the least possible delay.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES -said that he also was in general agreement with thepolicy outlined.      It was unfortunate that we lackedinformation on such essential points as the likelihood of German reinforcements arriving in the Middle East.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the &quot;War Cabinetthat the Admiralty, together with the Ministry ofShipping had been invited tp examine the possibility of using some of the large, fast&apos; ocean-going liners for transport purposes;,Later the Chiefs of Staff had initiated a Reporton Basic. Shipping Requirements with a view to asdertainihgto what extent ship-oing-^would prove a limiting factor to .our future plans (Chiefs of Staff g56th Meeting, Minute 4)It was important that both these Reports should besubmitted as early as possible.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that thetroops engaged in the desert warfare had had no relief,and practically, no recreation with the exception of anoccasional bathe in the Mediterranean, but they were in very good heart.The morale of the enemy.      In the Navy it waspoor;      in the Air Force, good (this was confirmed by our Navy)j    in the Army, rather mixed.The Sudan.     Details were given of our forcesin the Sudan, which had been   strengthened..Perhaps the most important point was the rebellion in abyssinia, the prospects of which were now much more hopeful.     Particulars were given of the various areasin which rebel activities had been stimulated.     A gooddeal had been done in the way of sending in arms, rifles and money, but there was room for a good deal more.    Itwas clear that the Italians were now being hampered byrevolutionary movements, and were moving about incolumns, for self protection.      Our Air Force in theSudan helped by bombing places indicated to them by colonel Sandford.

ftThe view taken by the   authorities atKhartoum was that our forces in the Sudan were nowsufficient to counter any Italian offensive againstKhartoum, taking account of the low morale of theenemy troops and&apos; thfe difficult country.     it was nowthought   that the Italian advances on Kassala,G-stllabat and   Iloyale had been made with   the objectof capturing the places through which we mightinfiltrate into Abyssinia.There was some evidence that the italians were short of supplies.     All the prisoners takencomplained of food difficulties,, In Kenya the military situation was affected toy the political motive.     General Smutswas anxious to make an offensive which would finallyremove any threat to Mombasa.     The Secretary ofState for   War agreed that, if this offensive wasnot carried out, the   West African Brigade in Kenyashould   be sent back to West Africa.alestine and Palestine and Trans-Jordan.     There was onerans-Jordan. problem of which the War Cabinet would be aware,namely, that if Syria was hostile to us, troops could advance through the Dera   Gap into Palestine.Plans were now being prepared to meet such an advance, and the Arab forces in Palestine were being increased.    We had, however, at present oui) militaryforces available to deal with such an advance fromSyria.      Finally, summing up the position as a whole,the Secretary of State for   War said thatGeneral Wavell had summed up our strategy under thefollowing three heads:-First, to ensure the security of Egypt bythe   defeat of the Italian forces nowthreatening it.Secondly, to foster rebellion in Abyssiniaand, by raids and local offenaives   fromSudan and Kenya, to seek to liquidate theItalian forces in East Africa.    We should thus remove threat: to^Red Sea and liberate, . .our forces now engaged there for use in other theatres.Thirdly, to build up forces to assist Greece,Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed the thanks ofthe War Cabinet to the Secretary of State for war for the very fine and enc ouraging account which hehad given of the position in the Middle East.The War Cabinet:-(4) Took note, with warm approval, of theSecretary of State forWar*s account ofhis visit to the Middle East.(2) Invited the   Admiralty, in conjunctionwith the Departments concerned,*to accelerate submission of the Rebootsreferred to at &apos;IA%,Richmond Terrace,, S.W. 1.
