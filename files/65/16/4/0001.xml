MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(8th November, 1940 - 11.30 a.m. )I FRANCE.The french fleet.DEAN BART&quot;and &quot;RICHELIEU&apos;.&apos;(previous reference;V7.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 4.)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY referredto the action to be taken if the &quot;JEAN BART&quot; and the&apos;RICKELIEU&quot; tried to reach Toulon,     If, as might wellhappen, our larger surface vessels were otherwiseengaged, only submarines would be available to stopthese ships passing through the Straits,      In that case should orders be given to the submarines to sinkthem at sight?     A further possibility, following theappointment of Admiral Laborde as Commander-in-Chiefat Toulon, was that he might, with a superior force,steam west to meet the &quot;JEAN BART&quot; aid the &quot;RICHELIEU&quot;.In that case he imagined that orders should be givento our forces to avoid action.THE SECRETARY&apos;OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he hoped that the warning which had beensent to the Vichy Government would be effective.      If,on the other hand it became necessary to sink thesetwo ships, the Vichy Government might take strongeraction by way of reprisal than bombing Gibraltar..This danger had to be weighed against the potential danger of these two ships being in the Mediterranean.The big object in view was to get North Africa andGeneral Weygand over to us.      If we had to&apos;sink the&quot;JEAN BART&quot;    and the &quot;RICHELIEU&quot; all hope of thiswould have to be abandoned.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that he did notthink that the French had any intention of moving the&quot;JEAN   BART&quot; and the &quot;RICHELIEU&quot;.      So long as theywere outside the Mediterranean the Vichy Governmentcould always threaten Germany that they would turnthese ships over to us.      Once they had passed intothe Mediterranean this card could not be used.      Inhis opinion their passing into the Mediterraneanwould be a definite hostile act against us.The Prime Minister said that president roosevelt had always taken a great interest in the fate of these two French battleships and he thoughtthat it might be desirable to telegraph to thePresident and suggest to him that he should warn the .Vichy Government against moving them.

The War Cabinets-(a) Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to draft a telegramfrom the Prime Minister to president roosevelt suggesting that thePresident should warn the vichy government against moving the&quot;JEAN BART&quot; and the -RICHELIEU&quot;. from their present positions.(b) Invited the First Lord of theAdmiralty to issue instructions that if the &quot;JEAN BART&quot; and the&quot;RICHELIEU&quot; endeavoured to moveeither into the Mediterranean or to any French West   Coast Port, they shouldbe stopped unless overwhelming force was brought against our naval forces.(c) That if submarine action wasnecessary to prevent the &apos;JEAN BART&quot;or &quot;RICHELIEU&quot; moving into theMediterranean, or to any FrenchWest Coast Port, the submarinesshould be authorised to sink atsight^rf^fo  unjuwiu^i U-4xW.Us i b*rRichmond Terrace, S.W.1.
