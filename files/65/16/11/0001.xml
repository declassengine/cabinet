After the French defectionour position in Egypt had looked precarious.    Nofwith-standing the risk of invasion at home, we had sentstrong reinforcements to Egypt, including tanks and artillery.    When the Secretary of State for War had visited Egypt some four or five weeks ago, he had found the condition of the Army so much improved that theHigh Command in Egypt were considering whether theycould not take the offensive.    Then haa come theItalian attack on Greece, and we had had to deplete our air forces in Egypt in order to support the Greeks.Five squadrons had been sent to help them, and the king of Greece, in writing to the King, had said that thisair help had constituted a decisive turning-point.Meanwhile we had taken steps to replace, from thiscountry, the aircraft sent to Greece, while Air MarshalLongmore had withdrawn to Egypt two squadrons from aden and another from the Sudan.    In consequence, the command in Egypt had felt able to proceed with their intention to take the offensive.It had been necessary to observe the greatestsecrecy in regard to this operation, and he (the PrimeMinister) had therefore only sought the approval of theDefence Committee (Operations).    General Wavell had been assured that if he cared to run the risk of undertakingoffensive operations, he would be supported by those athome, even if the operation was unsuccessful^The main British and Italian forces had, untilthree days ago, been separated by some 75 miles,although the advance parties were, of course, muchcloser.    Three days ago we had started to move uplarge forces.    It was a cause of satisfaction that wehad been able to carry out these movements without anyhindrance from the enemy.    At dawn that morning our forces had attacked.    So far, the only news received was thatwe had captured the camp at Mibiewa, some 15 miles south of Sidi Barrani, and had taken 500   prisoners,and that the enemy reaction had been slight.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR explained themain purpose of the operation in progress..^   It was intended that the 4th Indian Division, with 50 infantrytanks, should attack the 2nd Libyan Division, whichoccupied a position South of Sidi.
