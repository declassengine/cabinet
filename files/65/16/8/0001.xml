There were also some grounds for the view that Germany did not want war to spreadover the whole of the Balkans at the present time;that Germany had not yet made up her mind how to act,and that her time-table might have been disarranged.It also looked as though if Germany decided to intervene in the Balkans, she would be more likely togo through Bulgaria which was unlikely to resist,than through Yugoslavia, which would probably do so.THE PRIMS MINISTER thought that Mussolinimight have been afraid that Hitler was doing a dealwith France at his expense, and have given the order for the Italian ultimatum to Greece, contrary toHitler&apos;s wishes.      If this was so, it might be thatGermany had no counter move ready to redress theposition.     But it would be rash to draw any conclusionfavourable to ourselves.      Germany might well be medi-tating a stroke on the lines which would be mostembarrassing to us, namely, through Bulgaria to salonika.      Germany might count on inducing Bulgariato give her right of passage and   on persuadingTurkey also to stand aside.Discussion ensued as to how long it wouldtake Germany to strilce dov/n from Roumania,on to the Aegean.      It had been reported that Germany had only30,000 troops in Roumania.      Our General Staff put the figure higher, and thought that a move throughBulgaria could be operated in a matter of days,relying largely on rail transport.      It was pointedout that German troops had been established in roumania for some time, and that preparations for a rapid forward move might have been in hand for sometime,THE PRIMS MINISTER referred to telegrams nos. 1310 and 1511 to Turkey, -which set out thearguments for and against bringing Turkey into thewar at this stage.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY explained that these telegrams had been despatched after the Meeting of theWar Cabinet held on Friday, 22nd November,   when ithad been decided to invite the Turkish and YugoslavGovernments to make a joint delaration to Bulgaria.(This suggestion   now seemed unlikely to materialise,as Yugoslavia was afraid to commit herself so openly.-)At the same Meeting it had been decided to communicate to our Ambassador at Ankara, for his own information,the substance of the Chiefs of Staffs&apos; view on thequestion whether&quot; it would be to our advantage tobring Turkey into the war at this stage.

In discussion, the War Cabinet were     QCreminded that the Chiefs of Staff, after very. -careful consideration, had come to the conclusionthat the arguments on each side were nicelybalanced. . They had, however, considered that thebalance was turned by one over-riding factor, .namely, that if Turkey entered the war now weshould be sure of her alliance, whereas if Greecewas first over-run she might accede to Axisdemands without fighting at allo   It was suggested .that it would be desirable that our ambassador should be given clear and specific guidance asto the line he should take on this point,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS, while in genegal agreement with thisview, said that he^gSStty boli-eAE&amp;d. that turkey would fight if Germany attacked Bulgaria orYugoslavia or attempted to march through either of those countries.    If, however, Turkey came into the war now, this would almost certainly bringdown a German attack on the Aegean.   Was it inour interest to bring that about, if there was a chance that it might be postponed until we had had time to make fuller preparations to meet it?   Furtherhe doubted whether there tmc anything which we could dowhich would persuade Turkey to como into the war,unless and until Germany attacked, or marchedthrough5Bulgaria or Yugoslavia^At the suggestion of THE PRIME MINISTER,the War Cabinet:-Agreed that the question whetherit was to our advantage to bringTurkey into the war at this stage,and the instructions thereon to besent to our Ambassador at Angora,should be further considered by theDefence Committee (Operations) thateveningoRichmond Terrace, S.W*1*
