The Chiefs of Staffs made the following reports in amplification of the information contained in Cabinet War RoomRecords 530-533.Recently three enemy aircraft which had lost their way had landed or tried to land at aerodromes in this country. One of these machines had been captured intact with its crew.The German Air Force concentration in Roumania was probably nearly complete.Of the 19 ships in the convoy homeward bound from sierra leone attacked by a raider on the 12th February, 6 were known tohave been lost and 6 had arrived undamaged at Funchal. The fate of the other 7 was not known. The War Cabinet were informed ofthe revised convoy arrangements proposed, which would be closelywatched by the Defence Committee.Details were given of the recent operation by British para-chutists. It was not yet known what success, if any, had been achieved before our parachutists had been taken prisoner.The Greek Army had again taken the offensive in Albania,apparently with success, but so far the War Office only had officialconfirmation of the taking of 300 to 400 prisoners.93 civilians had been killed by an enemy air raid on Benghazi.The War Office and Ministry of Information should considerwhether the names of those killed should be published.Particulars were given of the progress of operations. Kismayuwas in our hands, and the enemy was holding the line of the RiverJuba.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.2. The Permanent Under Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs gave the following information : There was no definite news as to the result of the meeting between Signor Mussolini and General Franco.The Belgian Foreign Minister had been given a memorandum in the form approved by the War Cabinet. He had accepted it without protest, but had asked for more explicit assurances that wewould be prepared, at the end of the war, to give immediate help infeeding the people of Belgium.The Regent of Yugoslavia had stated that the Yugoslav PrimeMinister and Foreign Minister had had no authority to enter into any commitments with Germany. Otherwise there was no definitenews as to what had happened at the recent meeting at Berchtes-gaden.These were making slow progress. The Yugoslavs gave theimpression that they were holding back.Some 320 German &quot; tourists &quot; were reported to have arrivedat Varna.It seemed probable that the decisive voice in Greek policy was now that of the King. The new President of the Council had seen the German Minister and had stated that Greece remained faithfulto the policy of General Metaxas. . .
Iraq.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 12thConclusions,Minute 2.)3 apan.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 17thConclusions,Minute 2.)Thailand.The new Iraqi Government had indicated that they would likeus to supply them with dollar exchange. They had been told thatit was for them to make the first move, if good relations with thiscountry were to be resumed. We expected them, in the first place,to break off diplomatic relations with Italy.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had seen the Japanese Ambassador, who had indulged inlengthy protestations about the purely defensive character of hisGovernments policy. There were unconfirmed rumours of a forth-coming visit to Europe by M. Matsuoka. President Roosevelt had had a frank talk with the Japanese Ambassador in Washington.On the whole the tension in the Far East seemed to havelessened.Here also the tension was less. The Thai Prime Minister wassuggesting that we might help his country with money and material.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 12thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Minister of Home Security said that, while there hadbeen a fair amount of enemy activity during the last few days, forthe most part the casualties and damage had been light. On the night of the 15th/16th February there had been 10 persons killed and 39 injured in the Provinces, but none in London.At 10 p.m. on the 13th February one very large H.E. bomb hadbeen dropped in Hendon. Some 35 houses had been flattened and230 badly damaged. The casualties were now estimated at 75 deadand 150 seriously injured. Morale had been excellent, workersliving in damaged houses having reported at the local factory next morning as usual. No red warning had been given, as from itsdirection it had not seemed as if the enemy aircraft would attackLondon.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Communist 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the.Party. Lord President of the Council (W.P. (41) 27).   The Report recom-Proposed mended:-Control of (1) That a fresh Regulation should be passed for the controlLeaflets. of leaflets.(Previous [The Home Secretary should have discretion to reference: limit this Regulation to a period of three months in the,W.M.
