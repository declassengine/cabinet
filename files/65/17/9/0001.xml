(41) 5thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Chiefs of Staff&quot;made the following reports in amplification-cation of the information contained in Cabinet War Room Records506 to 508.The damaged cruiser of the Hipper Class was still in dry dockat Brest.Further details were given of the capture of Tobruk. Thenumber of prisoners taken was not yet known. The Italiancommunique exaggerated the size of the British forces engaged.The Prime Minister, informed the War Cabinet of certaindecisions on future military policy in the Middle East reached bythe Defence Committee (Operations) on the 20th January. ... yThe Prime Minister read the draft of a private congratulatorytelegram to General Wavell, in which he proposed to make specialmention of General Wilson, General O&apos;Connor, General Creagh andGeneral Mackay.The War Cabinet were informed that the reason why NewZealand troops had not so far participated in the fighting was thatthe New Zealand Government had expressed a wish that they shouldnot be put into the front line until they could operate as a self-contained division.On the Kassala Front the Italian retreat continued, but theItalians were fighting better than in Libya. On the morning of the21st January, about 55 miles east of Kassala, Italian cavalry hadcharged our gun positions and Brigade Headquarters, stopping only30 yards from the guns, losing 25 killed and 14 prisoners.Climatic conditions on the Continent made any attempt atinvasion unlikely during the next few weeks. It might be possibleto grant leave to the Army at Home on a more extensive scale until,say, the 15th February.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements,(ii) Invited the Minister of Information (a) Not to contradict the Italian reports exaggeratingthe strength of our forces in Libya.(b) To give publicity to the Italian cavalry charge onthe Sudan Front.(iii)Invited the Secretary of State for War to considerwhether leave on a more extended scale could be given tothe British Army at home during the next few weeks.2. The War Cabinet were reminded of their decisions regarding the future of Abyssinia taken at the meeting referred toin the margin.  These had included the following : &quot;We welcomed the reappearance of Ethiopia as anIndependent State. It might be desirable publicly to announce that we recognised the Emperor&apos;s claim to the throne, as soonas the Emperor had crossed the frontier into Abyssinia.&quot;&quot;A revived Ethiopian State would for many years needsome form of international guidance in political and economic affairs. The extinction of slavery was an important point inthis connection.&quot;These views had been conveyed to the Dominion PrimeMinisters; a telegram (No. 83) had since been received from general smuts calling our policy in question. His objections were not altogether clear, but he might perhap&apos;s be thinking of some form ofSouth African control over Abyssinia, whether by mandate or
otherwise. Again, he might be influenced by the prevailing SouthAfrican view on colour questions.In discussion the following points were made : (1) We were committed to restoring the independence of ethiopia. Any hesitation in this matter would not be tolerated by public opinion in this country, and wouldhave a deplorable effect in Africa and India.(2) It might be argued that the restoration of Abyssinia as anindependent State did not necessarily involve therestoration of Haile Selassie as Emperor. Certainly hecould not be put back on his throne against the wishes of the majority of his people. But it seemed that thegreat majority of the Abyssinian people favoured hisrestoration.(3) Nothing must be said which might weaken HaileSelassie&apos;s position now, when he was making a gallantbid for the freedom of Ethiopia.(4) General Wavell was concerned lest our commitments toHaile Selassie might hamper the freedom of action ofthe Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. This point could easily be met.The War Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their previous decision.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to send a suitable reply toGeneral Smuts, in consultation with the Secretaries ofState for Foreign Affairs and Dominion Affairs.The Balkans.Position in eventof Germaninfiltration intoBulgaria.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.).3. The Foreign Secretary gave the War Cabinet an account ofa conversation which he had had the previous day at the TurkishEmbassy, at which the representatives of Greece, Yugoslavia andthe Soviet Union had also been present.He had taken the opportunity to emphasise the danger of aGerman infiltration into Bulgaria. The representatives of yugoslavia and Turkey had undertaken to telegraph to their governments, suggesting that they should make it clear that theywould regard a German infiltration into Bulgaria in the same senseas an open invasion of that country.Reference was also made to the official statement issued atAngora to the effect that the Turkish Government were on the alertfor any threat which might arise, and that all precautions had beentaken. The statement which referred to Turkish prowess in thelast war marked some advance on any recent public expressions ofthe Turkish Governments attitude.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Man-Power.Requirements oftheJFighting and civil defence services.     :(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 1stConclusions,Minute 12.)th* tn2he ^SlSPP ^f,re ^formed, that the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for War m regard to the Army&apos;s require^-ments of man-power was nearly ready. The Minister of Labourand National Service said that the new Proclamation to registerand call up further age classes under the National Service (armed forces) Act would have to be made very soon 1The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be dealt with in thefollowing Week. t *Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 23, 1941.
