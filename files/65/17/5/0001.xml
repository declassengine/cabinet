(41) 5), and agreed as follows :-&apos;Abyssinia  .  -(1) We welcomed the reappearance of Ethiopia as an Indepen-dent State. It might be desirable publicly to announce that we recognised the Emperor&apos;s claim to the throne, assoon as the Emperor had crossed the frontier intoAbyssinia.(2) No suggestion should be made that we accepted any per-manent military commitments to a restored Abyssinia! ui-(3) While it would be desirable to obtain from Haile Selassiean undertaking not to interfere by any action in theLake Tsana district with the flow of water into the Nile,we must not appear to be pursuing territorial ambitionsin Abyssinia: for we had none. i,.&apos;.^- o(4) A revived Ethiopian State would for many years,;need&quot; some form of international guidance in political andeconomic affairs.&quot; The extinction of slaverywas- ahimportant point in this connection..Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. &apos;w 1(5) The fate of Eritrea and Italian Somaliland must be reservedfor determination at the Peace Conference after the war.(6)--If. the Italian forces in East Africa were to ask for an armistice, the terms to be granted, would have to besubmitted to the War Cabinet. There would be noobjection to General Wavell being informed that we did not exclude the&apos; possibility that we might allow
Civil Defence.Compulsorypart-time service.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 312thConclusions,Minute 1.)the Italian troops in Abyssinia, after being disarmed,to remain in these colonies, under suitable military control, for the period of the war. Such an arrange-ment would, of course, only be agreed to as part of theterms of an armistice which was to our advantage:e.a., if we were saved the trouble of a long campaign in abyssinia by the early surrender, of the Italian forces.7. The Lord President of the Council reported on his dis-cussions with the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security and other Ministers. It was proposed that two Regulations shouldbe placed before The King for approval at a meeting of the privy council to be held on the 15th January.The first Regulation would place a general obligation on menand women (subject to age limits), in areas to be denned, to under-take Civil Defence duties, out of working hours, and withoutremuneration, up to 48 hours a month. The Home Secretary wouldbe empowered to make Orders under the Regulation, for example,Orders delegating certain of his powers to the Regional Commis-sioners, and Orders setting up Tribunals to grant exemptions.The second Regulation would require occupiers of factories and commercial premises to make adequate fire-watching arrangements.The duty of employees to lend assistance in these schemes would beasserted, and would be made compulsory on men, in the absence of adequate voluntary arrangements.No interference was contemplated at present with the arrange-ment whereby fire-watching was remunerated in certain cases,sometimes at very high rates. But at a later stage it would benecessary to review certain of the existing arrangements which, ifunchecked, would have a harmful effect on other Civil defence services.The War Cabinet-(1) Gave a general approval to the above proposals.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of home security to make a public announcement of the scheme,after the Regulations had been approved by His majesty in Council.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to examine thedesirability of a scheme whereby, when an employer wasconvicted of negligence in fire prevention, the Courtfurnished a certificate to this effect, and it was open tothe Tribunal awarding war damage to make an abate-ment on this account from the sum which would otherwise have been awarded.The press the daily worker.(previous reference:W.M, (40) 310thConclusions,Minute ll.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary on the Daily Worker (W.P. (41) 7).The discussion and the Conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.-Great George Street, S.W.1,January 13, 1941.
