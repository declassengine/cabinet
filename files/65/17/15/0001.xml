According to our latest information, Marshal P^tain was still resisting the german pressure. ,The Foreign Secretary had had an interesting talk withMonsieur Benes.

(41) 28).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that this ship,normally a cargo liner, had been taken over by the Japanese Goyern-ment, who were sending her to Lisbon in order to collect machineryof great value to the Japanese Navy. The Japanese Governmenthad asked that the ship should be protected. From the point ofview of economic warfare all the arguments were in favour of the interception of this ship. The Chiefs of Staff (with whom thismatter had been discussed) thought that the Japanese might betrying to create an incident by the despatch of this ship, knowingthat its interception would raise the type of case from which weshould get the least sympathy from the United States. He suggestedthat before coming to a decision he should telegraph to Lord Halifaxand ask him to find out what President Roosevelt&apos;s attitude wouldbe, and whether he would consider it justifiable to take the risk ofwar implicit in any attempt to subject the A saka Maru to a contra-band control. At the same time he would instruct Sir robert craigie merely to inform the Japanese Government that we couldnot undertake any responsibility for the ship&apos;s safety. He wouldalso endeavour to ascertain the nature of the cargo which the A sakaMaru intended to take on board at Lisbon.1 The Minister of Economic Warfare said that he agreed withthe course proposed by the Foreign Secretary. From the point ofview of contraband control he emphasised there was ho case for not stopping the ship.The Prime Minister said that it was important to ascertain the nature of the cargo which the ship proposed to take oh board at Lisbon.The War Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State forForeign AMirs should take action as at   A   above.     .

(G.) (41) 19,Theatres: 16 and 18 respectively). -Cinemas. -The Home Secretary said that the present system of localoption, as modified by Defence Regulation 42B, enabled localauthorities to obtain Orders for the Sunday opening of cinemas on receipt of a certificate from the military authorities, without taking a poll of the electors. The system had &quot;worked fairly well. In onlya &apos;few cases had the local authorities not agreed to open Ginemaswhere the military authorities wanted this done. It would be unwise to abolish local control, but the present system might be amended to cover the interests of industrial workers as well as ofthe troops.The Minister of Labour and National Service favoured dealingwith the matter on a national basis, so far as concerned Englandand Wales. Sunday opening of theatres should be allowed in all areas where a certificate was given by the military authority or bythe Area: Board, irrespective of the views of the local authority.The Sunday opening of cinemas was urgently required for the largenumbers of people who were away from their homes. Many of thelocal, authorities imposed pettifogging restrictions.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, while therewas much to be said for the Minister of Labour&apos;s point of view, it involved certain political difficulties and that the Home Secretary&apos;proposal should be adopted.Theatres. The War Cabinet agreed that there: was a strong case fortreating theatres on broadly the same grounds as cinemas.Should local authorities in future have power to agree to the sunday opening of cinemas, but not of theatres; or must they allow the opening of both or neither ? The general view was that it wouldbe wiser to give the local authorities power to differentiate betweencinemas and theatres if they so decided, since otherwise there wasa risk that certain local authorities, which would otherwise agreeto open cinemas, would refuse to open both cinemas and theatres.The Home Secretary pointed out that it would not be possibleto distinguish between theatres and music halls in this connection.The War Cabinet&apos;s decisions were as follows :-     -(1) Cinemas. The principle of local option should be retained,but steps should be taken to secure that, full and proper use was made by the local authorities of their option :-(a) by amending Defence Regulation 42B so as to cover the interests of workers as well as of troops;(b) by Home Office CirculartoLocal Authorities, calling attention to the advantages of the Sunday opening in proper cases, and the importance pfavoiding all unreasonably restrictive conditions.(2) Theatres.-A   Defence   Regulation   should   be   made,providing  that  local authorities,  on receipt of a
certificate from the competent military or &quot;industrialauthority, may make Orders permitting theatres to beopen on Sundays. This Defence Regulation should beso drafted as to enable a local authority to differentiatein this matter between cinemas and theatres; but theGovernment spokesman, in presenting the case, shouldurge strongly that theatres should be treated on the same basis as cinemas in this matter.(3) Theatres should not be called upon to make a contributionto charity in respect of Sunday performances.(4) The amending Regulation referred to in (1) (a) and the regulation referred to in (2) should each contain aprovision deferring the date of operation, so as to giveParliament an opportunity - of praying against the changes proposed before they became operative^&quot;(5) These Conclusions should apply to England and Wales. no alteration of the law in Scotland was contemplated.Parliament. .8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMembers of Lord President of the Council (W.P. (G.) (41) 9) proposing anParliament and amendment of the statutory provision whereby holders of certainoffices under the offices under the Crown were disqualified from being elected orCrown. sitting or voting in the House of Commons, to enable Members ofthe House of Commons to be appointed to posts in connection withour war effort.After a short discussion the War Cabinet (1) Agreed to the introduction of a Bill to give effect to theproposal set out in the Lord Presidents Memorandum.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider an amendment of the Order in Council governing theParliamentary candidature of Civil Servants, on thegeneral lines of the practice now in force in the FightingServices.Great George Street, S.W. 1,February 10, 1941.

The Meeting was held to consider whether the Whipsshould he put on when the Defence Regulation for enablingtheatres and music-halls to he opened on Sunday came before the House in the following week.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had been suggestedthat a Whip might be sent out to secure an adequateattendance, but that it might be made clear that theGovernment did not wish any Member who had strong convictions on grounds of conscience or religious scruples, to doviolence to those eonviefciona;THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had been approached by many Members who wanted the matter left to a free vote ofthe House.THE CHIEF WHIP said that 66 names had been handed in with the prayer against the Resolution.    j% looked as though, on a free vote, the issue might be close.THE HOME SECRETARY was hopeful that the regulation would be carried on a free vote.    The risk ofa defeat could be taken, since the consequences of defeaton a free vote were not very serious.In discussion it became clear that the general view of Ministers was in favour of this matter being leftto a free vote in the House,    It was, of course, understoodthat no Minister or Junior Minister should vote againstthe Regulation, although one or two Ministers might beabsent from the House on other business.The Chief Whip was asked to take steps toensure as many speakers in favour of the Regulation asagainst it.      It would be an advantage if some of theService Members of the House were to speak in support of it.It was also agreed that when the Business of theHouse for the following week was announced on the following day, a statement should be made that this matter would beleft to a free vote of the House.    It was also suggestedthat the best day to take the Regulation would be thefollowing Tuesday.Great George Street, S.W. 126th March, 1941.
