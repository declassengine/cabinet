Anglo-japanese relations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)our war purpose was the eradication of Hitlerism from Europe,that we had run great risks for this cause, and that our purpose would be pursued.The War Cabinet were informed that Sir Robert Craigie had had a conversation with Mr. Matsuoka. Some of Mr. Matsuoka&apos;observations had been contentious (for example, his attack on the lease-and-Lend Bill), but on the whole the interview had been reasonably satisfactory.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed by thePrime Minister.Far East.Anglo-Dutchco-operation inthe event ofJapaneseaggression.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 14thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that, in a conversation with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, the Dutch Minister had enquired whether ourreluctance to give a specific guarantee of the territorial integrity ofthe Netherlands East Indies was to be attributed to a desire to consult the United States before answering.The Prime Minister said that it was, in fact, important toobtain President Roosevelt&apos;s advice on the suggested plan for mutual Anglo-Dutch help in the event of Japanese aggression in theFar East. The point should be put to the President as soon as the lease-and-Lend Bill was out of the way.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed.United States ofAmerica.Financing of contracts.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 5thConclusions,Minute 4.)Comparativetaxation.6. The Prime Minister said that he had received a personal telegram from Lord Halifax stating that it was of the utmost importance that we should without delay hand over to America ourremaining financial resources in that country. We should have to resign ourselves to meeting American wishes. A few weeks ago hehad doubted the wisdom of this course; but he no longer did so,since it was clear that we should receive from America far morethan we could possibly give. He proposed, however, to send aprivate telegram to the President, asking him to ensure that oursecurities were not taken over at knock-down prices.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this matter con-cerned the direct investments owned in the United States by theInsurance Companies and such firms as Courtaulds. Unless the transaction was very carefully handled, we might lose large sums.Sir Walter Peacock and others were already in the United Statesendeavouring to arrange for an orderly liquidation. But there wasa fringe of people in America who hoped to make sums of moneyout of the transaction. Lord Halifax, Mr. Purvis, and Sir F.Phillips all held that we must do what was asked, and he feared thatwe had no alternative in the matter.In reply to a question by the Minister of Labour and NationalService, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the United states authorities had refused a suggestion that they should take over ourassets in the United States of America and administer them on thelines applied to enemy property.The War Cabinet were informed that the United StatesGovernment were considering imposing increased taxation.Mr. Hopkins had telegraphed for full details of our taxation.These would be sent to him. The fact that the Americans wereimposing additional taxation made it all the more necessary that weshould show that we were willing to make sacrifices.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements, -

The Prime Minister said that he had received satisfactoryaccounts of the conversations with United States defence expertsnow in progress in Washington.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.foreign information.France.(previous reference:W.M.

The Permanent UndersecretaryAffairs gave the following information:of State for ForeignAffairs gave tne tollowmg mtormation: The general impression of the position at Vichy was unfavourable.   Admiral Darlan was gradually planting hiskey positions, while Marshal Petain&apos;s supporterssqueezed out.men inwerethebeingGeneral Weygand&apos;s position in North Africa seemed to be lessstrong. There were signs of German infiltration into North Africa,e.g., in the form of Inspection Commissions.General Aranda had stated that, at the meeting betweenSignor Mussolini and General Franco, the former had made anabject appeal for help, which the latter had refused. Herr hitler had not been present.The meeting between Marshal Petain and General Franco hadbeen one of courtesy only.One account of the meeting at Berchtesgaden was that theGerman representatives had been studiously polite to the YugoslavMinisters. They had pressed them to adhere to the &quot; new order,&quot;but had not demanded the right of passage for German troops or threatened Yugoslavia^ territorial integrity. They had spoken ofa great air and submarine offensive against this country, but had said nothing of invasion.The question was raised whether &quot;new order&quot; accuratelyrepresented the German phrase.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Mediterranean.Proposal thatmerchant ships should be sunkat sight incertain areas.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 13thConclusions,Minute 3.)9.   The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals in the Memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (W.P.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (41) 33). The Memorandumrecounted the occasions on which the Spanish Government had shown laxity in applying against enemy submarines the generally accepted principles of International Law. Authority was asked forthe Navy to continue the chase of submarines into the territorial waters of Spanish Morocco, Tangier or the Canaries, but not of metropolitan Spain or the Balearics. The attack might not becontinued after the submarine had entered a Spanish port.The War Cabinet approved the issue of instructions on thelines proposed.Africa. 11.

The Permanent Undersecretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the possibility of raising a force of Free Italianswas being examined, and a Report was almost ready.It was pointed out that the organisation of such a force wouldbe facilitated if the administration of the occupied territories in africa was undertaken by the War Office (see preceding Minute).The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Far East. 13.
