(39) 92ndConclusions,Minute 3.)MilitaryOperations.italian somaliland.1. The Chiefs of Staff made the following reports in amplification of the information contained in Cabinet War RoomRecords 541-543.On the previous night 145 aircraft had attacked industrial targets at Cologne and the invasion ports. Manchester bombers hadbeen used over Germany for the first time. 150 fires had been observed in Cologne.On the 26th February Luqa aerodrome (Malta) had been attacked by about 60 German bombers, escorted by 20 to 30 fighters.The losses on the two sides had been : Enemy losses 9 certain.12 probable.1 damaged.Our losses 3 destroyed in the air.7 destroyed on the ground.3 badly damaged.3 slightly damaged.We had sustained heavy losses in an attack on an outward-bound convoy by submarines and aircraft, between 240 and 300 miles off Bloody Foreland. Four vessels, totalling 10,000 tons, had been sunk for certain. Nine other vessels, totalling 61,000 tons, had beeneither sunk or damaged to a greater or less degree.The Prime Minister said that the highest possible priority mustbe given to the measures necessary to deal with the double menace toour shipping constituted by submarines and Focke Wulfe aircraft,acting in combination. Our effort against this renewed dangermust, for the moment, be our supreme exertion.Details were given of the action in hand to counter the enemy attacks on our shipping and to increase our imports.We had occupied Kasteloritzo Island at dawn on the25th February. Our occupying forces had met with slightresistance only.H.M.S. Leander had intercepted an Italian ship which had sailed from Massawa. This vessel had first displayed Britishcolours, but, on being ordered to stop, had displayed Italian coloursand opened fire. Soon she had hauled down her colours and scuttledherself.The Prime Minister recalled the procedure ordered by theAdmiralty in November 1939 to deter scuttling. Steps should betaken to make it known that, if a ship were scuttled, the crew wouldbe left to their fate.We had captured Mogadishu. In the advance from Jumbo toMogadishu we had captured several thousand prisoners and muchwar material.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to reissue, if need be in stronger form, the orders previously issued to deter enemy crews from scuttling their ships.[22267]
The balkans and theMiddle East.Future military policy. .^previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Balkans.The Italo-YugoslavFrontier.2.   A further discussion took place, a record of which is;contained in the Secretary&apos;s  Standard File of War  cabinet conclusions.3.   After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Invited the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to circulate to the War Cabinet a Memorandum on asuggestion made by our Ambassador in Moscow, that we might indicate to Yugoslavia that we were disposed to lookfavourably on her claims for frontier rectification with italy.double summer-Time.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 277thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary on the question whether summer-time should beextended during the summer months bv a further hour(W.P. (G.) (41) 25).In discussion it was urged that an extension of summer-time during the summer months by a further hour would be of great assistance to transport, particularly in the marshalling yards andin the ports. It would also facilitate the working of two full shiftsin industry outside black-out hours.The proposal would, however, be strongly resented by farmers,and, it was claimed, would have great disadvantages for agriculture.The resultant difficulties for milk distribution could probably be overcome by an alteration of transport arrangements. But withdouble summer-time the dew would not be dry until 12 noon by theclock. This would mean, either a loss of man-hours, or else very longhours and overtime.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had consulted the National Farmers&apos; Union of Scotland and the Farm Servants&apos;Union. While they disliked the scheme, he had obtained assurances that they would work it if it was introduced.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the advantages of the proposal from the point of view of industry and transportoutbalanced the disadvantages for agriculture, which could be mitigated by appropriate adjustments. Further, the position couldbe eased if double summer-time was brought to an end on the8th August, i.e., before the harvest. Nevertheless, the announcementof this decision should be accompanied by a suitable explanation.The War Cabinet-Agreed that summer-time should be extended for a furtherhour during the period from approximately 1st May to the8th August, and invited the Home Secretary to take thenecessary steps to give effect to this decision.
Agriculture. 5.   The Lord Privy Seal said that, at a Meeting of the FoodMan-Power Policy Committee that morning, it had been explained that 3,000Requirements, to 5,000 more men were urgently required for the increased foodproduction campaign authorised by the War Cabinet in the autumn,particularly for work in mobile gangs. The Minister of Labour hadbeen unable to provide the men required, and it had been suggestedthat men from the Military Pioneer Corps should be made available.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to preside over a Meeting ofthe Ministers concerned to discuss this proposal.Home Defence. 6. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the LordPrenaratiom President of the Council and the Minister of InformationagaLt (W.P. (41) 41 and 43).invasion. The Lord President of the Council explained that the generalEvacuation of effect of the scheme outlined in his Paper was to start at onceCoastal Areas, thinning out the civil population in the towns, in the coastal strip(Previous between Great Yarmouth and Littlehampton on the lines adoptedReference: last summer; and to hold in readiness a scheme for the evacuationW.M. (40) 245th Qf the rest of the population. The thinning-out process should notConclusions, be applied to the rural areas, and persons engaged in agricultureMinute 7.)        should not be urged to leave.The scheme would involve great hardships, and it should not beput into operation unless it was urgently necessary. This was understood to be the view of the military authorities.A particularly difficult problem was presented by the towns inthe Brighton group (Brighton, Hove, Worthing and Littlehampton).It was proposed in these towns, before making any attempt to thinout the resident population, to put restrictions on visitors and tointroduce a scheme for the voluntary evacuation of local school-children.The Prime Minister said that, if invasion came, those in the invasion area would undergo a terrible ordeal, and it was thereforeright to start thinning out from the towns in this coastal zone.Some distinction, however, should be drawn between those with tiesin these districts and temporary residents. While a beginningshould be made now with thinning out these areas, it was undesirable to exercise too great pressure at this stage. It was reasonable to assume that there would be some warning of invasion;and when this stage was reached, greater pressure should be broughtto bear.The Prime Minister thought that Military Officers should beasked by the Regional Commissioners to visit those living in thesetowns and explain to them what the position would be in the eventof invasion. They should make it clear that those who stayed behindwould not be allowed to clog the roads by attempting to leave atthe last moment.The War Cabinet Adopted the recommendations in paragraph 7 of the lord presidents Report-appended to these Minutes as an appendix in the light of the discussion which had takenplace.
Oil DenialScheme.Miri (Sarawak)and Seria(Brunei).X&quot;7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies, explaining the arrangements atpresent authorised for setting in force the Oil Denial Scheme(W.P. (41) 42).The Secretary of State for the Colonies raised the question ofparallel action in the Dutch part of Borneo and elsewhere in theNetherlands East Indies. It would be relatively little use ourputting our wells out of action unless the Dutch did the same. Hethought that the effective decision by the Dutch would probably rest with authorities in the Ear East and not with the netherlands government in this country. He suggested, therefore, that theCommander-in-Chief in the Far East should make contact with the heads of the Dutch Colonial Administration in the East Indies.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) That.the Colonial Secretary should obtain the authority ofthe Prime Minister for putting the denial scheme intoforce, without further consultation with them, when thetime came.(2) That the attention of the Chiefs of Staff should be drawn to the point at &quot;X&quot; for such action as might benecessary.Great George Street, S.W. 1,February 27, 1941.
APPENDIX.Evacuation of Coastal Areas.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.(W.P. (41) 41).   (See Minute 6.)jfc jfe jt. 4t. -v. Ji-*7r &quot;7C&quot; *n* tv &quot;vv tpRecommendations.7. I therefore submit, for consideration by the War Cabinet, the following recommendations: (a) Intensive local publicity should at once be undertaken, on the linesadopted last year, with a view to inducing persons not engaged inuseful work to leave the towns set out in the two Appendices to thismemorandum.(&amp;) The Departments should prepare plans for carrying out, if opportunity offers when invasion is imminent, the compulsory evacuation of thosestill remaining in those towns (less the workers needed to assist themilitary in maintaining essential local services).(c) Departments should also prepare emergency plans for the removal of refugees who decline to &apos;&apos; stay put&apos;&apos; in these areas.id) No attempt should be made to induce residents to leave their homes in the rural parts of the coastal belt from the Wash to Littlehampton. Nofacilities (i.e., railway fares or billeting allowances) should be givento persons resident in those rural areas who desire to leave their homes.(e) A scheme for the voluntary evacuation of local schoolchildren from townsin the Brighton group should at once be put into operation; and thosetowns should be made subject to the same restrictions as regardsvisitors as already apply to coastal towns from Great Yarmouth toNewhaven.Arrangements should be made to enable an estimate to be formedof the flow of residents away from this area and, when the evacuation of the local schoolchildren has been carried out, further consideration should be given to the practicability of taking additional measures tothin out the adult population in these towns.
