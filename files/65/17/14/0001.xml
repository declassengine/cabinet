(41) 22) giving the results of his examination ofour precautionary measures against gas attack.The Lord Privy Seal said that the general position was satisfactory, and the measures which he had mentioned in his report had   either been taken or were being actively pursued. Animportant point, however, arose in regard to anti-gas personnel.He thought that anti-gas work should have as high a priority asthat of the fighting services. :--The Minister of: Home Security said that this proposal wasconnected with the Bill now in course of preparation, whereby a proportion of the man power called up under the National Service(Armed Forces) Act would be available for the Civil defence services.The War Cabinet-*Approved the Report of the Lord Privy Seal(W.P.

(41) 24).After a preliminary discussion the War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty to discuss the matter, as a preliminary to discussion by the Defence Committee(Operations) at an early date.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (41) 23) covering the draft of the essential clause of the projected Agreement, whichhad been accepted in principle both by the representatives of new foundland and the Colonies and by the United States repre-sentatives, subject to the approval of Washington.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theonly part of this clause which presented difficulty was the last sentence, which read as follows : &apos;&apos; In the practical application of the foregoing paragraphsthere shall, as occasion requires, be consultation between theGovernments concerned.&quot;This sentence was the most which be had been able to persuade the United States negotiators to accept. From our point of view,and from that of the Colonies and Newfoundland, an undertaking that difficult questions arising from time to time should be settled by common agreement would have been more acceptable. Such anundertaking had been contemplated in the Lothian Note. However,the arrangement now proposed ought to be workable. It was hard to imagine any dispute arising over the bases which could not besettled in a spirit of goodwill in direct negotiation between Londonand Washington, assuming that attempts to settle it locally had failed.The United States negotiators had made it plain that they hadno authority to discuss Defence questions, including the system of command in the areas affected; they had suggested that these mightbe reserved for examination at a later date in staff conversations.The Dominions Secretary handed round the following formula which had been drafted to meet the difficulties of the United Statesnegotiators : It is recognised that the Defence of the Leased Areas andthe Territories in which they lie is of mutual interest andconcern to the United States&apos; and His Majesty&apos;s Government,and questions of mutual defence shall be the subject of agree-ment between the two parties, due regard being given to theposition of the Governors of the Territories as representativesof His Majesty. When the United States is engaged in war&apos; or in time of other emergency, it shall have all such rights in the territory and the surrounding waters and air spaces asmay be necessary for conducting military operations.It was understood thatthe United States negotiators would accept this formula. The Colonies and Newfoundland had not yetbeen consulted, but would also probably accept it reluctantly.In discussion it was urged that the formula was one-sided.While it gave the United States, when they were at war or in astate of emergency, rights in British territories, there was no corresponding provision giving us the right to use American baseswhen we were at war. Again, the word &quot;facilities&quot; would bemore acceptable to us than the word &quot; rights &apos;&apos; in the last sentence,
although there was no difference of substance between the two intime of war. The draft had, however, been shown to the Americannegotiators, and it would therefore not be wise to suggest an alteration at this stage.The Prime Minister thought that the formula was in substanceunobjectionable and could fairly be accepted. The United states had now openly espoused our cause, and had virtually promised usfinancial help of incalculable value. We must do what we Could tomeet American difficulties. The last sentence could operate in oneof three sets of circumstances (a) War between the United States and ourselves.   This Wasunthinkable.(b) A state in which we were both at war on the same side.We should then gladly give them what they wanted.(c) A state in which they were at war and we were neutral. Insuch a position the United States would not antagoniseus by unreasonable demands. They would be anxious towin our favour, just as were now anxious to win theirs.He attached great importance to the conception of Sovereignty,from the point of view that there must be no suggestion that theWest Indian peoples were being driven out of the British Empire orcompelled to become American citizens. But on all points bearing on this aspect of the matter the United States negotiators had met us.The War Cabinet accepted (i) The clause annexed to W.P. (41) 23.(ii) The formula at &quot; A &quot; above.Home Defence. 6.
