One of our Spitfires was missing.The Hipper class cruiser was still in dock at Brest.On the 30th January enemy aircraft had dropped bombs andmines in the Suez Canal.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information : Morocco.The United States Government were showing signs of taking an independent line about the supply of food-stuffs toMorocco. We had taken the line that we were reluctant toagree to any imports into Morocco without some correspondingsign of goodwill. The Washington authorities said that it had become a point of American policy to see that North Africadid not disintegrate and that a measure of trade was necessaryto this end. (Washington telegram No. 361, Arfar.) our ambassador in Washington would do all he could to securethat British and American policy in Morocco kept in step.Tangier. . &apos;The Foreign Secretary.was in favour of making ihebestterms obtainable with Spain as early as possible. He wascirculating a; Memorandum which he hoped the Cabinet would consider on the following day.Iraq. .       ^The resignation of the Iraqi Government under Rashid Aliwas not to be regretted.&apos; The Government under Whithall wasnot very satisfactory, but might be only a stop-gap.
(previous reference:W.M. (40) 309thConclusions,Minute 7.)Vichy-German negotiations.We had no definite news as to the points on which marshal petain was being pressed by the Germans, but it was stronglyrumoured that Bizerta was among them.Admiral Darlan was reported to be still hostile towards this country.The War Cabinet took note of this information.The Balkans.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 11thConclusions,Minute 2.)Italian EastAfrica.Abyssinia.Attitude towardsthe EmperorHaile Selassie.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 11thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Prime Minister made a statement which is recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The Foreign Secretary said that General Smuts had now accepted the revised draft agreed at the last meeting of the WarCabinet. The statement defining the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards the Emperor Haile Selassie would be issued onthe following day.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the above statement.(2) Decided that it would be premature to recognise Abyssiniaas an Ally of this country. For this reason it was alsoundesirable that the Abyssinian National Anthem shouldbe included among the Allied National Anthems playedin certain B.B.C. programmes.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M.

The Minister of Home Security said that the casualtiessuffered as a result of the day raid on the 30th January had beenthe heaviest daylight casualties in London since the 25th October.In reply to a question the Minister said that the public shelterposition had been steadily improving and that there was now littlepublic criticism.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.6. The War Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(W.P. (41) 9) covering an Aide-Memoire for the use of our repre-sentatives in the discussions now proceeding with the United states delegation.The Minister without Portfolio said that a meeting of ministers held that morning had agreed to recommend to the War Cabinetthat the Aide-Memoire should be used as a basis of discussion.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he favoured the use of the Aide-Memoire as a basis for discussion, although herather doubted whether the United States would accept the arrange-ments proposed.
The Prime Minister said that our policy was to give the UnitedStates all the accommodation they required in the oases for theirown safety. In return we should expect the United States not tointerfere with our sovereign rights.The importance was emphasised of our retaining command in newfoundland.The War Cabinet^-(a) Authorised our representatives in the discussions now pro-ceeding to discuss the question of command in the leasedbases, on the basis of the Aide-Memoire (excludingparagraph 7).(b) Agreed that the Departments concerned should consult together in the preparation of any document on thissubject which it might be desired to hand to theAmerican representatives.The Far Bast. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the burma-Yunnan  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of StateEailway Project. for Burma (W.P. (41) 19) about the construction of a railwayconnecting Burma with the Chinese province of Yunnan.T.he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theChinese Government were very keen on the construction of this railway and saw in it an essential means for the conveyance of heavy goods and armaments from the outside world now that otherchannels of communication had been closed by the Japanese. Itwas proposed to inform the Chinese Government that we wereprepared to provide the finance for the construction of the sectionm Burma, provided that the Chinese Government were willing to:(i) agree to a delimitation of a frontier satisfactory to theGovernment of Burma;(ii) undertake the construction as soon as possible of the sectionof the line from the Burma, frontier to Kunming out oftheir own resources or out of dollar credits available toX &quot; I them in the United States;(iii) provide any rails and bringing materials which have tobe financed in dollars for the Burma section in returnfor an appropriate share of future profits, or for thesupply of an equivalent amount of material from british sources when supplies are available.The Secretary of State for Burma, said that in order to avoidconstitutional difficulties he would like to acquaint the BurmaGovernment of the fact that the project had been approved beforethe Chinese Government were informed.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the proposal as at &quot;X&quot; above; and(6) Requested the Secretary of State for Burma to inform theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs as soon as thedecision had been made known to the Burma Govern-ment.Food.MilkDistribution.&apos; 8. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the FoodPolicy Committee on Milk Distribution (W.P. (G) (41,) 14).The Lord Privy Seal explained that the Food Policy Committeehad decided that the Perry Report (which proposed that the allow-ance to milk distributors for expenses and profits should be reduced
to 8d. per gallon throughout the country as from the 1st April,1941) was too drastic. , The Committee had therefore recommended compromise scheme, put forward by the Minister of Food.The Minister of Food said that, while the present system of milk distribution was wasteful, it would be difficult to reorganiseit during the war. If the Perry Report was adopted in full, the saving would only be Ad. per week per family. Further, the milkdistributors had been very successful in avoiding interruption inthe daily delivery of milk notwithstanding air attack. It would bea great pity to lose their goodwill at the present time. His presenttask was to ensure proper feeding in war time. He had accordinglyput forward the compromise scheme, summarised in paragraph 4 of w.P. (G) (41) 14. An essential feature of this scheme was towithdraw the minimum retail price as from the 1st April, so thatcompetition would operate. This might put a number of the smallerfirms out of business, but there would be no interruption in supply,and more efficient working would be likely to result.In discussion, it was urged that there was no really satisfactoryhalf-way house between leaving the present position broadly as it stood and a root-and-branch reorganisation of the milk industry,which should make proper provision for compensating thosedisplaced. It was also argued that it was undesirable to proceedwith the scheme proposed, since labour difficulties might make it essential to bring about big changes in the milk industry in the nearfuture.The general view of the War Cabinet was against proceeding with the compromise scheme proposed by the Minister which,admittedly, would not confer any very material benefits on thepublic. That scheme had, in fact, been put forward largely because it was thought desirable to take some action to meet criticism inregard to the milk industry. It was not thought that there wouldbe any difficulty in continuing broadly on the present basis.The War Cabinet-Decided against the adoption of the proposals set out inparagraph 4 of the Report by the Food Policy Committee(W.P. (G) (41) 14), and invited that Committee to give further consideration to the position.Great George Street, S,W. 1,February 3, 1941.
