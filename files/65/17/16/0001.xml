Parliament. The War Cabinet had before them a draft of the House ofMembers of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Bill (H.P.C. (41)Parliament and 20), together with the Minutes of a &quot;Meeting of the Home PolicyOffices under   Committee at which the draft had been considered on the previousthe Crown.       day.(Previous Lord Privy Seal explained that the view had been expressedEeference: that t^e would be strongly criticised in the House, unless itW.M. (41) 15thwas amended so as to provide some effective form of control by theConclusions,    House of Commons.   Thus, the Bill might.be amended to makeMinute 8.)      prevention   of   disqualification   dependent   on   an   affirmative resolution of the House of Commons.A second draft of the Bill, on these lines, was handed roundduring the Meeting.The main arguments used against the first draft of the Bill(as presented to the Home Policy Committee) were as follows: (1) While legislation was necessary, a Bill which gave theAdministration power, by a certificate of the Treasury,to enable persons to remain Members of the House ofCommons and to hold offices of profit, would be open to criticism. Under these powers, the Government couldstifle the criticism, and the House of Commons wouldhave no effective remedy.(2) Although good arguments could be brought forward infavour of enabling Members of Parliament to beemployed for purposes connected with the prosecution of the war, these arguments might not carry much weightif the temper of the House was unfriendly to the Bill.(3) It was a long-standing tradition that express Parliamentaryauthority was needed before Members of the House ofCommons could hold posts in the Executive withoutvacating their seats.(4) The holders of offices of profit who now sat in the Houseof Commons were answerable to the House for thedischarge of the duties of these posts. But the samewould not be true in regard to Members of Parliamentappointed to relatively subordinate posts in theExecutive.The case in favour of proceeding with legislation on the linesof the earlier draft was as follows : (i) There was an older tradition, before the &quot; Statute ofAnne,&quot; whereby Parliament had contained many personswho were actively engaged as servants or agents of theExecutive.(ii) Burke&apos;s reforms had been directed against a state ofaffairs in which the Crown had sought to extend itsfollowing in the House of Commons by the creation ofnew offices. It would be absurd to suggest that thepresent Bill could be inspired by a desire to obtain morepower for a Government which comprised representa-tives of all the main political parties.(iii) Many breaches had already been made in the principlethat Members of Parliament should not be appointedto new offices of profit.  For example :-- (a) Persons serving in the Fighting Services had been permitted to continue as Members of Parliament.(This, of course, was with long tradition behind it.)(&amp;) On the outbreak of war an Act had been passedenabling Members of Parliament to be appointed as Regional Commissioners.
(c) There were the recent appointments of Sir samuel hoare and Sir Stafford Cripps as BritishAmbassadors in Madrid and Moscow respectively,the former as a &quot; Special Envoy.&quot;(iv) It would be perfectly possible to make further breaches bya process tantamount to evasion. Thus, Mr. MacDonaldmight have been appointed, not High Commissioner tothe Dominion of Canada, but as a Special Envoy.Several Members of Parliament had been appointed to&quot;advisory posts&quot; which were not &quot;new offices.&quot;Again, there was no clearly marked line between Militaryand Civil appointments in certain Departments.(v) If the Government wished to stifle criticism, it already hadthe power by Defence Regulation to treat additionalParliamentary Secretaries ad lib.(vi) It was much franker and better to come to the House ofCommons with a straightforward Bill to regularise thepast doubtful cases and to provide machinery whereby the House would in future be acquainted with the truefacts.(vii) But the House must retain some measure of control overthe position. The procedure of Affirmative Resolution,proposed in the revised draft Bill, did not meet with approval. The procedure of Negative Resolution wasthen considered and rejected in favour of a proposal that the Bill should confer powers for one year only,and should be re-enacted annually during the war.These arguments were considered to be conclusive in favour of proceeding with a Bill on the lines of the earlier draft, but con-ferring powers renewable annually.When the Bill was introduced, the question might be raised whether a Member of Parliament, appointed to an office of profit,would draw the pay of that office as well as his Parliamentary pay.It was believed that in the cases in which the existing law mighthave been infringed, no pay was drawn. M.P.&apos;s serving with theforces, however, could draw pay in both capacities. The matter could not be settled by any general rule.&quot;The War Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed the Conclusions reached at their previous meeting, that a Bill should be introduced to give general effect to the proposals set out in the Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council (W.P. (G.) (41) 9),.subject to the Bill conferring powers for one year only,and requiring to be renewed annually, with a savingclause for those appointed to offices before the Act&apos;sexpiry.(2) Asked that a further revised draft of the Bill, on the lines proposed, should be submitted to the Meeting of theWar Cabinet to be held on the following day.Great George Street, S.W. 1,February 12; 1941.
