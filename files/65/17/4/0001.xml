Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Germany..Middle East.naval operations.1. The Service Ministers gave the following reports in amplification of the information contained in Cabinet War RoomRecords Nos. 492-494 : Fifty-eight British bombers had operated over Germany theprevious night, m spite of unfavourable weather conditions. All had returned safely, and the results reported were good. Severe fires hadbeen caused at Wilhelmshaven and Emden. At Wilhelmshaven theTtrfxtz had been straddled. &apos;R.A.F. Headquarters in the Middle East had received anunconfirmed report that Gazala, some 30 miles West of Tobruk,had been abandoned by the enemy. Twenty-three S. 79&apos;s and12 C.R. 42&apos;s were mentioned in this report as burnt out and abandoned on two landing grounds in the vicinity.Enemy attacks on our shipping had been on a greatly reduced scale, partly, no doubt, owing to wintry weather, but partly owingto the development of our protective measures.The disabled Empire Mariner had arrived in a home port.Emf ire Thunder had been torpedoed and sunk. An unknown ship had signalled the previous morning that she was being attacked200 miles West-North-West of Bloody Foreland. It was thoughtthat she had probably been bombed by a Focke Wulf Condor.Vessels had been despatched to the rescue.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.foreign information.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information: (1) The Dodecanese Negotiations. -The Turks had alarmedthe Greeks by making extensive claims. The best plan was probably to let the negotiations drop.(2) United States Bases. The United States Government had agreed reluctantly that the negotiations should takeplace in this country.(3) Increased military assistance to Greece. This had beendiscussed at a Meeting of the Defence Committee theprevious night.(4) Tangier. The International Zone. Senor Suner was absent from Madrid. The negotiations were progressingslowly but well.(5) Vichy France.-Particulars were given of information received from recent contacts.The War Cabinet took note of this information.[22113]b 2
Blockade. 3.   The First Lord of the Admiralty asked the War CabinetFrance. to decide on the disposal of the four French merchant ships inter-(PreviouB cepted off the Spanish Moroccan coast and now held at Gibraltar.reference: The ships were : W.M. (41) 2nd The Chantilly (9,986 tons), a passenger vessel with aboutConclusions, 500 passengers on board (of whom about 300 were FrenchMinute 2.) Service personnel) and a mixed cargo, including cocoa, palm oil,gum and rubber.The Sally Maersk (3,252 tons, ex Danish, allocated toFrance), with a similar mixed cargo.The Octane (1,950 tons), the Suroit (500 tons), tankers in ballast.We could *(a) Release all four ships after removing all articles of contraband; or(b) Seize all the ships; or .(c) Seize the Chantilly on the ground of resistance to searchand/or carriage of contraband, and the Sally Maersk forcarriage of contraband, but release the two tankers.The following were the main points in discussion : (1) The Minister of Economic Warfare said it was important to make an example by seizing the vessels, and not merelyremoving all articles of contraband. For some time pastour blockade of unoccupied France had been practicallyin abeyance, and much material had got through toGermany. An increasing volume of trade was passingup the West African coast into France, and there were indications of the beginning of a French Trans-Atlantictrade.(2) The Minister of Shipping haid that all four vessels wouldbe of great use to him. If we were to release the four ships we should be treating Prench vessels better thanneutrals.(3) The Attorney-General had advised that of enemycharacter against French merchant ships would have agood chance of success, whether the ships were controlledfrom occupied or unoccupied France.(4) Seizure of the vessels would cause some setback in ourrelations with the Vichy Government. This must be faced. But it was generally&apos; felt that seizure on thegrounds of the enemy character of the vessels a coursetantamount to outlawing all French seaborne trade might have very serious consequences.   .(5) A better plan would be to announce that we were detainingthe ships until the Vichy Government gave us satisfactionin the matter of the British and Allied vessels which had for a long time been held up in French and french colonial ports.(6) Disposal of French personnel. A Portuguese ship could bechartered to carry the French passengers and crews from gibraltar to Oran at a cost of  20 a head.&apos;5w --(7) A better plan would be to repatriate the personnel on-board to France&apos;by the San Francisco. The Vichy Frenchship was due to leave Liverpool for Marseilles on the10th or 11th January repatriating French nationals andwas travelling under the safe conduct of ourselves, theGermans and the Italians.   The San Francisco wouldnot, under present arrangements, call at Gibraltar, butthe French could probably be induced to order &quot;her to-:  do so.
The War Cabinet (i) Agreed that the four French ships should be seized on thegrounds set out in (5) above, and invited the First Lordof the Admiralty, the Minister of Shipping and theMinister of Economic Warfare to take actionaccordingly.(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, the foreign secretary and the Minister of Shipping to arrange forthe French personnel on the Chantilly to be repatriatedto France on the San Francisco.MunitionsSupply.ProposedEastern GroupSupply Council.4. The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India and the Minister of Supply(W.P. (41) 4) asking for authority to consult the Governments ofthe Dominions, of India and of Burma as to the acceptance of therecommendations of the Delhi Conference regarding supply matters in the East.The Secretary of State for India said that the recommendationsof the Eastern Group Conference were designed to increase pro-duction in the Eastern half of the Empire. As regards thedistribution of supplies, it was proposed that this question shouldbe dealt with by setting up a series of Provision Offices which wouldmake demands upon a Central Provision Office which would beresponsible for supplying all theatres of war in the Eastern Group.The natural location for this Central Provision Office was India.As regards production it was proposed to appoint a Council onwhich the Dominions and India would be represented; with a chairman from the United Kingdom and one military member,representing the Imperial General Staff. The Colonial dependencieswould not be represented, but would retain the right to send advisersif and when desired.The Board of Trade had asked that the long-term economic consequences resulting from the activities of increasing productionin the East should not be overlooked. He (the Secretary of Statefor India) thought this point would be met if the United KingdomChairman was informally warned not to lose sight of the effect ofnew production on future trade. So far as capital commitmentswere concerned there would be ample opportunity for the Board ofTrade to scrutinise the activities of the Council from this pointof view as these were not to be entered into without reference home.The Secretary of State added that he thought the proposal, if adopted, would mean economy of production, of shipping, and of dollars, would bring into play sources of labour and material whichhad not yet been used, and would mean a contribution of the highest importance to the winning&apos;of the war.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Ministry had developed several sources of supply in the East which he assumedwould not be interfered with. He thought that the Air ministry should have a representative on the Council.The Secretary of State for India said that the military member to be nominated by the Imperial General Staff as head of theCentral Provision Office, would represent the needs of the fightingServices, but it might be possible to have an Air representative onhis staff.The Minister of Labour and National Service emphasised thedesirability of having, on the staff of the United Kingdom repre^-sentative, an expert adviser on labour questions. Otherwise, therewas a risk that measures initiated by the Eastern Group supply council would cause labour difilculties.
Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 9, 1941.The Secretary of State for India said that the Supply council would only be concerned with the allocation, of supplies to beproduced in the various countries. Any labour questions arisingwould therefore be the responsibility of the individual Governments.He would be glad, however, to discuss with the Minister of Labourand National Service and the Chairman (designate) of the council the question whether a labour expert should be added to the staffof the United Kingdom representative.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the scheme in principle, and gave authority tothe Secretary of State for the Dominions and theSecretary of State for India and Burma to consult theGovernments of the Dominions, of India and of Burmarespectively regarding the acceptance of the recom-mendations of the Delhi Conference.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for India:(i) To consult with the Minister of Labour and NationalService regarding the appointment of a labouradviser to the staff of the United kingdom representative on the Eastern Group supply council.(ii) To consult with the&apos; Secretary of State for Airregarding the appointment of an Air Ministryrepresentative to the Staff of the Military Memberof the Eastern Group Supply Council.
