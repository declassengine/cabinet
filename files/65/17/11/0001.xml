He thought that we should now make it clear to the United States authorities that, if the transaction went through in its present form and became known tothe Japanese, we should have to let it be known that we had acted in the manner proposed at the request of the United States Govern- -ment.

The Foreign Secretary said that the &quot;Vichy Government had made very wide demands in the economic discussions. their proposals had little relation to reality, and he had instructedSir Samuel Hoare to inform the French Ambassador in writingthat, while we would consider the French proposals as soon as theyhad been received in this country, we could not consider any con-cessions with regard to imports into Metropolitan France, beyondthe arrangements made for the relief of children in unoccupied france, and that for the moment the economic discussions should belimited to Morocco. Although Sir Samuelhad some doubts as tothe wisdom of this course, he (the Foreign Secretary) had thoughtthat we should make it plain to the Vichy Government that we werenot in a position to make large concessions such as they had in mind(telegrams Nos. 138 and 173 to Madrid),The War Cabinet approved this course.
