Naval, Militaryand &amp;irOperations.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)naval operations.MilitaryOperations.Libya: capture of Bardia1. The Chiefs of Staff gave the following reports in amplification-tion of the information contained in Cabinet War Room Records,Nos. 488-491.Italy-Greece.All the ships in the convoy which had scattered on the25th December, owing to the presence of an enemy raider, had nowbeen located and were proceeding to their destinations. EmpireTrooper had arrived at Gibraltar.There had been no further news beyond that already publishedregarding the capture of Bardia. 25,000 prisoners had been takenincluding 2 Corps Commanders and 4 Senior Generals.The Prime Minister said that this operation had been brilliantlyexecuted, and our total of 400 casualties was extraordinarily small.In a broadcast that morning a B.B.C. spokesman had stressed thepitiful condition of the Italian forces. It was undesirable to belittlewhat the Australians had done by laying too much emphasis on thefact that there had not been much fighting. The line to take wasthat the Italians, normally excellent soldiers, had not on this occasionfought with their accustomed bravery owing to their being out of sympathy with the cause for which they were fighting. Stressshould also be laid on the great weight of our bombardment, and onthe brilliance of the tactics adopted by General Wavell.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information after consultationwith the War Office to make a personal broadcast that evening bringing out these points.The weather in Albania had been very bad and had restrictedoperations. Present conditions emphasised the need for air superiority, and for action to improve the Greek communications.The Prime Minister said that the Defence (Operations) Com-mittee would examine these matters.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Blockade.France.(previous reference:W.M. (41). 1stConclusions,Minute- 2.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that therehad been no further French reactions regarding the incident of theprevious week when four French merchant ships, escorted by armed trawlers, had been intercepted off the Spanish Moroccan coast, andthe Chantilly had offered resistance. The Vichy Government had then said that the incident had created a grave situation and had placed Marshal Retain in a position of serious embarrassment.The War Cabinet were informed that a telegram had been sentto Gibraltar asking for the situation to be cleared up as quickly aspossible.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Spain. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said tfeMTangier. negotiations had been proceeding at Madrid for a week. Sir SamuelThe Inter- Hoare had had the help of Mr. Gascoigne, our Consul-General afcnational Zone. Tangier, and representatives of the British colony.   It was hoped.(Previous to negotiate a temporary arrangement to cover the followingReference: points :-W.M. (40) 306th The British colony would continue to enjoy their presentConclusions, rights; the Spaniards would agree not to fortify the.Zone, and minute 5.) to make no further changes without notice to us, and to pay compensation to the British officials dismissed; and the BritishPost Office in Tangier would continue.Our Ambassador at&apos;Madrid had asked whether he might have authority to settle the matter without further reference home. Buthe (the Foreign Secretary) had thought that the text should be sentto the Foreign Office before an arrangement was concluded. In themeantime, Sir Samuel Hoare had represented that the food situation was very urgent, and had asked whether facilities should be givenfor one of the wheat ships forthwith. Sir Samuel Hoare had beengiven discretion to deal with this matter (telegram No. 32 to madrid).The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this action.foreign information.U.S.S.R.     .The baltic states.requisitioning of Shipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 287thConclusions,Minute 2.)Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 1stConclusions,Minute 5.)The Balkans.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet particulars of the following information: With the concurrence of the Ministry of Shipping, it had nowbeen decided that the seamen on the ships in this country belongingto the Baltic States,, which had been requisitioned, should now beallowed to return to Russia if they so wished. They would be sentto Eire, so that they might return on the five Baltic ships now in eire ports, over which we had no control.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed.Reports received recently from Italy (but before the fall ofBardia) were to the effect that although Italian opinion wasdepressed, it was unlikely to break except under the pressure ofaction in Italy itself. &apos;During the last few days the news from Bulgaria had beendisquieting. There were a number of indications that Bulgariawas under strong pressure from Germany.Attention was also drawn to a telegram from Sir MichaelPalairet (No. 26) indicating some anxiety as to the slowing down ofthe Greek advance.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.United States.Financing of contracts.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 1stConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the War Cabinetinformation of the latest developments (telegrams Nos. 311 Pursa,and 21 and 31 from Washington). It might now be intended toproceed, not by legislation, but by a Joint Resolution amending the Resolution passed on the 15th June, 1940, to enable the UnitedStates to facilitate the defence of the American Republic,The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Royal Alp Force.Proposedcontribution toBenevolentFund from public funds.6. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on theMemorandum (W.P. (G) (41) 2) by the Minister of Aircraft Pro-duction (absent through indisposition) proposing the payment from public funds of the sum of  1,000,000 to the Royal Air ForceBenevolent Fund.The War Cabinet were informed that the Benevolent Funds ofthe Navy and Army would expect similar assistance in the eventof this proposal being approved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposed pay-ment could not be made without a specific vote of the House ofCommons. A large payment to the Benevolent Fund of one of theServices might be construed as an admission that the State schemesof pensions were inadequate, or that the particular Service selecteddeserved better treatment than the other Services, or again that private benevolence was not forthcoming in that Service to anamount adequate to provide a reasonable measure of assistance forcases which required more than the general rules afforded.If the payment was made from the Spitfire Fund, it was relevant to point out that the Exchequer had received far greatergifts from other sources in aid of our war effort.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also drew attention to therecent inauguration of the King&apos;s Fund.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production and theChancellor of the Exchequer to consider this matter further, in consultation.Royal message of Condolence.proposed extension to civilians.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 258thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The War Cabinet discussed the Memorandum by theMinister of Home Security (W.P. (G) (40) 331) (absent throughindisposition) proposing (a) that a submission should be made toHis Majesty pointing out the difficulties in the way of sending theRoyal Message to the next-of-kin of all civilians killed by enemy action, and suggesting that the Message should not be sent in thesecases; (b) certain alternative forms of recognition which might be acceptable to relatives of air-raid casualties.The War Cabinet (i) approved generally the Memorandum by the Minister ofHome Security (W.P. (G) (40) 331);(ii) invited the Minister to consider whether the Imperial war graves Commission should be the agent for keepingrecords of civilian deaths due to enemy action, and ofdeaths among civilian defence workers on duty.Great George Street, S.W. 1,January 6, 1941.
