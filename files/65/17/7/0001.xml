The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegram received from General Wavell at Athens.The War Cabinet invited the Defence Committee (Operations)to meet at 6 p.m. that night to consider the reply to be sent.W-M. (41) 6thConclusions,Minute 2.)United States of 3. A discussion took place on a proposal that PresidentAmerioa. Roosevelt should be invited to inspect H.M.S. King George V on proposed ner arrival in the United States with Lord Halifax, and the Britishinspection of delegation to the Anglo-American technical conversations, on board.H.M.S. King There were some difficulties in the way of the proposal since theGeorge Vby vessel would only be in port for one day; and the President wouldPresident hardly be expected to go to meet the new British Ambassador onRoosevelt.        arrival.  Nor would there be much time for the President to inspectthe vessel after the Ambassador had continued his journey.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the matter could only be dealt with in a personal telegram from the Prime Minister to president roosevelt; and invited the Foreign Secretary to submit thematter to the Prime Minister with a draft.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave thefollowing information: The Balkans. Telegram No. 69 from Belgrade indicated that if we continued with the policy we had proposedYugoslavia now professed that she might wish to modify herattitude.A further telegram (No. 70) was being sent to Belgrade tohelp make our position clear.The War Cabinet took note of this information.5. The Minister of Home Security said that on the previous night raiding had been sporadic, but widespread, mainly over theNorth Midlands and London. Damage of national importance wasvery slight, apart from interruption of the L.N.E.R. main line at two points north of Peterborough. As many as 100 people mightbe trapped as a result of a bomb in Lambeth.Apart from this incident the casualties the previous night hadbeen:  -Killed.

Attention was drawn to several recent telegrams suggesting that the Germans were considering the use of gas against thiscountry.  The general public had grown slack in anti-gas prepara-tions; and very few people now carried gas masks.The War Cabinet-Took note that the Minister of Home Security was considering steps to secure that our anti-gas preparations were in a state of readiness.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping (W.P. (G) (41) 4), asking for authority tccontinue negotiations with the United States in order to evolvea practicable scheme for taking over enemy ships, together withDanish and French ships in their ports.The Minister of Shipping said that since his Paper had been circulated a telegram had been received from the United Statesindicating that the Americans were drawing back from the proposalto requisition these ships, and were encouraging us to start again the negotiations, which had failed before, to obtain the Danish ships.The Minister of Economic Warfare pointed out two dangers : (1) The possibility of financial leakage to the enemy. &quot;c,possible we should not go beyond promising paym : after the war.(2) If we made arrangements with the United States, other neutral Powers would want similar treatment. If this happened we might find that ships had been releasedwhich would become possible blockade breakers. one way of meeting this difficulty was to say that we woi&apos;\refuse to recognise any transfer of flag except on tc .V-approved by us. - .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he understood theMinistry of Shipping were seeking to arrange that payment shouldbe made to a blocked account in sterling, to be repaid after he war.This was satisfactory from the Treasury point of view. Fa ing this solution the United States Aduwistratiqn might be asketv to lendus the ships under the Presidents plan when it had beer approvedby Congress.   We should then have a post-war obligation to theUnited States of America, which would be merged in our post-warobligations under the Presidents plan. He asked that the Ministerof Shipping should continue to keep in touch with tlu. Treasury onthe financial aspect as the negotiations proceeded.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Shipping to continue thenegotiations with the United States Government, with aview to evolving a practicable scheme for taking overenemy Danish and French ships sheltering in their ports.e War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSmV^hm&apos;s^^m^mSecretary of State *orWartoarrange for^2,000-3,000 suitable/North Italian prisoners to bebrought imn^diately to this country in order that they might beused for urgent la;iid reclamation work,the War Cabinet-T-Agreed to this proposal provided (1) that the Home Defence (Security) Executive were satisfied regarding the security aspect ol theproposal; and j-(2Y that the Home Secretary was satisfied as regardsany repercussions on our alien policy.
c.IThe Minister of Labour and National Service said that apriority question of this nature should be dealt with by theProduction Executive and the Sub-Committee on the Allocation ofRaw Materials, before being brought to the War Cabinet.This was agreed to.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the finance of thescheme had been agreed, subject to (a) Shelters being concentrated as far as possible in vunerable areas;.n9L (6) A review of shelter policy in three months.The Lord President of the Council suggested that the engineerswho had previously objected to indoor shelters on grounds of firerisk, should be asked to reconsider the views they had previouslyVf - expressed, in the light of experience gained. The Minister of Homev% Security took note of this suggestion.The War Cabinet-Approved generally the proposals in the Memorandum bythe Minister of Home Security, subject to the priorityissue involved being remitted for urgent consideration bythe Production Executive.Production. t,A 10.   The War Cabinet were informed that it was proposed arrangements that the Debate on Production in the House of Commons should for take place on the 21st and 22nd January.Parliamentary ^* The War Cabinet had a provisional discussion of the arrange-Debate. ments for the Debate in order to help the Ministers concerned in(Previous        preparing the necessary material, and to enable the Lord PrivyReference:       Seal to report their views to the Prime Minister.W.M.
