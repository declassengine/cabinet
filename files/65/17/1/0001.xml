The Chief of Naval Staff reported that an Eastboundconvoy of four French merchant ships, including the Chantilly(9,986 tons), escorted by the armed trawler La Toulonnaise, hadbeen intercepted off the Spanish Moroccan Coast outside territorial waters by, five.of our destroyers, and was being escorted back to gibraltar. The trawler had protested, and had reported inter-ception by wireless telegraphy, but had been allowed to proceed toOr an. The Chantilly had, contrary to International Law, offeredsome resistance (it was not clear of what character) to our boardingparty and one of our destroyers had fired a few rounds of machine-gun fire into the water. Unfortunately, these rounds had richo-chetted and had resulted in two civilians being killed and fourwounded.After discussion the War Cabinet decided as follows :  (1) The Foreign Secretary was invited to send a message atonce to the Vichy authorities, without waiting for more complete information as to the nature of the resistance offered by the Chantilly, expressing greatregret at the casualties which had taken place, butpointing out that they must be regarded as theresult of this vessel s illegal action.(2) Notwithstanding this clash, the First Lord of theAdmiralty was invited to give intructioiis that further interceptions should, if possible, be made during the next two days.Franoe: Pro- 3.

He had given the15th February as the approximate date on which the Bill wouldbecome law. It ought to be possible, however, to make appropria-tions under the existing law, in order to enable us to make day-to-day payments under our contracts in the interim period. This waspur main difficulty. The President was inclined to deal with thematter on broader and more general lines, but he showed no dis-position to be alarmed at the size of our financial demands.The Prime Minister said that he had already sent a telegram: &apos; (No. 3787) thanking President Roosevelt for his speech on the.-i-.v.&apos;.v:-W&quot; 29th December. He was now about to send a further telegram(No. 19) bringing out our immediate difficulties over the financing of contracts.United States r The War Cabinet were informed that it had been decided thatDestroyers. the particulars regarding the defects in the destroyers which we(Previous i had obtained from the United States should be communicatedReference: ; through the American Naval Attache in London, and not in the,W&apos;Mv (40) 510th form of a telegram to President Roosevelt.

He had taken soundings as to what effect thereduction of the ration would have on labour, and had been assured that it would cause no trouble.8. The War -Cabinet -had before them a Minute by -theChancellor of the Exchequer addressed to the; Prime-Minister,together&apos; with a note by the First Lord of the Admiralty(W.P. (40) 493). . .. -       .     r.: wThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the essential features of the policy now proposed were contained in paragraphs1 and 2 of this Minute. We should cease to provide Eire with any facilities for obtaining shipping. Eire would be released from itsundertaking to charter only through us and would be free to charterin the open market. In actual fact, they would.be unable to do this,as our Allies do not make charters without previous consultationwith us.The Prime Minister said that, when the Eire Government was informed of what we proposed to do, it should be emphasised thatthis step was taken in no vindictive spirit and only dire- necessityforced us into such a step. . ,WM&apos;te&quot;--The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (a) Effect should be given forthwith to the proposals containedin the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Minute to thePrime Minister.(&amp;) We should continue to allow any Eirean or neutral shipsengaged on Eire trade to receive the protection of ourconvoys. tv.;.:(c) When we informed the Eire Government that we: were unable to charter ships for them, no reference should bemade to insurance, but for the moment;! ;w?e - shouldcontinue to give facilities in this direction,   ^n,(d) Subject to the special requirements of particular; Britishtrades (e.g., Welsh coal) we should withdraw vesselsengaged in traffic between this country and Eire as ourown needs might require.(e) The policy in regard to the regulation of food supplies to eire should be one of gradual diminution. Thus weshould not cut off all supplies of tea at once, but shouldcontinue to supply Eire with small quantities for thepresent.(/) The Minister of Information should inform the press thatthe Government viewed this measure with&quot; pirdfblindregret, and that it had been taken only because1 &quot;the pressure on our own shipping space was so severe.1     )(g) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should beresponsible for the general handling of this&apos;matter-&apos;1 andother Departments concerned should keep in &apos;toueh- with.  him. liUwM(h) The United Kingdom Representative to Eire should beinformed of the steps proposed, before action on theabove lines was initiated.
In answer to a question, the Minister said that it was necessaryvp . -to ration pork and offals in order that poor people might be able toobtain them. He was fully aware of the importance of cheese in the diet of manual workers, and was already distributing cheese in larger quantities to industrial areas and taking the risk of other areas going short.It was suggested that when the reduction of the ration was announced, attention should be called in the Press to the fact that even the reduced meat ration was considerably above the 1918 ration.Emphasis might also be laid on the success that had attended the rationing system during the war, and to the complete absence offood queues.The War Cabinet agreed that the meat ration should bereduced to Is. Qd. a week as from the 6th January, porkand offals to be included.Food. 10.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the previousIndustrial minute, the Minister of Labour and National Service said that theCanteens best waY 0$ providing extra food for heavy workers lay not in a supplementary ration but in the development of canteens. He was making enquiries- into this matter and meant to appoint an officer todeal with it speedily. He agreed that it was the Minister of Food&apos;business to provide the food and his (the Minister of Labour&apos;s) to seethat canteens were provided.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service andthe Minister of Food to consult together on this matter with a view to the development of industrial canteens.Oil: 100-OotaneFuel.Responsibilityfor Hey shamand ThorntonPlants.(previous reference:. W.M. (40) 284thConclusions, .Minute 5.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (40) 490), asking for theauthority of the War Cabinet to transfer the 100-octane fuel plantsat Heysham and Thornton to the Ministry of Works and Buildings.In discussion it was suggested that the building side constitutedonly a small part of the whole scheme. The financial and thetechnical problems involved were more important, and the onlypeople who had experience of them were serving in the Ministry of aircraft Production.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he and his stafffound it difficult to be responsible for an undertaking in which theydid not believe.It was further suggested that it was important that thereshould be a single controlling authority, responsible for the oil production in this country.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to find a solution; for. this matter, consistent with the principle that a sin &quot;&quot;controlling authority: should be responsible for oil production in this; country. - ;

The Prime Minister contrasted the total strength of the Armywith the effective fighting strength of the Divisions at presentformed. He hoped that means would be found to avoid a furtherintake of men into the Army for the present. He hoped that theresults of the investigations now being carried out by the War office would soon be available, and that a decision on the matter could bereached quite soon. In the meantime, he suggested that considerationof the present Paper might be deferred.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security reminded the War Cabinet that he had been authorised to arrange for the drafting of a Bill for recruitment for the Civil Defence Services, inthe expectation that some proportion of the men called up under theAct would be available for Civil Defence. He also wished to put iton record that a number of Local Government Staffs and employeeswere of great value for Civil Defence purposes. He would com-municate on this matter with the Minister of Labour and NationalService.The War Cabinet-Postponed consideration of the Minister of Labour&apos;s Memo-randum for a short period, pending the enquiry, referredto by the Prime Minister, whether better use could be madeof the man-power already serving in the Army.Radio. 13.
