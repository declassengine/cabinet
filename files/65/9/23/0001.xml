The Chief of the Air Staff reported that the only importantenemy operation in the air on the previous day had been a sweep byabout 100 aircraft, shortly after 4 p.m., from the Dover-Dungenessdirection. Part of this force had approached Central London, but most of it had remained over Kent. All the enemy aircraft in thissweep seemed to be fighters, which flew at a great height.The Sudan.During the previous night London had again been the principalobjective of the enemy bombers. Bombing had been somewhat lessintense and there had been fewer fires. The districts most affectedhad been Acton, Willesden and the South-West Suburbs.Hampshire, South Wales, Liverpool, East Anglia and the Midlandshad also been visited.The casualties on the previous day had been : Our own 5 machines (2 pilots safe).Enemy 5 certain.3 probable.2 damaged.The principal targets of our own bombers had been the channel ports, the Bosch Factory at Stuttgart, an oil target at Magdeburg,the Bitterfeld Aluminium Works and the marshalling yards atHamm and elsewhere.An unconfirmed report had stated that the Hipper had been operating off Stavanger.Two unknown destroyers had been sighted from the Scilly Islesand British destroyers had been sent to investigate.

There was nothing, however, to indicate that the Italianoffensive would be resumed at an early date.The First Lord of the A dmiralty drew attention to reports that german reinforcements for the Egyptian Front were passing through Italy and were being transported to North Africa by air.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that enemy armoured car patrols had been active in the Kassala sector, and their aircraft had been over Gallabat.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[21796-1]

Birkenhead Dockshad also been attacked, but the flour mills had not been damaged.There had been some large fires in the London area, but for themost part the attack seemed to have spent itself or been stoppedSouth of London. Many bombs had been dropped on the lineGuildford-Sevenoaks. Railways had again been affected, but notvery seriously.The Secretary of State for War said that Sir Warren Fisherhad asked that the military authorities should make soldiersavailable to help clear the streets. This request was being consideredthat morning.The question was raised whether the lake in St. Jiames&apos;s Parkwas a landmark which the enemy could pick up easily. The Chiefof the Air Staff undertook to re-examine the question whether thelake, which afforded a useful reserve of water, should be emptied.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Foreign 4.

5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Home Security (W.P. (G.) (40) 249).The Minister of Home Security said that the present policy wasto allow racing on a limited scale, unless there were reasons on military grounds or on account of air raid risks why a particularmeeting should not be held. No meetings were permitted in theneighbourhood of London. On grounds of home security there wasno reason to change this policy, though the War Cabinet might thinkit unseemly that race meetings should be held in presentcircumstances.The Secretary of State for War said that the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, would prefer that all horse racing should be stopped. One of his reasons for this was that in certain eventualitiesa race meeting might interfere with the movements of troops.Discussion showed that the general view of the War cabinet was against a complete discontinuance of horse racing, thoughracing was clearly impracticable in certain areas.The War Cabinet agreed : (a) That the present policy of allowing a restricted number of race meetings should continue; provided, of course, thatthe Jockey Club thought it was worth while to continue on the present lines.(b) That the Newmarket meeting, to be held that week, shouldbe cancelled.(c) That the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, should beasked to state whether there were certain areas in which,on military grounds, it was desirable to ban all racemeetings.6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (W.P. (G.) (40) 246), about the Children&apos;s OverseasReception Scheme.The Home Secretary said that he recommended that, in presentcircumstances, no more children should be sent overseas under theGovernment scheme, either in fast or slow convoys, and that aGovernment announcement should be made to the effect that thescheme had been suspended.257th The Home Secretary also asked for a decision from the WarCabinet whether permits should be granted to those who. wished tosend their children overseas under private arrangements.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that his Department hadnot been aware of the extent to which, after the decision reached by the War Cabinet on the 12th July that the operation of thescheme should be postponed, arrangements had continued to be madeto send a number of children overseas under the scheme, exceptthat a request had been received from the Ministry of Shipping forthe provision of defensive armament, &amp;o, for certain specifiedships.The Foreign Secretary said that he had also telegraphed toSir Robert Craigie, putting to him the various courses open to usin regard to the Burma Road. Lord Lothian had had a discussionwith Mr. Cordell Hull about the new Pact and about the burma road. It would be necessary for the War Cabinet to have a discussion on the Burma Road question during the course of thepresent week.The War Cabinet took note of this information.
The Home Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that, by agree-ment with Ministers, that decision had subsequently been somewhatmodified. The extent of the modification had been indicated by thePrime Minister in the statement which he had made in the Houseof Commons on the 18th July, when he had said that any furtheremigration that might be possible, as opportunity served, would be regulated with a view to restoring the balance between classes; and,furthermore, the scale of movement must necessarily be small in number, and dependent in time upon Naval facilities.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked that theannouncement made should not appear in the Press untilWednesday. This would enable him to inform the Dominion high commissioners well in advance of the public announcement.The War Cabinet agreed : (i) That a Government announcement should be made to theeffect that the Children &apos;s Overseas Reception Scheme hadbeen temporarily suspended,(ii) That this announcement should not appear in the Pressuntil the following Wednesday morning,(iii) That permits should not be refused to those who wishedto send their children overseas under private arrangements.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 30, 1940.
