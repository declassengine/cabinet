The authorities in the Regions were,Reference:        Qf COurse, all very fully occupied, and there had been some difficultyW.M.

It was also difficult to get uniformity of procedureMmute 2.)        an(j standards in the different parts of the country.   He had therefore invited Lord Chatfielcl to undertake the important task of co-ordinating procedure and standards between the different parts of the country.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that he also had in mind the possibility of instituting a new Honour to be awarded to civilians, including, of course, members of the Police and A.R.P.Services. Members of the fighting Services might also be eligiblefor awards in respect of acts of gallantry performed while not on duty. Men and women would both be eligible, and posthumousawards should, he thought, be made. He had mentioned the matterinformally to His Majesty, who had expressed general approval.One suggestion, for which, of course, His Majesty&apos;s approvalwould be necessary, was that the Honour, which might well be intwo Classes, should be described as the &quot; George Cross &quot; and the&quot; George Medal.&quot;The Secretary of State for the Colonies hoped that the newhonour would not be limited to Home Defence and that civilians inthe Colonies (e.g., Malta) would also be eligible.The Secretary of State for War said that he was faced withthe difficulty of providing an adequate reward for the personnel ofbomb disposal units. It had hitherto been the practice that, e.g.,the D.S.O., the D.C.M. and the MM. were awarded for acts ofgallantry in face of the enemy, and not for what might be described as acts of gallantry in cold blood. While he agreed that the workof the bomb disposal units called for bravery in a very high formindeed, on the whole he felt that the practice of keeping the D.S.O.,&amp;c, for actions performed in face of the enemy should be main-tained. He was therefore proposing to award the Empire GallantryMedal to members of the bomb disposal units. The first four awardswould be gazetted on the following morning.In discussion, the Secretary of State for War agreed that theEmpire Gallantry Medal was at present not widely known. he fully agreed that the awards of the Empire Gallantry Medal nowto be made must set a very high standard, and must bring this Medalto a very high point in public esteem.The War Cabinet expressed general approval of theproposals outlined by the Prime Minister for the insti-tution of a new Honour.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 17, 1940.
