Air Raid THE War Cabinet had before them the Conclusions of anWarnings. Informal Meeting held that afternoon under the Chairmanship of proposed the Lord Privy Seal (WP. (40) 357).   The principal recommenda-modifications. tion of the Meeting, was that an authoritative statement should be(Previous made to the effect that everybody engaged on useful work, and not reference: in a position of special danger, should continue his or her work on W.M. (40)24lst receipt of the &quot;red&quot; warning, and should not seek shelter untilConclusions, specific instructions were received (or until guns or bombs were minute 3.) heard).There was general agreement with the view that the presentsystem should be changed, but considerable discussion took place asto the extent of the change to be made immediately, and, inparticular, on the question whether the &quot; red &quot; warning should beretained for the present.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that, under therecommendations put forward by the Informal Meeting, the sirenswould continue to disturb production, which would show no improve-ment. He wished to see the &quot; red &quot; warning abolished at once. Hisown workers had had no value out of the system. With one exceptionthere had been no warning before any of the bombing attacks on aircraft factories which had resulted in serious damage.The Prime Minister pointed out that the &quot; red &quot; warning meantonly that enemy aircraft were flying over a certain area. No one could tell whether the enemy aircraft intended to bomb that area or were on passage to some other place. Accordingly the &quot; red &quot;warning bore no relation to the danger involved. He was sure thatthe people of this country would follow any clear and reasonabledirection. The public would feel that there was an inherentcontradiction between the continued sounding of the &apos;&apos; red&quot;warning on the siren, which was associated with the official Govern-ment advice to take cover, and the directions that workers worththeir salt should no longer obey these instructions but stay at work.In reply to this, it was pointed out that there were two separateproblems : the workers in factories, who were equivalent to troops inthe front line, and the rest of the people in the country. It was argued that there was no inconsistency in giving the &quot; red&quot;warning, which applied to the people of the country generally, andan instruction to the workers that their duty to continue production over-rode the duty to take cover unless danger was imminent.A number of Members of the War Cabinet thought that theabolition of the &quot;red&quot; warning could only come about gradually.To abolish it immediately might have bad effects on production.There should, however, be a general encouragement to munition workers to keep at work until the last possible moment, and to comeback to it as soon as the danger was over and make up for lost time.The public must be educated to understand that the more we were attacked, the more important it was to increase production.The Home Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that on the 2ndJuly he had stated in the House of Commons that it was the con-sidered view of the Government that, in order to defeat any effortsby the enemy to dislocate production in our war industries, workers engaged in war production should be encouraged, so far as their local conditions allowed, to continue at work after a public air raid warning, until it was clear that an enemy attack was actuallyimminent in their neighbourhood. Subsequent to this statement,there had been a series of Meetings organised by the Minister ofLabour to deal with the matter. At first there had been somereluctance to continue at work after the &quot; red &quot; warning. This,however, had now been completely overcome. At the Meeting held the previous day both employers&apos; and employees&apos; representatives had given an undertaking that, if the sirens were sounded frequently,
(previous reference:W.M. (40) 239thConclusions,Minute 15.)they would organise a system of private observation withinindustrial establishments and guarantee that the workers would remain at work until the alarm was given through this privatesystem of observation. It was clear that both sides of industry had shown that they were determined to carry on with production,provided that proper provision was made to ensure that the wives and families of workers had time to take cover. All the soundingswhich he had taken showed that importance was attached to thecontinuance of the &quot; red &quot; warning.Both the Home Secretary and the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministry of Labour strongly deprecated any decision being takenor any public announcement made before there had been anopportunity for ample discussion with the representatives ofemployers and employees.Another point dealt with in discussion was the importance ofsleep for workers whether on day or night shifts.The Prime Minister thought that everyone should be urged tosleep by day or by night in some place where he could stay putduring air raid warnings.General agreement was expressed with this view, although theLord Privy Seal pointed out that in certain poorer districts ofLondon it was difficult to give effect to this principle.The Minister without Portfolio thought that we should moveby stages in this matter, and deprecated for the present any punitiveaction in the case where workers had left their posts. We ought tobe able to create a1 tradition that industry remained at its post,whatever the risks might be. Visits of Ministers to munitionsfactories might help greatly towards the creation of this tradition;they could be arranged without creating any public apprehension,or giving any encouragement to the enemy.Air Vice-Marshal Peck thought that the present system ofwarnings could be greatly improved and made more accurate. Hethought it was not the &quot; red &quot; warning system itself, but the action taken on it, which required amendment.I. The War Cabinet invited the Prime Minister in his state-ment in the House of Commons on the 5th September todeal with this matter on the following lines : (a) He should stress the importance of production notbeing interfered with by air raid warnings unlessan attack was imminent.(b) He should stress the importance of adequate sleepfor workers, whether on day or night shifts.(c) He should indicate that changes in the presentsystem of air raid warnings were under con-sideration; that consultations were taking place with interested bodies (in particular withorganisations of employers and workpeople); andthat a further announcement on the subject would be made in a few days&apos; time.(d) He might also remove the misapprehension that work came to a standstill in Government officeswhen the &quot; red &quot; warning was given, and explain that instructions were being given that work should continue.II. The War Cabinet agreed that the aim should be to modify the present system on the following lines : (a) The present audible warning given on the sirens atthe beginning of the &quot;red&quot;  warning period
should be discontinued. This signal should either be abolished altogether, or kept in reserve for use should conditions change.(&amp;) In its place an &apos;&apos; alert&apos;&apos; would be notified by visiblesignals, e.g., flags by day and electric lights on the street corners by night. This &quot; alert&quot; signalshould not interrupt the normal life of the area;but those not engaged on national work could takerefuge or put their children in a place of safety.(c) On the &quot; alert,&quot; look-out men would take post at each factory. These men should be given special training in their duties and, if possible, shouldbe provided with apparatus to enable them todetect approaching enemy aircraft.(d) When the approach of enemy aircraft was detected,or air fighting was in progress in the neigh-bourhood, the alarm would be sounded by look-outmen at the factories and by air raid wardens orpolicemen in the streets. It would then beeveryone&apos;s duty to take cover.(e) The &quot; all-clear &quot; would be sounded to end the alarmperiod. This might or might not coincide withthe end of the &quot; alert.&quot;III.-The War Cabinet agreed that, while it was desirable towork to a system on these lines as soon as possible, itwas most important not to announce any change ofpolicy until the appropriate organisations had been consulted, and, in particular, organisations of employersand workpeople.The Home Secretary and the Minister of Labourwere invited to put before the appropriate organisations the outline of a scheme on the above lines, as repre-senting a change in policy which the government thought should be introduced at the earliest opportunity.IV. The War Cabinet invited the Supply Ministers, inconsultation with the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Air, to take steps to organise a system oflook-out men in factories, beginning, with those of primary importance from the point of view of munitions production.V. The War Cabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal to approach the Speaker with a view to modifying forth-with the present arrangements whereby the House ofCommons would adjourn on the &quot;red&quot; warning beingsounded.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 5, 1940.
