Naval 2.   The Chief of Naval Staff made a report on the mining of operations. British destroyers at 1 a.m. on the 1st September. The Esk had(Previous been sunk, and they had had to sink Ivanhoe, 44 survivors fromBeferenee: which had been landed at Harwich. The Express was being towedW.M.

The Germans had been just in front of us and our ships had runNaval casualties, into their minefield.The Chief of Naval  Staff  also gave particulars of  thetorpedoing of the Fiji on the afternoon of the 1st September.   TheFiji was proceeding to the Clyde with a destroyer escort.The The Chief of Naval Staff also gave the latest information asMediterranean,   to the Mediterranean position.Submarine Our submarines claimed to have sunk a German submarine in operations.        the North Sea and to have got in two hits on Italian warshipssouth-west of Messina.   It was not clear whether the vessels hitwere cruisers or destroyers.Enemy attacks The enemy attacks on merchant shipping had been on a reduced on shipping.      scale during the last few days.(Previous The R.A.F. were making available a squadron of Whitleys toBeference: assist in the anti-U-boat campaign in the North-WesternW.M. (40) 238th Approaches.Conclusions,Minute 2.)The Fleet Reference was made to the apparently unauthorised statementsAir Arm. which had appeared in the evening papers on the 31st August, and again in one of the Sunday papers, that the Fleet Air Arm wasbeing re-equipped with Fulmar aircraft.The War Cabinet-(a) Took note of the above statements.(b) Invited the Minister of Information to make enquiries, andto take action, with regard to the Press Reports of there-equipment of the Fleet Air Arm with Fulmaraircraft.Air Operations. 1.   The Prime Minister said that on the 31st August he had(Previous visited the Fighter Command during one of the big German airBeference: attacks. He had found it very instructive to watch the OfficersW.M. (40) 236th of the Fighter Command deploying their forces and building upConclusions, a front at the threatened points. He was sure that the SecretaryMinute l.) of State for Air would welcome it if other Members of the War&quot; The Battle of  Cabinet were to pay similar visits.Britain.&quot; The Prime Minister then reviewed the results of the last monthof hard air fighting. We had every right to be satisfied with thoseresults. He was tempted to ask why the enemy should continueattacks on this heavy scale which included some days as many as700 aircraft if it did not represent something like their maximumeffort. This might not, of course, be the explanation. But our ownAir Force was stronger than ever and there was every reason to beoptimistic about the 1940 Air Battle of Britain.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
MilitaryOperations.Middle East.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 236thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported certain minor operations which had taken place in the Middle East.(i) Egypt. Enemy aircraft had bombed the Suez Canal onthe night of 29th August without doing any damage.The nearest bomb had fallen 300 metres away from the canal. There had been a short enemy bombardment ofthe Sollum area.(ii) East Africa. During the period the 19th-29th august the Brigade Group at Buna had been gradually with-drawn to the line of the Waso Nyiro river, and the postwas now unoccupied. A Brigade Group remained atWajir.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Air Raid 4    A short discussion took place about the need for alteringWarnings. the present system under which large parts of the country were(Previous under air raid warnings for many hours together.   The suggestionslief erence:        made included the following: \\ .M (40) 230th (j) That the system (at any rate as regards areas such as conclusions, South-East   England,  where  warnings  were   almostmu 6 continuous) might be simplified so that there would be only three stages the &quot;alert,&quot; the &quot;alarm&quot; and the&quot;all clear.&quot; The &quot;alert&quot; might be notified in someway which did not involve the use of the sirens. Duringthe &quot; alarm,&quot; but not before, all workers would takecover.(ii) That factories and other establishments might be encouraged to set up a system of local warnings, suchas had been initiated by the Departments in Whitehall.Under this system the greater part of the staffs did not go to the air raid shelters until they had been warnedby a signal from their own spotters that enemy aircraft were close at hand.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Air RaidCasualties.Publication ofthe Augustfigures.(PreviousKeference:W.M. (40) 234thConclusions,Minute 1.)France.Relations withthe vichy government.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 218thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The War Cabinet were informed that civilian air raidcasualties for the month of August were approximately 700 killed and 781 seriously injured. Subject to confirmation, the WarCabinet agreed that there was no reason why these figures shouldnot be announced publicly.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Madrid telegrams Nos. 684 and 685. The latter contained a communication from the Vichy Government to the effect that theywere willing for contact to be maintained between the two Govern-ments through the medium of their Embassies in Madrid. they stated, however, that there would be no point in a continuance ofcontacts if His Majesty&apos;s Government persisted in interference inthe French overseas possessions.Telegram No. 684 contained the following comments fromSir Samuel Hoare. First, the French authorities in Madrid seemedincreasingly anxious to work with us. Second, some kind of relationship with the Petain Government would- help us with theSpanish Government, who regarded Marshal Petain as the only hope
United States ofAmerica.Supply of destroyers and munitions ofwar.Proposed grantof base facilities in certainBritishTerritories.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 237thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that agreement had now been reached with the United States Governmentand that President Roosevelt had decided to publish the exchangeof Notes the following day (Tuesday, the 3rd September) in a message to Congress.Various points of procedure arose; first, we should publish the documents as a White Paper at 5 p.m. on Tuesday.Mr. Cordell Hull had intimated (Washington telegramNo. 1886) that he wanted, for reasons of internal politics, thequestion of the future of the British Fleet dealt with by an exchangeof Aide-Memoires between the State Department and theWashington Embassy. Should the Aide-Memoires on this point beincluded in our White Paper ?The War Cabinet decided against inclusion. After all, thisAide-Memoire only repeated the Prime Ministers statement inParliament.Secondly, how were the details of the agreement to be filled in.The Foreign Secretary thought that we ought to insist on london as the place of meeting of the British and American Experts whowere to determine the exact location of the Naval and Air bases in which facilities were to be granted. We might give as our reasons : (a) the preoccupation of our experts with their war duties;and(b) the fact that we were the donors.No objection was seen to Newfoundland representatives beingassociated with these discussions.The preliminary visits which United States Military Expertswere paying to certain of the Bases were in the nature ofreconnaissances, which would in no way prejudice the results ofthe meeting of experts.Thirdly, the War Cabinet were informed that Mr. Hull hadbeen anxious that the Prime Minister should not say that our offer of facilities had been intended as a free gift. It was agreed thatthere could be no question of going back on the statement already made publicly on this point (telegram No; 2125 to Washington).The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to proceed on the lines ofthe discussion.against a France totally occupied by Germany. Third, the many difficulties about British refugees and prisoners would be greatly facilitated by the existence of a channel of communications. these local considerations might not weigh against the bigger issues, butought to be taken into account.The Foreign Secretary said that his colleagues might well feelthat a continuance even of indirect relations with the Vichy Govern-ment was a waste of time. Clearly we could not agree to thedemand of the Vichy Government. Nevertheless on the whole hethought that Sir Samuel Hoare should continue discussions withthe French Ambassador in Madrid.The War Cabinet agreed with this view.
The Baltic 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionStates. to Washington telegram No. 1864 and to the reply (telegramEelease of assets No. 2123 to Washington). Before taking a decision as to thenow blocked release of the assets of the Baltic States now blocked in London, wein London. should obtain the considered views of the United States Govern-previous ment. It looked as though the release of the assets would cause theBeference:        United States some embarrassment.W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that withinThe Burma six weeks we should have to decide whether to reopen the BurmaBoad. Road. He had had a preliminary exchange of views with Sir Robert(Previous Craigie (Tokyo telegram No. 1716 and Foreign Office telegram toBeference: Tokyo, No. 914).W.M. (40) 207th He would be grateful for any suggestions which his colleaguesConclusions,      might have on this problem.Minute 14.) In reply to a question, the Foreign Secretary said that he saw no objection to these telegrams being repeated to Mr. Menzies.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.French Colonies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 238thConclusions,Minute 6.)Adherence of west african colonies toGeneral de gaulle.Tahiti.10. The Secretary.of State for Foreign Affairs read extracts from a telegram dated the 30th August from the OfficerAdministering the Government of Gambia which indicated that most of Senegal was anxious to adhere to General de Gaulle. Theprospects in West Africa generally looked increasingly favourable.The Prime Minister stressed the importance of an active policyin regard to the French African possessions.The Foreign Secretary said that telegrams had also beenreceived from the British Consul at Papeete, via New Zealand, inregard to the situation in Tahiti. He asked that the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs and he should have authority to decide,in consultation with other Departments concerned, on the reply tobe sent to the Governor-General of New Zealand as to the actionto be taken. *The War Cabinet agreed to this proposal.AerodromeConstruction.Allocation oflabour and materials.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 139thConclusions,Minute 2.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (W.P. (40) 347) asking for a special priority, higher than &quot; Works and Buildings priority A,&quot; for theconstruction of additional aerodromes.The Minister without Portfolio said that cement presentedspecial difficulties. The maximum capacity of 750,000 tons a monthwas beiow the current requirements of Departments. Stocks hadbeen eaten into since May and were now very small. Distributionwas also a problem, as 50 per cent, of production was in the Thamesand Medway area, and cement had usually been delivered by sea.The following points were made in discussion : (1) The demands of the War Office for cement and other materials for defence works would fall off rapidly.
Royal Air Force.Training of pilots.Proposal to send,flying training schools abroad.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 238thConclusions,Minute 1.)12. The Prime Minister said that, after Friday&apos;s Meeting ofthe War Cabinet, further discussion had taken place between theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister of Aircraft Production,and agreement had been reached.The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for Air to circulate a Memorandum setting out the agreement reached. Unlessany member of the War Cabinet- saw objection to the course proposed, this matter need not be further discussed by the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet Approved the procedure proposed, and invited theSecretary of State for Air to circulate a Memorandum tothe War Cabinet as proposed.This memorandum was subsequently circulated as W.P. (40)Against this, however, the &quot;War Office would need muchcement for foundations of hutments to be occupied bythe troops this winter.(2) The importance of substituting other materials for cementwherever possible was stressed.(3) The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Laboursaid that the demands of the Air Ministry for cementfor new aerodromes could only be met by heavy cuts inthe requirements for cement for some of the following : War Office Camps,Ordnance Factories and other Factories for the ministries of Supply and Aircraft Production,andThe Ministry of Home Security shelter programme.(4) It was generally agreed that the completion of new aero-dromes during the next few months was the most vitalneed; and tibat the problem should be handled not by giving aerodromes a &quot;super-priority,&quot; but rather by an allocation on a proportional basis.(5) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, saidthat, in present circumstances, the right course wouldbe to fix an allocation of the materials in short supplyand to direct labour to works on the basis of the alloca-tions of material.(6) The Minister of Supply said that any reduction in the allocations to his Department would slow down theconstruction of factories and would affect the long-termmunitions programme.The Prime Minister said that certain of the new factories were, of course, of vital importance and shouldtake precedence over the shelter programme.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to determine theallocation of cement in the light of the precedingdiscussion and to report to the War Cabinet.(2) Agreed that labour should be directed to works on thebasis of the materials available to them.
Royal Air Force.Air FiringFacilities forBomberCommand.13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air proposing that the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command, should be authorised tocarry out firing over certain sparsely populated areas in the UnitedKingdom, at altitudes of 10,000 feet and upwards (W.P. (40) 345).The Secretary of State for Air explained that there was verylittle risk of casualties from spent bullets, which were equivalent toa 1-lb. weight falling 6 feet.General agreement was expressed with the Secretary of State&apos;proposal.Discussion ensued whether a public announcement should bemade about this measure.The War Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 3 of the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (40) 345).(2) Decided that, for the present at any rate, no public announcement should be made in regard to this measure.If public opinion should make it desirable, an announce-ment could be made later.The middle east.Despatch of reinforcements.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 233rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Home defenceneeds.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 233rdConclusions,Minute 2.)14. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War in regard to the provisional shippingarrangements for a further convoy to the Middle East, to be despatched towards the end of September (W.P. (40) 341).The Secretary of State for War said that he understood thatthe Minister of Shipping now saw his way to make shipping available for 22,000 men.The proposal to include in this convoy the personnel of furtherarmoured units was not, of course, intended in any way to prejudgea decision whether, when the time came, these further units shouldbe sent to the Middle East. This must depend on the general position by, say the 10th September, by which date it would benecessary to decide whether these armoured units should be includedin the convoy. A decision on this point could not be dissociated fromthe likelihood of invasion of these islands being attempted in theautumn. Some discussion on this latter question followed, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard Eile of War cabinet conclusions.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that provisional arrangements should be made onthe basis that the convoy despatched to the Middle Easttowards the end of September would include capacity for approximatly 22,000 troops.(2) Took note that the decision whether further armoured units should be included in this convoy would have to betaken not later than, say, the 10th September.Parliament. 15.   The War Cabinet were informed that it was intended thatthe meeting of Parliament on Thursday, the 5th September, shouldbe for one day only. After the Prime Minister&apos;s statement therewould be an opportunity for debate. Parliament would thenadjourn for a further fortnight, subject to earlier recall if necessary.Statement by The Prime Minister said that he proposed in his statement onthe Prime        Thursday to deal with the following topics : Minister on 5th First, he would propose to make a guarded statement onSeptember. the progress of the air battle, indicating that the results were generally satisfactory.
(previous reference:W.M. (40) 240thConclusions,Minute 7.)Secondly, he hoped that it would be possible to make some statement as to compensation for air raid victims. TheChancellor of the Exchequer hoped to have proposals on thesubject ready that evening.Thirdly, he intended to refer to the internment of aliens,and to explain that, at the time of the country&apos;s greatest danger,the War Cabinet had decided, as an act of high policy, that large numbers of aliens must be interned, notwithstanding thegreat hardships involved. We were now in a stronger positionand could afford to release aliens quickly, even though this might involve some risk.Fourthly, he would refer to the agreement with the UnitedStates of America (see Minute 7 above).He would have liked also to deal with railway rates, butthe enquiry on this matter would not be completed by Thursday.The War Cabinet-Gave general approval to the lines of the statementindicated by the Prime Minister.The Allies.Organisation ofAllied Naval,Army and air contingents.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 232ndConclusions,Minute 6.)16. The War Cabinet took note of the Fifth Report by theChiefs of Staff on the Organisation of Allied Naval, Army and air contingents (W.P. (40) 344).Richmond Terrace, S.W.September 2, 1940.1,
