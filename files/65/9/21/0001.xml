The attack on the Bristol Company&apos;sworks at Filton had been made by 27 bombers escorted by fighters, and considerable damage had been done to the works,and casualties amongst the staff had been heavy.The Prime Minister suggested that Lord Chatfield should beinvited to visit Filton to enquire whether there had been any outstanding&quot; examples of courage, which should be rewarded.The attacks on Portland and Plymouth had been unsuccessful.Casualties for the previous day had been : Our own 4 aircraft (2 pilots safe).Enemy 26 certain.8 probable.12 damaged.The previous night 116 aircraft had been despatched toattack : (i) shipping and barges in Channel ports 68 aircraft.(ii) marshalling yards 13 aircraft.(iii) Uneisenau.

A Blenheim had shot down aDornier 18 off Brest.The Prime Minister mentioned that he had received a letterfrom Lord Trenchard-which he had referred to the Chiefs of staff in which he deplored that our bombers should be taken offattacking military objectives in Germany in order to bomb the invasion ports. The Prime Minister thought, however, that weshould be assuming a great responsibility if we allowed invasionconcentrations to accumulate in the Channel ports without taking action against them. But when the weather in the Channel wasunfavourable for invasion, it might be possible to divert moreaircraft to targets in Germany.The First Sea Lord reported that destroyers had againsuccessfully attacked Sidi Barrani early on the morning of the25th September. The Anthony had reported that she had onboard forty-six survivors, including six children, from the City ofBenaresThe Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that enemytroop concentrations had been reported 10 miles west of Tessenei(south of Kassala).
