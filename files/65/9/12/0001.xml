Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 249thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Casualties.1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the casualties duringthe 24 hours ended 7 a.m. that morning had been as follows : Destroyed. Probable.   Damaged.Enemy BombersBy our Fighters FightersUnidentifiedBy A.A.-Unidentified126532810454126CivilianCasualties.Air Operations.MilitaryOperations:Middle East.naval operations.Enemy attacks on shipping.Our Losses 25 Aircraft-186-13 Pilots killed or missing.4672During the week ended 6 a.m. 14th September, the civilian casualties had been 1,286 killed and 5,699 injured in London and 133 killed and 404 injured in the rest of the country.As the figures of air casualties indicated, the fighting of theprevious day had been most successful. The enemy had adoptedbolder tactics; these had served only to increase his losses. Thefigures of enemy bombers destroyed were very striking.We had carried out attacks on a large scale on barges and shipping at Boulogne, Dunkirk, Ostend, Calais, Antwerp andHavre, and a small scale attack on the West Power Station at berlin. All our aircraft had returned safely, but full reports hadnot yet been received. One of the aircraft returning from Berlinhad claimed a hit with a 250 pound bomb on a German cruiser nearTerschelling.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that Sollumwas now in the hands of the Italians. It was believed that oursmall forces had extricated themselves. There were signs of an italian advance in two columns towards Buq-buq. The enemy forces employed consisted of about two strong brigade groups, with two battalions of medium tanks and a proportion of Corps medium artillery.The First Sea Lord reported that H.M. Sloop Dundee had been torpedoed in the North-West Approaches and had sunk on the.previous day.The enemy attacks on trade, although still serious, had abatedduring the last ten days, in spite of the fact that we had recalleda number of destroyers from trade protection duties.HM. Submarine Parthian had attacked and probably sunk Zara class Cruiser (10,000 tons) about 150 miles E.S.E. ofMessina on the 31st August.The War Cabinet-Took note of the above statements and invited the PrimeMinister to send a further message of congratulations ontheir behalf to the Royal Air Force.The HomeFront.Air raid damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40)249thConlusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Report, dated the14th September, by the Lord President of the Council (W.P. (40) 371)on air raid damage in the London area.The Lord President of the Council said that a further meeting had been held that morning of the Ministers concerned and he was now able to bring the information in his report up to date.Electricity,   Water  and   Gas.- No  further  substantialdamage had been sustained.[21753]b 2
Drainage. The statement in his Report that it would take several months to repair the pumping machinery wasinaccurate. The pumps had been repaired, and it was hopedthat the breached sewers could be repaired in two or threeweeks.Docks. No further major damage had been sustained.Railways. There had been a very definite improvement inmarshalling yards and depots. In the three days ended the16th September nearly 60 per cent, of the normal war traffichad been carried. The Southern Railway was still the line mostaffected.Food Stocks. The amount of sugar lost now amounted toa week&apos;s supply. Some copra (used for margarine) had alsobeen lost. The damage done to cold storage plants might makeit necessary to build further plants. The Minister of food would submit a report on this point.Raw Materials. Effect was being given to the stepsoutlined in the Report for the further dispersal of stocks.Assistance to Homeless Persons. The numbers in RestCentres had dropped from about 17,000 to 10,000 or 11,000, andthe Centres were functioning much more satisfactorily.Evacuation. The delegation of powers to Regional Com-missioners to authorise evacuation in cases of special emergencywas being communicated to them that day.Air raid shelter. The Prime Minister referred to a report in the Press that a body of people, looking for air raid shelter, had made their wayinto the Savoy Hotel. Episodes of this kind could easily lead to serious trouble.The Home Secretary said that there were some signs of organised demonstrations, especially by persons who came from theEast End into the West End, where they thought that better sheltercould be found. He agreed with the Prime Minister that it wouldbe necessary to take strong action to prevent demonstrations of thiskind, which if allowed to grow, might easily lead to serious difficulties.The Minister of Aircraft Production suggested that the base-ments of the banks in the East End might be opened up as shelters.The Home Secretary said that there was a good deal of shelterin the City which was not being used; but the fire risk must be takeninto consideration.The Lord Privy Seal stressed the need for publicity for themeasures which the Government was taking to deal with air raid damage and to assist homeless people. Unless these measuresreceived proper publicity, it was apt to be assumed that nothing was being done. The Minister of Health said that he wasarranging a Press Conference that afternoon for this purpose.The Prime Minister suggested to the Lord President of theCouncil that he might . make a statement on this subject inParliament on Wednesday, the 18th September.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Report by the Lord President of theCouncil (W.P. (40) 371) as supplemented orally, and invited the Lord President to continue to keep thisPublicity forGovernmentmeasures.
matter under review, in consultation with the Lord privy seal and the Minister without Portfolio.(2) Recorded the view that strong action should, if necessary,be taken to prevent organised demonstrations by bodies of people purporting to seek better shelter accom-modation.Parliament.Arrangementsfor Meetings ofboth Houses.(previous reference:W.M. (40)249thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Prime Minister said that when Parliament met on tuesday, the 17th September, he proposed to make a short statement in public session, in which he would mention the German prepara-tions for invasion, the great air successes in the last few days andthe position in the Middle East. He then proposed to invite theHouse to go into Secret Session. In Secret Session he would explain that, although certain precautionary measures had been taken that day, there was nevertheless a considerable risk in the House meetingat advertised times. It was not right that the meetings of the house should impose a special burden on the air defence of this country.He proposed that in future the time and date on which the Houseintended to meet should not be announced beforehand, nor shouldthe Press be allowed to state after the event at what time the Househad met. He invited the Minister of Information to issue suitableinstructions to the Press in regard to this matter, and covering bothHouses of Parliament.The War Cabinet took note with approval of this state-ment.Operation&quot; Menace.&quot;(previous references:W.M. (40) 235thConclusions,Minute 7,and 249thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Allies.Organisation ofAllied Naval,Army and air contingents.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 245thConclusions,Minute 8.)India.Proposedpromulgation ofRevolutionaryMovementOrdinance.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 217thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff (C.O.S. (40) 4 (O.)) relating to operation &quot; Menace.&quot;   Thediscussion  and  the  conclusions   rerecorded  in  theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.5. The War Cabinet took note of the Seventh Report by theChiefs of Staff on the organisation of the Allied Naval, Army andAir Contingents (W.P. (40) 367).6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (G.) (40) 237) as to the attitudeof Congress. Information had been received that Congress mightpass a resolution in the next few days which would bring them intoopen conflict with the Government of India. If this happened, theViceroy proposed, and the Secretary of State agreed, that theRevolutionary Movement Ordinance, suitably amended, should bepromulgated forthwith.The Secretary of State for India explained that this paper had been circulated as a precautionary measure, in case Congressshould pass a defiant resolution.  In his telegram to the Viceroy of
the 13th September he had stressed the importance of basing our action on the threat of anti-war activities on the part of Congress.It now seemed much less likely &quot;than two days earlier that congress would pass a resolution in the terms suggested, and he hadgood hope that it would not in fact prove necessary to take drastic action. He thought, however, that the Viceroy should be in aposition to take such action at once if the need arose.In discussion, the Lord Privy Seal said that, while one wingof Congress no doubt wanted to take extreme action, other elements in Congress by no means wanted to break with us. He deprecatedgiving the Viceroy carte blanche to take drastic action immediately on the passing of a resolution by Congress and without referenceto the War Cabinet. If any precipitate action was taken it mighthave very serious consequences.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs suggested that theViceroy should be informed in quite definite terms that, if it was clear that Congress was determined to embark on a campaign ofdefiance, the War Cabinet would not hesitate to agree to drastic action being taken immediately against the Congress leaders. Atthe same time, the War Cabinet should have an opportunity toconsider the situation created by any Congress resolution, before such action was taken.The Home Secretary said that he thought that Gandhi was rather alarmed at the way in which the situation had developed, andthat it was for this reason that he was indulging in vague language.General agreement was expressed with the Home Secretary&apos;suggestion.The Prime Minister said that he thought it was very important that the Viceroy should know that he would be supported in taking action against the Congress leaders, if they embarked on a defiantcourse.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for India to communicate to the Viceroy the War Cabinets views as shown in discussion.  These may be summarised as follows  (1) The Viceroy should be assured that the War cabinet would agree to the enactment of all necessary measures such as the Revolutionary MovementOrdinance, and to support firm action being taken against the Congress leaders, the moment it was established that Congress was determined to embark on a campaign of deliberate interference with theconduct of the war.(2) The War Cabinet, however, wished to have anopportunity of considering the actual situation created by any Congress resolution as soon as theresolution became known, before action was taken,&apos; and assumed that a delay of 24 hours would nothamper the Viceroy in this matter.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 16, 1940.
