Munitions T/he w,ar Cabinet had a provisional discussion on the munitions production.       Situation, and had before them the following Papers :-programme and priorities.(1) Memorandum by the Minister of Supply (W.P. (40) 339).(2) Memorandum by the Prime Minister (W.P. (40) 352).(3) Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production(W.P. (40) 360).(4) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (W.P.(40) 370).(5) Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (W.P. (40) 378).(6) Appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff on Future Strategy(W.P. (40) 362).The War Cabinet reached the following Conclusions : (a) The  existing programmes  of  the three  Services  werereaffirmed. The Ministers concerned were invited tomake sure that their programmes were stated in a conciseform, in order that all Departments concerned with the munitions programme should be fully acquainted withthe position.(b) Every effort must be made to complete the programmes bythe due dates. No delay in completion of the pro-grammes could be accepted at this stage. Nevertheless,it would be better to accept some lag in the completionof the programmes, rather than to truncate the pro-grammes themselves.(c) The available resources of labour, material, and industrial capacity must be allocated proportionately to the existing programmes, the basis of the allocation being determined in relation to strategic priority.(d) A system of double entry should be devised and administered by a central priority organisation, in order to check theuse made by Departments of the material allocated tothem, and to ensure that material urgently required byone Service is not being retained in anticipation of thefuture needs of some other Service.(e) Where bottle-necks occur, they must be determined by an arbitrary decision, based on the facts of the particular case.(/) The demand of the Minister of Aircraft Production for45,000 tons of alloy steel for the Quarter 1st October-31st December, 1940, was approved.(g) The proposal in the Secretary of State for War&apos;s Paper,that 300,000 men should be recruited from, within theUnited Kingdom in the period September 1940-March1941, inclusive, was approved.(h) A decision was deferred on the intake into the army in theperiod April-October 1941. But as this intake would materially affect the labour supply situation, it shouldbe reviewed within the next two months.(?&apos;) The Minister of Supply had ordered 25,000 vehicles in theUnited States, and was anxious to order another 35,000at an early date. This matter should be discussed withthe Treasury and an early decision reached.(j) The Minister of Supply wished to increase the order forrifles in the United States from 400,000 to 1,000,000.This order was approved, subject to the Treasury being satisfied that the increase could not be met by, e.g.,orders in India or Australia.(k) The Minister of Supply hoped to obtain increased capacity for the manufacture of small arms ammunition in theUnited States, and might invite the assistance of thePrime Minister in this matter.
Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 30, 1940.(I) The Secretary of State for War undertook to inform theMinister of Supply, within the next few days, whetherthe War Office would accept field guns of United Statespattern, the United States authorities being unwilling to manufacture guns to the pattern of our 25-pdr. Theview generally expressed was that, although it was undesirable to increase the number of different types of guns in the Army, we might well have to agree to acceptthe United States type of field gun.(m) General approval was given to the policy outlined inSection VI of the Paper by the Minister of Supply (W.P.(40) 339) for dealing with the ammunition programme.Under this plan, manufacturing capacity would beprepared, ready to produce at short notice the ammuni-tion which the guns could fire; but only a part of this capacity would be put into production forthwith, carebeing taken not to hamper immediate needs.(n) The Minister of Supply, the Minister of Aircraft Produc-tion and the Minister of Labour, acting in consultation,were authorised to give effect to a scheme wherebydirections were given to industrial firms, requiring themto train specified numbers of men and women.(o) Discussion on these questions should be. continued at afurther Meeting to be held in the near future.
