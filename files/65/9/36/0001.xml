Naval, Military 2.   The Secretary of State for Air reported that the casualties and Air for       previous day&apos;s fighting had been : Our own 3 machines (3 pilots safe).Operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 273rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy 7 certain.5 probable.6 damaged-Air Operations. During the previous night A.A. guns had brought down two enemy bombers for certain, and possibly a third.All the machines detailed to attack targets in Northern italy had not reached their objectives, but three targets had been bombed and good results had been reported. We had lost oneWhitley and crew; three Whitleys had fallen into the sea, but the crews had been saved.The Hampdens detailed to attack Berlin had had satisfactory results. One pilot had come down to 2,000 feet and droppedfour 500-lb. bombs on the Chancellery. One Hampden had been lost. All the Wellingtons had returned and had reportedsatisfactory results.Pour Italian aircraft from the Dodecanese had bombed the oil refinery at Bahrein in the early hours of the 19th October. Thisraid was worthy of note as the distance flown had beenapproximately 2,600 miles.Twenty-four enemy aircraft had flown over London between12 o&apos;clock and 5&quot;45 p.m. that afternoon. Owing to the clouds manyof these aircraft had been flying at low altitudes, and one had come down as low as 3,000 to 4,000 feet.Naval The  Vice-Chief of Naval Staff reported that a number of operations.       M.T.B&apos;s. had made a sweep off Ostend the previous night, and hadencountered some German trawlers.   One M T.B. had been sunk.A Red Sea convoy, escorted by a cruiser and two destroyers,had been attacked the previous night by Italian destroyers offMassawa.   No damage had been reported, but one Italian destroyerhad run ashore and had finally blown up.Two Italian submarines had been sunk east of Gibraltarduring the week-end.United States A further eight United States destroyers were now on theirdestroyers. way across the Atlantic. So far only three United States(Previous destroyers were in service.Reference:&apos;W.M. (40) 268thConclusions,Minute 1.) :Shipping Losses. The shipping losses over the previous week-end had beenthe worst ever experienced. At least 14 ships had been torpedoedin one convoy and 11 in another, although it was possible thatsome of these ships were still afloat. The Germans had employednew tactics, attacking the convoy at night, in conditions in whichvisibility was less than 1 mile. It seemed certain that R.D.P.was now being used by the enemy to locate convoys.The Admiralty were taking all steps possible to deal with thenew situation.Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that on theOperations: 16th October three small parties of enemy M.T. had movedEgypt. 20 miles along the road from Sidi Barrani  towards Matruh.Later the same day 30-40 enemy M.T. had been located in campnear the same spot, and the Support Group of the 7th armoured division had attempted to attack them. The enemy, however,had withdrawn towards Sidi Barrani.
Italiandispositions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 271stConclusions,Minute 1.)The Italian Desert Force under General Maletti was still inthe desert some 40 miles south-west of Sidi Barrani, and wasbeing carefully watched by our reconnaissances.The number of Italian Divisions in this theatre was now estimated to be:  .3 in the Sidi Barrani area,1 at Sollum,Possibly 1 on the lines oftwo places, making a total ofand the Maletti column.communication between these5, together with a tank groupA 6th Division was at Bardia, 20 miles north-west of Sollum.Italian A telegram had been received from the Commander-in-Chief,casualties. Middle East, giving the comparative figure of Italian losses andour own in Libya since the beginning of the war.   The firstItalian casualty list had been missed, but the remainder showed800 killed, 1,701 wounded, 861 missing to the end of September.Our own casualties over the same period had been 66 killed,68 wounded, 36 missing.Abyssinia. The Sandford Force had penetrated south of Lake Tana.Military successes in Africa were, however, needed to give therevolt some encouragement.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raids.Damage and effect on civilianmorale.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 272ndConclusions,Minute 7.)TilburyStepneyshelter,2. The Home Secretary said that on the previous night about70 people had been killed and 300 seriously injured in London.A fair amount of damage had also been done to railway communi-cations.Reference was made to the effect of air raids on public morale.There was comment that the A.A. barrage had decreased, and somedisappointment that more enemy bombers were not brought down at night. Press statements to the effect that an antidote to the night bombers might be expected shortly had not been realised,with the result that Londoners were at the moment a littlepessimistic.The Lord Privy Seal stated that the Prime Minister had held a Meeting that morning at which the question of the best meansof combating night bombers had been fully dealt with.The Home Secretary said that the public had been excludedfrom this shelter while work was in progress on the structuralimprovements. When an air raid warning had sounded the shelterhad. not been opened quickly. Some disorder had followed, and a party had attempted to rush the A.R.P. Control Office in Stepney.The Police had drawn their truncheons, and a number of men hadbeen arrested. The Daily Worker had made strong complaintabout the Police action, but as far as he (the Home Secretary)could see, the Police had been fully justified.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
foreign information.U.S.S.E.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 273rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Turkey.China.United States ofAmerica.Spain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 273rdConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the following information : Recent telegrams from Sir Stafford Cripps showed that theprospects of a trade or barter agreement with the U.S.S.R. werepromising, and that the discussions between the Turkish Ambas-ambassador and M. Molotov had been satisfactory. (Telegrams Nos. 878and 888 from Moscow.)According to the latest telegram from Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen (No. 40 from Istanbul), Turkey was adopting a satis-factorily firm attitude in face of German pressure.Three telegrams from Sir A. Clark Kerr (Nos. 141-143 fromChunking) reported two long talks with Marshal Chiang Kai-shekas to China&apos;s desire for closer co-operation. These telegramsdeserved close consideration, but it was doubtful whether wecould do much in regard to them until after the presidential election.The Foreign Secretary said that he had only had a few minutes&apos;discussion with Lord Lothian since the latter&apos;s arrival in thiscountry. Lord Lothian had reported the almost miraculouschange of opinion in the United States after it had become clearthat this country was effectively resisting the German air attack.Sir Samuel Hoare had seen General Franco who had been atpains to explain that the ministerial changes meant no change in policy. (Telegram 886 from Madrid.) He was circulating to theWar Cabinet a despatch from Sir Samuel Hoare which gave agood deal of the background to the appointment of a new ForeignMinister. The general impression was that Senor Sufier wouldnot be able to drag Spain into the war, because that would bringfamine to Spain.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Press:Objectionablearticles.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 272ndConclusions,Minute 5.)King Leopold.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theBelgian Ambassador had been to see him that morning to complainabout an article in the Sunday Despatch of the previous day,entitled &quot; The Real Guilty Men.&quot; The particular passage corn-plained of ran as follows : &quot; It is plain that King Leopold has to be tried by his own people and the world for what many of us think was hisdeliberate treason to them and us, and either acquittedas a foolish weakling, unfit to govern a brave people, or elsecondemned and executed......   If he is guilty, he shoulddie. What is one life to the sweetening of the world by suchan execution.....Such an article played straight into German hands, and pro-vided perfect material for their propaganda.In discussion, the view was expressed that, objectionable asthe article was, it was impossible to stop attacks being made onthe Kirig of the Belgians, or to muzzle a well-known writer likeH. G. Wells. Further, it was probably well recognised that. G. Wells in no way represented public opinion in this country.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the foreign secretary should make representations on this subject to Mr. E.Harmsworth.The War Cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary to take this course.
Labour.Provision of machine Toolsfor GovernmentTrainingCentres.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 257thConclusions,Minute 9.)A&quot;5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister without Portfolio (W.P. (G.) (40) 267) setting out his proposals for adjusting the demands made by the Minister ofLabour for machine tools for Government Training Establish-ments.The Minister without Portfolio explained that his recom-mendations were as follows : (i) Second-hand Machine Tools. Every effort should be madeto meet the demand for 2,250 second-hand tools. Thedemand should not, however, be given an absolute priority; discretion should be left to the Machine ToolController to deal with special cases where there mightbe interference with urgently needed immediateproduction. A monthly report should be submitted tohim (the Minister without Portfolio) showing theextent to which the demands for second-hand machine tools were being met, and, so far as they were beingrefused, the nature of the production work which hadbeen given preference.(ii) New Machine Tools. If it was not possible to modify theMinister of Labour&apos;s scheme so that training needingnew tools could be ca,rried out in factories, each of theProduction Departments would have to make a smallcontribution of new tools to the Ministers training scheme for a limited period, at the end of which thesituation could again be reviewed.The Minister without Portfolio said that his scheme had thegeneral support of the Minister of Supply and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, at any rate so far as concerned second-hand tools.The Minister of Aircraft Production did not agree that either new or second-hand tools should be allocated to the Training Centres,and wished every available machine tool brought into immediateproduction.Tlie Minister of Labour and National Service said that he wished to press for his original requirement of 2,250 second-handtools and 750 new tools within the next 30 weeks. The minister made the following points : (1) A high proportion of persons trained in his centres werebeing  sent  to  factories for which the Minister  of aircraft Production was responsible.(2) A very high proportion of persons trained in his centreswere being retained in the factories to Which they were sent.(3) To a large extent the phrase &quot; semi-skilled workers &quot; wasa misnomer. The trainees from his centres werenormally ready to begin immediate production.(4) He could put machine tools to better uses than those towhich they were sometimes put. He gave instances of machine tools being installed in unfinished factories.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that a general approval shouldbe given to the recommendations made in W.P. (G) (40) 267, which appeared to hold the balance fairly between the interests of theDepartments concerned. It seemed right that the Minister ofLabour should have the use of a proportion of new tools, in orderthat the latter part of the training in his centres could be given ontools similar to those in use in actual production.The War Cabinet-7ar Cabinet (a) Gave  general   approval   to   the  recommendationsW.P. (G; (40) 267 :in
(b) Accepted, as  regards  second-hand machine  tools, therecommendations at &quot; A &quot; above.(c) Authorised the  Minister without  Portfolio to take thefinal decisions as to the allocation, of a proportion ofnew tools to the Ministry of Labour Centres, from the quotas available to the Production Departments, this contribution from the Production Departments wouldbe for a limited period of time, at the end of which thesituation would again be reviewed.Shipping.Sale of Vesselsordered by theGovernment toShipowners whohave lostVessels duringthe War.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 266thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping (W.P. (G) (40) 266), to which was appendedthe terms of the undertaking to the shipowners given in cmd. 6218,After a further exchange of views, it was decided to adjourn the discussion to a Meeting at which the Prime Minister could be present.Richmond Ten-ace, S.W..1,October 21, 1940.
