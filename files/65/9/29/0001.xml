Naval, Militaryand air operations,(previous reference:W.M. (40) 266thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.MilitaryOperations:Middle East.Italiandispositions.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that bad weather hadrestricted activity on both sides. On the previous day machine-gunattacks had been made on several small towns and villages andR.A.F. stations. The damage had been comparatively slight, but atNortholt several aircraft had been wrecked and offices and hangarshad been damaged.Our aircraft had attacked Diepholz aerodrome and Calais.Two armed merchant vessels had been attacked by three Hudsonsoff Horn&apos;s Reef, but results had not been observed. One of theHudsons had been lost. The total casualties during the twenty-four hours ended that morning had been Enemy 2 lost.1 damaged.Our Own 2 lost.The First Sea Lord reported various Fleet movements. An air reconnaissance of Taranto had shown five Italian battleships in harbour. A British 7,000-ton tanker had been damaged by a torpedoattack the previous evening. We had sunk one Italian U-Boat offLorient.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that therewas no indication of any early Italian advance on the western desert Front. There was no sign of any German formations havingarrived in Libya.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff described our dis-positions at Mersa Matruh and Siwa and the Italian dispositionsat Sollum and Sidi Barrani, at each of which places two divisions were now present.The Prime Minister said that this was the first occasion onwhich the War Cabinet had been informed that as many as four enemy divisions were in forward positions. It was important thatthey should be notified immediately of the arrival of any new enemydivisions at the Front.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Far East.Attitude of theUnited States.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 265thConclusions,Minutes 5and 7.)2. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to Washingtontelegrams Nos. 2209 and 2212. The first of these telegrams reportedMr. Cordell Hull&apos;s reactions, which had been very satisfactory, toHis Majesty&apos;s Governments message about the reopening of the burma Road, and about the proposed joint technical discussions on defence in the Pacific. The second telegram reported that theUnited States Navy Department had inquired how far our basefacilities at Singapore could be placed at the disposal of the UnitedStates Fleet, in the event of trouble in the Far East. The telegrammentioned specifically the contingencies (a) of a hostile Japanese reaction to the reopening of the burma Road, and(b) of a threat of Japanese action against the Dutch east indies, before a Japanese declaration of war.He was sending an answer, which had been drafted in con-sultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty, to the effect thatthe whole of the facilities at Singapore would be at the disposalof the United States Fleet, except in so far as those facilities were needed for our own warships. He had added that, if the navy department wanted any further information, they should let usknow.
Spain. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionGibraltar. to Madrid telegram No. 825 commenting on the revised draft State-previous ment on Anglo-Spanish relations.   Sir Samuel BZoare agreed withReference: the revised draft, but wished to insert in paragraph 3 (which dealtW.M. (40) 266th with Gibraltar) after &quot; in this spirit &quot; the words &quot; and in the beliefConclusions, that all outstanding questions can be amicably settled between the minute 7.)        two countries.&quot;He was disposed to accept Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s amendment and hoped that it might be possible for the Prime Minister to make thestatement in the course of his speech on the following day.The War Cabinet agreed that this amendment should beaccepted.Germany andItaly.Herr von ribbentrop&apos;visit to Rome.Air operations against Italy.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Ankara telegram No. 1290 containing a report that Herr von ribbentrop&apos;s visit to Rome had been made with the object of keeping-Italy in the war. The result was believed to be that Italy wouldfight on, but not for an indefinite time. The report also mentioned the great moral effect of our bombing of the Northern Italian towns.The Secretary of State for A. ir said that these operations wouldbe resumed as soon as the weather permitted.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Blockade 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that, since, the discussion in policy. War Cabinet on the 4th October, he had been in consultation withThe Atlantic the Minister for Economic Warfare. Taking first the suggestionCoast and the that we should decide not to hamper trade between Spain and western Morocco, the Foreign Secretary said that this trade would be largelyMediterranean, with the Atlantic ports of Morocco, and principally with Casablanca.(Previous Provided that the trade was on a barter basis, the Minister for reference: Economic Warfare and he saw no objection to allowing it to beW.M. (40) 266th opened. Nor did they see objection to a decision not to interfereConclusions, with trade between the French Mediterranean ports and the FrenchMinute 4.)        North African ports.More difficult questions arose in connection with the proposal that the Navy should stop all trade coming to the FrenchMediterranean ports from the Atlantic whether or not escorted byVichy Government warships. This trade might come from WestAfrica, from the Atlantic ports of Morocco or from across the atlantic.The Foreign Secretary said that the objects he wished to securewere as follows : (1) To keep Morocco quiet and prosperous. We might con-conceivably modify the rigour of our proposed new policy by encouraging Moroccan traders to use Oran instead ofCasablanca.(2) To make our contraband control as effective as possible.His Majesty&apos;s Representative in Tangier had alreadyreported that there was a growing trickle of trade with france. It would assume larger proportions if we werenot careful.The Prime minister said that this was a message of the highest importance. It showed how great a mistake Japan had made inaffronting the Americans. The Navy Departments message hadevidently crossed his own message to President Roosevelt.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
(3) To avoid any unfavourable reactions in Spain, portugal and the Azores.(4) To avoid any further retaliatory attacks on Gibraltar.(5) To avoid any open conflict with Vichy Government war-ships.His conclusion was that we should go ahead with our efforts to reach a modus vivendi with Vichy and should attempt to secure,as part of the general arrangements, an agreement regulating thetrade between France and the French Colonial Empire. We shouldhave to make it plain to Vichy that we reserved full liberty as tothe methods by which we conducted our economic warfare.The Prime Minister thought that we should tell the Frenchnow, through our Ambassador &quot;&quot;in Madrid, that the trade with theWest African ports must stop although we would not interferewith any ships from these ports that were now on their way to french Mediterranean Ports. He was not worried about the tradeinside the Mediterranean, which could proceed. The appeasementof Vichy was not worth while if it meant allowing this trade between West African ports ancl the unoccupied zones of france to go on. He doubted whether, if we stopped this trade, the vichy government would provoke an incident. If they bombed Gibraltarwe would retaliate by bombarding Casablanca.The Minister for Economic Warfare said that he agreed withthe Prime Minister. It was a reasonably good offer to the vichy government not to interfere with trade east of Gibraltar but only with trade through the Straits. So far as barter deals were concerned, they could go free West of Gibraltar. He hoped that theCabinet realised that trade was already proceeding through theStraits. A French ship with 14,000 tons of crude oil and anothersaid to have aircraft parts had already passed through the Straits.Unless something was done soon our blockade of West African portswould become a farce.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that if wewere faced with a choice between obtaining a modus vivendi with vichy or letting the blockade go, he would maintain the blockade,even if it meant firing on French ships. The problem was how best to play our cards with the Vichy Government. Fie was quite prepared to say to them that, pending any results from the talks,the Vichy Government must understand that we could not varyour blockade either inside or outside the Mediterranean. But he did not wish us to be forced into the position of having to fire on french ships until our efforts to obtain a modus vivendi had failed.Should the Vichy Government accept our conditions, he would liketo discuss with the Minister for Economic Warfare the policy ofdealing with the West African trade under a Contraband control system rather than on the basis of a blockade.The Minister for Economic Warfare said that he would preferusing a stronger phrase than &quot; vary the blockade,&quot; for our blockadeat this moment was ineffective. In effect the Vichy Governmentshould be told that the trade now passing through the Straits wouldbe stopped.The Secretary of State for the Colonies attached importanceto the immediate stoppag-e of trade from the West African ports.These ports were now beginning to export their surplus stocks toFrance. Once they were allowed to do this the value of our blockadepressure would be lost.The First Sea Lord pointed out that the policy proposedassumed for its success that the French would not bomb us out of gibraltar. We could not keep heavy ships at Gibraltar withoutfighter aircraft protection.    If we could not keep a Fleet at
(previous reference:W.M. (40)264thConclusions,Minute 6.)Gibraltar, it would be impossible for us to maintain a blockade of the Western end of the Mediterranean with Naval forces basedon the United Kingdom and Freetown. The trade with West Africawas not, he thought, of great importance, and it was for considera-tion whether it was worth while, in order to stop that trade, to take action which involved the risk that the French might bomb us at gibraltar. He would prefer, therefore, that we should maintainthe blockade of Metropolitan France and North Africa as a singleunit, stopping, for example, all trade between that unit and america.The First Sea Lord added that the trade at present passing through the Straits was using Spanish territorial waters. The useof a larger Naval force would be involved if we were to stop shipspassing through the Straits before they entered Spanish territorial waters.Some discussion then took place on the extent of the exports from West African ports. It was suggested that, although thenormal trade from these ports might be small, if we allowed trade between these ports and France they might be used as an entrepotfor the French Atlantic trade.The Prime Minister said that he deprecated the conclusion thatthe French would react to our blockade of the West African trade by trying to bomb us out of Gibraltar. If we allowed this possibilityto influence our policy, we should have to give way to the vichy government all along the line. He did not think that Governmentcould carry the French people with it to-day in a policy of war withthis country. There was an increasing longing among the peopleof France for our victory.The Foreign Secretary suggested that he should telegraph atonce to Sir Samuel Hoare, instructing him to tell the french ambassador that we expected a reply urgently to the communication which we had made through him to the Vichy Government, since,pending the issue of conversations with that Government, we mustmaintain all our rights of blockade.In the meantime the Admiralty should continue to collect a naval force stationed on Gibraltar.The Prime Minister agreed with this suggestion. For themoment it was not necessary to reach any further decision, but wecould not afford to allow trade to continue to pass through theStraits for any length of time while discussions with the vichy government continued. He wished to emphasise that, for his part,he was satisfied that we must face the threat of a French attack onGibraltar if we interfered with their trade through the Straits.The War Cabinet:-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to send a telegram toour Ambassador at Madrid, on the lines indicated at &quot; X.&quot;The Press. g    The Prime Minister drew attention to an article in theSubversive Siunday Pictorial on the 29th September. This article, which hadarticles. contained a lot of false information, had characterised the Dakaraffair as &quot; another Blunder,&quot; and had used language of an insultingcharacter to the Government. In the issue of the same journal ofthe previous day (Sunday, the 6th October) great prominence hadbeen given to an article published by Mr. H. G. Wells in an obscurepamphlet (the Bulletin of the Labour Book Service). This articlehad contained a slashing attack on Field-Marshal Sir EdmundIronside and General Viscount Gort. The general tenor ofMr. H. G. WelTs article, reproduced in the Sunday Pictorial had
been that, until the Army was better led, we stood no chance ofbeating the Germans.The same issue of the Sunday Pictorial had contained a leadingarticle by the Editor, containing a scurrilous attack on several members of the Government, and obviouslv seeking to undermineconfidence in the Government. Much the same line had been takenin the leading article in that morning&apos;s Daily Mirror.The immediate purpose of these articles seemed to be to affectthe discipline of the Army, to attempt to shake the stability of theGovernment, and to make trouble between the Government and organised labour. In his considered judgment there was far morebehind these articles than disgruntlement or frayed nerves. they stood for something most dangerous and sinister, namely, anattempt to bring about a situation in which the country would beready for a surrender peace.It was not right that anyone bearing his heavy responsibilitiesshould have to submit to attacks of this nature upon his Govern-ment. It was intolerable that any newspaper should indulge incriticism and abuse, far beyond what was tolerated in times of acuteParty strife, in a time of great national peril.The War Cabinet were informed that the Daily Mirror and the sunday Pictorial were owned by a combine. A large number of shares were held by bank nominees, and it had not been possible toestablish what individual, if any, exercised the controlling financial interest of the newspaper. It was believed, however, thatMr. I. Sieff had a large interest in the paper, and that Mr. CecilHarmsworth King was influential in the conduct of the paper.The War Cabinet were also informed by the Attorney-general as to the legal position under Regulation 2 (d). If the Secretaryof State was satisfied that there was a systematic publication ofmatter which, in his opinion, was calculated to foment oppositionto the successful prosecution of the war, he could take steps to stop the printing, publication and distribution of that paper. action under this Regulation would be an executive act of Government and did not involve Court proceedings. If, however, the government also seized the printing presses, action could be taken in the Courtswith a view to obtaining permission to use the printing pressesagain.Discussion ensued as to whether action could be taken in regardto the article about Field-Marshal Sir Edmund Ironside andGeneral Viscount Gort under the Regulation which dealt with intent to seduce troops from obeying their orders. The Attorney-General pointed out that the Defence Regulation in question dealtwith incitement to disobey orders of a far more direct characterthan was contained in this particular article.The Lord President of the Council said that he was satisfiedthat it would be wrong to attempt to stop publication of these articles by a criminal prosecution in the Courts. If action wastaken it must be executive action, taken . under the defence regulations, and any appeal against the action taken would be toParliament itself, and not to any court of law. He thought thatwhoever was responsible for these newspapers should be given a clear warning and told that the warning would not be repeated.In the course of discussion the view was advanced that,although the articles in question were most objectionable andscurrilous, to proceed against these newspapers, which made a widepopular appeal on account of their pictures, might do more harm than good.The view generally expressed by the War Cabinet was,however, that the conduct of these newspapers represented someunscrupulous and dangerous purpose, the ulterior motive of which
was certainly not the commercial motive of profit, and that thecontinuance of these malicious articles should not he tolerated.The Minister of Aircraft Production thought that an approachcould properly be made through the Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association. This Association had considerable disciplinary actions, which he thought they would be prepared to exercise. TheAssociation would realise, at least as strongly as the War Cabinet,the disadvantages of action being taken by the Government to suppress a newspaper, and would wish to avoid recourse to this procedure.The Home Secretary said that the War Cabinet would appreciate that he was new to this matter, and had not followed theline adopted by these two newspapers. An important Parlia-mentary issue was involved. If these newspapers were suppressed,it would no doubt be argued in some quarters that suppression hadbeen carried out because criticisms had been made of individual members of the Government or of Generals. The Governmentwould be told that the troubles in France had had their origin inthe drastic suppression of all criticism by the French Government.Furthermore, he had a quasi-judicial function to exercise, and hewould therefore wish for some further time to consider the matter.The Lord President of the Council pointed out that the matterneed not necessarily be decided by reference to the existing defence regulations. While still Home Secretary he had given instructions for a new Regulation to be drafted in somewhat wider terms thanthe existing Regultion 2 (d).The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thesolution which he hoped to see adopted and which he thought was generally favoured, was that two members of the War cabinet should see the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association and explain thesituation to them. The articles complained of should be shown tothe Association, and it should be made clear that the Governmentwas not prepared to allow continued publication of such articles.It should also be made clear that, if the Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association were not ready or able to take action to stop furtherpublication of such articles, the Government would have to dealwith the matter in some other way.It was clear, however, that, before action could be taken onthese lines, the War Cabinet must decide definitely that they wereprepared to take action against these newspapers if necessary. Inview, however, of the fact that the Home Secretary had a quasi-judicial function to perform, it would clearly be right to defer adecision in order to give him time for further consideration.The War Cabinet:  Adjourned the discussion of this question to a later meeting.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 7, 1940.
