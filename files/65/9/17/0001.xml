This information is containedin the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.3. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs referred to telegram No. 215 from Sir Samuel Hoare, which stated that there had been a good deal of German propaganda inthe Spanish Press relating to our use of fire leaves, and thesuggestion that they had a toxic effect. This propaganda might mean that Germany was preparing to use gas against this country.[21773-1]B 2
At the Prime Ministers suggestion the War Cabinet : Invited the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and minister of Home Security to review our precautions against the use of gas by the enemy, including the stocksof bleach powder.United States ofAmerica.Supply ofMunitions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 254thConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Prime Minister said that, in the course of thenegotiations with the United States Government in regard to thesupply of munitions and the grant of base facilities, the UnitedStates Government had said that they wished to refer, in theexchange of correspondence, only to the supply of 50 Destroyers.But they had indicated clearly that we should receive the further250,000 rifles, 20 motor torpedo-boats, the 150 aircraft on order forSweden, and 10 large flying boats. He had instructed the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to telephone to Lord Lothianthat day, and to explain to him that we regarded ourselves as having been promised these munitions, and that we felt the lack ofthem very severely. If need be, he (the Prime Minister) would send a personal message to President Roosevelt on the matter. He also attached importance to the rifles being despatched quickly. It hadbeen stated that the Purvis Commission had insisted on re-packingthe previous consignments, and had thereby caused considerable delay.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had seen it. stated that the United States Government intended to makeit a condition of the supply of these 250,000 rifles that 20,000 ofthem should be handed over to the Eire Government. If it was intended that the Eire Government should receive 20,000 rifles, thematter should be so arranged that the initiative appeared to comefrom this country.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Air Raid 5.   The Home Secretary said that Waterloo, Victoria and damage. London Bridge Stations were now restored to partial working.(Previous The bombs which had fallen on or near the Scottish Office, the reference: Foreign Office and the Ministry of Aircraft Production had causedW.M. (40) 254th little damage.Conclusions, He had visited some of the tube railways to see how far theyMinute 4.) were being used as air raid shelters, and the character of thepersons who took refuge there.A discussion on shelter policy followed, in which the PrimeMinister suggested that tickets might be issued for admission tothe large multiple-unit type of domestic shelters. By this meanseach person would know where he ought to take shelter.The Home Secretary said that one of the first measures to betaken would be to bring into use, as public shelters at night, base-ments under warehouses, shops and other commercial buildings.The Secretary of State for War thought that the photographsin the Press of ruined houses and buildings were giving anexaggerated idea of the general aspect of London in the presenttime. It was bad propaganda, and it was disturbing to Londonersin the Fighting Services who were serving at a distance from their homes.The War Cabinet (a) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a memorandum containing his further recommendations on shelterpolicy.
Air raid warnings.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 253rdConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Airreferred to the decision that the &quot; red &quot; warning should not normally be given during hours of daylight in the London area on accountof the presence of a single enemy aircraft. The public had notbeen informed of this change in practice, and would be likely to blame Fighter Command in cases where bombs were droppedalthough the &quot; red &quot; warning had not been given. The commissioner of Police for the Metropolis had said that there was strong feeling in two districts of London where bombs had been dropped on theprevious day, although no &quot; red &quot; warning had been given.The Prime Minister said that it was essential to give a leadin the direction of not allowing dislocation of production and of normal activities over wide areas, on account of a single aircraft.The decision that the &quot; red &quot; warning should not be given in theLondon area on account of a single aircraft must be adhered to.For the moment he was opposed to making any public statement onthe subject. Later, if need be, the matter could be explained inParliament.The Prime Minister also stated that at a Meeting of ministers held on Monday it had been arranged that weekly returns should beobtained from the principal Departments to show the working hourslost through air raid warnings. These returns should be circulatedto all the Departments concerned, in order that each might see howits practice compared with that of others.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The Black-Out.(previous reference:W.M. (40)Conclusions,Minute     .)7.   The War Cabinet had before thern the Report (W.P. (40)375) of a Committee appointed to review the Black-out position.The Report showed, inter alia: that certain improvements in strict lighting weretechnically practicable, including a dual system ofcentrally controlled street lighting in the centres of towns;that, if these improvements were to be adopted, it wouldbe necessary to ensure that the lights were extinguishedbefore a hostile aircraft arrived within 15 miles, and thatthis would necessitate a reliable warning of at least10 minutes.The Report also recommended that the following preparatorysteps should now be taken :(a) A review should be made of the Air Raid warning system and the possibility of introducing asupplemental system of localised area warningsexamined.(b) A full scale test should be made of the visibility ofdifferent intensities of lighting.(c) The views of local authorities should be ascertainedand they should be invited to prepare schemes fortheir areas.(d) Experiments on deception lighting should be continued.[Paragraph 50 (9).]After a short discussion the Prime Minister suggested that itwas not necessary to reach a final decision that day.  Meanwhile the(b) Invited the Minister of Information to take steps to securethat the Press did not, by their choice of photographs,give an exaggerated picture of the damage done toLondon.
preparatory steps recommended by the Committee should be putin hand forthwith, together with such other steps as might berequired to enable the streets to be cheerfully illuminated in thefollowing November, should that be found possible when the time came without unnecessary risk.The Home Secretary and the Minister of Health were afraid that many local authorities would be unwilling to run the risks involved in adopting improved street lighting. At any rate, theywould not be willing to pay for it, and a new burden might fall upon the Exchequer.Mr. Rucker said that he did not think that the provision ofthe necessary equipment would prove a limiting factor, or wouldtake a long time.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the necessary preparatory steps on the lines suggested in paragraph 50 (9) of W.P. (40) 375 shouldbe taken forthwith.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 20, 1940.
