Operation&quot; Menace.&quot;(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 256thConclusions,Minute 1/)Issue of a communique.Attitude of theUnited StatesGovernment.1. The First Sea Lord reported that the visibility at Dakaron the previous day had not exceeded two miles and the Cumberlandhad engaged the shore batteries at 4,000 yards. This explained the damage which she had received. General de Gaulle&apos;s emissary had landed at about 7 - 30 on the previous morning, but his proposals hadbeen rejected and he had returned wounded, having encounteredresolute opposition. About 2 p.m. General de Gaulle had attempteda landing at Rufique, but owing to fog it had been impossible tocarry out the operation before dark. The forces had therefore been withdrawn with the intention of resuming operations that morning.An ultimatum expiring at that time had been sent to the Dakarauthorities. Later in the&apos;meeting the War Cabinet was informedthat a French submarine had attacked the battle fleet, and, on beingdepth-charged, had surfaced and shown the white flag.The First Sea Lord drew the attention of the War Cabinet toa communique which had been received from General de Gaulle inregard to the operations at Dakar during the previous day, andwhich he asked should be published. The last sentence of thiscommunique referred to the withdrawal of General de Gaulle&apos;stroops and ships owing to his not wishing to be a party to a fightbetween Frenchmen. This (which was no doubt intended for Frenchears) might easily give an impression that the operations were atan end. The question was raised whether the communique shouldbe published in the English Papers. It was pointed out that the communique had been telegraphed en clair and had probably alreadyappeared in the American newspapers. The attention of the WarCabinet was also called to a statement issued by the Vichy Govern-ment to the effect that the British had attempted, after 1 a.m. that morning, a series of landings which had been repulsed with heavy losses.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information to issue to the press the communique prepared by General de Gaulle,accompanied by a statement that there was no truth in thereports emanating from Vichy regarding attempted Britishlandings.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet a telegram from Washington (No. 2352) which showed that president Roosevelt approved of the Dakar operation, and was prepared to exercise his influence with the Vichy Government toprevent them from declaring war. The Foreign Secretary also read the reply sent by the Prime Minister.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.2.   The Chief of the Air Staff reported that the air casualtiesfor the previous day had been as follows : Our own 11 machines (8 pilots safe).Enemy 12 certain.6 probable.6 damaged.Air Operations: The previous night 193 bombers had taken part in operations;attack on Berlin. 120 had been despatched to Berlin and 60 to the Channel ports.Of those sent to Berlin 75 per cent, had reached the target and successful results had been obtained on various gasworks, power stations and other targets in the Berlin area.     Our losses had[21773-3] b 2Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 256thConclusions,Minute 2.)?
amounted to one heavy bomber manned by Czechs and one heavy bomber manned by British. Another of our bombers had crashedbut the crew was safe.During the previous five nights our bombers had taken part in683 &quot;sorties&quot; with a loss of only 4 machines including the abovecasualties.Naval The First Sea Lord reported that the Submarine Tuna had sunkOperations.       a merchant vessel of 8,000 tons off Bordeaux.Two hours ago it had been reported that 7 German mine-sweepers were sweeping in the Channel 9 miles W.S.W. of Dover.A medium bomber force with a fighter escort had been ordered toattack.Enemy attacks A ship of 550 tons had been sunk off Cromer on the previouson shipping.      night by an E-boat.It was now reported that a further ship had been sunk in thein-coming convoy bound for the Clyde which had suffered so heavily.Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there wasOperations:       nothing of importance to record.Middle East. Enemy air attacks had been made against Alexandria andMersa Matruh harbour and station. It was believed that some damage had been done to the station.In the raid on Haifa on the 21st September, Arab propertyhad suffered extensive damage, but it was not thought that the hitsto the refinery would seriously interfere with refining.The &quot;War Cabinet took note of these statements.Air Raid 3.   The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that on the damage. previous day the main enemy activity had been directed against(Previous London, and had been rather more intense than on recent nights.Reference -        The main force of the attack had been directed against communica-W M (40) 255th tions, with the result that Liverpool Street Station and the BrightonConclusions &quot;    nne at- Wandsworth Common were blocked.

Full details were not yet available.   Direct hits had beensustained by several shelters, and the casualties had been ratherheavier than on the preceding two or three nights.The Prime Minister referred to reports issued by the Germansthat they had now dropped 22,000 tons of bombs on this country.It would be worth while for the Air Staff to calculate whether this statement was near the mark. It seemed clear that the air attackon this country had been most ineffectual in relation to the weightof the attack delivered.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements, and invited the Chief ofthe Air Staff to make an estimate, on the lines suggestedby the Prime Minister; as to the weight of air attackdelivered against this country.The Far East. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thePosition in War Cabinet would have seen the many telegrams about the positionIndo-China. in Indo-China.   Japanese forces had entered Indo-China and had(Previous established themselves.   It would seem that the Japanese had made reference: an agreement with the French authorities which would enable themW.M.

War Cabinet in a day or so.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
United States.Supply ofMunitions:anti-aircraft guns.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 255thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that in thevarious requests we had made to the United States for munitionshe had seen no reference to anti-aircraft guns. Was this worthexamining ?The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that GeneralStrong had mentioned this matter to him on his recent visit. Hethought that the United States Government had no anti-aircraft guns immediately available which would be of value to us, but thatsome might be available early in 1941.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War to enquire further into this suggestion.OverseasEvacuation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 254thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Prime Minister referred to the sinking of the City ofBenares with the loss of a number of women and children. He was anxious that the scheme for evacuating children overseas should now be discontinued.The Secretary of State for Home A ffairs said that he had asked the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Dominions to convene a meeting of the Council of the Children&apos;s OverseasReception Scheme that day and to ascertain their views. he gathered that there was strong feeling against a complete discon-tinuance of the scheme.The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to an article in the evening News the previous night attacking the Government inconnection with this scheme. He hoped it would not be necessaryto make a public statement on the additional risks to which ships were now exposed in the North-Western Approaches. He also mentioned that a fast ship with a number of children on board was due to leave that night for South Africa.The War Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to submit a report to the WarCabinet on the whole matter at an early date. In themeantime, so far as practicable, steps should be taken to postpone further sailings of children under the scheme.Prisoners of 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theWar. Secretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 379).Removal The Secretary of State for War said that there were 850overseas. prisoners of war in this country.   The number was being added toat the rate of about 100- a week. He would like to send up to 1,000prisoners to Newfoundland, but before doing so he sought the specificapproval of the War Cabinet to the policy involved.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he hadno doubt that the Newfoundland Government, when approached,would agree to this request. There might, however, be some difficultyin regard to providing guards, and some time would be necessaryto complete the construction of the camp.The War Cabinet-Agreed in principle with the policy of sending prisoners ofwar overseas, and that the Newfoundland Governmentshould be asked to accept 1,000 if the camp could becompleted before the winter set in.
8. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by theMinister of Supply (W.P. (G.) (40) 240 and 243).In the former Memorandum the Minister explained that, as aresult of action taken by the United States Defence AdvisoryCommittee, the exports of machine tools from America had beenput under licence, and we were now required to justify eachpurchase. Unless the United States Government could be persuaded to take a more favourable view of our requirements, and to release the machine tools on order by us in the States, our munitions programme might suffer a serious setback.The second Memorandum by the Minister covered a telegram,dated the 20th September, from Mr. Purvis, setting out the termsof a settlement reached with the Defence Advisory Committee andthe Navy and Army authorities.The view generally expressed was that the terms of this settle-men t were very favourable, and that Mr. Purvis was to becongratulated on reaching so satisfactory a settlement.The War Cabinet took note of the settlement reached.9. In connection with the preceding Minute, the PrimeMinister said that the Minister of Labour was anxious to get 3,000machine tools for the Government training centres. The Ministerrepresented that, unless he could get these machine tools, it wouldnot be possible to provide the trained men required to fulfil thedefence programme.In discussion the Minister of Aircraft Production suggestedthat, as a general rule, all the machine tools (especially new machine tools) which could be obtained, should be sent to the factories and used for current production. He deprecated putting machine toolsinto training centres at this juncture, more especially since in his view training should be carried out in the factories.On the other hand it was urged that full use was not beingmade of the existing machine tools on account of the shortage of skilled labour; and that while, for the most part, training shouldbe carried out in factories, there was a field for training in theMinistry of Labour centres and by local education authorities.The general view of the War Cabinet was that it was necessaryto maintain a due balance between the immediate needs of theproduction programme and our long-term requirements.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister without Portfolio to adjust thedemands made by the Minister of Labour for machine toolsfor Government training establishments, in competition with other demands, on the understanding that the biasshould be in favour of training in factories and that as faras possible the Minister of Labour&apos;s requirements should bemet by the provision of second-hand tools.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 24, 1940.Machine Tools.Arrangementsfor purchase inthe UnitedStates ofAmerica.Labour.Provision of machine Toolsfor GovernmentTrainingCentres.
