Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 247thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air casualties.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that the casualties during the period ended 7 a.m. that morning had been : Anti-aircraftartillerydefences ofLondon.bomber command.coastal command.Enemy BombersFightersBy our Fighters By A.A. Fire, uniden-justified (I.A.Z.)(Solent) BomberDestroyed.4733Probable.2212Damaged.2717893453Our Losses 28 Aircraft.   17 pilots killed or missing.A conservative estimate was that the Germans had lost 250 men.The anti-aircraft artillery defences of London were being morethan doubled. On the previous night it had been decided to put upa pretty heavy barrage, and about 100 rounds per gun had been fired.As a result of the barrage one-third of the raiders had turned back.It was also noticeable that while enemy aircraft which had pehe-t-rated the defences earlier in the night had flown at about 180 milesan hour at a height of 12,000 to 16,000 feet, later in the night theyhad flown at about 240 miles an hour at about 27,000 feet.The Home Secretary was most grateful for the increasedmeasure of artillery support. The moral effect on our people hadbeen excellent. The City of London had now escaped serious damagefor two nights running.The Secretary of State for Air said that our bombers had made very successful sorties on the night 10th/11th September. their attck on the Potsdammer railway station in Berlin had been very effective. On the night of the 11th/12th September an attack hadbeen made on the Anhalter railway station in Berlin. Shipping had also been attacked in the Channel ports and at Bremerhaven, wherehits might have been secured on the Europa and the Bremen.The Coastal Command also had made successful sorties. on one occasion, when six Blenheims and six Albacores had been engaged with three times their number of enemy fighters, threeM.E.109&apos;s had been shot down and a D.O.18 had been damaged.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.France.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 247thConclusions,Minute 5.)Switzerland.&quot;Violation of swiss neutralityby british aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 236thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet took note that the six French Cruisershad passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on the previous day andhad proceeded to Casablanca, and that a British force had been ordered to patrol to the southward to prevent these ships from entering Dakar.3. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs drew attention to telegram No. 901 from Berne. this telegram recorded an interview between our Minister and thePresident of the Swiss Eepublic, who had read out the text of instructions to the Swiss Minister in London. Clearly we must expect to receive a very stiff protest in the next day or so.Consultations were proceeding between the Foreign Office andthe Air Ministry on the following points : first, whether we could undertake not to cross Switzerland in order to get to SouthernGermany; secondly, whether our airmen could be instructed that ifthey had to jettison their bombs, they should do so on Italian rather
than on Swiss territory; thirdly, whether without serious inter-ference with needs, a few nights could now elapse during which our aircraft did not fly over Switzerland. It would be easier to dealwith the Swiss protest if there could be a short interval free from further violations.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he understood that Milan could not be reached withoutcrossing Switzerland, but that this might not apply to Turin orGenoa.The Secretary of State for Air undertook to examine these points and to communicate with Sir Alexander Cadogan.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 12, 1940.
