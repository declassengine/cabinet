Naval, Militauyand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 245thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.1. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that during the twenty-,four hours ended at 7 a.m. that morning the casualties had been : naval operations.MilitaryOperations:Home Forces.The middle east.Our own 20 (15 pilots safe).Enemy 52 destroyed.11 probable.13 damaged.On the night 8th-9th September some 200 German aircraft had operated over this country. In the daylight hours of the9th September some 400 German aircraft had been operating over this country, of which some 300 had taken part in the 5 p.m. raid.During the whole of the night 9th-10th September enemy aircraft had been active over London. The main attack had been on the City, where several fires had been caused, two of major importance.  Bombs had fallen in many other parts of London.The bombing of London had been quite indiscriminate and theview was expressed that our raiders over Germany ought to be instructed not to return home with their bombs, if they failed to locate the targets which they were detailed to attack.One hundred and eight of our bombers had been over enemy countries on the night of the 9th-10th September. Medium bombershad attacked the harbours and shipping at Ostend, Calais andBoulogne and two medium bombers had attacked gun emplacementsat Cap Gris Nez. Heavy bombers had attacked the Charlottenburgand Neukoln gasworks at Berlin.The First Sea Lord reported that during the night of the9th-10th September five destroyers had carried out a sweep of theFrench Coast from St. Valery north-eastwards towards Le Touquet,in order to locate and destroy enemy small craft. Two destroyers had proceeded towards Calais and three towards Boulogne:M.T.B.s also had carried out a sweep between Ostend and the mouth of the Scheldt. The results of these sweeps had been almost negative,only one small craft having been found out of harbour.The report that an enemy force consisting of four Cruisers,thirteen Torpedo boats and fifteen small craft had been seen offOstend steering South-West had proved incorrect. In all probabilitywhat had been seen had been a number of sloops and small craft.Our reconnoitring aircraft had reported that a fair number ofvessels of small size were still entering the ports of Flushing, Ostend,Calais and Boulogne.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave particulars ofcertain movements of the Home Forces.In the Middle East there was little to record beyond ineffectiveenemy bombing, and a successful raid by one of our patrols from kenya into Abyssinia.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to give instructions that our bombers operating over Germany should not return with their bombs in the event of their failing to locate their targets.(2) Invited the Minister of Information to arrange with thePress and the B.B.C. for no further statements to bemade to the effect that the British aircraft alwaysreturned with their bombs if they failed to locate theirtargets.
Home Defence.Likelihood of invasion.(previous erence:2. The War Cabinet were given the latest information bearing on the enemy&apos;s preparations for invasion of this country, and inparticular as to the movements of shipping.The possibilities of various forms of attack against shippingassembled in Channel ports or passing from one port to anotherW.M. (40) 239th were discussed.Conclusions,Minute 14.)Air Raids.Provision for thehomeless.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 238thConclusions,Minute 5.)Proposed lord mayor&apos;s fund for the relief of distress.The Prime Minister again emphasised the importance of attacking enemy shipping and troop concentrations.The Prime Minister also asked the Secretary of State for war for a report on the information obtained from enemy agentscaptured in this country.3. The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Home Security informed the War Cabinet that a difficult situation was arising in regard to persons in the East Endof London who had been rendered homeless. This matter had not,perhaps, been very well handled by all the local authorities, but arrangements had now been made for the matter to be taken overby the London County Council. A special organisation was also being set up in Whitehall. It was proposed to transfer the homelesspeople from the East of London to districts further West. Anappeal would be made to householders to find accommodation.Continuing, the Home Secretary said that the Lord Mayorwanted to start a fund for the relief of distress caused by the bombing of London. It would be difficult to refuse to allow thisfund to be started, more especially as the American ambassador and the Lord Mayor of Melbourne had opened similar funds. Itshould, however, be made clear that the scheme was intended to supplement the compensation provided by the Government, andwould deal with the sort of items of expenditure which could not be covered by the Governments scheme.The War Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to inform the Lord Mayor ofLondon that no objection was seen to the opening of a fund on these lines.Air Raids.Compensationfor damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 243rdConclusions.)4. The War Cabinet invited the Lord President of the Councilto confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in regard to theproposed scheme of compensation for damage resulting from air raids.5. The Prime Minister said that it was now proposed, subjectto further consultation with the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury, that Parliament should meet on Monday, the16th September, at 11 a.m. . The time and date of the meeting, shouldnot be announced beforehand, and the Press should be told not to publish the time of the meeting even after it had taken place.Parliament.Arrangementsfor meeting ofboth Houses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 245thConclusions, _________Minute 2.)Home Defence. 6.   The War Cabinet approved the revised print of InstructionsFunctions of the to the Police in the event of Invasion (W.P. (40) 363) subject to thepolice in the addition of the word &quot;previously&quot; before the word &quot;issued&quot; in event of the last line but two of paragraph 4 (6) (ii).invasion.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 233rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 10, 1940.
13th September, 1940.Dear Melville,With reference to the Secretary of State&apos;sletter to the Prime Minister of yesterday&apos;s date ahoutthe Cabinet Conclusion on instructions to our &quot;bombersoperating over Germany, the Prime Minister has minutedon the telegram which was enclosed:-&quot;S.  of S.This may stand for the present.W.S.C. 12.9.&quot;Yours sincerely,(Signed)    PECK,.H. Melville, Esq..,AIR MINISTRY.COPY.

AIR MINISTRY,MI ITEHALL, S.W.I.11th September, 1940.Dear Prime Minister,In Conclusion 1 (i) of the minutes ofyesterday&apos;s War Cabinet Meeting I am invited &quot;to give instructions that our bombers operating over germany should not return with their bombs in the event oftheir failing to locate their targets&quot;.I find that an instruction had already beenissued to Bomber Command that pilots should make everyeffort to avoid bringing their bombs home and I attach a    copy of our signal.      It does not, however,  go sofar as the Cabinet Conclusion in that it permits pilotsto bring home their bombs in the last resort if theycannot find any military target.    I think it wouldbe unwise to go further than this instruction.(a)    Because otir present policy is to bombonly military objectives snd thiswas re-emphasised at this morning&apos;cabinet.COPY.MOST SECRET.

(b) Because a relaxation of restrictions onbombing indiscriminately might possiblyreduce the determination of our pilot&apos;sto go for their set targets with a consequent loss in military results,        and(c) because pilot&apos;s normally look, for their last resort targets in Holland,  Belgium or Franceand if they fail to find them ana-drop theirbombs indiscriminately it would be the Dutch,Belgians and   French who would suffer andnot the Germans.I do not propose therefore to issue anyfurther instruction to Bomber Command &quot;hut I  should beglad of your approval.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    ARCHIBALD SINCLAIR.The Rt. Hon. Winston Churchill, C.H.,M.P.10, Downing Street, S.W.I.

It is not theintention that pilots should bomb at random or that theyshould never bring back their bombs, but every attempt should be made to bomb alternative or last resort targetsif it is impossible to locate the primary target.Time of Origin:- 1500 hours/9Cox^ies to:-       C.A.S.V.O.A.S.D.O.A.S.
