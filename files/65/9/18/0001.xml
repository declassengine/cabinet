Operation 1.   The Prime Minister said that the operation &quot;Menace&quot;&quot; Menace.&quot; had begun that morning. At the outset it had appeared that matters(Previous were progressing very favourably.   Thus the first messages had reference:        stated that General de Gaulle&apos;s emissary had been received, and that.M. (40) 255th our aircraft had landed at the aerodromes.   Later a message had conclusions,      been received indicating that sporadic and formal resistance was minute 2.)        being shown, and that our forces would have to interfere and openfire.  The Cumberland had received a hit amid-ships by a shot fromone of the batteries, and was out of action, and one destroyer hadbeen damaged.   The operation was now proceeding.The First Sea Lord in supplementing the above informationsaid that visibility at Dakar that morning had been bad andResolution and Barham could not see the forts to open fire on them.Admiral Cunningham had decided to test the opposition with ourlight forces and the Cumberland had been hit. The situation ashe saw it depended on the efficiency of the shore batteries, whichmust be effectively dealt with before any landing was attempted.The Barham and Resolution would have to come within range ofthe shore guns in order to accomplish this.Later in the meeting a message was received, timed 1-58 p.m.,stating that General de Gaulle was attempting a landing at Rufiqueunder cover of fog. It was also known that General de Gaulle haddelivered an ultimatum to the Vichy forces and that they hadbeen ordered to resist.Reference was made to a statement issued by the german wireless which referred to our having interfered with French ships off the African coast. The Minister of Information urged thata statement should be issued by the British Government before theGermans had time to do so.The War Cabinet invited the Minister of Information, inconsultation with the Foreign Office, to draft a statemen tregarding operation &quot;Menace&quot; and to submit it to thePrime Minister for approval.2. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on the previous day our bombers had attacked the Channel ports and a numberof factories well inside Germany.That morning a number of enemy fighters had crossed the South-East coast. The casualties ascertained at the moment were asfollows : Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 255thConclusions, Qlir Ow7Mmute 1.) 9 aircraft (3 pilots missing and 3 unaccounted for).Air Operations:Home, Egypt Enemy-and Palestine. 10 certain.5 probable.3 damaged.On the 21st September a successful bombing attack had beenmade on enemy positions at Sidi Barrani.On the 21st September eight enemy aircraft had attacked Haifa,doing some damage to a power station, a petrol tank and a petrolcharging plant.Shipping Losses. The First Sea Lord reported that in the last three days wehad suffered severe loss by enemy attack on convoys approachingthis country from the north-west. In one convoy we had lost7 ships and in another 4.Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave details of theOperations: Italian advance on Sidi Barrani the previous week. They hadE8&apos;.ypf- moved in what was described as &quot; hedgehogs,&quot; i.e., columns of several hundred vehicles with tanks, A.T. guns and artillery in[21773-2] b 2
front and on the flanks, and infantry in lorries in the centre. Whenengaged they had deployed their artillery and tanks, and sometimesinfantry, and had advanced slowly in rigid lines. Our artillery hadfired on to these massed vehicles at effective range and claimed tohave destroyed at least 150, some of them full of troops. Ourinfantry also had had opportunities of using machine gunseffectively.   The 25-pdr. gun had received high praise.Our casualties amounted to 40 personnel, 1 cruiser tank and about one dozen vehicles.The present situation was that one black shirt Divisionsupported by a Libyan Division was consolidating round SidiBarrani, where the R.A.F. was constantly harassing them. TwoMetropolitan Divisions were in the Sollum area and a small forceof uncertain composition was thought to be in the Giarabub area.Besides these there were 11 or possibly 12 Divisions in Libya.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the armoured brigade would reach Egypt that afternoon. This represented avery fine achievement on the part of the merchant ships concerned.The War Cabinet invited the First Lord of the admiralty to send the following message on their behalf : &quot; The War Cabinet, the Army and the other Servicessend their congratulations to the ships of the merchant navy on this fine achievement.&quot;Air Policy. 3.   The Prime Minister said that a number of indications hadBerlin and the    been received pointing to the possibility of an attempt at invasionChannel Ports,   over the week-end.  One of these had suggested that invasion would start at 3 p.m. on Sunday, 22nd September.In the light of the information available, it was for considera-tion whether our Bomber force should continue operations againstthe invasion ports, or whether the majority of heavy bombers should,if conditions permitted, deliver an air attack on Berlin.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the weather was suitablefor the despatch of over 100 heavy bombers against Berlin that night. This would leave 45 medium and 5 heavy bombers availablefor action against the Channel ports. Orders in this sense hadalready been given.The War Cabinet agreed that the orders given should stand.4. In connection with item 2, discussion ensued as to theextent to which aircraft and pilots should be sent to Egypt. TheDespatch of air- War Cabinet were informed that the despatch of fighter aircraftcraft overseas, overseas had been suspended some time back, and that no aircraft(Previous were being despatched to the Middle East other than under arrange-reference: ments authorised some time previously. It was pointed out in w.M. (40) 241st discussion that there was a strong case for the despatch to theConclusions, Middle East of aircraft which could be flown by the experiencedMinute 2.)

A number of pilots were also being sent to theMiddle East.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Air to submit a state-ment showing the numbers of aircraft (by types) and pilotsdespatched to the Middle East in August and September,and the numbers it was proposed to despatch in october and November.aircraft production.
It was understood that, pending consideration of this state-ment, no further aircraft would be despatched, other thanthe small consignment the despatch of which during thepresent week had already been arranged.Air Raid 5.   Reference was made to a statement by Lord Nuffield whichWarnings. had been published in the Sunday papers to the effect that theEffect on German attack on our industry had resulted in no material damage,aircraft The Chief of the Air Staff suggested that a statement of this kindproduction.       was likely to attract further attacks on the aircraft industry.(Previous The general view of the War Cabinet was that, while the state-Reference: ment made was perhaps ill-judged, it was far better that any publicW.M. (40) 255th statements made as to the effects of air attack on our productiveConclusions,      capacity should sound a confident note.Minute 6.) j*jie Minister Qj a %r craft Production said that aircraft produc-tion was still suffering severely from interruptions due to air raid warnings. There was an unfortunate tendency on the part ofworkers in the aircraft industry to stop work on the raid warningsand to hang about outside the factory without going into theshelters.Closing of shops        The Lord Privy Seal said that, while the practice of the Postand banks.        Office had now been remedied, work still stopped in shops and bankswhen the sirens sounded.The Home Secretary said that he had received a deputation from the Retail Traders on this subject. At the outset the bigshops had been afraid of being rushed in the event of an air raid,but this no longer presented any trouble. He had not been in touchwith the big banks on this subject, but he would look into thematter.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that every effort must be made to induce workers in aircraft factories and engaged on other war productionnot to cease work when the &quot; red &quot; warning sounded.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would look into thequestion of the closing of banks during air raids.United States ofAmerica.Supply ofMunitions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 255thConclusions,Minute 4.)Honours andDecorations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 252ndConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet copies of two telegrams from Mr. Purvis stating that the United States Govern-ment had now agreed to release 250,000 further rifles. negotiations were proceeding in regard to aircraft and large flying boats.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.7. The Prime Minister said that the approval of His majesty the King had now been obtained to the creation of a George Crossand a George Medal. The George Cross would absorb the EmpireGallantry Medal and could be awarded posthumously.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the draft of astatement announcing the establishment of the George Cross andthe George Medal which it was proposed to publish that night.The War Cabinet approved this statement.
Evacuation of 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGovernment Lord Privy Seal in regard to the &quot; Grey &quot; move for the evacuationDepartments.     of Government Departments from London (W.P. (G.) (40) 242).The Lord Privy Seal said that 30,000 staff had already leftLondon as part of the &quot; Grey &quot; move, but very few had left in recent months. The move ought now to proceed steadily, in order to make more elbow-room in London. At present, if the accommodationoccupied by one of the big Departments were to be knocked out, itwould be difficult to find alternative accommodation. It was important that the move should be carried out in an orderly way,but without creating an impression that the Government wasleaving London.The First Commissioner of Works said that the conditions ofwork of staffs evacuated from London were now far morefavourable than the conditions in London itself.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the recommendations summarised inparagraph 7 (a), (b) and (c) of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sMemorandum :(2) Invited the Minister of Information to explain to the press that the moves contemplated represented no more than an extension of the process, already begun, of thinningout the Government staffs in London, and to invite themto make no reference to the movement in the Press.Air Raids. 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theInsurance Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G.) (40) 239), stating thatagainst Personal pressure was developing on employers in certain industries,Injuries. particularly those in which the employees were asked to work underair raid conditions, to effect insurances for the benefit of their work-people against death or injury from enemy action. Thequestion arose whether such insurances would reckon as an expensein computing the employers&apos; liability to Excess Profits Tax, inwhich case they would be effected at the cost of the Exchequer.Further, if such insurances became common in, for example,the aircraft industry, the demand for insurance would spread toA.R.P. workers and to employees in other industries which couldnot bear the cost.A situation might arise in which the State would be bearing the whole cost of this insurance, in addition to its own compensa-tion scheme. The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore proposedthat this form of insurance should be stopped.In discussion, it was explained that the State scheme ofcompensation for personal injury in air raids applied to all personsgainfully employed, and to persons engaged in Civil defence services, and was based on the compensation payable to a privatesoldier in the Army.The question was raised whether the State scheme of compensa-tion should be so limited, or whether it should be of general application.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that his objection was not to private individuals taking out insurances on their own account, but to Insurance Companies issuing policies to employers in respect of large blocks of their employees.The Minister of Labour and National Service doubted whetherthe present scale of compensation, based on that payable to a privatesoldier, was adequate, particularly in regard to men who might beearning as much as  5 a week. He thought that consideration should be given to a more attractive scheme, to which the workers

W. 1,September 23, 1940.might be asked to pay contributions, possibly as part of the generalState insurance scheme.(Previous The Prime Minister suggested that, on the analogy of theBeference: scheme agreed in respect of damage to property, compensation for w.M. (40) 246th personal injury should be payable by the State in respect of allConclusions, persons injured, on ia modest scale. Persons desiring to be insuredMinute 4.) against personal injury in air raids in excess of this scale should beasked to pay premiums. The rate of premium, however, should beincreased in respect of insurances effected above a certain limit.The War Cabinet (1) Deferred a final decision on this matter, but authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer as an interim measure toput a stop to the type of insurance policy outlined inhis Paper.(2) Invited a Committee comprising The Lord Privy Seal (Chairman),The Minister without Portfolio,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The President of the Board of Trade, andThe Minister of Labour to consider the question of compensation for personal injury in air raids, and to report to the War Cabineton Friday, the 27th September.It should be an instruction to this Committee to relate compensation for personal injury to the scheme ofcompensation for damage to property in air raids; andto consider whether the scheme for compensation for personal injury could be made of general application.
