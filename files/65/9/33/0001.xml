Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 270thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.naval operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 264thConclusions,Minute 6.)Mediterranean.Italiandestrovers sunk.Shipping losses.MilitaryOperations:Middle East.1. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that the attacks by our heavy bombers on central and eastern Germany and onselected targets in the Berlin area on the previous night had beenvery successful. Three of our bombers had failed to return and four had crashed on landing, the crew of one machine being killed.The casualties for that day&apos;s operations over this country upto date had been : Our own 4 machines (4 pilots safe).Enemy 9 certain.150 enemy machines had taken part in the previous nighfsoperations over this country, of which 100 had attacked London.The enemy machines had come over in batches of five and six,instead of singly as on previous occasions. It was feared thatcasualties in the London area had been heavy,The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff reported that H.M.S. Cheshirehad been torpedoed west of Bloody Foreland on the evening ofthe 14th, but was now proceeding to the Clyde under her ownsteam.The French destroyer Fleuret, escorting three French merchantvessels, had passed Gibraltar from west to east on the morning of the 14th.   The Fleuret had returned westward a little later.During the recent sweep in the Mediterranean H.M.S. Ajaxhad sunk three Italian destroyers. The Italians claim to havedamaged one of our cruisers was untrue. During this sweepfour enemy aircraft had been shot down for certain and probablytwo more.H.M. submarine Trident had reported that she had sunk anenemy U-boat off Lorient on the morning of the 8th October.H.M.A.S. Parramatta escorting a convoy in the Red Sea hadbeen bombed on the 14th instant, but no damage had beenreported.The S.S. Hurunui (British) 10,023 tons had been torpedoed and sunk west of the Butt of Lewis on the evening of the 14th.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thesituation in Egypt, the Sudan and East Africa were generallyquiet. The western desert railway had been bombed at Fuka bythe enemy on the 13th, causing some native casualties, but no damage. A column of M.T&apos;s had moved about 20 miles down theMatruh road from Sidi Barrani and had then turned back.Enemy artillery had been in action 10 miles south-east of SidiBarrani.Middle East Intelligence Reports now indicated that thestrength of the enemy between Sollum and Sidi Barrani was rather less than had generally been thought. It was consideredthat the number of Italian divisions was at the most five, andpossibly only four.General Malletti was in command of an Italian desert force,which appeared to be concentrating in Giarabub, possibly withthe intention of raiding Siwa. There were indications of possibleenemy movements in the area either in Siwa or perhaps further south.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
Home Defence.Likelihood of invasion.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 269thConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The Prime Minister said that it would be premature to suppose that the danger of invasion had passed. IntelligenceReports indicated that enemy plans were still moving forward.In these circumstances it would not be possible for the Navy towithdraw7 any more of their forces from the invasion front inorder to strengthen shipping escorts in the north-west approaches.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids.Effect on civilian morale.&quot;X&apos;8. Discussion followed on the effect of night bombing on civilian morale. The view was advanced that the civilian population in London were beginning to wonder whether wewere hitting back hard enough at Germany in our bombing operations. If this feeling was allowed to grow it might havean unfortunate effect on our war effort. It would be of thegreatest advantage if the public could be made to realise thata resolute effort was being made to check night bombing.The Prime Minister said that those concerned were strainingevery nerve to improve means of countering night bombing.There were good prospects that our defensive measures would be greatly improved within the next two or three months. In themeantime we were retaliating as effectively as we could on germany. But our Bomber Force was much smaller than thatof the enemy, and had to make far longer journeys. meanwhile the people of this country must stick it out. No doubt they realised that Hitler was trying to break morale over here. He(the Prime Minister) would consider whether it would be desirable for him to make another broadcast speech.In further discussion, it was suggested that if more publicitycould be given by way of photographs of the results of our bombingin Berlin, it would have a good effect. Another suggestion was thatit would be worth considering whether a document could be pub-lished containing extracts from the reports as to the effect of ourbombing in Germany, without compromising the sources of this information.The War Cabinet-Took note of this discussion, and invited the Minister ofInformation in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Air toconsider the suggestions at &quot;X.&quot;U.S.S.R.Anglo-soviet relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 270thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The War Cabinet considered Moscow telegram No. 865, inwhich Sir Stafford Cripps asked for authority to make a new approach to the Soviet Government, together with a draft replyprepared in the Foreign Office, the text of which is on record inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.- (Vo - i&apos;f i\ g\tfct.UlIn discussion the following points were made:(1) The Foreign Secretary said that he had at first thought thatwe ought first to find out if the United States Govern-ment agreed with the line we proposed to take. on second thoughts he thought it would be enough to sendLord Lothian a copy of our telegram to Moscow with ashort explanation of the reasons for our action.General agreement was expressed with this view.It was unlikely that the United States Governmentwould commit themselves far until after the presidential election.
(2) We should compromise both our present and our post-war position if we were to make any statement implying dejure recognition of the Russian aggressions in eastern europe. But there was a case for recognising a de factosituation which we should be unable to alter, at anyrate until the end of the war.(3) It would be imprudent to build any hopes on the outcome of a new approach to Russia, which was mainlyinfluenced by fear of Germany. Nevertheless, it was right that at the present juncture one more approach to Russia should be made, and that it should be on record that we had made it.The War Cabinet-Gave a general approval to the instructions to Sir stafford cripps contained in the draft telegram before them.The Royal AirForce.Training of pilots.Proposal to sendFlying training schools abroad.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 238thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The War Cabinet were reminded that, following thediscussions on the 30th August, a revised programme had beenagreed for the despatch of aircraft and pilots to Canada andSouth Africa. A number of moves had taken place in August,September and October, in accordance with the programme, andthe Secretary of State for Air had undertaken to come to theWar Cabinet early .in October for authority to complete it(W.P. (40) 351).The Prime Minister said that the Secretary of State for Airnow wished to carry out a further instalment of the scheme.This involved a move of one School only, which involved only10 pilots. Aircraft for this school would be supplied from america. In addition, it was proposed to send to Canada about30 Ansons and 27 Battles required for the five schools already sent overseas. He understood that the Minister of aircraft production was still opposed to sending pilots and aircraft outof the country. It seemed, however, to him (the Prime Minister)that the arguments in favour of sending Flying Training Schoolsoverseas had certainly not diminished since this proposal had first been made. The objection to sending pilots and aircraft outof this country, of course, remained; but if we did not adopt thiscourse, we ran a great risk that we should not see the hoped-forincrease in the Royal Air Force next spring.The Minister of Aircraft Production thought that the experiencesince this scheme had first been proposed last summer reinforcedthe objections. The training of pilots in this country had beencarried on successfully in the meantime, and there was much tobe said for training pilots under the conditions to which theywould have to accustom themselves.The Secretary of State for Air said that while the output of trained pilots had increased by &apos;25 per cent, in the months of june and July, and by 50 per cent, in August and September, the output was still below what was required for the expansion of the RoyalAir Force. If the present proposal was agreed to, he would againbring the matter to the War Cabinet early in November before proceeding with any further transfers overseas in respect of flying training schools.
After some discussion, the Prime Minister said that he thought the general feeling of the War Cabinet was that it would not be right to override the considered view of one of the Service ministers in favour of the small further measure of transfer overseas nowproposed.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed to the transfer overseas of No. 10 Service PlyingTraining School, and to the shipment of approximately60 aircraft to the five Schools already abroad.(2) Agreed that the programme for the despatch of aircraft and pilots to Canada and South Africa, under thescheme for the transfer abroad of Flying training schools, should be further considered by the WarCabinet early in November.Works and buildings.Allocation ofcement.Aerodromeconstruction.(previous reference :W.M. (40) 239thConclusions,Minute 11.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 238thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister without Portfolio.(W.P. (40) 415 and W.P. (G) (40) 262).The Prime Minister stated the case for the Army in the absenceof the Secretary of State for War. The Army feared that the newAir Ministry demand for cement might result in some reduction oftheir own allocation. The proposed allocation for the Army itselffor the period October to December, 1940, was only 205,850 tons,compared with requirements of 366,601 tons. If it were cut again,it would be at the cost of our coast defences, of the defences of malta and Gibraltar, and of other vital works.The Minister wit!tout Portfolio said that he was in the unenvi-able position of taking decisions which could please nobody. the revised allocation which he had approved had been made in thelight of all the relevant considerations, including the approvedprogramme of 125 additional aerodromes and the latest shelterpolicy. Within the last few days he had received information asto the probable supply position which justified him in increasingthe total allocations for the quarter by 50,000 tons. He recom-mended that this should be added to the Air Ministry allocation,increasing it to 434,515 tons. He saw no way, consistent with themaintenance of other essential services, of increasing the AirMinistry allocation above this figure.The Minister suggested that the Secretary of State for Airmight see his way to revise his cement requirement for perimetertracks. It was for consideration whether these ought not to be constructed in tarmac, where soil was suitable and material avail-able, even where the runways must be of concrete&apos;.It must be remembered that air raid damage might reduce thequantity of cement manufactured or transported. This made it essential to eliminate the waste of which the cement-using Depart-ments were at times guilty. For example, the mixture was oftentoo rich, and the buildings constructed too heavy.The Secretary of State for Air said that he would be in defaultif he failed to carry out the additional programme of 125 aero-dromes. It was impossible for him to do so with his presentallocation. His advice was that the cement requirement forperimeter tracks could not be further reduced. Tarmac was already largely used in constructing perimeter tracks.
The Minister of Home Security said that he must press for his original requirement of 514,000 tons. The heavy raids on Londonmade it essential to speed up the shelter programme.The Minister of Labour and National Service thought that theposition would be eased if labour and materials were concentrated on finishing works which were approaching completion.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention to thepossibility of additional supplies of cement becoming available from Northern Ireland.The Prime Minister did not question that the Air ministry had a good case for their orginal requirement. Other Departmentsalso had good cases, and it became a question of cutting one&apos;scoat according to one&apos;s cloth. He proposed that the War cabinet should authorise the Minister without Portfolio to make hisadjudication. He would assess the competing claims of the AirMinistry, the Ministry of Home Security and the otherDepartments in the light of the strategic position.The Secretary of State for Air said that training in the UnitedKingdom would necessarily be restricted if his allocation could notbe increased. It would become more essential than before to sendPlying Training Schools overseas.The War Cabinet Authorised the Minister without Portfolio to take thefinal decisions on the allocations of cement for thecurrent quarter.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 15, 1940.

I J october, 1940.Your telegram So* 860 /&quot;of October 13th:policy towards Soviet Onion 71,     2 authorise you to make approach to soviet Government on lines you suggest.   Thefollowing points sees to me Important, and Ishould like you to have them in Blind.(i)   2 think Soviet Government should  give some practical proof of benevolent neutralitytowards Turkey and Iran, both before and during aermn attack on Turkey, should thatmature - that is to say, they should notmerely be passive spectators but shouldfacilitate Turkish defence by all stepsconsistent with technical neutrality.   This is-most important.   Front point of view of Par3asts (though i recognise that if Russia is totake risks in Europe by being benevolent to turkey, she may want to reinsure herself inFar Best) it would also be very undesirable that soviet Government should make any pact with japan which involved cessation or disamitlon oftheir supplies to China (see your telegram110. 888), and which would relieve Japan of allanxiety in the norths thus enabling her to pressdovm upon us and the Dutch in the South.   2recognise of course all the difficulty ofplaying this very delicate hand, but if&quot;benevolent neutrality&quot; is to have- no suchpractical consequences, I should fear that yourplan might not improbably result in our givingfar-reaching/Sir S.crippa,MOSCOW.Mo.......Cypher1)1 attribution B.

farWeaching undertakings to Soviet Ckjver&amp;mentin return for nothing more than a promise that they will not acutally fight against us,which they are not likely to do in any ease.(II)   Guarantee of post-war consultationwe-.Id not of course imply steadiness to acceptSoviet views on future of Europe or AsiSj,and undertaking not to form anti-Sovietalliance must necessarily be conditional onSoviet Government undertaking no tiling; against our interests either directly4 or indirectlythrough revolutionary agitation.(iii)   We already recognise that soviet Government are in ae facto control ofBaltic states and occupied parts of Polandarid Roumanian and l see no objection to yourtelling; them that we shall continue to acton this assumption.   I Obviously could not,however, agree to any statement implyingde .1ure recognition or gravely compromising post-war position? and I fear that this is isfeitt theymay want (as is indeed implied in paragraph of your telegram),   as you will have seen from my telegram Ho.        , we are prepared toaccept la substance your suggestion for(Sealing with Baltic ships which involves dcfacto recognition of Soviet occupation ofBaltic states; and before that we hado   .,jred fee set off British claims toconfiscated property there against Balticgold.   i do not think therefore thatimplication, in third paragraph of yourtelegram that we have shown intransigence onthese cjaeetieas is well founded-

(iv) If by arranging to supply SovitGovernment ir?ith articles they require you&apos;meanmaterial for war, such as non-ferrous metals,these might he supplied as part of a trade agree-ment.(v) Guarantee against attack &quot;by Turkeycould no doubt be given with consent of TurkishGovernment, and it is obvious that tse or our allies would not attack Baku so long as SovietGovernment gave no gx^ouna for such action.8.    Really as I am to give you all thesupport I can in your efforts, 1 confess thatI find it difficult to think that SovietGovernment arc really more afraid of our post-warattitude than of a victorious Germany, as suggested in paragraph eleven of your telegram, 01that they believe they will be strong enough to defeat a German attack if they postpone it, as suggested in paragraph 5j and I still feel thatreal reason for their present -attitude is fearof immediate consequences of opposition toGeasnaa-Japanese combination,   we cannot hope atpresent to remove their fear of Germanyj but withaid of 0,8*Government fe*e might go far to removeSoviet fear of Japan end it is therefore important that your B.S. colleague shouldimpress upon Soviet Government determination ofhis Government to prevent Japan from indulgingin any further adventures,   1 am accordinglyinstructing       Ambassador In Washington to make further representations to U.s.Government in this sense.Repeated to Washington and Angora.
