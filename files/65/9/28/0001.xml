The Prime Minister referred to a number of indications fromwhich we could draw encouragement, as to the forces at work indifferent parts of the French Empire.His mind was moving in the direction of doing nothing to hamper either the French or the Spanish communications with north africa, while maintaining our contraband control over the Frenchand Spanish trade entering the Mediterranean by the Straits of[21801-2] b 2Naval, Military 1.

Gibraltar. We might declare our policy on this matter in con-nection with the approach now being made to the Vichy government through the French Ambassador in Madrid. The matter was notripe for decision that day.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wasstudying a Minute on these questions, which he had received fromthe Prime Minister. His first reactions to the suggested new policy were favourable, although he could not answer for the Minister ofEconomic Warfare, who might see great objections to the reopening of trade between France and North Africa., and to a less extentto the reopening of trade between Spain and Morocco-.The Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion appeared to offer a way ofescape from the present position, in which we got all the odiumof a blockade which we could not strictly enforce.He was in touch with the Minister of Economic Warfare andhe hoped to be able to make a statement at the War Cabinet Meetingon Monday, the 7th October. The First Lord of the admiralty would also wish for time to study the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion.The War Cabinet-Took note that the Foreign Secretary, after consultationwith the Minister of Economic Warfare, would make astatement on these matters on Monday, the 7th October.Shipping. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theProtection of Minister of Shipping, the Minister of Food and the First Lord ofmerchant the Admiralty (W.P. (40) 393, 401 and 403, respectively),shipping in The Prime Minister said that this matter had been discussed-convoy. on the previous evening at a Meeting of the Defence Committee.*The conclusion reached had been that, in view of the fact thatsuitable weather for an invasion was not likely to prevail on many occasions during the winter months, and taking into account thevery heavy sinkings which were being sustained, it would be rightto divert a number of destroyers and anti-submarine trawlers fromanti-invasion duties, to reinforce the escorts to shipping in theNorth-West Approaches. Some of the vessels could be recalled at short notice, to assist in repelling any attempt to invade these islands.In addition to the vessels thus released, it was hoped to have10 further destroyers and 6 corvettes available for service in the next four weeks, including vessels received from the U.S.A.The Minister of Shipping referred to the increasing number ofships damaged by air attack off the North-East Coast of Scotland.Great importance was attached to adequate air protection for these convoys.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested that further steps could be taken to expedite salvage and repair work.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to look into this point.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister without portfolio said that they were not prepared, on present advice, toagree to the request of the Minister of Food that the import programmes for the second year of war should be re-considered witha view, to the making of a larger proportion of shipping availablefor food.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the steps proposed for improving the protection for merchant ships in convoy.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider, inconjunction with the Minister of Labour and NationalService, whether steps could be taken to expedite thesalvage and repair of merchant ships.* D.O. (40) 33rd Meeting.
Shipping. 6.   The War Cabinet again had before them a MemorandumSale of vessels by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Shippingordered by the (W.P. (G.) (40) 216) asking for authority to announce that, as partGovernment to of the Governments shipping policy, ship-owners who had lostship-owners who their ships by war or marine risk, and who had not themselves placedhave lost an order for replacement, would be given the opportunity, in ordervessels during of date of loss, to purchase new Government-built ships to replace the war. such tonnage.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 230thConclusions,Minute 10.)The Minister of Shipping made the following points inaddition to those made in the Memorandum : First, that his predecessor had given a definite but not veryspecific undertaking to ship-owners that their shipping losses wouldbe replaced.Secondly, that unless he took the step now proposed, he wouldbe forced to devise a scheme on a larger scale for post-war replace-ment. He would prefer to anticipate this scheme by his present proposal, which would be an earnest of the Governments good faithwith the owners.In discussion, the view was expressed that to dispose ofGovernment-owned ships to ship-owners at the present time wouldgive rise to a good deal of criticism. While it was true that this measure would not in effect prejudge the question of the futureof Shipping after the war, the proposal might nevertheless raiseParty issues. It was also represented by the Minister of Labourand National Service that the measure proposed might well resultin some agitation in the shipyards. The men in the yards had agreed to a number of steps, on the ground that the ships werebeing built for the Government in order to help win the war.On the other hand, it was pointed out that if nothing was done,the ship-owners would come forward and say that the undertaking given to them was not being fulfilled. It was therefore of the first importance to consider this matter in the light of the precise termsof the pledge or undertaking given by the late Minister of Shipping.The War Cabinet-Postponed further consideration of the &apos; Memorandum(WP. (G.) (40) 216) pending submission by the Ministerof Shipping of a further Paper setting out the precise terms of the undertaking given to the ship-owners by his predecessor.Spain.Gibraltar.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 264thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a draft telegram had been prepared, for despatch to Sir Samuel Hoare, inregard to the public statement which the latter should be authorisedto make. The following sentence in the draft ought to be submittedto the War Cabinet: &quot;As regards special questions in which the SpanishGovernment is particularly interested, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are no less prepared to approach the consideration ofthese questions with a full appreciation of Spanish aspira-tions.&quot;In discussion it was argued that, unless something was said which might be regarded as covering the case of Gibraltar, thestatement would lose most of its value. On the other hand, it was said that if this sentence was included in the statement, there would almost certainly be demands for its elucidation which would prove embarrassing.
The War Cabinet agreed That the following sentence should be substitutedtherefor: &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to secureto Spain her rightful place in Europe as one of theMediterranean Powers, and it is in this spirit thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would approach any discussions which may appear desirable after theconclusion of hostilities.&quot;Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 4, 1940.
