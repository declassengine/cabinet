Naval, Militaryand air operations.Air Operations.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 239thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that during theprevious day enemy air activity had been on a considerably reduced scale, and the casualties had been : Air raid damage(previous reference erence:W.M. (40)243rdConclusions.)naval operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 240thConclusions,Minute 2.)MilitaryOperations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 239thConclusions,Minute 3.)Libyan frontier.The Sudan.Our own 4 machines (2 pilots saved).Enemy 7 destroyed.3 probable.8 damaged.The air attack on the previous evening had started before dark andhad continued until 5 o&apos;clock that morning. Practically the wholeof the enemy effort had been devoted to an attack on London, withacute concentration on the dock area, railways and power stations.Reports showed, however, that, while considerable damage had beendone, the intense bombing had had comparatively little effect onundertakings engaged on war production.The operations of the Bomber Command on the previous nighthad been mainly directed against enemy shipping, and from these operations 5 medium and 4 heavy bombers were missing.The Minister of Home Security reported that the main damage caused by the air raid on the previous evening had been suffered byrailways, power stations and the dock area. A number of hospitalshad been hit, but most of the damage to utility services would be quickly repaired, and all fires were under control. In spite of theprevious night&apos;s air raid, it was considered that the situation at8 o&apos;clock that morning as regards fires was better than twenty-four hours previously. A tribute was paid to the efficiency of the fire brigade services, and Sir John Anderson said that by that evening,in spite of the heavy demand made on the personnel and plant, itwould again be 100 per cent, efficient.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that the effect on aircraft production of the raids of the two previous nights had beenvery slight.The First Sea Lord reported that on the previous nightH.M.S. Galatea and Aurora,, each with three destroyers, hadbombarded Calais and Boulogne. Bad visibility had impeded this operation. M.T.B.s. had damaged two ships, one of 2,000 tons andone of 1,000 tons, off Ostend.German Naval wireless activity had been intensive.The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of attackingports such as Calais and Boulogne. Such attacks would affect the morale of German troops assembled ready to invade this country.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff- reported that therehad been a certain amount of activity on the Libyan Border, where our tanks had engaged the enemy, who had retired.In the Sudan there had been activity amongst patrols, but the rains still continued, and it was improbable that the enemy would attempt any large-scale attack in this neighbourhood before October.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
Air Said 2.   The Prime Minister said that, after tile heavy air attacksWarnings. of the week-end, he thought it would be wise to feel our way for a proposed few days before making any changes in the air-raid warningmodifications. system.   In the meantime, the practice should be continued of(Previous sounding the sirens on the red warning for half the periodReference: previously adopted.W.M. (40) 243rd The Home Secretary agreed, but hoped that the watchmanConclusions.) system would be developed to the fullest extent.   Both employersand employees were anxious to see this done.Parliament: The Prime Minister said that, on further consideration, hearrangements thought it was unwise that Parliament should meet on fixed datesfor meetings of and at fixed times publicly announced. The present arrangementboth Houses. was that the House of Commons should reassemble on Tuesday, the17th September. He thought that the right plan would be that theHouse should reassemble on Monday, the 16th, but that this changeof plan should be kept secret until the House had met. thereafter the procedure should be that the House should adjourn to a daynot later than a fixed date. No public announcement would be madein advance of the time or date on which the House would meet.Similar arrangements would apply to the House of Lords. ThePrime Minister added that, in his view, it was important that members of Parliament should spend as much time as possible intheir constituencies.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that steps should be taken to bring about the fullest use of the watchman system, but that no furthermodifications should be made at present in the air-raid warning system.(2) Approved generally the suggestions made by the PrimeMinister in regard to meetings of Parliament.Harvest Work.Hop-picking:employment oftroops.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 241stConclusions,Minute 6.)Employment ofLondonchildren.3. The War Cabinet were reminded that at their Meeting heldon Wednesday, the 4th September, arrangements had been approved for the employment of troops on harvest work, the immediate object being the employment of troops for hop-picking. In presentcircumstances, troops could not be spared for this work.At the same Meeting, the Home Secretary had been invited to instruct the Regional Commissioner for South-East England thatchildren should be allowed to accompany hop-pickers. Havingregard to the bombing of London in the last two days, there should now be less difficulty in getting children to leave East and SouthLondon for the Kentish hopfields, to replace troops who could notbe spared.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries to take steps, in consultation,to arrange for children from London to help pick hops in kent.Smoke 4.   The War Cabinet were informed that there had been someExperiments. difficulty in getting 1,300 men to carry out an important smokeEmployment of experiment.   All available troops were required for defence duties,troops. but the Home Guard had been unwilling to undertake the work.
The Secretary of State for War said that, in the light of thedecision that troops should not after all help with the hop-picking(see Minute 3), he would be prepared, on the present occasion, tomake army recruits available for this particular experiment, towhich special importance was attached.The U.S.S.R.Attitude to beadopted towardsSoviet absorp-tion of theBaltic States.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 225thConclusions,Minute 2.)The UnitedStates ofAmerica.Supply of destroyers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 239thConclusions,Minute5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the&quot;War Cabinet that he had been invited to ascertain how the UnitedStates Government would view a suggestion that the gold of theBaltic States Banks should be released to the U.S.S.R. in exchange for adequate compensation for the interests of our nationals.The conversation which the Commercial Counsellor atWashington had had with Mr. Atherton showed (TelegramNo. 1926 from Washington) that any deal on these lines would meet with serious opposition in the United States. Clearly the goodwill of the United States was of far more value to us than the somewhatillusory benefits of the goodwill of the U.S.S.R. It was thereforeimpossible to proceed with a deal on the lines previously suggested.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to see M. Maiskyand to tell him that on examination the matter involved greater difficulties than we had anticipated, and that a deal on the lines suggested would virtually involve de jure recognition, for which wewere not ready. If, however, the U.S.S.R. were prepared to forgotflieir claim to the gold, we would forgo our claim to compensationfor British assets.If, as seemed likely, the U.S.S.R. refused to agree to a settle-ment on these lines, he (the Foreign Secretary) would say that theclaims of both sides should be put into cold storage, but that thisshould be no obstacle to better relations between our countries or toa barter deal.the United States of america the War Cabinet authorised the Foreign Secretary toproceed on the lines indicated.The Soviet had in fact made a Trade Agreement with6. The Prime Minister said that the Admiralty had decided tocall the destroyers we were receiving from the United States afternames of towns common to this country and the United States.This happy suggestion would emphasise the common heritage ofthe two countries. He asked the Minister of Information toarrange to give publicity to the names selected, as soon as theAdmiralty list was&apos;available.Home Defence.Evacuation ofcivil population from certaintowns.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 192ndConclusions,Minute 14.)7. The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Home Security reminded the War Cabinet- that, on the3rd July, they bad agreed that the voluntary evacuation of thecivil population should be stimulated from the nineteen East coast towns between Great Yarmouth and Folkestone. In the result, thepopulation of these towns had been reduced to about 40 per cent,of the normal.The Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, had now reached theconclusion that, in view of the advanced state of the enemy &apos;spreparations for invasion, every effort should be made to arrangefor the evacuation of all but essential people in the towns along the coast from Ramsgate to Brighton (both inclusive), and also fromIpswich, Colchester, Canterbury and Ashford. If invasion wasattempted, he thought that these towns would be subject to intensivebombing. In this event it. would be very difficult, if not impossible,to maintain the civil population in these towns.
The Allies.Organisation ofAllied Naval,Army and&apos; air contingents.(previous reference:W-M. (40)239thConclusions,Minute 16.)Meetings of the Civil Ministers concerned had been held,attended by a representative of the Home Forces. The conclusions reached had been that, if the War Cabinet agreed that the threat of invasion in the next two weeks must be regarded as considerable,certain measures should be taken, notwithstanding the serious economic consequences.The time available did not permit of the adoption of a com-pulsory evacuation scheme. It would be possible, however, to applyto the towns between New Romney and Newhaven (both inclusive)a scheme for stimulating voluntary evacuation, on the linespreviously applied to the coastal towns from Folkestone to GreatYarmouth. It would, however,:be an inherent part of this scheme that this evacuation should be regarded as a temporary measure, i tomeet a risk which&apos;was now substantial, but would decline as winterapproached. The scheme, like the previous scheme, would apply; to non-essential people, to whom it would be represented that it was their duty, as good citizens, to leave the neighbourhood for thetime being.It was not proposed to apply this scheme to.Brighton, havingregard1 to the fact that accommodation and transport would not beavailable for the large number of people concerned. Special arrange-ments would be made to evacuate the population of Brighton to theWest, if this area was directly: threatened.with invasion.The. Minister of Health said that it was: proposed that theinhabitants of the towns affected in Kent and Sussex who agreed to evacuate should be moved via the Redhill-Reading route to the counties of Berks, Oxon, Wiltshire and \ Somerset. If approved,the scheme could be carried out in the course of the next three orfour days. The total number of persons involved was about 150,000for the towns on the South Coast, and 60,000 to 80,000 for Ipswichand Colchester.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, on purely military grounds, the measures advocated were most desirable.The Prime Minister said that it was essential that, if thescheme was approved, it should be kept out of the Press.The Home Secretary said that, 1 following the arrangementsadopted in regard to the East Coast towns, no mention would bemade of this measure of evacuation in the newspapers, but - localpublicity would be necessary. People in the country districts wouldnot be brought within the scope of the scheme.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Home Security to take;steps, to stimulate the voluntary evacuation of the non-essentialcivil population from South Coast towns between NewRomney and Newhaven (both inclusive), and fromCanterbury, Ashford, Ipswich and Colchester.This should be carried out as a temporary measure,and no news about it should be allowed, to appear in the newspapers.8. The War Cabinet took note of the Sixth Report by theChiefs of Staff on the Organisation of Allied Naval, Army and air contingents (W.P , (40) 358).Richmond - Terrace, S.W: 1,September 9, 1940.
