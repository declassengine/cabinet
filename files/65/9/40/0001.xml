251W.M. 278 (40)Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 277thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Operations.naval operations.Home waters:the Empress of britain.Relativesubmarinelosses in theMediterranean.1. The Secretary of State for Air reported that the casualtiesfor the previous day&apos;s operations over and around this country had been: Our own 10 machines.(4 pilots safe.)Enemy 9 certain.7 probable.9 damaged.By night enemy activity had been similar to previous nights,but on a slightly reduced scale. An extensive dusk attack hadbeen made on bomber and fighter aerodromes, but our losses had been comparatively light.Our aircraft detailed to attack targets in Germany had achieved satisfactory results.Three Beauforts of the Coastal Command had sunk a Germanvessel and had then been engaged by 12 Messerschmitts. TwoBeauforts and 1 Messerschmitt had been brought down.In the Middle East 3 Vincents had dive-bombed buildingsnorth-west of Kassala.The First Sea Lord reported that the Empress of Britain, whichhad been bombed and set on fire on the 26th October, 90 miles west of Bloody Foreland, had been sunk early that morning, while in tow, probably by torpedo. The casualties might be as few as40, although one party had still to be accounted for.Enemy mine-laying was taking place on a considerable scale in Home Waters. Most of our important ports were temporarilyclosed by mine-laying on most nights. The enemy appeared to beadopting new tactics, consisting of laying an acoustic mine with every magnetic mine. Merchant tonnage of a total volume ofsome 19,000 tons had been beached as a result, although no vessels had been sunk. Our mine-sweepers were very active, andwere cutting from 6 to 20 mines each day. Our experts were working day and night to discover the secret of the hew acousticmines.A submarine which had been patrolling off the Dutch coastwas twenty-four hours overdue.The War Cabinet were informed of the movements of theMediterranean Fleet. Their recent operations had included as weep towards the Dardanelles.Italian motor transport had been bombed by aircraft of theFleet Air Arm and the R.A.F. east of Sidi Barrani.Up to date we had lost 7 submarines, and the Italians some27 submarines in the Mediterranean. The former total includedtwo which were now overdue in the Mediterranean, and which hadbeen patrolling near the mouth of the Adriatic Sea. The Italiansclaimed to have torpedoed a British submarine recently in this area.H.M.S. Neptune was patrolling to the south of the indian ocean, with the object of discovering what had become of the crews of a number of merchant vessels which had been sunk inthe Indian Ocean during the last six months. She had visitedKerguelen Island, where she had found signs of previous enemy activity in the shape of an abandoned camp and a cliff which hadbeen used for target practice.Off Duala we had intercepted a French vessel of about 4,000tons, carrying timber for the Vichy Government. H.M.S. Devonshirewas patrolling off Libreville.In the Red Sea there was confirmation from air photographsthat we had sunk the Italian destroyer Francesco Nidlo. AnotherItalian destroyer, which we had bombed off Harmil Island, hadeither sunk or been towed away.[21862]b 2
Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there wasOperations.       nothing to report beyond active patrolling in the Kassala sector.On 23rd October a patrol had encountered a party of the enemy,estimated at 500 strong, who were digging and wiring in an area20 miles south of Kassala.   The enemy had withdrawn.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Greece. 2.   The War Cabinet were informed that following on the invasion by Italian ultimatum delivered to Greece at 3.0 a.m. that morning,jtaly and refused by the Greek Government an attack on Greece had(Previous begun.   Unconfirmed reports stated that Athens had been bombedReference: and that 10 Italian divisions, consisting of perhaps 200,000 men,W.M. (40) 277th were moving into Greece through the difficult country on theConclusions,      Albanian border.Minute 2.) The Greek Army consisted of 14 divisions, or something over200,000 men; but they were very short of equipment and inparticular of anti-aircraft guns.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that GeneralMetaxas had asked for our immediate help by sea to defend Corfu,by air to defend Athens and by financial assistance. (Athenstelegram No. 994.) The Greek Minister in London had made asimilar request.A discussion took place on possible methods of assistingGreece, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard Pile of WarCabinet Conclusions.United Statesof America.Supply ofMunitions.(previous reference:W.M, (40) 255thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. Arising out of the preceding Minute, the question was raised whether, as the result of the Italian attack on Greece, theUnited States of America would be more willing to make aircraft and other equipment immediately available.The Prime Minister said that nothing which was available at short notice would be likely to affect the immediate situation.He had, however, received a telegram (No. 2408) from Sir WalterLayton, putting forward a scheme for increasing the continuedmunitions output of Britain and America. The scheme was thatthis country should immediately place orders in the United Statesof America for equipment of American types for 10 divisions.These orders would be supplementary to, and not in substitution for, orders already placed in the United States for the british army programme. The scheme involved us in no capital expendi-ture and in no financial commitments until delivery was made tous from the United States War Department contractors.A message had been despatched saying that we gladly accepted this proposal.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Prance.negotiations between the vichy andGermanGovernments.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 277thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he hadreceived no confirmation of the report that M. Laval had replacedM. Baudouin at the French Foreign Office.The Foreign Secretary said that he had had further talks with M. Rougier, who had come over to this country the previousweek. In his earlier talks M. Rougier had stated emphaticallythat the Marshal would not accept the German terms regardingthe cession of bases. That morning he had adhered to this state-ment, but he had been disturbed. He had said that, as he couldnot return to Vichy in time to be of any service he thought itwould be useful if he went to Tangier and saw General Weygand
and General Nogues. After consultation with the Prime minister he (the Foreign Secretary) had told M. Rougier that we should beprepared for him to do this. Before leaving, however, it was desirable that M. Rougier should put on paper the kind of state-ments he proposed to make to General Weygand.Continuing, the  Foreign Secretary said  that  M. Rougierthought that General Weygand would react very sharply if theFrench had, accepted German terms such as had been suggestedf) in the press,    Should the General be in a mood critical of the vichy Government, he would wish to know if we would be in aposition to keep the Spanish Division in Morocco quiet, andwould also wish to know whether we could help in the way ofsupplies. To this he (the Foreign Secretary) had said that hecould not give precise answers, but we should be prepared toreceive any accredited persons the General might wish to sendand help them to the utmost of our power. Finally, M. Rougierhad said that General Weygand would be profoundly impressed bythe report he would give him of the state of affairs in Londonand the way it was standing up to the German bombing. TheGeneral believed that London had been flattened out.The Prime Minister said that it was extraordinary that neitherwe nor the Americans should have received any information as towhat had happened in the negotiations between the Germans andthe Vichy Government. The Vichy Government might haveagreed to join the German bloc without having the intention of adopting a more hostile attitude towards this country than theyhad in the last few months. The worst position from our pointof view would be if the Vichy Government had agreed to handover French bases to Germany and if General Weygand remained the servant of the Vichy Government. In that event our position at Gibraltar might become untenable. A number of plans hadbeen prepared, or were in course of preparation, to meet this contingency. They would not, of course, be put into effect untilthe position at Vichy became clear.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France.Establishmentof Council ofDefence byGeneral de gaulle.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 219thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thereport that had been received the previous evening that general de Gaulle had set up a rival Government was obviously untrue.It was perhaps tiresome that he should have chosen this moment to set up a Council of Defence without prior consultation with us.But the correspondence which had passed with General de Gaulleprovided for the setting up of a Council of Defence in due course.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Gibraltar.Provision ofCondensingPlant.6. In connection with Minute 4, reference was made to theprovision of condensing plant at Gibraltar to supplement thestored water reserve. It was suggested that this matter should havebeen taken in hand at an earlier date and pressed more resolutely.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to submit a report on the steps taken to provide this plant and thetime necessary to complete the installation.253 W.M. 278 (40)
Air raid damage.Use of Armyunits to repairdamage andclear debris.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 265thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention toan article in the Daily Mail that morning, complaining that theWar Office were refusing to allow the Army to take its share inessential work on the home front in the heavily bombed areas.The fact was that, although the Army was short of training, nodemands on the Army for labour had been refused. The Ministerof Home Security confirmed this statement.The Prime Minister said that it should be brought home to public opinion that our Army could not be properly trained forwar if it was continuously used for work which could be done bynavvies. At the same time, the Army could, of course, properly be called upon to assist the Civil Defence Services in cases ofemergency.In further discussion, the Minister of Labour and NationalService said that so far he had been able to meet all the demands for labour which had been made on his Department.It was also pointed out that the civilian labour employed onthese duties would have to be engaged for continuous work, and organised in regular groups. The first essential was that theorganisation for this purpose should be set up. Much had nowbeen done in this direction.The War Cabinet were also informed that public opinion fely strongly that insufficient work was being done on clearing awaydebris. This had a depressing effect on morale, and it mightwell be necessary to ask the Army if they could spare a furthernumber of men for a limited period until the arrears had beenovertaken.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the view that a civilian labour force should be organised for the work of clearing away debris and making good air raid damage. The Army should onlybe called upon to do this work in emergency, or for ashort period until the labour force could be organised and arrears overtaken.(2) Invited the Ministers concerned to consult together in orderto concert the necessary arrangements to this end.(3) Invited the Minister of Information, after consultationwith the Ministers concerned, to explain this policy tothe public, and at the same to make it clear (a) That the time of the Army must be spent inintensive military training.(b) That the War Office had not refused calls madeon the Army for labour to meet temporaryemergencies.Aircraft 8.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theProduction. Secretary of State for Air and the Secretary of State for DominionRequirements of Affairs (W.P. (40) 424 and 4&apos;26), on the supply of aircraft to NewNew Zealand. Zealand.The Secretary of State for Air said that he proposed that18 Hudsons should be shipped direct to New Zealand from theUnited States of America during the next two months. he supported this proposal on the following grounds: New zealand had relinquished her claim to 30 Wellington aircraft at thebeginning of the war. Since then she had repeatedly pressed forthe supply of up-to-date aircraft, the need for which was increasedby the presence of a suspected raider in New Zealand waters andby Japan&apos;s attitude of increasing hostility.  The supply of Hudson(previous reference:W.M. (40) 210thConclusions,Minute 1.)
255W.M. 278 (40)aircraft in prospect during the next two months showed a surplusbeyond that required for the maintenance of the five squadronsequipped with Hudsons.In discussion, the view was generally expressed that we couldnot afford to send these aircraft to New Zealand at the present justice.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that all the availableaircraft were needed for work in the North-West Approaches.If the Secretary of State for Air could not use these Hudsonaircraft to equip a new squadron, he would be glad if they couldbe handed over to the Fleet Air Arm.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that NewZealand would be greatly disappointed if these aircraft could notbe supplied, but the matter must be settled by the military needsof the moment. He thought that New Zealand should be informedthat, while these aircraft could not be spared now, we wouldsupply them with up-to-date aircraft as soon as we could manageto do so.The War Cabinet-Decided that 18 Hudson aircraft could not be sparedfor supply to New Zealand at this juncture, and thata communication should be sent to the New zealand government on the lines suggested by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs.Richmond Terrace, SAV. 1,October 28, 1940.
