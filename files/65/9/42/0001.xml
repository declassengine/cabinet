The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on the night28th-29th October a Whitley bomber had flown to the Skoda works at Pilsen, a flight of some 690 miles each way, and had made a successful attack.A Whitley of the Coastal Command, with the aid of the newapparatus, had found and bombed a submarine some 90 miles north-west of Bloody Foreland. The contact obtained by this aircraft had probably prevented an attack being made on a number ofmerchant vessels in the vicinity.Four hundred and sixty enemy aircraft had visited this country the previous day. This number included 20 Italian aircraft which,however, had not been encountered in the air fighting.The casualties for the previous day had been : Our own 7 aircraft (5 pilots safe).Enemy 27 certain.8 probable.10 damaged.The previous night 200 enemy machines had been over London,Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool. Thirty-seven of our aircraft had been sent up but had made no interceptions.One hundred and five aircraft had been sent out on the previous night to attack various targets. Three had reached Berlin in spiteof bad weather and had dropped 1,000 lb. bombs. Three of our machines had failed to return and two had crashed on landing inthis country.Of the six bombers which had left for Malta, one had crashedand another had returned owing to bad weather. No news had yetbeen received of the other four.The Chief of Naval Staff reported that battle cruisers andother forces were continuing their search west of the Faroes for asuspicious vessel which had been reported.Kent, after completing temporary repairs, had left Suez, andwas now returning to the United Kingdom.Aircraft from Eagle had carried out an attack on Maltezana,Stampalia, in the Dodecanese Islands, hitting a hangar and settingit on fire. A number of bombs had been dropped on the barracks and near an ammunition dump, and incendiary bombs had been widely spread over the target area.   All our aircraft had returned.The Submarine Swordfish patrolling off Cherbourg had attacked a convoy of enemy merchant ships and claimed one hit.A Norwegian vessel of 3,015 tons had been mined in the bristol channel.  Details of the damage had not yet been received.   *A sludge vessel had been sunk in the Thames Estuary.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatthere had been patrolling activity in the Blue Nile and Kassalasectors.  There had been nothing to report from other theatres.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Policy. 2.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the following information : A telegram had been received from Berne (No. 1208) reporting that M. Baudouin was instructing French representatives abroad to spread in conversation that every word so far published aboutthe Franco-German negotiations was false. The French Ministerat Dublin had also stated that the Vichy Government hoped toarrive at very satisfactory terms, and that there was no questionof cessions of territory or bases. There was no other news aboutthe negotiations.Sir Miles Lampson reported a conversation which he had had with General Catroux (telegram No. 1415 from Cairo) who was anxious to make an immediate appeal to Syria to join the free french. If this failed, he advocated working with the Druses and arabs to prevent enemy infiltration.The Foreign Secretary said that he had given instructions fora telegram to be sent to Egypt to the effect that action in this mattermust in any case await the outcome of the conference now being heldin Khartoum attended by the Secretary of State for War andGeneral Wavell. In any event, however, it seemed clear that it wasnecessary to suspend action on this and other projects (e.g., theaction proposed at Libreville and the stopping of escorted Frenchmerchant vessels passing through the Stoaits of Gibraltar) until the vichy position cleared.The War Cabinet agreed with this view.Egypt: visit of The Prime Minister said that he had requested the ^secretary secretary of of State for War to return to Cairo as soon as the Conference atState for War.

The War Cabinet were informed that detailed arrange-ments were now being made for a Meeting of Allied representatives on the lines discussed in the War Cabinet the previous week. TheMeetingwould comprise representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom, Holland, Belgium, Norway, Poland,Czechoslovakia and Greece, an observer from the French Free Forces,together with the Dominion High Commissioners (other than Eire).The Allied Representatives had been sounded, and were agreeable to the suggestion, which the Dominions Secretary would nowcommunicate to the Dominion High Commissioners.  As soon as theweek we should concentrate on Italian targets, at the same timekeeping a few machines for Berlin. We should also for the timebeing take as our primary objectives military targets in built built-up areas, marshalling yards and oil installations for a short periodbeing given second priority.The War Cabinet approved the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal.

The Meeting should be held as early aspossible, probably in about ten days&apos; time.The War Cabinet approved the arrangements proposed.Dan er 5.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProposed Minister without Portfolio  (W.P.  (G.)

(ii) In South Wales, and in Durham also if anapplication is made from the latter coalfield      2   9(iii) In the Kent coalfield   ...      ...      ...      ...      33In discussion the following points were made : (1) Two general increases of prices had been approved sincethe beginning of the war, the first of Is. (Is. 4:d. in wales) a ton from November, 1939, and the second of8c/. a ton from May, 1940. The increase now proposed was directly attributable to war damage sustained incertain districts which might have to go out ofproduction if the increase was not approved.(2) In the last war coal prices had been directly controlled,but great increases had taken place. Inland coal prices had been increased by about 6s. 6d. a ton, and export coal prices had been doubled or trebled. The outputs ofthe various districts had been allocated in the last war to different consuming areas. In the present war therise in inland prices had so far been much less than in1916-18.(3) At the beginning of the present war, the two sides in thecoal industry had agreed to retain the district ascertain-ment of wages which had been in force since 1921. Therehad, however, been a national flat rate addition to wages,based on the increased cost of living.It was clearly impossible within the next few days to alter the whole basis of wages and profits in the industry,although there might be Si CclSC for a fundamentalreview of the position before, say, the end of the calendar year. In any event, the system could not be alteredexcept by agreement with the men.
(4) The position had deteriorated greatly since the collapse of France, even in the normally prosperous districts.Taking the country as a whole, in August, 1940, theowners&apos; balances per ton had still shown an averagecredit of S\d. This had been completely wiped out inSeptember.   The returns for October would be worse.(5) The Prime Minister suggested that, if the increased pricesproposed in W.P. (G.) (40) 278 were approved, theannouncement of the increases should be accompaniedby a statement that the Government were considering whether some more scientific basis for determining coal prices could not be found.It was pointed out that any such statement wouldhave to be very carefully worded, in consultation withthe Treasury and the other Departments concerned.(6) It was pointed out that the proposed inCTeases in coal prices would have important repercussions : (a) on the prices of steel and other raw materials; onthe prices of gas and electricity, and on railwaycosts:(b) as a result, on the cost of living :(c) on wages in those industries (in which some 3,000,000workers were employed) where wages wereautomatically affected by cost of living changes :(d) on wages in other industries.(7) The President of the Board of Trade said that the effectof the proposed increases on the cost of living ought notto be exaggerated. His advisers thought that the consequent rise would not be more than one or two points.(8) It was pointed out that the index figure would also, in thenear future, be affected by the sales tax.(9) Steel prices had gone up 10 per cent, on the previous day,and it would be unfortunate if another rise occurred inthe near future.It was suggested that the price fixing machinery forthe various controlled raw materials should be reviewed,in order to ensure that the policy and timing of price changes were co-ordinated.The War Cabinet-(a) Gave general approval to the proposals for increases inpithead prices of coal, to take effect from the1st November, 1940, contained in W.P. (G.) (40) 278.(b) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in notifyingthe above price increases, to announce that the Govern-ment were reviewing the position of the coal industry,with the object of discovering whether some morescientific basis of dotormining wageo and profito couldnot be found. The President was invited to draft this announcement in consultation with the Minister without portfolio, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and anyother Ministers concerned. This announcement shouldnot refer to the recent negotiations with the central council of Colliery Owners for a levy scheme.(c) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to consult with theMinister of Supply in regard to the arrangements for regulating the prices of controlled raw materials.
O7. The Minister of Home Security said that the enemy bombingduring the last 24 hours had been indiscriminate, but on a smaller scale than previously. Casualties also had been much smaller than hitherto. The principal objectives had been London, birmingham and Merse3*side.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Air Raids.Shelter Policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 272ndConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Home Security (W.P. (G.) (40) 275) on Air Raid ShelterPolicy.The Minister of Home Security explained that our Air RaidShelter Policy had been governed by the assumption that raids wouldbe comparatively short, and that shelters must be readily accessible.Prolonged night raiding had, however, led certain sections of thepublic to seek shelter, irrespective of warnings, towards nightfalland to stay there until morning. The arguments against deepshelters which had hitherto prevailed were, therefore, no longerentirely valid. While it was impossible to apply any widespreadpolicy of deep shelter which could be applied evenly over thevulnerable areas of the country, the Minister felt that it would notbe right, on this account, to dismiss the possibility of deep shelters.He accordingly suggested that work should be put in hand for providing additional shelter by tunnelling. In London this con-struction would be linked with the Tube system. In the Provincestunnelling would be carried out where the physical features made this practicable.The Minister added that he was anxious, in a broadcast whichhe would have to make shortly, to deal with the mischievousCommunist agitation on the deep shelter question. He felt, however,that it would be impossible for him to deal with the situationadequately if he adopted a wholly negative attitude towards theprovision of deep shelters where this was practicable.In a preliminary discussion the view was expressed that, ifthe Minister&apos;s proposals were adopted, the advocates of deep sheltersAvould claim that the case for deep shelters had been conceded inprinciple, but that the measures proposed to provide them were entirely inadequate. It was also argued that to provide deepshelters for a very small proportion of the population would do littlegood and would have unfortunate psychological results.To this it was replied that the people of this country were toosensible to wish to see a remedy negatived, merely because it couldnot be universally provided.The Lord President of the Council said that, while theconditions now experienced were different from those anticipatedwhen the policy governing the provision of air raid shelters hadbeen laid down, the Minister of Home Security&apos;s proposal did not really represent any fundamental departure from existing policy.Deep shelters had been approved in a number of cases where suitabledeep tunnels could be made available; e.g., Ramsgate, Rochesterand Luton. While, however, there was everything to be said foran extension of this policy where feasible, the proposal to drivetunnels linked with the Tube system would require very careful handling. There was the risk that if this proposal was taken up by public opinion in the wrong way, it might be used to discredit thewhole shelter policy.The Minister of Home Security thought it was important to mention publicly the proposal to make new tunnels connected withthe Tubes.   This point was reserved for further discussion.Damage and casualties.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 279thConclusions,Minute 3.)
The general conclusion expressed in this preliminary discussion was that the question at issue was mainly one of emphasis inpresentation. The general line to be followed might be as follows.The Minister of Home Security would start his statement bystressing the importance of spreading the risk and of popularisingthe smaller shelters. He would explain that there was neither timenor material available for the construction of deep shelters for large numbers of people. But this was no reason why such measures should not be taken to provide additional deep shelter accommoda-tion where this was feasible. The statement should not berepresented as a reversal of existing policy.The War Cabinet Took note of this preliminary discussion, and invited theMinister of Home Security to submit to the War cabinet a draft of the statement which he proposed to make on thismatter.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 30, 1940.
