The adjournmentmight be for 14 days.(b) Thereafter Parliament  should hold very shortmeetings at irregular intervals, e.g., it was undesirable that Parliament should always becalled together on a Tuesday.These arrangements would, of course, apply to bothHouses of Parliament.Air raid warnings.The cause of loss of workingtime inMunitionsFactories.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 270thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The, Minister of Labour and. National Service said that hehad begun his examination of the position at munitions factories,with a view to eliminating conditions leading to a loss of workingtime, and he hoped to achieve good results by such methods asmeeting the men in the workshops and taking their difficultiesinto consideration. He was being assisted in this task by aspecial branch of his Department working in co-operation withrepresentatives of the Air Ministry and Ministry of Home Security.In seaport towns representatives of the Admiralty would also bebrought into consultation.Outside London there had been a considerable improvement,but some difficulty was still being experienced at Bristol.The Lord, Privy Seal suggested that it might be practicable toestablish &quot; control rooms &quot; in the larger factories. The men would feel more confidence if they knew that their managementswere able to follow the movements of enemy aircraft in theirneighbourhood.The War Cabinet took note with approval of the above statements.
5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, accord-ing to a recent telegram from Moscow (No. 878), the possibilities of a trade or barter agreement looked promising. Sir Stafford Crippshad been instructed to proceed with negotiations on the basissuggested in his telegram.The Foreign Secretary also referred to certain action taken inthis country to requisition ships belonging to the Baltic States.M. Maisky had said that, if we requisitioned these ships, it wouldhave the most serious effect on our relationship with the U.S.S.R.He (the Foreign Secretary) had therefore taken the responsibilityof informing Sir Stafford Cripps that, if he was satisfied that the requisitioning of these ships would spoil the chances of successfulnegotiations with the U.S.S.R., we would countermand this action.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Far East. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that severalExport of telegrams had been received from Sir Robert Craigie in the lastprohibited few days, as a result of a report which had reached Japan thatarticles from we intended to remove the restrictions on exports of prohibitedHong Kong to articles from Hong Kong to China.   This report, which was dueChina, to a  misunderstanding,  had made Sir Robert anxious as  to(Previous Japan&apos;s reactions.

(40) 270thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad seen the Netherlands Minister on the previous day, at therequest of the Chiefs of Staff, to ask whether the Dutch would co-operate in the Singapore Defence Conference and in other staff conversations.The Dutch Minister had said that the United States defenceauthorities had asked to be supplied with a good deal of technical and strategic information about the Netherlands East Indies.He had no doubt that this request would be agreed to. The Dutchwere rather reluctant to go so far as to Nsend representatives to singapore, but arrangements would be made for the exchange ofinformation in London.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Spain.Replacement ofSefior Beigbederby sea or Suneras ForeignMinister.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 270thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the replacement of Senor Beigbeder by Sefior Suner as ForeignMinister was bad from our point of view. Our Ambassador had warned us that this was a possibility, but he had not expected the change to take place so soon.The War Cabinet were informed that there was a good dealof information which seemed to show that this change might not mean quite so muoh as appeared at first sight. The change was,no doubt, a defeat for the anti-German party. But anti-Germanfeeling in Spain was very strong.   While, therefore, it was wiseAnglo-soviet relations.^previous reference:W.M.

(previous reference:W.M. (40) 267thConclusions,Minute 3.)to treat this change as a definite set-back and to make plansaccordingly, we should still not assume that Spain was bound tocome into the war against us, and we should make every effort tokeep Spain out of the war.The Foreign Secretary said that he intended to consultSir Samuel Hoare as to whether, in the circumstances, it wouldbe wise to make the proposed statement on Anglo-Spanishrelations in Parliament on the following Tuesday.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France.Policy towardsthe vichy government.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 272ndConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a draft telegram toSir Samuel Hoare (W.P. (40) 420) as to relations with the vichy government. A number of amendments were made, and are setout in the Conclusions to this Minute.Discussion turned mainly on aD amendment proposed to bemade at the end of paragraph 7, to the effect that if we tookreprisals against targets in unoccupied Prance we should directour attention particularly to the seat of the Vichy Governmentwherever it might be.The Prime Minister favoured an amendment in this sense, asthe most likely means of deterring the Vichy Government frombombing Gibraltar. He did not think they were likely to do this ;but if we were to retaliate, we should retaliate effectively; and ifthe Vichy Government were driven out of Vichy, it would be along step towards their final liquidation.The Foreign Secretary thought that there were strong arguments against bombing Vichy. In the first place, information was accumulating to show that feeling in unoccupied Prance was going in our favour. Nevertheless, we were being continuallywarned by our friends that the French people had a greatveneration for Marshal Petain and that it would be inadvisable to take action against him personally.In the second place, he thought, that the bombing of an opentown like Vichy was likely to produce the opposite effect to thatdesired. He thought that it would be better to indicate that weshould bomb targets in unoccupied France, and to leave the vichy government guessing. His own view would be that we shouldattack military targets, such as the oil tanks in unoccupied France,which we had hitherto refrained from bombing.In further discussion it was pointed out that the matter forimmediate decision was not whether authority should be givennow to bomb Vichy. That question would not arise unless and until the French bombed Gibraltar again. The immediate question was how we could put into Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s hands a threat which could most effectively deter the French government from bombing Gibraltar again. For this purpose it would be adequate to add to paragraph 7 the words &quot; Even the seat ofGovernment itself would not necessarily be immune.&quot;The War Cabinet (1) Approved the despatch to Sir Samuel Hoare of the draft telegram proposed by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (40) 420), subject to the following amend-ments: Paragraph 2 should read as follows: &quot; You should speak to the French Ambassador on the following lines.&quot;
Paragrapli 4, line 2.   After &quot; and &quot; insert &quot; still.&quot;Paragraph 4. After the first sentence insert thefollowing : &quot; They inflexibly reject all enemy suggestions of which they have had notice to make a peace inwhich Germany and Italy would be paid off out of the territories of France.&quot;Paragraph 4, line 4.   After &quot;our &quot; insert &quot;own.&quot;Paragraph 6, line 6. For &quot; satisfy &quot; read &quot; convince.&quot;Paragraph 6. At end add : &quot; We feel pretty sure that this victory will be achieved.&quot;Paragraph 7. line 4. After &quot;territory&quot; add &quot; har-bours.&quot;Paragrapli 7.   At end add &quot; and you may add in thcourse of conversation that even the seat of government itself would not necessarily be immune.&quot;(2) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should informSir Samuel Hoare that the draft telegram had beenprepared on the basis of the summary of the french governments reply, the full text not having beenreceived. Unless, however, the instructions sent tohim required modification by reason of some point inthe full text of the French communication not coveredby the summary, he should act on these instructionsforthwith.France.BlockadeQuestions.(Previouslieference10. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister of Economic Warfare and the First Lord of theAdmiralty (W.P. (40) 410 and W.P. (40) 418 respectively).A short preliminary discussion took place on the Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty.   It was felt, however, thatthis Paper raised such wide issues in regard to naval strength-x   (  )    nd that it would be better to have a discussion on this matter at a conclusions,      j t    Meeting when more time was available.minute 3.) &quot;On the blockade issues, the Minister of Economic Warfaresaid that, while he was quite ready to agree to make concessions in regard to trade between North Africa and ports in unoccupied france, he could not agree to a position whereby French west african trade proceeded virtually without interference.As regards the trade from North Africa (including the atlantic ports of French Morocco as suggested in paragraph 8 ofthe telegram to Sir Samuel Hoare, see Minute 9), he thought thatit would be perfectly right that we should allow certain foodstuffs to pass. We should, however, prevent alloys being shipped fromCasablanca to the Mediterranean ports of France. To enable acourse of this kind to be carried out, we should have to have aConsul at Casablanca. -The Minister also drew attention to the almost symbolicnature of some of the escorts now used to convoy French shipsthrough the Straits of Gibraltar. He was not asking that everyblockade-runner should be intercepted, but only that sufficientships should be seized to act as a deterrent.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it was his duty toput the full facts of the naval position before the War Cabinet. Afew weeks ago he had hoped that we should be greatly stronger asregards the type of vessel which was of importance for blockade and convoy duties. Owing, however, to mishaps to a number of cruisers, and to delays in the dockyards, we were not at present ina position to assemble a strong fleet at the Straits of Gibraltar.It was, of course, within the Admiralty&apos;s power to stop the weakescorts with the convoys now passing through the Straits. If,however, the French retaliated against such action, we should
have to act at once with the forces immediately at our disposal.In the Admiralty view, having regard to the naval position, if itwas possible for us to reach a tolerable agreement with the vichy government, we should lose no opportunity of doing so.Discussion followed as to whether we should take action to stop escorted French vessels proceeding through the Straits,pending further discussions at Madrid as the result of the telegram to Sir Samuel Hoare, dealt with in the preceding minute. The Foreign Secretary said that he thought the chances of reaching a satisfactory agreement with the Vichy Governmentwere not great. In any case we were now unlikely to reach anagreement quickly. We had waimed the Vichy Government thatwe reserved our rights of blockade, and he was in favour of taking action in regard to escorted vessels without waiting for furtherresults from the negotiations, provided that we acted with greatdiscretion.The War Cabinet agreed That the Admiralty should no longer be debarred fromapplying Contraband Control Measures to escortedFrench convoys passing through the Straits of Gibraltar.That the authority to interfere with escorted Frenchconvoys must be used with discretion. Thus, when anescorted convoy was stopped, it should be by an over-whelming show of force, so as to avoid the risk of havingactually to use force; and it was not necessary for thepresent to attempt to stop every convoy.(previous reference:W.M.
