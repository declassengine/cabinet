Parliament.Bill to extend the duration ofthe present parliament.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 269thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Lord Privy Seal suggested that it would be desirableto make some statement during the second reading of the prolongation of Parliament Bill indicating the governments intention to arrange for a new register of electors before a generalelection was held after the war.The War Cabinet agreed that the Home Secretary shouldmake the following statement: An appeal to the electorate must always remain the finalconstitutional method of resolving grave issues of national policy. No one can foresee what circumstances will arise,but in normal conditions it will be the desire of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, when a general election again becomespracticable, to give sufficient notice for the creation of a newregister, and this interval woidd also afford an opportunityfor the House to consider, if it so desired, questions connectedwith changes of our electoral system.Government 2.   The Prime Minister said that he had examined the needDepartments. for safer accommodation for essential Government staffs whoProtected would have to continue to work in London.   A number of theseaccommodation, staffs were now working in old buildings which were quite(Previous insecure, and should be moved to buildings which wrould provideReference:        greater safety and which would afford them reasonable means of w.M. (40) 273rd carrying on their work.    For many reasons &quot;Paddock&quot; was an conclusions,      unsuitable solution to the problem.   The Foreign Office BuildingMinute 2.)        and the &quot;New Public Offices&quot; were strongly built, but were notconstructed to withstand direct hits.   He had given authority for part of the latter building to be strengthened so as to give aconsiderable measure of security, but the work would not becompleted for six weeks.    As part of the problem of providingadequate accommodation for central staffs, the Board of trade had been invited to move to new premises.   The Department was prepared to fall in with this arrangement, but this move must beconsidered in relation to the general scheme.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that&apos; there were anumber of stronger modern buildings in London of steel-framedconstruction, some of them still uncompleted, within a com-paratively short distance of Whitehall, and he thought that ministers and essential staffs should be distributed among these buildings when the necessary works had been completed. TheMinister of Aircraft Production had concerned himself in thematter, and might be authorised to direct and supervise, on behalfof the War Cabinet, the important and extensive works required.The Minister of Aircraft Production informed the War cabinet of the buildings which he had in mind. These buildings were as yet uncompleted, so that the question of turning out other people to make room for the Government staffs did not arise. Thebuilding which he had in mind for the accommodation of thePrime Minister, War Cabinet Ministers and certain staffsconnected with the higher direction of the war would, he hoped,be ready for occupation within three to four weeks.Reference was made to the Prime iViiriister&apos;s accommodation.The War Cabinet were unanimously of the opinion that it was wrong for the Prime Minister to continue to five or to transactbusiness at No. 10, Downing Street. They urged him most strongly to agree to other arrangements being made forthwith for hisaccommodation in a securer building.The War Cabinet invited the Minister of Aircraft Pro-duction to direct and supervise on their behalf theprogramme of works necessary to provide adequateprotected accommodation in London for the centralnucleus of the Government.b 2[21850]
The Minister of Aircraft Production would keep inclose touch with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, andwith the Minister of Works and Buildings and first commissioner of Works, and would have authority tosettle any questions of allocation of accommodationinvolved.Parliament.Alternativemeeting-place.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 273rdConclusions,Minute 3.)8. In connexion with the preceding Minute, further dis-cussion took place on the question of an alternative meeting-place for Parliament. Doubts were expressed whether ChurchHouse was a suitable meeting-place.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production, as part ofthe work of supervising the provision of accommodation in London for the central nucleus of Government, to take account of the arrangements for alternative accommoda-tion for Meetings of Parliament, in consultation with theLord President of the Council.The Prime Minister also said that, when Parliament adjournedon Thursday, it was his intention to propose an adjournment forfourteen days.General agreement was expressed with the view that it was most undesirable that Parliament should make a habit of meetingfor two or three days consecutively.Propaganda.Long-wavebroadcasting:Middle East.4. The Minister of Labour and National Service said that ithad been suggested to him that we were not making enough useof propaganda on the long wave-lengths; and that in particular the question of our propaganda in the Middle East ought perhaps to be enquired into.The War Cabinet: Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toraise these questions at a Meeting when the Minister ofInformation and the Minister of Economic Warfare werepresent.Shipping.shipping losses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 274thConclusions,Minute 1.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 141stConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Prime Minister said that the shipping losses of thelast two or three days had been without precedent. Some100,000 tons of shipping had been sunk, in spite of the fact thatone of the convoys attacked had been strongly protected. Onthe previous evening he had reviewed the matter with those concerned, and the adoption of certain measures, which the PrimeMinister described, had been decided upon. The Prime Ministeradded that, if the new measures to be adopted were not successful,it would be necessary to raise again the question of the use ofcertain bases in the Irish Free State.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
The Railways.financial questions.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (40) 240thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumbv the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport(W.P. (G.) (40) 270).The Memorandum dealt with two main points: First, it was recommended that effect should be given at once to the recommendations in the Report of the Charges (Railway-Control) Consultative Committee ; namely, that no increase shouldbe made in season tickets, workmen&apos;s tickets, or ordinary fareson the L.P.T.B. system, but that other charges and fares shouldbe increased from 10 per cent, to 16f per cent, above the pre-warbasis.Secondly, it was pointed out that the new War compensation scheme cut across the Agreement with the Railway Companies,which provided that the cost of restoring war damage up to amaximum of m10 millions a year should be met as a revenuecharge. It was therefore suggested that the principles of theRailway Agreement should be preserved, but that negotiations should at once be opened with the Railway Companies with aview to such modifications of that Agreement as might benecessary in the light of the Governments War compensation scheme.Increased charges.(1) The Minister of Transport said that, whatever might bethe position after the war as to the management andownership of the railways, it was important to have a healthy railway system not dependent on subsidies,and with an incentive to efficiency.(2;Increases in freights would not incrpase food costs morethan &apos;ld. per person per week.(3) The Minister without Portfolio said that, if there was anyquestion of further increases in railway charges infuture to meet still higher costs, he would stronglyoppose any further increase in freights, which would cost far more to the State, in the long run, than anoutright subsidy. The same objection, however, didnot apply to an increase in fares.Negotiation of a New Railway Agreement.(4) The Minister of Transport&apos; said that until some weeks ago it had looked as though the Railway companies would earn a net pool profit of  44 millions. since then, traffic had fallen off, and a net pool profit in 1940of a little over ; 40 millions now appeared likely.(5) General agreement was expressed with the view that anew Railway Agreement should be negotiated, and thatthe terms of the original Agreement had perhaps been rather generous.(6) Looked at from this point of view, it was perhaps goingtoo far to state that &quot; the principles of the existingRailway Agreement should be preserved.&quot; The Chan-. &apos; cellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport? undertook to explore the basis of the new agreement and to submit proposals to the War Cabinet.(7) The suggestion was made that the Executive committee might become a Board responsible to the Ministerof Transport only for the period of the war.The War Cabinet :-(i) Agreed that effect should be given forthwith to therecommendations in the Report of the Charges (Rail-way Control) Consultative Committee.
(ii) Agreed that negotiations should be opened with theRailway Companies with a view to the negotiation ofa new Agreement, which should take into account theGovernment&apos;s War Compensation Scheme.(iii) Invited the Minister of Transport to make an announce-meht in regard to (i) and (ii) in Parliament.(iv) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Transport to consult together and submit to theWar Cabinet the outlines of the new Agreementproposed.Richmond Terrace, S W 1,October 22, 11)40.
