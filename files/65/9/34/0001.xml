Middle East. 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the visit of the       Secretary of State for War&apos;s arrival in Egypt had become widelySecretary of      known and that a communique regarding the visit was being issuedState for War     that day.to Egypt.(previous reference: _W.M. (40) 270thConclusions,Minute 2.)Middle East.Despatch of reinforcements.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 270thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that anumber of telegrams from our Ministers at Athens and Angoraraised questions regarding the strength of our forces in the middle east.He thought it would be desirable that in reply to their telegramshe should make some play with the measures proposed to strengthen our position in the Middle East. He referred in this connection tothe Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on Air Reinforce-ments to the Middle East (W.P. (40) 419).The Prime Minister said that the question of sending reinforce-ments to the Middle East, including air reinforcements, had beenconsidered by the Defence Committee on the previous evening,* andcertain decisions arrived at. He thought the information containedin the Minutes of this Meeting would give the Secretary of State theinformation he required. They would be circulated to the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.France.Policy towardsthe vichy government.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 269thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet a summary of the reply received from the Vichy Government(telegram No. 862 from Madrid).In a preliminary discussion the Prime Minister said thatM. Baudouin&apos;s reply was not impressive, though it did not close the door to the suggested conversations. He thought the Vichy Govern-ment should be told that we were not proposing to take aggressive action against them; that we intended to support de Gaulle and maintain our rights of blockade; and that, whilst we should allowtrade within the Mediterranean, we should intercept escortedconvoys from French West African ports. We should add that, inthe event of the Vichy Government retaliating by bombing Gibraltar,then not only should we bombard Casablanca but we would bombVichy itself. He was of opinion, however, that it would not benecessary to go to such extremes.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressed generalagreement with this view, but drew a distinction between the effecton French opinion of blockade measures and action such as had beentaken at Oran and Dakar, which had retarded the swing of french public opinion to our side. It would be better to proceed by oraldiscussions than by way of notes, and he would draft, for considera-tion by the War Cabinet, a directive to Sir Samuel Hoare for use in conversations with the French Ambassador in Madrid.The War Cabinet :-Took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs would be circulating, for their consideration, a draftdirective to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Madrid.D.O.

naval operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 271stConclusions,Minute 1.)TheMediterranean.Home Waters.Coal traffic.4. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that H.M.S.Liverpool had been torpedoed by air attack late on the evening ofthe 14th. Her back had been broken, and whilst being towed to alexandria her bow had become detached. Further information wasbeing awaited.H.M.S. Erebus, together with 3 destroyers and 2 spotting air-craft, had fired 50 rounds of 15-inch shell into Dunkerque on theprevious night, without reply from the enemy. A number of fireshad been observed in the dock area.Submarine L. 27 had reported three hits on a 7,000-ton merchant ship off Cherbourg.The increased casualties to small craft, owing to mines round the coast, was causing the Admiralty a certain amount of anxiety.The matter was under active consideration.The Lord President of the Council said that it was important to keep going the East Coast coal traffic.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Press.Subversivearticles.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 268thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The Lord Privy Seal said that, as directed by the WarCabinet on the 9th October, he and the Minister of aircraft production had seen representatives of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association. They had explained that the Government took aserious view of the position. The impression left on his mind hadbeen that these representatives recognised that the articles in the sunday Pictorial and the Daily Mirror were mischievous, and thatthey would do what they could to remedy matters. Later,Mr. Esmond Harmsworth (one of the representatives of the News-paper Proprietors&apos; Association at the interview) had rung up and asked whether he (the Lord Privy Seal) would see representativesof the Sunday Pictorial and the Daily Mirror. On the advice ofLord Beaverbrook he had agreed to do so. Two representatives had come to the meeting, Mr. Bartholomew and Mr. C. H. King.Mr. Bartholomew had been the more reasonable of the two.Mr. King had at first tried to adopt the attitude that he did not see what harm these articles were doing. The Lord Privy Seal said thathe had made it clear that many people thought these articles were a deliberate Fifth Column activity. The representatives of the twonewspapers had suggested that an approach might have been madeto them at an earlier date by the Government. At the end of the interview, howeA^er, they had both appeared somewhat chastened,and had undertaken to exercise care in the future.The Minister of A aircraft Production said that he thought thatthese two newspapers would amend their behaviour, at any rate forthe time being.The Home Secretary said that he had ordered investigations tobe made as to who exercised the controlling influence over these twonewspapers, notwithstanding that there was some risk of itsbecoming known that these investigations were being made.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements. .
Armistice Day. 6.   The Home Secretary said that a year ago the War Cabinet(Previous had decided that there should be no general celebration of ArmisticeReference: Day, but that the usual Poppy Day Collection should take place on W.M. (39) 38th the 11th November, and that no obstacle would be placed in the wayConclusions, of local observance of the day if desired by small communities. ItMinute 12.) had also been agreed that the Sunday following Armistice day should be observed clS cl Day of Dedication.The Home Secretary proposed that a similar course should befollowed this year, and that a recommendation in this sense shouldbe made to The King. He intended to consult the Archbishop of canterbury as to whether any notice of the arrangements suggested should be published in the Press.The War Cabinet :-Approved these proposals, and invited the Home Secretaryto make the necessary arrangements.Air Raids. 7    The Minister of Home Security said that relatively serious damage and damage had been suffered during the last two nights.  Public moraleeffect on was good, but he thought we should look ahead, as morale mightcivilian begin to suffer if the public felt that our reply to night bombingmorale. was ineffective.   It was of the utmost importance that every effort(Previous should be made to press ahead as quickly as possible with the meansReference: of countering night bombing.W.M. (40) 27lst        During the last two or three nights two tube stations had been conclusions, pierced.    The effect had been to make the public realise that minute 3.) practically no kind of shelter was invulnerable.Reference was made to the very serious structural damage tothe Carlton Club, where the building had been wrecked but virtually no personal injury had been sustained by the large number of people in the club. In some other cases, large numbers of casualties hadbeen sustained at individual shelters, e.g., the refuge under the StokeNewington block of flats. While the effects of high explosive bombs were freakish, everything pointed to the advantages of dispersal.The War Cabinet were also informed that the Germans had recently announced publicly that their air attack was to be directed against the big hotels and clubs.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.GovernmentDepartments.protected accommodation.8. The Prime Minister said that, while it was no doubtdesirable to have alternative quarters in the London area to whichthe nucleus of the Government could transfer in. the event of some temporary emergency, he was more than ever satisfied that it was essential that the central nucleus of Government should not move.This, however, carried with it certain consequences. First, only theessential headquarters staff should remain in Central London. he agreed with a suggestion made by the Lord Privy Seal that the&quot; Grey &quot; Move should proceed as rapidly as possible. Secondly, steps should be taken to ensure that accommodation for those working in central London was as safe as possible. This might involve seriousstructural work to improve existing accommodation. He thoughtthat there should be a survey of the protected accommodation ofGovernment Departments, which varied considerably in quality.Thirdly, steps must be taken to enable the staff to adapt themselvesto the new conditions.  This would mean the provision of canteens
and sleeping arrangements so that the staff could remain in their offices for several days on end before going away for a day or two days&apos; rest.The War Cabinet: Expressed general agreement with these views and invited the Prime Minister to issue a directive on these lines to theDepartments concerned.Parliament. 9.   reference was made to two Parliamentary Questions, ofUndesirable which one had disclosed the identity of an air raid shelter, whileParliamentary the other had contained a statement that work-people were unwillingQuestions.        to work overtime on account of air raids.It was generally agreed that it was undesirable that such questions should appear on the Order Paper. The Clerk at the tablehad certain powers in this matter, and the Lord Privy Seal was invited to draw7 his attention to the point.It was also suggested that the Minister of Labour and NationalService might reply to the second of these two Questions in terms which would make plain to Members generally the undesirability of putting down Questions from which the enemy might deriveencouragement.Parliament.Alternativeplace of meeting.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 269thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Lord! President of the Council said that together withthe Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, theFirst Commissioner of Works and the Chief Whip, he had inspectedChurch House, Westminster. They were unanimously of the opinionthat Church House would provide a suitable alternative meetingplace for Parliament. The Office of Works were taking thenecessary steps to adapt the building.Church House had already suffered a direct hit from a bomb.This had served to demonstrate the structural strength of the mainpart of the building, and was not an objection to the course proposed.The War Cabinet :-Approved the use of Church House, Westminster,alternative meeting place for Parliament.as anIndia.Proposal toappoint Indianpoliticalleaders to theViceroy&apos;sExecutiveCouncil.Setting up of aWar AdvisoryCouncil.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 212thConclusions,Minute 1.)11. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (G.) (40) 252 and 260).The Secretary of State for India said that the situation had now been changed by the refusal of both Congress and the moslem league to be parties to the plan of appointing Indian political leaders to the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council, and of setting up a war advisory Council. The Viceroy now recommended that the plan should be held in suspense, and should not be implemented unless and until such degree of general support was forthcoming as would ensure that the expanded Executive Council and the proposed war advisory Council were reasonably representative.The Secretary of State endorsed this course. He added thatwhile the failure of India&apos;s politicians to take responsibility wasdisappointing, the general result of our declared policy was not unsatisfactory.  It had : (a) Assured the Moslems that we were not seeking to settle thefuture constitution of India over their heads, in consulta-tion only with Congress. This had already led to more active co-operation as well as to a greater readiness tocomply with Defence Rules;
India.SuggestedIndustrialTraining of indians in the united kingdom.12. The Minister of Labour and National Service thought thatthe War Cabinet ought to be aware that the Viceroy had not seenhis way to accept a proposal, which hadebeen communicated to himthrough the India Office, under which a certain number of Indiansshould be sent to this country for industrial training courses. TheViceroy&apos;s view was that it was sufficient to hold courses in Indiaunder British instructors.There was much to be said for holding these courses both inthis country and in India. If semi-skilled Indian workers were brought over here they would come under the wholesome influence ofthe British Labour Movement, besides being turned into skilledworkmen.The view was expressed that Indian labour was now a fertilebreeding ground for Communist propaganda. It was deplorablethat bona fide labour had little or no influence in Indian politics.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Secretary of State for India to give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the Viceroy, to thescheme for bringing Indian workmen to this country for industrial training courses.India.Proposed HighCommissionerfor India inSouth Africa.13.   The War Cabinet :-Approved the proposals in WP. (G.) (40) 258 for the con-version of the post of Agent-General to the Governmentof India in South Africa to that of a High Commissioner.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 16, 1940.(b) On the other hand, the Hindus have realised that theViceroy is not in Mr. Jinnah&apos;s pocket. Nevertheless, theCongress party would continue recalcitrant, and some oftheir leaders, including Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, mighthave to be imprisoned.(c) We had justified our sincere desire for constitutional progress in India in the eyes of reasonable indian opinion and in the world outside, and could afford to&quot; stand pat&quot; on our declared policy.In discussion it was suggested that, now that we had taken our decision about the Burma Road, we might enlist the help of chiang kai-shek -shek in persuading Indian democratic leaders to co-operate inour war effort.The War Cabinet :-Authorised the Secretary of State for India (1) To inform the Viceroy that the proposals in his telegram of the 8th October were approved.(2) To submit a draft of the statement for publication, out-lined in paragraph 7 of that telegram.
