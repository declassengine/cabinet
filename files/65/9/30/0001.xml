The Chief of the Air Staff reported that 250 enemy aircraft had operated over this country on the previous morning.Two raids had penetrated to London and dropped bombs in whitehall.  A number of aerodromes had also been attacked.The previous night the enemy had sent over some 220 machines,140 of which had attacked the London area. Bombs had hitSouthwark Generating Station, the Wandsworth Power Station,and Shoreditch Hospital, where there had been casualties. the casulties for the previous day had been :  Our own 4 machines.(4 pilots missing.)Enemy 6 certain (2 by A.A.).2 probable.4 damaged.During the previous night 105 of our aircraft had attacked the invasion ports and various targets in Germany. 4 of our machines had crashed on returning, the crews of 2 being killed.We had also lost 3 photographic machines.6 Blenheims had made a successful attack on Assab.The First Sea Lord reported that a further 5 United states destroyers had arrived at Belfast.Particulars were given of the position of certain convoys ontheir way to the Middle East.At the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet: :Invited the Admiralty, together with the Ministry ofShipping, to examine the possibility of using some of thelarge fast ocean-going liners for transport purposes. Itmight, for instance, be possible to ship troops to, say,&apos;Freetown, Capetown or Bermuda in smaller vessels, andthen tranship them to faster ships, which would take them to their destination.The arrival of certain of General de gaulle&apos;s forces at ports in French Equatorial Africa was reported.The Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therewas nothing to report.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.2. At the request of the Prime Minister, the First Lord ofthe Admiralty undertook to study the possibility of interceptingcertain empty cargo ships, which, according to Telegram No. 2223from Lord Lothian, were on their way to West African ports. Itmight be easier to intercept these ships on their way to Dakar andCasablanca than after leaving these ports.W.M.

We could notretaliate, as the Roumanians in this country were not supporters ofthe present Roumanian Government, but he had authorised theBritish Minister in Bucharest to begin his preparations for leavingRoumania, and for evacuating the remaining British subjects there,if he thought necessary.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Roumania.Detention ofBritish subjects.(previous reference:W.M, (40) 261stConclusions:Minute 4.)The Far East. 6.   In a discussion of the Far Eastern Situation, the following(Previous points were made :  Reference: (1) The interview at which Sir Robert Craigie had informedW.M.

It was clearly necessary that
they should also be represented at the Staff Conversa-tions which it was proposed to hold first in London andthen in Washington.(6) Washington telegram No. 2220 also showed thatMr. Cordell Hull was getting impatient about the delay in starting these conversations. The Chief of the AirStaff thought that this telegram must have crossed the telegram (No. 2556) which had been despatched theprevious day welcoming these conversations.The War Cabinet:-(a) Took note of the above statements.(b) Agreed that the Dominions of Canada, Australia and NewZealand should be represented at the forthcomingx\nglo-American Staff Conversations.Proposed Anglo-American staff conversations.Chemical 7.

(39) 94thConclusions,Minute 9.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (G.) (40) 253) dealing with a difficulty which had arisen over the number of Polish Army Officerswhom the Polish Government desired to see maintained in thiscountry.The Secretary of State for War said that it would be unfair,not only to the British taxpayers, but also to British Officers andother ranks, if one of the Allied contingents in this countrycontained a disproportionate number of officers compared with theBritish forces. General Sikorski wished to maintain some 4,200Polish Officers here, 3,200 on full rates of pay and 1,000 on lower rates. According to British standards, taking a generous view, only some 1,400 officers were required by the Polish contingents.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that the high proportion ofofficers in the Polish contingents was not due to any discreditablereasons.  A large number of them had been on the staff of the Polish
War Office. Others were young officers who had been trained inFrance. He thought that it would be necessary to reach a compromise settlement with General Sikorski. Would it not help the Secretary of State for War if he insisted on satisfying himself as to the military value of these officers 1The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that there wouldbe repercussions on the other Allied contingents if we gave undulyfavourable terms to the Poles. He asked to be kept informed of thecourse of the negotiations.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Secretary of State for War to make the bestarrangement possible with the Polish Government.The Press.Subversivearticles.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 267thConclusions,Minute 6.)10. The War Cabinet resumed discussion of this question,and had before them a Memorandum by the Home Secretary(W.P. (40) 402) suggesting that, while representations should bemade to the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, this should be inthe nature of a friendly appeal and not of a threat of action underthe Defence Regulations.Prime Minister said that the articles in theTheSwidayPictorial and Daily Mirror constituted, in his view, a serious danger to this country. First, these newspapers were trying to&apos;&apos; rock the boat&apos;&apos; and to shake the confidence of the country inMinisters. Secondly, the effect of the prominence given toMr. H. G. Wells&apos;s article must be to weaken discipline in the Army.Thirdly, an endeavour was being made to poison relations between members of the Government. It was intolerable that those bearing the burden of supreme responsibility at this time should be subjectto attacks of this kind. He was determined to put a stop to these attacks and to obtain protection for the War Cabinet. It would be quite wrong that two members of the War Cabinet should be in theposition of asking favours of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association.Discussion followed as to who exercised the controllinginfluence over these newspapers. The War Cabinet were given the names of the Directors, and particulars of the largest shareholders.Most of the Directors had been appointed by Lord Rothermere. Butit was understood that he did not play any great part in the conductof these two newspapers. Large numbers of shares were held bybank nominees.The Lord Privy Seal attached importance to finding out whohad the controlling interest, in order to satisfy himself whether the underlying motive was definitely an attempt to exercise a disruptinginfluence and not merely irresponsible journalism. He regarded thematter very seriously and favoured strong action, but wanted to besure that there was a cast-iron case. The Home Secretary was invited to take such steps as were in his power to find out the factsrequired, although the view was expressed that persons who went tothe trouble to put their holdings in the name of bank nominees had probably taken steps to make it very difficult to trace theirconnection with the paper.The Lord President of the Council pointed out that, irrespective-tive of the question of motive, the fact remained that grave harmundoubtedly followed from the fact that these malicious articleswere published. It was a grave embarrassment to a Home Secretary,who wished to stop mischievous articles in the Press,1 if powerfulnewspapers were allowed to publish articles of this kind.
General agreement was expressed by the War Cabinet with theview that the articles in question were highly objectionable, andthat, while no-one objected to fair criticism, a continuance of such articles could not be tolerated.On the other hand, it was said that Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s Govern-ment (and Mr. Chamberlain himself in particular) had been subjectto no less bitter attacks, and it was argued that it would be difficultto find any remedy short of interference with the liberty of thePress.The Home Secretary pointed out that a number of othernewspapers had published articles which, in their way, were just asbad; he quoted an article from the Daily Worker, the effect of whichwas to dissuade men from going to sea in the Destroyers boughtfrom the United States. There had also been an objectionablearticle in the New Statesman on the shelter policy, which hadvirtually identified the Stepney shelter. It was also important toavoid any debate in the House of Commons which might lead to a division on Party lines.In further discussion it was suggested that the Minister of aircraft Production and the Lord Privy Seal should summon repre-sentatives of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association to see them,and should explain to them that the War Cabinet were considering this whole matter and were gravely perturbed at the position.Before taking any further action, however, the War Cabinetthought it right to lay the matter before the Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association in order that they might have the opportunity of taking such action as they thought fit.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he had felt quite sure that the Newspaper Proprietors as a whole would wish to seeaction taken to restrain the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Pictorial.These two newspapers were conducted in a manner which wasdamaging to the repute of newspapers generally. The newspaper proprietors&apos; Association had it in their power to exercisedisciplinary action, by taking steps which would add substantially to the cost of running the papers; e.g., by refusing to allow these papers to be put on the newspaper trains.The Prime Minister said that he was prepared to agree to theMinister of Aircraft Production and the Lord Privy Seal sendingfor representatives of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association andspeaking to them on the lines suggested. But he wished it to be clear that, for his part, he receded in no way from the view he hadtaken, that the Government must be prepared to take firm action todeal with this menace.The War Cabinet:  (1) Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production and the lord privy Seal to send for representatives of the newspaper proprietors&apos; Association and to speak to them on thelines indicated at &quot;X,&quot; and to report to the WarCabinet.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to give consideration to an amendment of Defence Regulation 2 (d) on the lines indicated in paragraph 8 of his Memorandum; but notto proceed with this amendment pending receipt of theReport referred to in (1) above.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to take such steps as were inhis power to ascertain who exercised the controllinginfluence over the Sunday Pictorial and the DailyMirror.
The coal situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 69thConclusions,Minute 9.)11. The War Cabinet were informed that the question ofsupplies of fuel, light and heat, and particularly of coal, had been raised that morning at the Civil Defence Committee. A great dealof work had been done during the summer months to accumulatestocks of coal so as to avoid the difficulties which had been encountered last winter. The effect of enemy bombing on transport facilities, however, seemed likely to give rise to fresh difficulties,and this matter needed to be taken in hand promptly.The War Cabinet: Invited the Lord President of the Council to review thequestion of supplies of fuel, light and heat, particularly of coal supplies, and to report to the War Cabinet,Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 9, 1940.
