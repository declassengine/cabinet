The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on the previous day there had been a great deal of enemy activity off the dutch coast and in the Straits of Dover, but until the late afternoon, ithad been confined to reconnaissance. In the late afternoon a heavy attack amounting to about 100 aircraft had developed against the isle of Wight and Southampton area in which Vickers SuperMarine Works had been severely damaged. At about the same time25 enemy aircraft from the Bay of Biscay direction had flown upSt. George&apos;s Channel, and attacked. Crewe, where the damage hadbeen slight.The casualties on the previous day had been : Our Own 10 machines (7 pilots safe).Enemy 32 certain.10 probable.10 damaged.On the previous night between 70 and 80 of our aircraft had attacked the Channel Ports, the Dortmund-Ems Canal and enemywarships at Kiel. One stick of bombs had straddled the Basin atKiel and one bomb was believed to have burst on the Scharnhorst.Our losses had been one heavy bomber missing and two crashed,but the crews of the latter had been saved.On the 25th September Tobruk had been bombed by 27 aircraft with good results. A fuel installation south of Assab, had been attacked.The First Sea Lord reported that four shells had been firedat Dover on the previous afternoon.Air reconnaissance had reported on the previous afternoontwo M.V.&apos;s of 3,000 tons and four small M.V.&apos;s South-West ofGuernsey steering North-West at 12 knots.Five of the destroyers obtained from the United States ofAmerica had arrived at Belfast.The Stratford (British, 4,753 tons), Ashantian (British, 4,917tons) and Port Denison (British, 8,043 tons) had been torpedoed.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that recon-naissance had reported the enemy digging in at the foot of theescarpment in Bir Sofafi area 20 miles south of Buq Buq.Two or three enemy colonial battalions had been reported onthe frontier 21 miles south of Kassala and a large daily supplycolumn suggested the formation of forward dumps in this area.Eight enemy aircraft had flown over Malta on the 25th instant.One had been shot down and probably a second. In raids on the;15th and the 17th instant German aircraft had dropped 32unexploded bombs with German electric Rheinmetal fuses.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.aircraft production.Attack onVickers SuperMarine Works,September 26,1940.2. The Minister of A aircraft Production said that the damage to the Vickers Super Marine Works (Item 1) had been severe, buthe could not as yet give details.The Prime Minister said that for the week ending the21st September the number of aircraft repaired and new aircraftproduced by the Ministry of Aircraft Production was nearly 2^times the number of machines that had been destroyed during that week. The output in new construction and repairs had also shownan increase on the output of the preceding week, which had been[21781-3]b 2
very satisfactory. He was sure that the War Cabinet would wish to congratulate the Minister of Aircraft Production on this fineachievement.The War Cabinet warmly endorsed this view.Operation&quot; Menace.&quot;(previous reference:W.M. (40) 259thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The First Sea Lord reported that the following casualties had been inflicted on the French at Dakar : Submarines : 2 sunk, 1 severely damaged by gun-fire and1 had received two near misses.Destroyers : 2 Fantasque class and 1 unknown class hadbeen burnt out and beached.Cruisers : 1 possible hit on &quot; Gloire &quot; class.Richelieu: 2 probable 15-inch hits and 2 near misses from250 lbs. SAP. bombs.H.M.S. Cornwall had parted company with Primauguet andTarn on the morning of the 26th, having received their promise toproceed to Casablanca.H.M.S. Resolution was in tow and expected at Freetown withinthe next 48 hours.The Consul-General at Tangier had reported that 12submarines, with an adequate supply of torpedoes, had leftCasablanca on the 23rd instant to take action against the Britishsquadron at Dakar.The Prime Minister drew attention to telegram No. 784 fromMadrid. According to the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs,M. Laval had asked the Spanish Government to allow the flight ofFrench aeroplanes over Spanish and Moroccan territory for attackon Gibraltar. This request had been refused. M. Laval had also asked the German Government to take out of Toulon at once theStrasbourg, 3 10,000 tons cruisers, 3 light cruisers, 4 destroyers and12 submarines, presumably for the purpose of attacking the british fleet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that this telegram related to the condition of affairs before our withdrawal from Dakar.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Blockade Policy. 4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that three FrenchInterception of merchant vessels were on their way to Jibuti (two from MadagascarFrench ships. and one from Saigon); and others were on their way from(Previous Martinique to Casablanca.  He asked whether the orders given for reference-.        the interception of these vessels still held good; or whether theyW.M. (40) 224th should be suspended to avoid a policy of pinpricks.Conclusions, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hopedMmute 2.) to circulate a Paper during the week-end which raised the general question of the policy to be pursued towards the Vichy Government.In the meantime he thought it would be difficult to recast ourpresent policy towards the French Colonies which might besummarised as &quot;join de Gaulle or starve.&quot; He saw no reason forchanging our policy in regard to the particular ships mentioned bythe First Lord and he did not think that their interception wouldexcite any violent reaction from the French.The War Cabinet-Agreed that orders given for the interception of the french ships referred to by the First Lord of the Admiralty should stand.
Air Raid 6.   The Home Secretary said that he had underestimated the damage. number of persons killed in air raids in London area on the(Previous 25th September.   The figure was now put at 180; the figure for the reference-        26th September would in all probability be similar.W.M (40) 259th        London and Liverpool had been the enemy&apos;s chief objectivesConclusions *    during the preceding 24 hours.   In London the electricity situationMinute 6) &apos;      was g000--   The gas situation was unsatisfactory, as there was nosupply over a considerable area.   The railway services to King&apos;sCross, Waterloo and Marylebone, on the Bakerloo tube and on partsof the Underground system, had been brought to a stop, but theposition generally was being restored.The situation in Liverpool was much more favourable than thefirst reports had indioated. 90 per cent, of the port was availablefor shipping. No ships had been seriously damaged, and none ofthe lock gates or bridges in the docks had been hit.   The localForeign 5.

Ambassador, * to create a new order in Asia and Europe.    a significant point of the Pact was that the three Powers would helpeach other if attacked by any Power not taking part in this war or in the Sino-Japanese war. The Pact, therefore, seemed to bedirected against the United States of America.The view generally expressed was that the Pact, which wouldprobably anger the United States of America, left matters verymuch as they were, and did not affect the general situation. if anything, it was likely to accelerate the entry of the United Statesinto the war. There was no support in the War Cabinet for theview, sometimes advanced, that the United States of America couldlend us more help by staying out of the war.Portugal. r he Prime Minister referred to telegram No. 2107 from(Previous Washington referring to a statement made by the President in reference: conversation with our Ambassador, as to certain action in the eventW.M.

pride of the Liverpool people was suffering owing to their beingdescribed in the communiques as &quot; a North-West coastal town.&quot;The Secretary of State for Air said.that the larger towns wouldbe mentioned by name in future communiques, where it was certainthat the Germans must know what town they had attacked. Theair defences of Liverpool (like those of all other areas) were not upto scale, but further guns were being made available. It was also proposed to move an additional squadron to a station where it could take part in the defence of Merseyside.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.aircraft production.Despatch of aircraft to theMiddle East.(previous references:W.M. (40) 256thConclusions,Minute 4,and 259thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda : By the Minister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (40) 386).By the Secretary of State for War, as Chairman of the ministerial Committee on Military Policy in the Middle East(W.P. (40) 387).By the Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (40) 388).In discussion the following points were made : (i) The Chief of the Air Staff said that he naturally wantedmore aircraft to be made available for the Battle of britain. But the limited number of aircraft which itwas proposed to send to the Middle East would havean effect in that area out of all proportion to the lossoccasioned by their withdrawal from this country. Ifthe aircraft due to be despatched in October were to besent according to programme, they ought to be packednow.(ii) The First Sea Lord said that the arrival of additionalmodern fighters might be decisive, if there were any danger of the Fleet having to leave Alexandria, owingto dive bombing attacks. The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff also favoured the despatch of the aircraft to the Middle East.(iii) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought thaton balance it would be wrong to stop the steady flow of modern aircraft to the Middle East shown in W.P. (40)388. The consequences of a bad setback in the middle east might be very serious.(iv) The Lord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfolioexpressed general agreement with these views.(v) The Secretary of State for Air gave figures of theHurricanes now available in this country which showed a considerable improvement on the position on the1st September. He also gave figures showing our greatnumerical inferiority in fighters in the Middle East.(vi) The Minister of Aircraft ,-Production agreed that theposition as regards fighters available in this country hadconsiderably improved since the 1st September. Never-theless he was strongly opposed to further withdrawalsof either aircraft or pilots. The Battle of Britain wasthe only battle that counted.(vii) The Prime Minister recommended that the situation should be kept constantly under review. The balance of argument was in favour of despatching from thiscountry for the Middle East the aircraft shown in w.P. (40) 388 as awaiting despatch during the rest ofSeptember, and during October. In order that theprogramme of shipments should not be impeded, thepacking of these aircraft should proceed immediately.
(previous reference:W.M. (40) 259thConclusions,Minute 5.)The middle east.Despatch of reinforcements.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 239thConclusions,Minute 14.)The question of the despatch of aircraft to the middle east in November should be brought before the WarCabinet for decision in three weeks&apos; time.The War Cabinet (i) Approved the withdrawal from this country of the aircraftshown in W.P. (40) 388 as earmarked for despatch tothe Middle East during the remainder of September,1940, and October, 1940.(ii) Deferred for three weeks a decision on the despatch offurther aircraft to the Middle East during November,1940.(iii) Agreed that the despatch of the Brewster aircraft nowbeing consigned to the Middle East by the Admiralty,should proceed.[The Minister of Aircraft Production asked that hisdissent from conclusions (i) and (ii) should be recorded.]8. In connection with the discussion on Minute 7, the Secretaryof State for War said that he would like to see a programme drawnup to show what forces and equipment we proposed to send to theMiddle East month by month. This programme should be sentto the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, who should be asked todraw up a plan of campaign related to this programme. The WarCabinet ought to be informed of this plan of campaign, and itmight possibly be convenient that someone should go out from thiscountry to the Middle East.It would, of course, be necessary to consider the situation frommonth to month, in order to decide whether the situation permittedof the despatch of forces and equipment on the basis of theprogramme drawn up.General agreement was expressed with this view.In this connection, reference was made to the question of thedespatch of further troops from this country to the Middle East.This turned, in part, on the likelihood of an attempt at invasion,and in part on the sailing dates of future convoys from this countryto the Middle East.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be further discussed by thePrime Minister with the Ministers concerned.United States ofAmerica: grantof base facilities in british territories.Bermuda.(previous reference:WiM. (40) 239thConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies as to the requirements of theUnited States for base facilities at Bermuda (WP. (40) 385).These requirements, as stated to the Governor of Bermuda,were far in excess of anything previously contemplated by us, andwere open to objection on several grounds.The Secretary of State for the Colonies proposed that, in viewof the strong feeling in Bermuda and of the fact that the facilities to be provided in Bermuda were by way of a free gift, we shouldmake clear that our offer was subject to the following conditions : (a) That the main base should be at the East end of the Colony.(6) That we should not provide an area for a landing fieldexcept at Long Bird Island.(c) That, except in times of tension, the United States force to be maintained at Bermuda must be much smaller than had been suggested.(d) That the seaward defences of Bermuda must remain inBritish hands.
General agreement was expressed with the view that the UnitedStates requirements were greatly in excess of what had been con-templated, and were open to serious objection. At the same time,it was felt that it would not be right at this stage, before the matter had been discussed with United States representatives, to recorda definite decision setting precise limits to what we could offer.It would be better to put our alternative scheme to the american representatives and to say that we were prepared to discuss boththeir scheme and ours, and to endeavour to persuade them to accept our suggestions so far as possible.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) That the instructions to our representatives at the forth-coming negotiations should be to try to persuade theUnited States representatives to accept a scheme on thealternative basis proposed in the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies.(2) That it was desirable that the negotiations should takeplace in this country. In that event there would be noobjection to a Bermudan Deputation coming to thiscountry, but that a Bermudan Deputation should not goto Washington.(3) That, in view of the anxiety shown by the United StatesGovernment to make progress with this matter, therewas no objection to Lord Lothian showing the UnitedStates Government the Report of the Bermuda Com-mittee.(4) That a telegram authorising Lord Lothian to show thisReport to the United States Government should be drafted by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, and shown to the Prime Minister beforedespatch.(5) That the request of the United States Government to sendan aircraft tender and some aircraft to Bermuda forth-with should be agreed to. In order to avoid a claim toany site being prejudged, they should be givenhospitality at our own bases.Air Raids.Compensationfor PersonalInjuries.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 256thConclusions,Minute 9.)10. The War Cabinet took note of an Interim Report by theLord Privy Seal (W.P. (G.) (40) 248). This Report stated that theCommittee of Ministers, under the Chairmanship of the Lord privy seal, had agreed in principle that the existing scheme of com-pensation for death or injury from air raids should be made ofgeneral application to the whole of the civilian population, andthat alternative proposals were being prepared for contributoryschemes on a voluntary and compulsory basis respectively, providingcompensation for personal injury additional to the State scheme.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 27, 1940.
