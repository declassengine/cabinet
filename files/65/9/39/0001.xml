1. The Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs said that in theearly hours of that morning a telegram had been received (No. 906)from Sir Samuel Hoare at Madrid. The French Ambassador had told him that the Prime Ministers message was likely to have agreat effect on the French Council of Ministers. M. Laval and admiral Darlan were pressing hard for agreement with the Germansover the transfer of the French Fleet and French bases to Germany,whilst Marshal Petain and General Weygand were resisting. He(the French Ambassador) believed that, if either the King or thePrime Minister could send a message through him to marshal petain, such a message might turn the scales in our favour. the telegram went on to suggest the terms of a suitable message.A further telegram had followed (No. 908) asking for authorityto tell the French Ambassador in Madrid that such a messagewould be sent.The Foreign Secretary, continuing, said that the PrimeMinister and himself had drafted an appeal to Marshal Petain tobe sent to him from the King. This telegram (see Appendix) was now being&quot; despatched to Sir Samuel Hoare for communication tothe French Ambassador.The Prime Minister said that he hoped the War Cabinet would approve of the action which the. Foreign Secretary and himself hadtaken. On the previous Sunday he had himself sent a personal telegram to President Roosevelt in regard to the danger of theFrench handing over to Germany their fleet and bases, and had suggested that he might take action to deter the French fromcarrying out this proposal.   (See Minute 7 below.)Copies of the telegrams received from Sir Samuel Hoare andof the message from the King to Marshal Petain were being sent to Washington in order that the President might be keptau courant with events. He was also telegraphing to Washingtonsuggesting that the President should himself send a personal message to Marshal Petain to the effect that the United states would view with grave concern the handing over of French basesto Germany.The Prime Minister added that he and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs had considered making a personal appeal toGeneral Weygand, but on reflection had thought that for themoment it would be sufficient if he was kept informed of whatwas happening through our Consul-General at Tangier, to whomcopies of the relevant telegrams were being sent for communication to the General.The Prime Minister said that, if the French Fleet aud naval bases were transferred to Germany, our navy would be faced withthe most serious problems, and the situation would be ananxious one.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved of the action recorded above which had beentaken by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs,(ft) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to acquaint  the  Dominion  Prime  Ministers with thesituation.&quot;21854-2]The french fleet.negotiations between &quot;Vichyand german governments.

(40) 274thConclusions,Minute 1.)MilitarySituation.Middle East:Egypt.Sudan.2. The Prime Minister welcomed Air-Marshal Portal on his appointment as Chief of the Air Staff.The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on the previous night170 enemy bombers had flown over this country, but only 50 had attacked London. Birmingham had been heavily attacked. On theprevious night one of our Beaufighters had intercepted an enemymachine, and had fired at it with its cannon. No result had beenobtained, though it was thought that the enemy had been hit.On the previous night one of our bombers had been shot downin flames by enemy aircraft when taking off from its aerodrome.On the previous night 128 of our aircraft had been despatched to attack the Channel Ports, oil targets, aluminium targets,communications in the Ruhr, and 20 to attack a target in the berlin area. Although full reports had not yet been received itwas thought that these attacks had been successful.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Rome Security said that, although little military damage hadbeen done in Birmingham on the previous night, considerable damage had been done in the centre of the town. The two railwaystations had been hit and also the Town Hall and Midland Hotel.Damage in the London area had been negligible. So far as hadbeen reported the civilian casualties for the previous night hadbeen 2 killed and 67 injured in the London area, and 8 killed and46 injured in the Provinces.The Chief of Naval Staff reported that it was now known that three more ships in the slow convoy which had been attacked overthe week-end had been sunk. Out of thirty-five ships in this slowconvoy fifteen had been sunk and five damaged.It was hoped that the increased number of destroyers whichit had been decided should be used for escort duties would be operating by the 15th November.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that one disturbingfeature in the week-end attack was an unconfirmed report thatone of the Swedish ships had shown a red light.The fourth group of United States destroyers was now on its way across the Atlantic, and would probably be put straight into service.East Africa.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff made the following report: A battalion with supporting artillery had raided an enemycamp 14 miles east of Sidi Barrani on the 22nd/23rd October andhad destroyed eight M.T. with Molotov bombs. Our casualties had been three killed and four wounded. Enemy casualties wereunknown, but one prisoner had been captured.A patrol of the Sudan Defence Force had surprised 1,000 enemy and had attacked them in the rear from 100 yards. enemy casualties had been heavy. We had suffered no losses. In the blue Nile sector no enemy advance had been reported north of theline Maganza to Jebel Gardada.Two enemy aircraft had raided Port Sudan on the 23rd october and dropped bombs near the quay. No material damage hadbeen done, but ten natives had been killed and about twentyinjured.The second convoy of the South African Brigade (3,000personnel) had arrived at Mombasa on the 21st October.
Royal Navy.NewConstructionProgramme.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 144thConclusions,Minute 10.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (40) 349) making proposals for additional new naval construction and for an early resumption ofwork on ships on which work had been suspended.In regard to the main types of ships, his proposals were asfollows: Battleships.Work should be pushed ahead on the Solve andVanguard. Lion and Temeraire (both of which hadbeen laid down) should be proceeded with as men andmaterial could be made available. Conqueror and Thunderershould not be laid down at once, but should be started assoon as practicable.Aircraft-carrier 8.Work on the Indefatigable should be resumed and one additional vessel considered early in 1941.Cruisers.Work should proceed on the 8 suspended cruisers and 4of a new type laid down in March 1941.Destroyers.Work should proceed on the 4th Emergency Flotilla andtwo additional flotillas should be ordered in December 1940and March 1941 respectively.In addition, 14 sloops, 30 corvettes and 38 submarines,and a large number of miscellaneous craft, should be laiddown.The following points were made in discussion : (1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether the FirstLord&apos;s programme would interfere with merchant shipbuilding. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that capacity for merchant ship building, at the rate of1,250,000 tons a year, would not be interfered with.(2) Doubt was expressed whether the First Lord&apos;s pro-gramme could be carried out without interference withthe programmes of the other Services. The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that, while the need for small ships could not be contested, different argumentsapplied to capital ships, which could not be completeduntil 1943, 1944 or 1945.- (3) It was argued that, if these capital ships were being built to meet the contingency of a war with Japan in 1943 or1944, we could fairly assume that the United states navy would then be on our side.(4) The Prime Minister referred to his recent paper on Priorities(W.P. (40) 416), and thought that very powerful argu-ments had been advanced by the First Lord in favourof proceeding with all the suspended ships. At the endof the war we should be faced with the formidable task of clearing up the situation in the Far East, and we[21854-2] b 3Italo-Greek No confirmation had been received of the rumours of anRelations. impending Italian attack on Greece.   It seemed possible that theItalians thought that the visit of the Secretary of State for war to Egypt was connected with a coming offensive on our part.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
should be unequal to that task if we fell behind Japaniu capital ship construction. It took four years or more to build a capital ship, and he thought it was essentialto make progress towards the completion of a numberof these powerful vessels The potentialities of capital ships for altering a military situation were very greatindeed.(5) The Prime Minister said he had reached the conclusionthat work must be resumed on the capital ships towhich the First Lord had referred, on the understanding I1that further delays might be imposed by shortages ofsteel or other necessary materials. In that event, theAdmiralty would have to advance their completiondates.(6) The Minister of Aircraft Production referred to the possiblecompetition between the programme of his department and the First Lord&apos;s programme.In discussion it was pointed out that the programme would make relatively small demands for alloy steel oraluminium. It was clear that the Admiralty wouldhave to economise in regard to the latter. As regardsmachine tools, the programme would be kept under constant review, in consultation with the other pro-duction Departments.(7) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he wasabout to consult the Admiralty regarding the number of landing craft included in the programme. Prima facie,the provision proposed was inadequate to meet army requirements.The War Cabinet-Gave general approval to the proposals in W.P. (40) 349,subject to: (a) The normal consultations taking place between theTreasury and the Admiralty at various stages inthe programme.(b) The general understanding that further delays mightbe imposed by shortages of steel and other necessarymaterials, in which event the completion dateswould have to be advanced.munitions production.WheeledVehicles.(previous references:W.M. (40) 229thConclusions,and 262ndConclusions.)Use of Armylorries for civil purposes.4. In connection with the previous Minute, the Prime Ministerdrew attention to the very heavy demands being made by theArmy for wheeled vehicles. The scale of these demands was based on the operations of a division under mobile conditions.In addition, however, substantial margins were allowed for variouscontingencies, and the full scale was applied to training units andto forces allocated to fixed defence positions. In the result, thetotal demand was far beyond real requirements.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the WarOffice appreciated that the Tank programme would suffer if theproduction of wheeled vehicles was not kept within bounds. Thematter was under examination by a War Office Committee.The Prime Minister suggested that a Treasury representative should be added to this Committee. The use of horse transport should also be examined.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested thatArmy lorries should be lent to relieve transport congestion at the docks. Army interests could be safeguarded by lending lorriesonly to reputable firms with good repair depots.
Gibraltar.Removal ofGibraltarianRefugeesoverseas.(previous references:W.M. (40) 129thConclusions,Minute 9; andW.M. (40) 261stConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of Health(W.P. (G) (40) 273) as to some 10,600 Gibraltarians who had beencompulsorily evacuated from Gibraltar and were temporarilyaccommodated in London. Arrangements had been made to accommodate them in the West Indies, but since the loss of theCity of Benares, and the decision not to proceed with the Children&apos;overseas Reception Scheme, they had been in a difficult mood.Some 500 of these evacuees were now prepared to go overseasvoluntarily, but compulsion might be necessary to get the wholeparty to go.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that if the party of 500referred to in W.P. lG.) (40) 273 was the only one concerned, theNavy could provide a sufficient escort. He considered, however,that, with the present position in the North Western Approaches,no further sailings of this kind should be arranged until theAdmiralty had tested the results of the new convoy arrangementsabout to be put into force on trial. He asked that no arrangement for any further shipments should be made without personalconsultation with him.The Minister of Health said that thex-e was no question of thewhole party proceeding overseas at once, but they would go inrelays.The Prime Minister thought that the Gibraltarians ought to gooverseas and that they should be made to understand that we were determined that they should go. Their attitude could be altered by propaganda.In reply to a question by the Minister of Labour, the colonial secretary admitted that the conditions on the ships in which theevacuees had been brought here from Morocco had been bad. Thiswas because it had been necessary to use the cargo-liners used to repatriate French troops from this country.The Minister of Shipping said that good passenger vesselswould be used for the voyage to the West Indies.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Colonial Secretary, the Minister of health and the Minister of Shipping to make arrangementsforthwith for the shipment to the West Indies of the500 volunteers.(&amp;) Invited the Colonial Secretary and the Minister of health to make suitable arrangements to induce the otherGibraltarian evacuees, by effective propaganda, toproceed to the West Indies as and when suitableshipping arrangements could be made. It should bemade clear to the Gibraltarians that the Governmentadhered to their decision that they should proceedoverseas.(c) Invited the Minister of Shipping to keep the First Lord ofthe Admiralty informed as to the sailing arrangementsmade and in contemplation for these evacuees, havingregard to the First Lord&apos;s responsibilities in regard toescorts.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the divisionsnow in this country were by no means well equipped with transport. In view of the invasion risk, ammunition lorries couldnot be released. The War Office would, however, examine whethera number of supply lorries could be lent to civil industry.The War Cabinet took note that the War Office would examine the Minister of Labour&apos;s suggestion.
Lighting g    rph.e War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by-Restrictions,  he Minister of Home Security on Improved Street LightingImproved Street (W.P. i G) (40) 272). The question for immediate decision wasLighting. whether a Circular should be issued to Local Authorities to(Previous ascertain their views on the scheme set out in the Report ofReference: the Black-out Committee (W.P. (40) 375), and to invite themW.M. (40) 255th to prepare plans for their areas.Minute^T&apos; r^l&amp; :^&apos;mster &apos;    Home Security said that his impression wasthat, as the result of the intense night bombing on this country,public opinion was now very sensitive on lighting questions, andthat proposals to improve street lighting would not be well received at this juncture. Further, the Local Authority staffsconcerned were already hard pressed. The cost was  500,000, andthe view hitherto taken had been that, as a local amenity was concerned, the cost should be borne by the Local Authorities.They were unlikely to be willing to bear this cost.The Prune Minister thought the view that the enemy bombersguided themselves by ground lights was not well founded. Thescheme to improve street lighting should not be allowed to fall into such a state of abeyance that it would take a long time toput into effect if conditions eased.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, held that, in presentcircumstances, it would be impracticable to operate a system of improved street lighting in Southern England.The War Cabinet :-(1) Agreed that a Circular should not be issued to LocalAuthorities, but that their opinion on this matter should be ascertained by the Minister of home security by personal consultation ;(2) Agreed that this matter should be brought forward again to the War Cabinet at the beginning of December;(3) Invited the Minister of Home Security to take such steps as were possible to proceed with preparatory measures,without, however, incurring any substantial expenditureon the scheme.France. 7.   The Prime Minister read the terms of a message sent byThe French President Roosevelt to the French Government protesting againstFleet. any action by the French Government permitting the Germans to negotiations      use the French Fleet against the British Fleet.   This telegrambetween Vichy   had been sent in response to a suggestion which the Primeand German      Minister had made on the previous Sunday (see Minute 1 above).Governments.     The Presidents telegram was expressed in the strongest terms,but   it  was  noted  that  it  related  mainly  to   action  whichpermitted the Germans to use the French Fleet, and did not dealwith the use by the enemy of French bases.The War Cabinet agreed that it would be desirable that this further aspect of the question should be brought to the Presidentsnotice.Transport. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLondon Minister of Home Security (W.P. (G.) (40) 271), putting forwardTransport in the proposals to reduce the number of persons travelling to and fromWinter Months, the centre of London without disturbing the national war effort.These proposals had been put forward by the interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of Transport,and had been considered and approved by the Civil defence executive Sub-Committee.
The main proposals, and the points made thereon in discussion,were as follows : (1) Evacuation. It was proposed to encourage certain classesof business to leave London, without prejudice to theneeds of the homeless and of mothers and children.General agreement was expressed with this sugges-tion provided that publicity was avoided. The matter would be dealt with by unofficial contacts with trade associations and individual firms.It was explained that 900 firms had made plans toleave London before the war, but had mainly planned to go either to the South-Eastern Counties (which were now difficult for military reasons) or to Oxfordshire,Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, whichhad now been largely filled up by unofficial evacuation from London. It was therefore proposed to guide the firms, so far as possible, to the Midlands and the North.This could be done while still leaving room for dispersalfrom the big centres of population in the Midlands.(2) Early Closing and avoidance of peak hours. arrangements would be made to discuss with the interests concerned the closing of shops at a progressively earlier hour, not later than 3 p.m. at the extreme. The availability of cheap day return tickets would be curtailed.(3) Sleeping at places of business.  Firms with suitable protected accommodation would be asked to allow a proportion oftheir staff to sleep on the premises.(4) Alteration of holidays and (5) Adjustment of hours. It was proposed to discuss with employers and with the T.U.C.proposals for: (a) different day or half-day holidays for different tradesor businesses.(b) a five-day week, spread over six days, or a six-day week with shorter hours on each day.(c) an adjustment of hours to enable staff to leave early.In regard to (2) to (5.) generally, the Minister of aircraft production feared that proposals that shops should close at 3 P.m.,or for a five-day week, if put forward by the Government, would react on hours of work in factories. [Earlier in the summer, thegrant to Civil Servants of a fortnights holiday had reacted on the factories.] He cited in support of this view a suggestion made inthe course of the Meeting by the Minister of Labour and NationalService that provision should be made for a number of munitionsworkers to sleep at their factories, in order to increase the amountof night work.The view generally expressed in discussion was that it wasimpossible to lay down uniform rules applicable to all classes ofthe community, and that different conditions applied to CivilServants and persons working in shops than to munition workers.Further, it was suggested that the earlier closing of shops couldbe linked up with the curtailment of hours during which cheap dayreturn tickets were available, as a policy designed to keep thetransport facilities at the peak hours open for munitions workers and other persons engaged in essential war work.This view met with the general approval of the War Cabinet.(6) Summer-lime. This should be continued during the winter.(7) Transport Services. Various proposals were being made toimprove facilities.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that the needfor express buses was not limited to London, butexisted also in other towns, notably Bristol.The Minister of Transport undertook to look into this point.
(8) Private  car drivers would be asked to carry  as manypassengers as possible.The War Cabinet :-Gave general approval to the recommendations in theReport outlined above, subject to the points referred toat&quot;X&quot;and&quot;Y.&quot;Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 2b, 1940.APPENDIX.Cypher Telegram to Sir S.

The armistice which you were forced tomake with the common enemy and his occupation of so many French ports and aerodromes for the attack on my country have been a very grievousaddition to the burdens which my people have to bear. Nevertheless, thesetragic events have not weakened in British hearts the sympathy and sense of comradeship which have grown up over many years of peace and war between the British and French nations. We are resolved to fight on tothe end, and we are sure that the end will be a complete British victory over Hitler and his regime. We have solemnly declared that our victorywill carry with it the restoration of the freedom and greatness of France.&quot; Reports are reaching me of an attempt by the German Government tosecure from you undertakings that would go far beyond the terms acceptedby you at the time of the armistice. I recall that then you expressed yourdetermination to accept no terms dishonouring to the name of France.I am confident that now also you will reject proposals that would bringdishonour to France and grave damage to a late ally. The disaster thatoverwhelmed France deprived us of her assistance but it would indeed be asombre event in history if France were to range herself against us andafford direct assistance to our enemy. I do not doubt that, in refusing anysuch proposals that may have been made, you will carry with you the over-whelming assent of all those among both our peoples, and in othercountries, who have put their faith in your honour as a soldier and who see in a British victory their hope of the salvation of France.&quot;(Repeated to Washington, No. 2791.)

M. Laval andDarlan are pressing hard for agreement with the Germans overtransfer of fleet and bases, whilst Petain and Weygand are .resisting.Ambassador believes that if the Prime Minister couldimmediately send me a similar message, expressed in solemn and friendly words that could be transmitted verbatim to theMarshal himself, it might turn the scales in our favour.     Sucha message should take into account, and if possible mention,Petain&apos;s loyalty to his signature binding him to the terms ofthe Armistice.     It should therefore be made clear that german demands go far beyond the Armistice terms.Message should end with personal appeal to Petain to respond to. your unselfish offer, and to make clear to theworld the French determination to repudiate dishonourableterms.     Ambassador believes, not only would such a messagestrengthen Petain&apos;s hands, but also prove a damning documentagainst M. Laval if it was decided to publish it.. Ambassador has with great deference suggested, in order togive message greatest possible solemnity, it might be sent toPetain in the name of the King,[Sent to Private Secretary, No, 10, Downing Street,at 3.45 a,m.3

Our Ambassador will have told you about the telegrams we have received from and sent to Sir Samuel Hoarein Madrid, and the views of the French Ambassador there.There seems to be a desperate struggle going on between Petainand Laval.     If the French Fleet and French bases on the african shore are betrayed to Germany, our task will become. vastly more difficult, and your dangers will grow.     I havethe feeling things are hanging in the balance at Vichy.     TheKing is sending a personal message to Marshal Petain,appealing to his soldierly honour.     Would it not be possiblefor you, Mr. President, to send a message to him yourself?It would greatly strengthen his position and might make himchoose rightly.     Anyhow there is no time to be lost as a verydisastrous turn may be very easily be given to the war by the vichy Government committing another act of shame.     (Ends).
