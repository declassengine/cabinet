War Cabinet. 1.   The Prime Minister suggested that, if a red warning wasArrangements in operation when a Meeting of the War Cabinet was about to for meetings begin, there should be a standing arrangement that the Meetingduring air raid should take place in the Cabinet War Room. If a red warning waswarnings. given after a Meeting had begun at 10 Downing Street, he hopedthat  they  would be able  to  continue  their business  withoutinterruption.The War Cabinet agreed to the standing arrangementproposed by the Prime Minister.NairalOperations.(previous reference:2.

(40) 350) setting out various measures which hadbeen taken for the defence of the Scilly Isles.The War Cabinet-Approved the measures taken for the defence of the ScillyIsles on the understanding that consideration would begiven at an early date to the replacement of one (or both)of the independent companies by other troops.aircraft production.Aircraft for theMiddle Eastand forCommunicationsUnits of theRoyal Air Force.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 236thConclusions,,Minute 1.)4. The Minister of Aircraft Production made a statement about aircraft production and reserves. In order to improve the flow of Hurricanes to Operational Units, he proposed (i) That he should be authorised for a limited period not to fit further Hurricanes with special Middle Eastequipment.(ii) That he should be authorised to ask communications unitsof the Royal Air Force to release machines to opera-tional units.The Prime Minister agreed that the first point should be looked at week by week, but thought that the step proposed shouldnot be taken forthwith. He would take an early opportunity of discussing both points with the Minister and with the Chief of theAir Staff (in the absence of the Secretary of State for Air).The War Cabinet took note of this statement.United States of 5. the Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theAmerica.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Transport (W.P. (G.) (40) 228).The Minister of Transport said that he did not recommend thefirst of the five alternatives set out in his paper, i.e., standing faston the terms of the agreement and accepting the consultative committee&apos;s recommendations for increases in charges. TheMinister cited a number of criticisms of the present agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the agreement hadbeen reached with difficulty. Agreement or no agreement, it was difficult to see how the railways could be given materially less thanthe meagre profit which they were in fact now showing. He was strongly opposed to the difficulty being met by the easy expedientof an Exchequer subsidy. If the railways were to get a subsidy,there were plenty of other undertakings which would also claim a subsidy.The following further points were made in discussion :  Should the agreement with the railway companies be modified?(1) The agreement was based on three relatively good years,1935/36/37, and ignored 1938, a bad year.(2) In peace there had been no reason to suppose that therailways as a whole would earn a dividend on theirordinary capital. Why should they be allowed largerprofits because of the increased traffic resulting fromthe war ?(3) The agreement had, however, only been reached inFebruary and had been accepted by implication,although after strong criticism by the House ofCommons.(4) It was generally agreed that the terms of the agreement should be modified, but by negotiation.Should charges be increased?(5) The essence of the problem was how to meet increased costsdue to the war.(6) Railway charges had increased by 10 per cent, some months ago, and a further increase of 1\ per cent, was now in prospect. This increase was moderate in comparisonwith the rise in the price of other commodities.(7) Even if the present difficulty could be got round, further increases in railway costs must be expected later. Howwere these to be met, if not by increased charges ?(8) Many classes had had increases in wages and could wellafford higher railway fares.(9) On the other hand, an increase in passenger fares wouldgive rise to political difficulties. While some classescould afford increased fares, others could not,particularly those who, owing to war conditions, wereliving at a greater distance from their wOrk or wishedto visit evacuated families.(10) If the increase was put on to freights, this would resultin a further rise in the cost of commodities and wouldintensify the vicious spiral.
Government preferential rates.(11) This led to some discussion on Government preferential rates. It was argued that, if passenger fares were now put up, the public would hold that they were paying for a concealed subsidy to the Exchequer.(12) It was suggested that the preferential rates obtained bythe Government represented an undue advantage, whichthe Government had obtained by reason of the fact that so large a proportion of the business of the country was now Government business. It was further suggestedthat there might be for considering whether the preferential margin, if it represented more than a faircommercial margin, should not be reduced. But there could be no question of depriving members of theFighting Services of the privileges in respect of journeysat reduced rates to which they were at present entitled.(13) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the point inregard to Government preferential rates had not previously been raised, and he must reserve his positionin regard to it.Nationalisation.(14) It was suggested that under the present arrangements therailways were treated from some points of view as public,and other points of view as private, undertakings, andthat more logical and defensible arrangements wouldresult if the Government was to buy out the railwayshareholders and be responsible for running all formsof transport.(15) The Prime Minister recalled the experiences of railwayadministration after the last war, and thought that itwould be a misfortune if the issue of nationalisationwere raised at the present time.General.(16) The Prime Minister said that, in his view, the objects tobe aimed at should be (i) That the terms of the agreement should be revised,so as to limit the railways net profits to the pre-war average.(ii) That there should be no increase in charges.He asked to what extent the proposed limitation of netprofits would meet the increased charges. The Ministerof Transport said that at the present time the railways were making a net profit of some  2 or  3 millions overthe pre-war average. There was thus a considerable gap between any saving which could be effected on the railwayprofits and the increased costs due to war conditions.After further discussion, the War Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to initiate discussions with the railway companies for a revision of the terms ofthe agreement in the light of the discussion in the WarCabinet.The Minister was instructed to aim at (1) a limitation of net pool profits to the pre-waraverage of  40 millions;(2) the avoidance of any general increase in railway charges, particularly in railway fares.The Minister was invited to take into consideration, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the
Air Raids.Compensationfor damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 238thConclusions,Minute 5.)question whether there was a case for reducing the preferential margin of the Government traffic, subject tono interference with the facilities for travel at reducedrates at present accorded to members of the armed forces.The Minister was invited to report the progress of thenegotiations to the War Cabinet before concluding anagreement.7. A short preliminary discussion took place about theproposal that compensation up to, say,  2,000, should be grantedto persons who had lost their household effects or the stock-in-trade of their businesses in air raids. Up to the beginning of Augustabout 8,000 houses had been hit, of which very few had been totallydestroyed. The local authorities were doing admirable work in arranging for the repair of damaged, as opposed to destroyed,houses. This was far less than the forecasts of damage made beforethe war. From this point of view the problem was of manageabledimensions.On the other hand it was by no means certain that a schemewhich was limited to damage resulting from air raids, and excludedother forms of distress due to the war (for example businesses inevacuated areas) would meet with general support from all political parties. There was the further consideration that it would bedifficult to finance the compensation by a fiat rate levy on the valueof all property, if the compensation payable was limited in all cases to, say,  2,000..0The discussion was adjourned.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 3, 1940.
