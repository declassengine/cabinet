: The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the main passagesPrime of the statement he was proposing to make in Parliament thatMinister&apos;? afternoon.Statement on 5th September.(previous reference:W.M. (40)239thConclusions,Minute 15.)Air raid warnings.(previous reference:W.M. (40)242ndConclusions.)Air raid warnings:arrangements in Houses ofParliament.(previous erence:W.M. (40)242ndConclusions.)Air raids:compensationfor damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 240thConclusions,Minute 7.)Miscellaneousquestions.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to deal witlh thequestion of air raid warnings very generally in order to prepare the way for changes, but not to indicate their nature. The changes would be discussed forthwith with the representatives of the organisations concerned, and an announcement made in the ensuingweek.The Minister of Labour had been informed of the discussion inthe War Cabinet the previous night, and had expressed very strongly the view that time should be given to allow of further discussions with interested bodies before decisions were taken orannounced on the new plans to be adopted.Subject to amendments on one or two points, the WarCabinet approved the lines of the statement proposed.The Prime Minister said that, at the meeting of the WarCabinet the previous evening, it had been contemplated that afurther announcement should be made that Parliament would notadjourn when the &quot;red &quot; warning was sounded. On reflection hethought that to make such an announcement would be asking fortrouble. He suggested that arrangement should be made wherebyif a &quot; red &quot; warning sounded while the House was sitting he (or inhis absence the Lord Privy Seal) would propose that the house should continue to sit, if that was the general sense of the House,until a further warning was received that an attack was imminent.This further warning would be received either by a message from the Fighter Command which would be passed to the PrimeMinister&apos;s Private Secretary or from watchers specially posted bythe authorities of the Houses.This arrangement met with general approval.The Prime Minister read out the draft passage in his speechdealing with compensation for damage resulting from air raidswhich had been settled in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer. He intended to bring out the point that of some12 million houses in this country only some 8,000 had been hit, ofwhich very few had been totally destroyed. This was a far smallerpercentage than that estimated before the war. The Treasury wereprepared to review the decisions as to compensation for air raid damage which had been taken at the beginning of the war, moreparticularly in so far as those decisions affected small householders,providing that investigation showed that this class of case could bedealt with in isolation from other war losses.The War Cabinet took note with approval of thissuggestion.The Prime Minister indicated briefly the line he proposed totake on a number of other topics. He proposed to announce thework being carried out by the Committee on Lighting Restrictions.He did not, however, propose to make any reference on this occasion to the question of aliens.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 5, 1940.
