Naval, Militaryand AirSituations.(previous reference erence:W.M, (40) 250thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations:HomeCommands and middle East.naval operations.Loss of S.S.City of Mobile.MilitaryOperations:Middle East.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there was little to report regarding air activity during the previous day. two German machines had been brought down, one of them by theballoon barrage.All operations of the Bomber and Coastal Command had been cancelled on the previous night owing to bad weather conditions.A mixed force of Gladiators, Hurricanes and Blenheims hadshot down over Sidi Barrani six enemy machines (confirmed) plustwo probables, with the loss of one machine to themselves.Successful bombing attacks had been made on Asmara aero-drome on the 14th instant, and on Gura, Massawa and Ali Guraon the loth. Fires had also been started in the Caproni works30 miles south of Asmara.The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that two sweeps hadbeen made in the English Channel on the previous day, withoutanything of importance being observed.On the 16th September the French S.S. Poitiers had abandonedship on sighting H.M.S. Cumberland and attempted to scuttleherself. The Cumberland had picked up the crew and then sunkthe vessel by gunfire.The Prime Minister doubted whether it was wise to open fire on a French ship for this purpose when our relations with the vichy government were so delicate. He thought that orders should beissued to prevent similar incidents occurring in the future.The First Lord of the Admiralty, continuing, reported thaton the 16th instant H.M.S. Cumberland had intercepted the Spanishship S.S. Domine, placed an armed guard on board and ordered her to Freetown for examination. S.S. Mobile, with a cargo of mechanical transport and stores for abroad, had been sunk by aircraft.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook toascertain what quantities of mechanical transport and other storeshad been lost by the sinking of this ship, and to report on thepurposes for which this mechanical transport and stores had been required.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that on theprevious evening two enemy columns had occupied Sidi Barrani.The enemy had sustained heavy casualties from harassing action by our tanks and from our artillery fire. It now seemed that three divisions had crossed the frontier. Two divisions extended fromSidi Barrani to Sollum with a second Libyan division dispersedbetween Sidi Omar and Halfaya. Air reconnaissance had disclosedno important movement towards Bardia from the West.Discussion ensued on the Military situation in Egypt and thenumber of our troops available to meet an Italian attack.At the request of the War Cabinet, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff undertook to obtain further information from theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, as to the present disposition ofhis forces, and his immediate intentions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[21754] b 2
Operation&quot; Menace.&quot;(previous reference:W.M. (40) 250thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet certain further information in regard to Operation &quot;Menace,&quot; a record of which is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.Switzerland.Violation of swiss Neutralityby british aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 248thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Permanent Undersecretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the Swiss Minister had called that morning onthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary to protest against the terms ofour recent Note about British aircraft passing over Swiss territory.The Minister had said that his Government could not accept thestatement in our Note that the flights over Swiss territory had been due to errors of navigation. He had asked Mr. Butler to delaysending a reply, at any rate until Lord Halifax had returned, since he feared that, if it could not be in more emphatic terms than our recent Note, the effect on Anglo-Swiss relations would be serious.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State said that our draft reply brought out that attacks were now being made on this country by Germany from countries which had been neutral until invadedby Germany; and that Italy, by coming into the war on Germany&apos;aside, had endorsed Germany&apos;s disregard of neutral rights. Subjectto confirmation, it would be added that Italian aircraft hadfrequently violated Spanish neutrality when making attacks on our forces. Generally speaking, the reply came rather more into the open in regard to our intention to continue flights over Swissterritory.It was desirable that our reply should be handed in before anyfurther flights over Switzerland took place. If the delivery of the note was delayed until the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return on Monday,the 23rd instant, this would mean suspending air operations againstNorth Italy for almost a week. The Swiss Minister was clearlyplaying for time, and seemed to be under the delusion that winterconditions would make it impossible for aircraft from this countryto deliver air attacks on North Italy.The War Cabinet- Agreed that our reply to the Swiss protest should be delivered on the following day, and that no further flightsof British aircraft should take place over Swiss territoryuntil the Air Ministry had been informed by the ForeignOffice that the reply had been delivered.FightingServices.Family and dependants&apos;Allowances.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 221stConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G.) (40) 236) proposing certain increases, which had been agreed with the Service Ministers, in the family and dependants&apos; allowances for members of the Forces. Thecost of the revised rates, which it was proposed should operate fromthe most convenient pay date near to the 1st November, 1940, was estimated at  3 millions a year for each million men.The proposed alterations in the family allowances were asfollows : Present.     New.Wife ,..Wife and wife and wife and wife andchildchildrenchildrenchildrenEach extra child17s.23s.27s.29s.32s.3s.18s.25s.30s.34s.38s.4s.The Lord Privy Seal criticised the revised family allowancesproposed on the grounds, first, that they were inadequate, taken
together with the soldier&apos;s allotment, to maintain the minimum standard of living to which a soldier&apos;s wife and family were entitled; and, secondly, that they compared unfavourably withother allowances paid by the Government. He thought that theamount allowed for children of members of the fighting forces should be considered in relation to the allowances for children inother State schemes.Taking into account the recent rise in the cost of living, the adjustment in the case of a wife ought to be an increase of the orderof 3s. 6^., not an increase of Is. Difficulty was likely to be experienced in getting the House of Commons to agree to theproposals in their present form.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the state of thenational finances would not justify increases greater than he had proposed. The demand for increases had come only from the Armyand there was no reason for believing that the Navy and the AirForce were not content with the present scales.The Secretary of State for War said that the aim had been toimprove the position of the wife with three children rather thanthat of the wife with no children. In all probability, most soldiers&apos;wives without children were now themselves working.The War Cabinet (a) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the proposals in W.P. (G.) (40) 236 to be reviewed by a meeting ofthe Home Policy Committee (Social Services Section)which the Chancellor of the Exchequer and service ministers should be invited to attend, and to report tothe War Cabinet.(b) Agreed that whatever new scales were eventually approvedshould operate from the most convenient pay date near to the 1st November, 1940.(c) Invited the Secretary of State for War to answer theParliamentary Question on the subject that afternoon,by saying that the matter was under review, and thatan announcement would be made as soon as possible.Civil Defence.Recruitment ofpart-time volunteers.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Home Security (W.P. (G.) (40) 235).The Minister of Home Security explained that in certain areasthere had been an unsatisfactory response to appeals for part-time volunteers for Civil Defence Services. One course would be to makepart-time unpaid service compulsory. But this would involve legis-lation and would not be desirable until other alternatives had been exhausted.The Ministers concerned thought that the right course was toarrange for a further personal appeal to be addressed to men in selected reserved occupations. Some help was already being obtained by reciprocal arrangements between the Home Guard and civil defence Services.The War Cabinet Gave general approval to the proposals of the Minister ofHome security summarised in paragraph 6 of his Memo-randum (W.P&quot;. (G.) (40) 235).
Parliament.Arrangementsfor Meeting ofboth Houses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 250thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet passages fromthe statement he intended to make in the House of Commons that afternoon. He intended to propose that, after the meetings duringthe present week, an announcement should be made that parliament would adjourn to Tuesday, the 15th October subject to an under-standing that Parliament would in fact be summoned privately tomeet at an earlier date.The War Cabinet approved this suggestion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 17, 1940.
