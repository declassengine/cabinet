The Chief of the Air Staff said that the enemy casualties during the period ended 7 a.m. that morning had been 3 aircraft destroyed and 4 damaged.We had suffered no casualties.Air operations in the middle east.MilitaryOperations:Middle East.Naval Opera-tions in theChannel.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 248thConclusions,Minute 2.)home Defence:Visit of thePrime Ministerto Kent.Enemy activity had been on a reduced scale during the past24 hours during the night not more than 100 aircraft having been involved. London had again been the principal target, but the damage had been appreciably less than on previous nights. TheMidlands had also been bombed, but no serious damage had beenreported.Air operations on a small scale had taken place in Egypt, theSudan and Eritrea.A considerable number of casualties were reported fromTel-Aviv as a result of the recent raid. The morale of the popula-tion had been good.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that on theWestern Frontier of Egypt the Italians were making their firstlarge-scale move for some considerable time. On the 10th Septembera force, estimated as the equivalent of one division, had movedeastwards, and one column of about 100 M.T. had halted betweenSidi Azziz and Fort Capuzzo, while the main column of about500 M.T. had halted in an area 8 to 12 miles West of Sidi Omar.These forces had made a further move eastwards on the11th September. General Wavell was of opinion that a large-scaleItalian offensive was not to be expected for a few days more, perhaps not until the 20th September.The First Sea Lord said that three groups, each of four destroyers, had made sweeps in the channel, but had reportednothing significant.The First Sea Lord said that, as the War Cabinet had beeninformed on the previous day, the six French cruisers had enteredCasablanca. On the early morning of the previous day H.M.Destroyer Vidette had sighted a French destroyer off Casablanca,steering north-west at 25 knots. After illuminating her by search-lights, Vidette had opened fire, but had ceased fire when the destroyer had signalled her name. No hits had been made and the fire had not been returned.The Renoivn had clear instructions that the French warshipsshould not be permitted to go to Dakar or Duala. If they attempted to do so, our vessels would use the minimum force necessary toprevent them.The Prime Minister gave a brief account of his visit to theDungeness and North Foreland districts on the previous day.The War Cabinet-(a) Took note of the above statements.(&amp;) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to convey to the squadrons of the Coastal Command their admiration ofthe skill and courage with which the vital, arduous, butoften unspectacular, tasks allotted to them had beencarried out, and of the enterprise and success with whichin recent days they had struck at the harbours, shipping and coastal defences of the enemy.(c) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to send asuitable message on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto the Authorities at Tel-Aviv.[21748]
The HomeFront.Air raid damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 247thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. A discussion took place on the position in the London area.The following points were made : (i) The Minister of Health said that there had been a remarkable improvement in the morale of the peopleduring the preceding 36 hours, largely owing to theheavy anti-aircraft fire,(ii) This improvement in morale had, however, to some extent-impeded the evacuation of the homeless. People whoearlier had clamoured to be taken away were nowreluctant to leave their homes. Nevertheless, the evacua-tion arrangements were functioning reasonably well.Large numbers from the East End had been moved intoWest London boroughs or into Essex.(iii) The Lord Privy Seal said  that he had heard somecomplaint that the persons rendered homeless were to bebilleted, when numbers of houses were empty and couldbe taken over for the purpose.(iv) The Minister of Health said that the sewage situation was unsatisfactory. A vital part of the sewage pumpingmachinery had been damaged and the main sewersbroken in several places. As a result, sewage wasdraining into the River Lea instead of into the Thames.Some anxiety was felt for other districts (for instance,West Ham) where the main sewers ran at a higher level than the ground. If the sewers were broken, these districts would have to be evacuated.The Minister added that he was very dissatisfied with a report that the damage to the sewage systemmight take several months to repair. He was lookinginto the matter personally.(v) The Silvertown district had been evacuated owing to thewater supply being cut off. The supply had been restored, but it was not proposed to allow the people toreturn to their homes at present.(vi) The population of certain parts of London was showingreluctance to make use of their Anderson shelters andof the street shelters. They preferred to congregate inother underground accommodation for example, underchurches, schools and public buildings.The Home Secretary said that this tendency was due in part to a number of street shelters having suffereddirect hits.(vii) The Minister of Health said that this overcrowding mightwell give rise to a health problem. Thus inoculationagainst diphtheria and scarlet fever might be necessary.Public opinion would have to be prepared before such measures could be put into effect. He had appointed a Committee to report at an early date on these matters.The Committee included Lord Horder (Chairman),Sir Wyndham Deedes, and representatives of theMinistry of Home Security and the Ministry of Health.(viii) The I^ord President of the Council said that, as directed bythe War Cabinet on the 11th September, he had had two meetings with the Ministers concerned, to review the steps taken to deal with the damage caused by air raidsin the London area to public utility services, transport and food supplies, &amp;c.He proposed to render a formal Report, but theWar Cabinet might like to know that, while considerable damage had been effected, the amount of stocks of any
Provision of shelter accom-modation inLondon.Air Raids. 3.   The War Cabinet discussed the possibility of increasingthe air raid shelter accommodation for the population of London.The use of the tubes for this purpose was proposed.The Minister of Transport said he had examined the questionwhether the tubes should be used for air raid shelters, but he stillSuggested use of agreed with the conclusions of the Committee which had examinedtube railways.    the question before the war, namely, that it was more important tokeep the tubes available for transport services.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and the Minister ofHome Security said that the Commissioner of Police stronglydeprecated the use of the tubes as shelters. The public had beeneducated to use shelters and there was broadly sufficient shelteraccommodation available for the majority of the population. Adviceurging the public to use shelters was continually being given, andnew shelters were being built as soon as material was available.Materials for air raid shelters did not, however, enjoy a very high priority, and the supply presented some difficulty.The War Cabinet agreed That it was important that it should continue to be impressed on the public that they should take shelterduring air raids, and that the shelters provided, while notaffording immunity from a direct hit, offered the bestprotection available.Air Raids.Effect on rail-ways in theLondon area.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Minute by the Chiefof the Air Staff (W.P. (40) 368) on the effect of enemy bombing of railways in the London area.The Minister of Transport said that more than half the trouble was caused by unexploded bombs. The priority for the use of bombdisposal units was decided by the Regional Commissioner. Hethought that vital points on railways should receive higher priority;that inspection should be made as soon as possible to determine what were unexploded time bombs; that additional units should be madeavailable, and that a number of bomb disposal units should be specially allocated for use on the railways.The Secretary of State for War said that steps had been takento increase the number of these units in the London area from 12last Tuesday, to 22.  A further increase to 28 was contemplated.The Minister of Home Security, after paying a tribute to thework of bomb disposal units under General Taylor, said that he deprecated earmarking a number of these units for railway workonly. It was important that our resources in this respect shouldbe pooled, and that the decision as to priorities should remain inthe hands of the Regional Commissioner.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War to determine, inconsultation with the Minister of Home Security and theMinister of Transport, the best means of ensuring that adue proportion of the available bomb disposal units wasmade available for dealing with unexploded bombs on therailways.particular type destroyed was not alarming. In no case had more than two days&apos; consumption of any foodcommodity been destroyed. Steps were being taken to effect further dispersal of stocks where called for.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
The King. 5.   In the course of the Meeting, the War Cabinet wereAir attack on informed that a dive-bombing attack had been carried out onBuckingham      Buckingham Palace.Palace- The War Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to send thefollowing message on their behalf to His Majesty The King : &quot; The War Cabinet offer their hearty congratulations totheir Majesties on their providential escape from the barbarousattack made on their home and Royal Persons.&quot;The War Cabinet also agreed that, subject to HisMajesty&apos;s consent, the fullest publicity should be given tothis message.6. The Prime Minister said that he was convinced that itwas too dangerous for Paxdiament to sit after dark.He had decided not to call the House together on Monday, the16th September. The House would therefore meet as originally proposed on Tuesday, the 17th September, at 2-45 p.m. and sit onWednesday at 11 a.m. It might also be necessary to meet onThursday at 11 a.m.The Prime Minister added that he would make a statement on Tuesday, the 16th, and propose that in future the House should meet at 11 a.m. instead of 2-45 p.m. and adjourn at 4 or 4-30 p.m.instead of 11 or 11-30 p.m., Questions being taken from 11 a.m. till12 o&apos;clock. The necessary motion to give effect to this proposal would be moved on Wednesday, the 18th September. similar arrangements would be made in the House of Lords. Both houses would adjourn the following week till Tuesday, the 1st October.Attention was also drawn to a leading article in a daily paper,urging that Parliament should now resume its full programme ofSessions. The Prime Minister said that it would be impossible for ministers to carry on with the essential business which they had totransact in present circumstances, from hour to hour, if they had also to attend to Parliamentary duties.The Prime Minister suggested that some preliminary indication of the Governments intentions in this matter should be given byParty Leaders to their followers before the House assembled on tuesday. In particular, emphasis might be laid on the importantduties which Members could perform in their constituencies at thepresent critical time.Air Raid 7.   The War Cabinet were informed that the loss of steelWarnings. production due to air raid warnings in the week ending the(Previous 31st August amounted to the equivalent of nearly 50,000 tons ofReference: finished steel, i.e., from an average of 254,000 tons a week in 1939W.M. (40) 245th to 207,000 tons. Owing to the glow or glare from the processesConclusions, involved, steel production was almost as much impeded by the minute 2.) &apos;&apos; yellow &quot; as by the &apos;&apos; red &apos;&apos; warnings. It was understood thatthe Steel Manufacturers were meeting to consider what action could be taken to deal with the situation.The War Cabinet considered whether any improvement couldbe made in the present system of warnings, supplemented by thesystem of watchers. This system was being rapidly extended, andit was hoped that the organisations of employers and employeeswould press for its use wherever practicable.The Minister without Portfolio thought that it would be ofadvantage if appeals could be made at particular works or localitiesby Ministers and national and local leaders.The War Cabinet-Agreed that every endeavour should be made to pressforward with the organisation of a system of look-out men.Parliament.Arrangementsfor Meeting ofboth Houses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 246thConclusions,Minute 5.)
South America. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theBritish Political Minister of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (40) 234), relating to the suggestion and Trade that a first-class ship (the A Imeda Star) should be placed at theMission. disposal of a Political and Trade Mission to be headed by LordWillingdon, which it was proposed to send to South America.The President of the Board of Trade said that the mission was one of considerable importance. It was necessary to restore our trade position in South America. Orders were now falling off fromthat part of the world and there was no belief that we could delivergoods. The Americans were stealing our trade under cover ofGerman propaganda which spread reports that this country wasnot in a position to send ships or deliver goods.The Minister of Shipping said that the use of the Almeda Starfor such a purpose would mean that our shipping programme would suffer; this was already behind schedule. Further, we had urgedour Allies to put at our disposal all their best vessels for essentialcarrying trades and the effect on them of sending one of our bestships on such a mission might be unfortunate.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, notwithstanding the importance of the Mission, we should not be justified in puttingthis ship at its disposal for four months.The Minister of Shipping said that he thought arrangements could probably be made to send the Mission to South America on aBritish ship which would go out to South America to fetch backcargo.The War Cabinet decided (a) That the Almeda Star should not be put at the disposalof the British Mission to South America.(b) That the President of the Board of Trade was free tocontinue the arrangements for the Mission, providedother arrangements were made for its transport to SouthAmerica and accommodation there.Information.Proposed&quot; Omnibus &quot;Communique.9.   The War Cabinet-Agreed with the recommendation of the Minister ofInformation contained in W.P. (G.) (40) 233 relating tothe issue of an &quot; omnibus &quot; communique.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,September 13, 1940.
