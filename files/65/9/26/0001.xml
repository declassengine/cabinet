The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on the previous day 450 enemy aircraft had been over this country but had donepractically no damage. There had been two attempts to attackPortsmouth which had been repulsed. The fact that these attacks had been driven off over the sea probably accounted for the equality of pilot casualties.   The casualties had been as follows :  Our own 5 machines (1 pilot safe).Enemy 4 certain.1 probable.5 damaged.On the previous night about 250 enemy aircraft had made raids,London being the main objective, although a number had penetratedto the Midlands and South Wales. The oil installation at Purfleethad been hit, but the fire had been put out immediately.On the previous night 88 of our aircraft had attacked varioustargets in Germany, including gas plants in Berlin. Invasion portshad also been attacked. We had lost three machines, and two othershad been lost on reconnaissance and photographic flights.Tobruk Harbour had been attacked and large fires had been started. One of our fighters had attacked and destroyed an Italianmachine on the ground west of Barrani. One of our aircraft hadbeen lost.During the last Italian attack on Haifa, four machines hadbeen shot down by A.A. fire. One of these machines had contained a German pilot with an Italian crew.Reference was made to recent reports from a number of sourcesthat, although our bombs hit their targets, yet the weight of the bombs was not enough to cause considerable damage. The Secretaryof State for Air said that he had discussed this question with theCommander-in-Chief, Bomber Command. The loading of aircraft with bombs was always very carefully calculated and the effect whichcould be obtained from different sizes of bombs, having regard tothe nature of the target to be attacked, worked out in detail. Whenbigger bombers were available, it would be possible to carry a more effective load.In answer to a further question, the Secretary of State for Airsaid that the Air Staff always regarded oil refineries and aircraft production factories as their main bombing objectives in Germany.It had been necessary during recent weeks to divert our attacks tothe invasion ports, but on the last few nights it had been possible to resume, to a certain extent, our attacks on what the Air Staffregarded as our primary targets in Germany.The First Sea Lord reported that King George V had been corn-missioned on the previous day.Certain of our naval forces were in the vicinity of the Azores.The War Cabinet:- VInvited the Chiefs of Staffs, together with a representativeof the Foreign Office, to consider whether these movementsshould, or should not, be carried out in such a way as toavoid attracting notice to the presence of a British naval force near the Azores.An air reconnaissance had reported that Richelieu and threeFrench cruisers were still at Dakar.Certain movements of General de gaulle&apos;s force were reported.H.M. Submarine Stvordfish had reported that on the morning of the 1st October she had attacked four small destroyers east ofCherbourg and believed she had made one hit.[21796-4] b 2
An Italian submarine had sunk a Spanish merchant ship in theMediterranean.Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that one of operations: our patrols had observed only white troops at Sofafi East CampEgypt- (south of Buqbuq).   Air reconnaissance had reported 30 motor-transport, vehicles moving east into Barrani. Eighty motor-transports had been seen stationary halfway between Buqbuq andSidi Barrani. Thirty motor-transports, with three tanks and guns,had been seen moving south from Tummar, 10 miles south of SidiBarrani.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raid 2.

The New Statesman and Nation, which had been brought to hisnotice, giving an account of conditions in the large shelter atStepney.In parts of this building, which had not been thought suitablefor a shelter, and had not therefore been recognised as such, andsuitably equipped, indescribable conditions had prevailed. ThePrime Minister urged the need for strong action to prevent largenumbers of people crowding into this building until the necessarywork had been done to make it safe. From all he learnt of theposition, drastic action was called for, and the Air Raid PrecautionsOfficer in Stepney should be immediately superseded.The Home Secretary said that steps were being taken to dealwith the Stepney shelter, and Admiral Evans, Regional Com-missioner, had been given the fullest powers to deal with this matter,including supersession of this particular Air Raid PrecautionsOfficer.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Prance.french colonies andMandatedTerritories.FrenchSomaliland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 185thConclusions,Minute 11.)3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a message hadbeen received from the French Admiralty through our Naval attache in Madrid, reporting that the French merchant vessel Esperance,en route for Jibuti to embark French troops for Indo-China, hadbeen taken to Aden. The message added that it was hoped weshould not interfere with French troopships, especially theEsperance, for if these troops in Jibuti could not be evacuated withtheir arms, these arms would fall into Italian hands. The troops were intended to keep order in Indo-China, and it was therefore inBritish interests to allow their passage.In discussion it was pointed out that the removal of these troops from Jibuti would have the effect of weakening French resistance to Italian demands, and would relieve their economic difficulties.Further, if these troops were removed, there was a great risk of the oil supplies in the neighbourhood of Jibuti falling into Italian&apos;hands. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, who had been con-suited, was strongly opposed to allowing these troops to leave Jibuti&apos;.further, their presence in Indo-China would not serve any useful purpose.
Far East.PolicytowardsJapan.Appointmentof Inter-departmentalCommittee.(previous references:W.M. (40) 217thConclusions,Minute 4, and261stConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that in thenear future there might be several ways in which we should be ableto cause inconvenience to the Japanese without ceasing to actpolitely. Already a number of steps had been taken to interferewith Japanese trading facilities. He suggested the appointmentof an Interdepartmental Committee on Far Eastern Affairs, withthe Parliamentary TJnder-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs inthe chair, to co-ordinate activities in this direction. ;The War Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to set up an Interdepart-mental Committee on Far Eastern matters, under theChairmanship of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.The Pacific.Anglo-american co-operation.5. The Prime Minister referred to Foreign Office telegramNo. 2406, dated the 29th September, to our Ambassador atWashington. He thought that there might be certain advantages in a proposal for parallel declarations by the United States,Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and ourselves, that we intended to maintain the status quo in the South Pacific. The PrimeMinister also questioned the statement that it was not in our interests that the United States should be involved in war in the pacific.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the argu-ment was that, if the United States became involved in war in the pacific, the result might be to shut off supplies of arms that were quired to fight our principal enemy, Germany. He agreed, how-ever, that the telegram was unduly compressed, and perhaps rathermisleading, and he would send a further telegram in amplification.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France.Policytowardsthe vichy government.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 263rdConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a draft telegram to our ambassador at Madrid (WP. (40) 397) prepared by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in the light of the discussion at theMeeting of the War Cabinet on the previous day. The War cabinet also had before them copies of telegrams Nos. 724, 725 and 72.6 fromthe United Kingdom High Commissioner in the. Union of SouthAfrica.The following amendments to the draft telegram were approved : Paragraph 1 (c) : Should end &quot; which rally to his cause.&quot;Paragraph 2, line 3 : For &quot; two &quot; read &quot; three.&quot;Paragraph 2 (a) : The words in brackets should stand.Paragraph 2 (b) : For &quot; prepared to receive&quot; read&quot; prepared to study.&quot;Paragraph 2 : Add at the end a new sub-paragraph (c) :&quot; How to ensure that ships of the French Government can inno circumstances fall into German or Italian hands.&quot;The War Cabinet :-(1) Agreed that the Esperance should not be allowed to proceedto Jibuti.(2) Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty, in consultationwith the Foreign Office, to send a full reply to the FrenchAdmiralty through our Naval Attache in Madrid, givingthe reasons for our action.

(40) 260thConclusions,Minute 5.)The blockade.&quot;AGibraltar.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 394), regardingmethods of affording support to the Non-Interventionist Party in spain. With the return of Senor Suner from Berlin, the strugglebetween the Interventionists (Senor Suner and the Falangist Party^and the Non-Interventionists (Colonel Beigbeder and the Army)might reach its climax. We might be able to make concessions to spain in respect of (a) Certain blockade matters.(6) Gibraltar.(c) Morocco.Attention was also drawn to Madrid Telegram No. 801, datedthe 29th September, in which Sir Samuel Hoare submitted a tentative draft of a statement intended for publication, dealing withthese three matters. He suggested that the statement should bediscussed with Colonel Beigbeder, whose views would be referredto the Foreign Secretary before any commitments were entered into.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, as a resultof a conversation with the Minister of Economic Warfare, he had found that action was being taken which it was hoped would meetmany of Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s difficulties on blockade matters. Hewould telegraph to Sir Samuel Hoare telling him what was being done at this end; and inviting him to report further on any matters in which the action which we were taking fell short of what he considered to be essential.General agreement was expressed with the course of action proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that he had now come to theconclusion that the best way of dealing with the Gibraltar issue would be to authorise Sir Samuel Hoare to repeat in public the assurance which he had been authorised in June last to giveColonel Beigbeder in private, namely : (a) That, for reasons which the Spanish Government would readily comprehend, we could not discuss the questionof Gibraltar during the war.(b) That we would be prepared to discuss any question ofcommon interest to ourselves and Spain after the con-clusion of hostilities.
(c) We would regard this discussion and any settlement asmatters primarily, if not exclusively, concerningourselves and Spain.He thought that a statement on these lines would help ColonelBeigbeder against Senor Suner, but would not involve us in anybinding commitments.The general view of the War Cabinet was against authorisingany public statement on these lines. Such a statement would give an impression of weakness abroad. At home it would be strongly criticised, and would probably give rise to discussion in parliament which would show how little this vague formula meant. It waspossible to conceive a state of affairs in which fortresses now in thehands of different Powers might be neutralised and dismantled, butwe were very far from such a position at the moment.Morocco. It was pointed out that Colonel Beigbeder had said thatMorocco was of more interest to him than the future of Gibraltar.It was also felt that Spanish aspirations in Morocco were well-founded, and that as France might well have to surrender some ofher Moroccan territory to Spain in the Peace Treaty, it was foolishto resist these aspirations. Looking at the matter from this pointof view, the Prime Minister thought that there would be noobjection to making a statement, not merely in private, but also in public, on the lines of the last half of paragraph 11 of the foreign secretary&apos;s Memorandum.On the other hand, it was argued that there might be somedisadvantage in doing this at the same time as we were endeavouringto improve our relations with the Vichy Government, and that astatement on these lines might hamper General de Gaulle&apos;smovement.The general conclusion reached was that a public statement onthe Moroccan question should, if necessary, follow the lines ofparagraph 4 of telegram No. 801 from Madrid.In the course of discussion, reference was made to somemischievous articles in the News Chronicle on the Spanish question.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Economic Warfare, to telegraph to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Madrid on the lines proposed at &quot; A.&quot;(b) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform Sir Samuel Hoarethat the War Cabinet deprecated any public statement about Gibraltar at the present time. The SpanishGovernment should, if necessary, be told that publicationat this juncture of the private assurance given in june last would create great difficulties in this country, andwould be likely to lead to a definition of the word&quot; discussion,&quot; which might be embarrassing to both parties.(c) Agreed that Sir Samuel Hoare should be authorised to givea private assurance about Morocco on the lines suggestedin paragraph 11 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Paper; andthat any public statement should be on the lines suggestedin paragraph 4 of Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;s telegram No. 801.(d) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to use his influence with the proprietors of the News Chronicle to secure a cessation of the mischievous articles which had recentlyappeared in that Paper.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 2, 1940.
