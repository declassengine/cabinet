The Chief of the Air Staff reported that between 200-250enemy aircraft had operated over this country on the previous day.On the previous night the total had been some 250. The mainconcentration had again been on London, though Liverpool hadreceived considerable attention.On the previous night we had despatched 127 bombers, butthey had only been able to engage their secondary targets owingto bad visibility.The First Sea Lord reported that four Tribal class destroyers had attacked enemy shipping off the South-west Coast of Norwayduring the night 13/14th, and had sunk two escort vessels andthree merchant ships.No report of recent operations had yet been received from theCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, as the Fleet was still at sea.The Italians acknowledged, however, that we had sunk twotorpedo-boat destroyers and one destroyer.Reports had recently been received of successful actions by our submarines in the Mediterranean. On 15th August H.M.S.Osiris had sunk a transport of about 3,000 tons in the Straits ofOtranto. Towards the end of September H.M.S. Truant had sunk ship of about 3,000 tons off Naples and H.M.S. Pandora had sunk ship of 800 tons off Benghazi.On 29th September two Swordfish aircraft had attacked anenemy convoy consisting of two ships west of Tobruk with torpedoes. Two explosions had been seen followed by columns ofsmoke from one of the ships.On the previous day 11,000 tons of shipping had been sunk by enemy action, but that day we had lost only one Greek ship of5,500 tons.weekThisThe First Lord of the Admiralty stated that for the ending 7th October we had lost 31,000 tons of shipping,was a great improvement on the previous weeks.The S.S. Empire Audacity had safely arrived in port with50,000 rifles from the United States of America, although the convoy in which she had sailed had been attacked.Iceland.The First Lord added that our minesweepers were nowsweeping up large numbers of mines. Evidently the enemy weresowing very large quantities of mines round our coasts.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that increasedM.T. activity had been reported in the Barrani area and the arrival of a further division had been reported, making three inall in that area. Between Benghazi and our Own Front theItalians had now some six divisions.The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to a report which hadbeen received to the effect that six light mobile German divisions were now passing through Italy on their way to Libya.The Chief of the Imperial Ueneral Staff gave particulars of ourown and Italian strength in tanks on the Egyptian front, and of reinforcements on their way to the Middle East.In the Kassala Sector the enemy had been engaged by amechanised patrol and suffered casualties amounting to 18 killed.Our casualties had been 1 killed and 1 wounded.Lord Gort was on his way to Iceland to  carry outinspection of our troops on the island.anThe War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
The middle east.Visit of theSecretary ofState for war to Egypt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 268thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that the Secretary ofState for War had arrived in Cairo that afternoon.Discussion ensued as to whether any attempt should be madeto keep his visit secret. The view generally expressed was that,as the visit was certain to become known, it was probably right to announce the Secretary of State&apos;s arrival in Egypt. The Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs undertook to telegraph to Sir miles lampson to make sure that the same line was adopted on thismatter here and in Egypt. The Foreign Secretary added that hehad asked the Secretary of State for War, during his visit to egypt, to discuss with Sir Miles Lampson and General Wavellthe possibility of our taking over some of the equipment now heldby the Egyptian Army in the event of that Army proving unreli-able. He was also telegraphing to the Secretary of State to ask him to take up the question of a declaration of war by Egypt.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the following information : The Roumanian Government had decided to liberate four, andto expel from Roumania two, of the British subjects now under detention in that country.foreign information.Roumania.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 26SthConclusions,Minute 5.)Spain. The upshot of the telegrams received from Sir Samuel Hoare(Previous was that Senor Suner&apos;s mission to Germany and Italy had been a reference: failure.W.M.

(40) 268thConclusions,Minute 6.)The Foreign Secretary invited the attention of his colleagues to telegram 865 from Sir Stafford Cripps suggesting a line ofpolicy in order to persuade the Soviet Union to adopt at least abenevolent neutrality towards Turkey and Iran. The foreign secretary thought that there was a good deal to be said for acting on the lines suggested by Sir Stafford Cripps, provided that wekept in line with United States policy. He asked his colleagues to study this telegram with a view to further discussion of thematter on the following day.Telegrams 2241 and 2265 from Washington showed that theState Department was opposed to anything like a conference,either in Washington, London or Singapore, at the present time.A reply to these telegrams was being despatched proposing thatarrangements should be made for the exchange of technical information.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
cAir raid warnings.Proposedmodifications.(PreviousPieferences:W.M. (40) 245thConclusions,Minute 2, andW.M. (40) 269thConclusions,Minute 4.)4.   The War Cabinet had before them Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production(W.P. (40) 408).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Home Security, covering a Report by a committee under the chairmanship of Air Vice-Marshal R. H. Peck,appointed to review the air raid warning system (W.P. (40) 417)Reports on the time lost in Government Departmentsduring air raids (W.P. (G.) (40) 256 and 265).The causes of loss of workingtime inMunitionsFactories.The Minister of Labour .and National Service said that hisinvestigations showed that the air raid warning system was onlyone of a variety of causes leading to the loss of working timein factories working for the Ministry of Supply and the Ministryof Aircraft Production. Other causes were faulty management,lack of consideration in handling men, and bad lay-out of factories.At Euxton, for example, the men had long distances to walk inexposed conditions between the railway station and theirworkshops.It was necessary to deal with the problem of output as awhole, factory by factory, as the question of the siren could notbe dealt with in isolation. He was confident that he and his department would be able to secure a considerable increase in production.The Minister of Aircraft Production thought the problem of thesiren needed to be dealt with urgently, in isolation from generalfactory conditions. He wanted to see a declaration made interms that would persuade the men to stay at their benchesafter the &quot; alert &quot; warning.In discussion, it was pointed out that the incidence of air raids varied greatly in different parts of the country. In theMidlands there was little or no reason for any interruption ofwork. In London and Liverpool, areas which furnished most ofthe examples given in W.P. (40) 408, several factories had suffered direct hits. This had a temporary effect on production,but the men soon pulled themselves together and production roseagain.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that in his judgmentthe worst flaw in the existing system was the working of shiftsoriginally planned on the assumption of long hours of daylight.If these shifts were not adjusted to meet winter conditions, therewould be a serious fall off in output. The first-class machine tools which we now possessed must be in continuous use.The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that there had been an increase in output in the aircraft industry since the weekreferred to in W.P. (40) 408 (the week ending 28th September).Air Vice-Marshal Peck explained the recommendations in his report. His Committee had been appointed in pursuance of theCabinet direction that a review should be made of the air raid warning system, and that the possibility of introducing a supple-mental system of localized area warnings should be examined.The War Cabinet-(a) Gave a general approval to the recommendations of theAir Raid Warning Committee for improving the presentsystem contained in W.P. (40) 417, as summarized inparagraph 21, subject to (b) and (c) below.
(b) Approved the appointment of Alarm Officers for eachObserver Group Centre as suggested in paragraph21 dv) subject to further consideration being given tothe question whether these Officers should be appointedby the Ministry of Home Security rather than by theAir Ministry. It was suggested that on general grounds it would be preferable that one department should be responsible for the whole of the air raid warning organisation.(c) Invited the Committee to report, after further investigation,on the practicability of providing mechanical listeningdevices for the assistance of roof-watchers.(d) Took note of the Air Raid Warning Committee&apos;s riderthat their recommendation for the issue of &quot; alarmswithin the alert &quot; was made on the basis that such ascheme could not be universally applied, and thatrequests for inclusion in the scheme which could not bemet must be resisted. It would be difficult, though notnecessarily impossible, for such a scheme to be applied in London.(e) Took note that the Minister of Labour and NationalService was willing, if so invited by the SupplyMinisters, to examine the position at any munitionsfactory, with a view to eliminating conditions leading to loss of working time.Air Raids.Payment of overtime in thebaking industry.5. In connection with the preceding discussion, The Ministerof Labour and National Service informed the War Cabinet that an informal arrangement had recently been made in the BakingIndustry by which men were to receive time and a half for working during air raid warnings. His Department had, of course,no official cognizance of this arrangement.It was pointed out in discussion that the arrangement was contrary to the national interest, and if not speedily brought to anend would be a dangerous precedent.The Minister thought that the best plan would be for him tosee the representatives of the two sides at a very early date and endeavour to persuade them to bring the arrangement to an end.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labouract on the lines proposed.and National Service toThe Means g.    The War Cabinet had before them memoranda by the test. Minister of Labour and National Service, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord Privy Seal and a joint memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health(W.P. (G.) (40) 259, 261, 263 and 264).In discussion it was pointed out that the abnormal movements of the population, due to air raids, had resulted in artificialhouseholds. To retain the Household Means Test in thesecircumstances might give rise to great bitterness.A number of Parliamentary Questions on the matter hadalready been postponed, but the subject was certain to be raisedwhen the new Assistance Regulations were taken in the House.On present arrangements these would be taken in the ensuingweek. One suggestion was that the Minister of Labour should say that the whole question of the Household Means Test wasunder examination by the Government.
Gas.Supplies inLondon.(previous reference:Minute 11.)7. The Lord President of the Council reported that he had examined the position of gas supplies in London, in consultationwith the President of the Board of Trade. The position was notperhaps quite so bad as had been painted, although one-eighth ofthe consumers in London were cut off from supplies. this.M. (40) 268th position had been static for some days. At the present momentConclusions ^ne limiting factor was distribution, much of the trouble beingdue to the presence of water in the gas mains.The Companies had pooled their resources in a single group,under the General Manager of the Gas Light and Coke Company.The position in regard to materials for repairs was satisfactory,but although 10,000 to 12,000 men were constantly engaged on repairs, there was some shortage of skilled labour. TheCompanies badly needed to get back some of their skilled menfrom the Army. This point was being taken up with the WarOffice. A number of Royal Engineer Companies were also being employed on this woi*k. The Board of Trade were hoping toimprovise pnmps to make good a shortage of pumps for gettingwater out of the mains. It was hoped to effect a steady improve-ment on the distribution side, in which case before long the limiting factor would be production.It was pointed out, however, that a statement of this kind would almost certainly be taken to mean that the HouseholdMeans Test would not be maintained, at any rate in its present form, and would thus prejudge a decisiou.While it was the unanimous wish of the War Cabinet thatthe whole question should be examined in a sympathetic spirit, itwas pointed out that the issues involved were at once complex and of considerable importance. An alteration in the Means Testfor Unemployment Assistance and Supplementary Pensions wouldprobably involve a similar alteration in regard to non-contributoryOld Age Pensions and also Public Assistance payments.As regards procedure, it was agreed that an examination byexperts was necessary. But it was felt that it would be helpful to have a meeting of Ministers for preliminary discussion of the issues involved, in order to provide the Departmental officialswith a better indication of the lines on which their examination should proceed.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) A special meeting of the Lord Presidents Committeeshould be held at an early date, to which other ministers concerned should be invited.(2) This meeting should conduct a preliminary survey of the issues involved, and frame a remit to facilitateexamination of the issue involved by a Committee of officials.(3) Until this examination had been carried out, and the WarCabinet had reached a decision in principle, no announcement should be made that the HouseholdMeans Test was under examination by the Government.(4) The examination should be carried out with the utmostexpedition consistent with a thorough investigation ofthe points involved.(5) In view of (3), the date when the new AssistanceRegulations were brought up in the House of commons should be postponed.
Two points arose in regard to production. The first was some relaxation of lighting restrictions. The second concernedventilation in retort-houses under black-out conditions. both these points were being taken up by the Ministry of home security.The Lord President of the Council added that he was obtain-ing a weekly appreciation of the position, together with dailyreports of any important alterations in the position. He would keep the War Cabinet informed of the situation.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.October 14, 1940,
