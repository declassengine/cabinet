Our fighters claimed to have intercepted two enemy aircraft, but had not brought them down.Our aircraft detailed to attack targets in Germany had been unable to reach Berlin on account of bad weather conditions. Theyhad attacked targets at Kiel, Wilhelmshaven, Bremen and Hamburg.One direct hit on the Gneiserio.u was claimed. Blenheim aircraft had attacked enemy occupied aerodromes in Belgium and Holland.The First Sea Lord reported the dispositions which had beentaken to intercept a suspicious vessel which had been observed in thedirection of the Faroes, which might be a raider making for home.H.M.S. Walpole had been mined and towed into port. A british merchant vessel of 2,700 tons had been damaged and set on fire bya mine, while in convoy.   She has subsequently been beached.The First Sea Lord reported the dispositions of theMediterranean Fleet. Reconnaissance from Malta on the previous day had detected the Italian main fleet in Taranto and Brindisi;no enemy activity had been observed near Corfu, Argostoli and theGulf of Patras or in the adjacent waters.Fourteen aircraft from Illustrious and Eagle, operating from ashore base, had successfully bombed Tobruk and had laid mines inthe harbour entrance.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave further detailsof the action south of Kassala, reported on the previous day, whichhad taken place on the 19th October. The enemy party which ourarmoured cars had surprised had been approximately 1,000 strong.Most of them were probably native troops. We had inflicted some400 casualties, with no loss to ourselves.On the night of the 26th-27th October one enemy aircraft had dropped ten bombs in the desert, near the Bitter Lake. There hadbeen no damage or casualties.The Italians had, as yet, made no serious attack on Greece onthe Albanian frontier. Greek outposts had been withdrawn in some places. Tatoi aerodrome (Athens), Patras, Preveza and the CorinthCanal had been bombed. There had been no enemy action againstCorfu.An unconfirmed report from a Bulgarian source stated thatseven German divisions were coming down the Danube.A discussion took place on the military situation in the middle east, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[21869]b 2
Home Defence. 2.   The War Cabinet were informed that a number of GermanLikelihood of vessels had been reported in the Channel making eastwards. It was,invasion. however, too early to draw the deduction that the risk of invasion(Previous had receded.   Some 60 good German divisions were ready at shortReference: notice, close to the invasion ports. So long as that situation con-W.M. (40) 272nd tinued, it would be essential for us to keep a number of divisions in conclusions,      readiness at home.minute 2.) ^Ae Home Secretary referred to the report that an invasion ofthis country had been attempted on or about the 16th September andhad been repelled. The currency of this report was already making-it difficult to enforce the present restrictions in the coastal areas.The Prime Minister said that there was no foundation for thesestories, apart from the heavy defeats which our fighters had inflicted on the German Air Force at that time, and the heavy barrage whichwe had laid down on the invasion ports.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Minister of Information to inculcate the needfor continued vigilance in our preparations againstinvasion.Ah&apos; raid damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 278thConclusions,Minute 7.)The Midlands.3. The Minister of Home Security reported that the air raidcasualties on the previous night had been in London about 60 killed and 250 injured, and in the provinces 6 killed and 67 injured. TheLondon figures included the casualties at St. Peter&apos;s Church, South-wark. where three H.E. bombs had hit the crypt, causing 100casualties.Birmingham had been heavily bombed on the previous night,New Street Railway Station being badly damaged. The roof of thecathedral had also been hit.The suggestion was made that some encouraging message shouldbe sent to Birmingham and Coventry. The Minister undertook toconsider the suggestion that a message, perhaps from the lord mayor of London, should be sent to the Midlands. It was probablyundesirable to specify particular towns.That morning bombs had been dropped near the County Hall,and in Parliament Square.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.foreign information.Greece:Invasion by italy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 278thConclusions,Minute 2.)U.S.S.R.:Anglo-soviet negotiations.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (40) 276thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the following information :--Very little information had been received in regard to theItalian attack on Greece. Telegram No. 1381 from Ankara reportedthat the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed the GreekMinister that Greece could count absolutely on Turkey in the eventof Greece being attacked by Bulgaria.Sir Stafford Cripps reported (telegram No. 925 from Moscow),that M. Vyshinsky had said that the Notes which he (the ambassador) had given him were regarded as of the greatest importance. M. Vyshinsky had asked for certain explanations, andhad said that he would see the Ambassador again in a few days&apos; time.The barter negotiations with the U.S.S.R. were proceeding, and finalinstructions were being sent to Sir Stafford Cripps that day.
Prance:negotiations between the vichy andGermanGovernments.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 278thConclusions,Minute 4.)M. Rougier was leaving that evening for Tangier. TheForeign Secretary had seen the notes of what he proposed to say toGeneral Weygand.No definite news had been received as to the negotiations between the Vichy and German Governments, though speculationsas to the position had reached us from Madrid (Telegram No. 922)and from Berne (Telegram No. 1889).In discussion it was agreed that the Minister of information should tell the Press that there was no objection to publicity being given to the reported terms which the Germans were seeking toimpose on France, provided it was made clear that these reports were unconfirmed. The blame for the present state of affairs shouldbe put on M. Laval, and not on Marshal Petain.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Germany. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarEffect of R.A.F. Cabinet Telegram No. 809 from Belgrade as to the effects of bombing raids on Berlin, on morale in Berlin. The upshot of this report was that the cock-(Previous sureness of the German civil population was disappearing, and that reference: the German people seemed to have less power of resistance to airW.M. (40) 27lst bombardment than the people of this country. The view was conclusions,      supported by a recent secret report.Minute 3.) jn diSCUssion it was suggested that advertisements in thesmaller German provincial papers were used by the German civilpopulation as a channel for communicating news to each other, andwould repay study.The War Cabinet :-Took note of this information, and invited the Chief of theAir Staff to arrange for the Intelligence Staffs to follow up this suggestion.Spain.Instructionsto ItalianSubmarinesregardingSpanishmerchant ships.6. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that whilst an Italiansubmarine had been sinking after a recent attack by one of our destroyers, two of our officers had boarded it and obtained anoriginal copy of instructions to Italian submarines to sink at sightmerchant vessels belonging to two Spanish steamship lines whichwere specified.The Foreign Secretary said that he had sent Sir Samuel Hoarea copy of these instructions and Sir Samuel had asked permission to communicate them to General Franco. This permission had beengiven. In discussion it was suggested that publicity should begiven to these instructions, both in this country and America, whereit might be especially valuable at the present moment.The War Cabinet decided that any question of giving publicity to those instructions should be deferred until Sir Samuel Hoare had had an opportunity of acquainting General Franco of the facts, andof expiration^ssing his views as to how the matter should be handled.India.Action againstPandit Nehru.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 250thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Secretary of State for India reminded the WarCabinet that on the 16th September they had agreed that theViceroy should be informed that the War Cabinet would agree tothe enactment of all necessary measures the moment it became clearthat Congress was determined to embark on a campaign ofdeliberate interference with the conduct of the war. The WarCabinet had, however, wished to consider the actual situation created by any Congress Resolution as soon as that Resolutionbecame known.
In the event, Congress had not passed a defiant Resolution.About a fortnight ago, Gandhi had instigated Vinoba Bhave tomake anti-war speeches. Vinoba had been arrested and sent to prison for three months.Sir Maurice Hallett, the Governor of the United Provinces,was anxious as to several speeches made by Pandit Nehru. Thesespeeches were not only anti-war, but were calculated to stir upagrarian discontent. Sir Maurice Hallett had wished to take actionagainst Nehru, and he (the Secretary of State) had authorised himto do so. Indeed, he was surprised that no news of Nehru&apos;s arresthad yet been received.In discussion, the view was expressed that if Nehru was arrested, the case for doing so should be a very strong one, and thathe should be tried in open Court. This course would be more satis-factory and effective than preventive detention or restrictedresidence under Defence Rule No. 26.The War Cabinet :-Approved the action taken by the Secretary of State forIndia, and invited him to communicate to the Viceroy thesuggestion that Nehru, if arrested, should be tried in openCourt.Parliament.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 275thConclusions,Minute 3.)Alternativeplace of meeting.8. The Lord Privy Seal said that a suggestion had been made that, in view of the negotiations between the Vichy and german governments and the Italian invasion of Greece. parliament should meet earlier than the following Tuesday.The War Cabinet, who were informed that this view was notat all widely held, agreed that there was no reason why parliament should be summoned to meet at an earlier date than had alreadybeen arranged.The Minister of Aircraft Production informed the WarCabinet that arrangements for alternative accommodation ofParliament in Church House were proceeding. He doubted whetherthe accommodation would be ready by the following Tuesday, buthoped to be able to give a definite date later in the day.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 29. 1940.
