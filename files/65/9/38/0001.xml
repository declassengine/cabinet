233W. M. 276 (40).1. The Prime Minister paid a tribute to the spirit of thePolish forces which he had visited on the previous day. Atpresent these forces numbered under 20,000, but later their numbers might be increased by volunteers from the UnitedStates. They were short of artillery, and were asking for &quot;5 howitzers. No doubt this request would be considered by theWar Office.The War Cabinet :-(1) Took note of this statement.(2) Invited the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in theabsence of the Secretary of State for War, to considerwhether 4&apos;5 howitzers could be supplied to the polish forces.Supreme WarCouncil.ProposedRevival.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 106thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. Arising out of the preceding Minute, the Prime minister suggested that a meeting of a revived Supreme War Council mightbe held in London at an early date. The Council might compriserepresentatives of Free France, Holland, Belgium, Norway,Poland and Czechoslovakia; the Dominion High Commissionersmight also be invited to attend. The meeting would thus be representative of a very large area. The Council might hearstatements from the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, and might be invited to pass resolutionsplacing on record the conviction of the Allies that no general settlement of Europe would be possible so long as large territories were constrained by violence to remain members of the German-Italian bloc. It might be arranged that meetings of the council should be held, say, once a quarter.The War Cabinet: Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit detailed pro-posals for a revival of the Supreme War council on thelines suggested.French and polish Gold.(previous references:W.M. (40) 232ndConclusions,Minute 3;   andW.M.. (40) 202ndConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The War Cabinet were informed that General Sikorskihad suggested that we might attach part of the French gold nowin Canada against the Polish gold in Bamako, which would be formally put at our disposal by the Polish Government.No progress had been made as regards the French gold in the custody of the Bank of Canada, although the Prime Minister had sent a personal telegram to Mr. Mackenzie King. It would benecessary to apply further pressure.The War Cabinet: Took note of this statement, and invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer to take up General Sikorski&apos;s suggestion.Parliament. 4.   The Secretary of State for the Home Department and MinisterProlongation of 0f Home Security reported that the assurance which he had givenParliament Bill, during the Second Reading debate on the Prolongation of Parlia-(Previous ment Bill had been well received.   This assurance had referredReference- *0 &quot; an opportunity to consider questions connected with changesW M (40) 275th ^n our electoral system,&quot; before a General Election was held, butConclusions naa- made no mention of redistribution. He had now authorisedMinute 1) &apos;      *ne Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State to indicate in debate that redistribution would not be excluded from consideration atthat time.The War Cabinet approved the Home Secretary&apos;s action.[21854-1] b 2Polish Forces inthe UnitedKingdom.(previous reference:&quot;W.M.

Iraq.Proposals forvisit of secretary ofState for War.(previous reference:W.M. (40)272ndConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Bagdad telegram No. 632, conveying a suggestion from theGovernment of Iraq that the Secretary of State for &quot;War mightvisit that country during his Middle Eastern tour.In discussion it was pointed out that the security aspect ofsuch a visit would need careful consideration, and that theextension of this visit would be inconvenient.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Foreign Secretary to decline the IraqiGovernments invitation on the grounds that the Secretaryof State for War could only be absent from this countryfor a limited time, and would have to make his report inLondon at an early date.France. 6.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to MadridRelations with telegram No. 900, reporting a conversation between Sir Samuelthe Vichy Hoare  and  the  French Ambassador at Madrid.   The   FrenchGovernment. Ambassador had spoken of the deep cleavages of opinion in the(Previous Vichy Government and of the growing resentment of the FrenchReference: people against M. Laval&apos;s attempts to make peace with Germany.W.M. (40) 273rd He had suggested that it might be prudent for us to make an conclusions, approach to General Weygand, preferably using a non-de GaulleMinute 9.) Frenchman as an intermediary.The Prime Minister said that the French were now beginning to realise that they could not make final terms with germany without surrendering Alsace-Lorraine and possibly also Nice andSavoy. Even after that surrender they would be no more thansatellites of Germany and Italy.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported a conversation which he had the previous day withM. Rougier, which indicated that M. Laval had no following inFrance, and did not possess the confidence of Marshal Petain,who, however, had found him useful. M. Rougier had suggestedthat we should employ a double line of approach to the vichy government (i) we should reassure them as to the French Empire, andindicate readiness to respect the status quo;(ii) we should be ready to agree to some relaxation of theblockade, and should  let it be known that Franceowed it to us that additional foodstuffs were becoming available to her from abroad.M. Rougier thought that General Weygand had gone to north africa to pull the place together, and that he would take the line that he was trying to hold North Africa for France against allcomers German, Italian, British, Spanish and de Ga/ulleist.Now that General Weygand had got away from the politicians,his attitude against the Germans would probably stiffen, and he might be useful to us some day.Blockade policy. The Prime Minister thought that it would be premature tomake any relaxation in our blockade of French territories. Henoticed that ships with food for France had recently passed through the Straits. He asked when we should be in a positionto re-establish our blockade. &apos; -The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet of the reasons,connected with Naval dispositions, which made it impossible toenforce our blockade in the Gibraltar area until at least 48 hoursfrom the 25th October.
U.S.S.R.(previous references:W.M. (40) 274thConclusions,Minute 3 ; andW.M. (40) 271stConclusions,Minute 4.)The baltic states:requisitioning of shipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 273rdConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that sir Stafford Cripps had now spoken to Vyshinsky on the linesauthorised by the War Cabinet on the 15th October (telegrams nos. 911-913 from Moscow). Vyshinsky had said that, in view ofthe importance of this communication, he must consult hisauthorities before commenting on it.The Foreign Secretary said that the action taken to requisi-tion the ships belonging to the Baltic States had been due to a misunderstanding in his Department. We had not actuallycountermanded this action, but we had told Sir Stafford Crippsthat we were prepared to do so if he was satisfied that the requisitioning of these ships would spoil the chances of successfulnegotiations with the U.S.S.R. Some 37,000 tons of shipping was involved. Even, however, if we could not requisition these ships,we might still obtain the use of them by some other method.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 274thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations:HomeCommands.8. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that enemy activity onthe previous day had been on a reduced scale, only 35 machinesbeing involved. One enemy aircraft had been damaged by our fighters, without loss to ourselves.The previous night only 100 German machines had been over this country, 25 having been over London. Many of these machines had flown from Norway, probably on account of.the weather beingbetter in the North than in the South.On the previous night 95 of our bombers had been despatched to attack enemy targets, which included ports, shipping, industrialplant and Berlin. Three of our bombers were missing. One whichhad come down in the sea was being searched for.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to enquire what progress had been made with experiments to enable our machines to give abetter indication of their whereabouts when they came down onthe sea.Two enemy merchant ships (of 4,000 tons and 2,000 tons) hadbeen torpedoed by our aircraft off the Dutch coast.Position in A discussion took place on the position in French WestFrench West Africa, a record of which is contained in the Secretary&apos;s StandardAfrica. Pile Gf War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet :-(a) Took note of the above statements.(b) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange, in consultationwith the War Office, for a British military representa-tive to proceed to Tangier with the object of establishingrelations with General, Weygand.(c) Invited the Dominions Secretary to inform the canadian government that they thought it would be of advantage if the Canadian representatives accredited to theBelgian, Dutch and Vichy Governments were to proceedto Vichy.(d) Invited the Foreign Secretary to furnish the dominions secretary with particulars of the points on which information from Vichy would be specially valuable.
Middle East: On the 22nd October Fort Maddalena had been attacked to egypt- create a diversion and to deny the enemy the use of the landing ground at Bir Shegga.

(40) 271stConclusions,Minute 6.)Protection of oilcisterns.9. The Prime Minister said that on his visit to Rosyth theprevious day he had observed the considerable progress made in giving concrete overhead protection to the oil storage cisterns.Approximately 160,000 tons of cement was wanted to finish thisjob. As this was rather a long-term project, he suggested that theChief of Naval Staff, on behalf of the First Lord of the Admiralty,should enquire whether its completion could not be postponed, soas to enable concrete to be spared for more urgent purposes in theimmediate future.The War Cabinet approved this suggestion.
237W. M. 276 (40).coal - 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by-Supplies for the Lord President of the Council (W.P. (G.) (40) 269), reportingLondon and the the position in regard to the transport of coal to London and theSouth. South of England.(Previous The Lord President of the Council said that as a result of airReferences: attack there had been congestion in the marshalling yards. ToW.M. (40) 268th deal with this difficulty, arrangements had been made to findConclusions, alternative consignees who would take delivery of coal which minute 11; and could not be accepted by the original consignees. Should theW.M. (40)272nd alternative consignee be unable to take delivery, the coal would be conclusions, diverted to Government dumps in the London area.Minute 4.) Another difficulty had been the blocking of the North to south communications across the Thames. It was proposed todeal with this by sending more coal by sea to South Thames andMedway ports. Additional small craft were being put into thecoal trade and the Admiralty had agreed to increase to 16 thenumber of vessels in convoys.As a long-term project steps were being taken to establishlarge dumps on the periphery of the London area, so that coalcould be brought by rail to the periphery, and delivered thence byroad transport, should the situation in the London area deterio-rate to a point at which coal could not be handled by rail inside the area.In reply to a question the Lord President said that he agreedthat more use could be made of canals ; probably another 100,000tons a year could be carried in this way.The Secretary for Mines said that 9 million tons more coal wasstocked in the country than this time last year, including 1^million more in the London area. This latter figure representedLondon&apos;s consumption for one month. The position was,however, serious from the production end. Owing to the factthat the coal could not be got away from the pits, and, to a lesser extent, to enemy interference, the rate of production was beingslowed down. Unemployment in the coal mines had also in-creased owing to the loss of foreign markets.The War Cabinet (1) Took note of the above statements and invited the lord president  of  the Council to continue to keep thismatter under review.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to press forthe fullest use to be made of canals to relieve the coaltransport situation.11.   The War Cabinet-(a) Approved in principle the proposal contained in the joint memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Secretary of State for India and theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (G) (40) 268)that a sum not exceeding , 100,000 should be provided from the Exchequer for the acquisition of a site for amosque in London.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to beresponsible for carrying this matter through and makingthe necessary public announcement.(c) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in regard to theai-rangements for the purchase and provision of thenecessary funds.The Moslems.Proposal thatHis Majesty&apos;sGovernmentshould provide a site for aMosque inLondon.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,October 24, 1940.
