Con-elusions,Minute 2.).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. - 72MOST S^EdRETqiuestect tnat special care may be taken to       COPY NO.ensure the secrecy of this document. &quot; &quot;W.M,(4Q)  219th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(5th. August,  1940,    -  11.30 a.m.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR reminded theWar Cabinet that at the meeting on&apos; the 2nd--  July(V. 11.(40) 191st,  Conclusions, Minute 2),  they had authorised action being taken to drop incendiarywafers by aircraft to fire the German crops.At the 201st. Meeting, held on 12th. July,  theWar Cabinet had been informed by the Prime minister that it was proposed that this operation shouldnot be carried out.      Further calculation had shownthat the areas which our aircraft could reach inpresent circumstances grew only a quarter of theGerman crops.      Again it had been estimated that only one-eighth of the crops in this area would beset on fire.    It had therefore been decided not toproceed with this operation for the time being.Some 15 millions of fpellets&apos; were now available in Bomber Command, and the Secretary ofState asked for directions as to how they shouldbe used, bearing in mind that their life was only about three months.    He had discussed this question with the Air Staff and had examined various alternatives,  including their use for attempting to start fires in the extensive areas of woods andforests in Germany.    It seemed unlikely, however,that the  &apos;pellets&apos;  alone would cause sufficientlyserious damage.     On the other hand, as largenumbers of them could be carried in bombing aircraft,in addition to the normal bomb load, they mighthave considerable nuisance value if employed inconjunction with normal bombing operations.YlThen the weather was dry there would be areasonable probability of a number of pellets&apos;starting fires on the extensive stretches ofheath-land and similar ground which are widespreadthroughout Western Germany.    We might thus causediversions, and add appreciably to the psychologicaleffects of our operations.     The effect of these attacks would be increased as the nights got longer,and our bombers were able to penetrate deeper into germany.In discussion some doubts were expressed as tothe military usefulness of setting heath-land on fire.      It was pointed out, however, that therewere a number of military establishments on oradjoining heath-land.     Further, these pelletscould be dropped on heath-land as part of otheroperations, and would not involve special journeys.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether the AirMinistry were in a position to employ the best method of setting fire to forests,    A method hadbeen devised whereby parachutes were caught up inthe branches of the trees, and subsequently ignited.He asked that this point should be looked into.The War Cabinet :-(1) Invited the Secretary of Statefor Air to report further on themethods available for startingfires in German forests:(2) Agreed that the Secretary of Statefor Air should have discretion toauthorise the dropping of incendiarypellets, if suitable weather conditionsoccurred in the next few weeks.Richmond Terrace, S.W.lo-2-

OPERATION The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum&quot;SCIPIO&quot;. circulated by direction of the Prime Minister,(W.P.(40) 301), and a Report by the Chiefs of Staff(W.P.(40 )  304).THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had been oneof our principal objects,  since the defection of theBordeaux Government,  to establish the rule of a FrenchGovernment friendly to His Majesty1s Government andhostile to Germany in as many parts as possible of theFrench Empire-        General de Gaulle with the free french Forces now in the United Kingdom had the sameobject and it was right that we should give themevery encouragement in carrying it out.      consideration had already been given to a number of possibilities,including projects for landing forces in Morocco,Algeria and Tunis.      Each of these projects had, after examination, been dismissed for the sufficient reason that British land forces would be required to carry itoutj     we did not wish to embark on the course of active conquest of any part of the French Empire,.A plan had then been discussed for a landingby General de Gaulle in AlgeriaD      General de gaulle had himself taken the view that a landing in one ofthe French West African possessions would offer betterprospects.     Messages which had been received from theGovernor General of Nigeria afforded some confirmation of General de Gaulle&apos;s view.     Accordingly the proposalnow before the War Cabinet had been drawn up,        Theplan was that General de Gaulle:s force should beready to sail for West Africa on 15th August.      Theywould embark in ships manned as far as possible by french crews  with a view to hoisting the Free FrenchFlag in French territory in West Africa, the occupationof Dakar, and the consolidation under the Free FrenchFlag of the French Colonies in West and equaltorial africa.Following this operation,  the nest objectivewould be to rally to the same cause the French colonies in North Africa through the intervention of elements in those Colonies ready tc continue the struggle.In this connection, immediate arrangements would be made to transport General Catroux from Indo-China to this country as quickly as possible.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 74It is requested that special care may be taken toMOST    SECRET, ensure the secrecy of this document.

If the War Cabinet approved the plan inprinciple, the first action would he to despatch toNigeria three agents (two military officers and onecivilian) selected toy General de Gaulle.      these would leave England for Accra on the following day inan Empire Plying Boat to confer with the governor general, Nigeria, and the General Officer Commanding,West Africa, and to make contact with French leaders in the French West African and Equatorial Colonies,thereafter reporting toy telegram to General de Gaulle.The intention was that only French forces should land in French West Africa.     Our part wouldtoe to equip and transport and escort those forces.The report toy the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(40) 304)analysed the problem toefore us which was that oftransporting and disembarking the forces of all arms,including guns, 13-ton tanks, Motor Transport vehicles and cased aircraft.      The only French West Africanports available for the disembarkation were Dakar,Konakri and Duala.If a decision could be taken that day it was contemplated that the time table for the expeditionmight be roughly as followsForces mobilised at Aldershot 10th AugustM/T and Store ships begin loading 11th AugustM/T and Store ships sail 13th AugustTroop ships sail 19th to23rd August.In discussion the following points weremade:-(l)    The operation under discussion was a Frenchresponsibility and it was for General de gaulle to take the operational decisions.His plans were still very fluid and much would depend upon the reports which he received from the special mission.(2)    General de Gaulle&apos;s plans were being drawnup on the assumption that he would be ableto make an unopposed landing, but there could2c no certainty that    this would be possible.From this point of view Duala seemed to bethe most hopeful port of disembarkation, andDakar the least hopeful0       Dakar hadformidable fixed defences.     A number ofFrench destroyers and submarines were inDakar Harbour, as well as the. disabled capital ship RICHELIEU.(3)   From our point of view, the possibility ofthe RICHELIEU becoming available for serviceagainst Germany was one of the attractionsof the plan.

(4)    THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIESthought that General de Gaulle ought tohave available to him, when taking his main decision, reports from the BritishGovernors in jest Africa as well as fromhis own missiono(5)    An occupation of French West Africa byGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s troops might forceGermany&apos;s hand.      It was always possiblethat the Germans might make an attempt onWest ^-frica;    and news of a success byGeneral de Gaulle might tip the scale.Were we ready with plans for turning theGermans out again if they sent an expeditionto West Africa?     Had we a force availablefor the purpose.(6)    A German attempt on Y/est Africa would haveto be air-borne, and would presumablyinvolve the prior occupation of both spain and Moroccoo      This rather increased the likelihood of a German invasion of Spain.(7) If the Germans made an attempt on WestAfrica they would find it difficult tomaintain their forces.(8)    THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed outthat we should be providing the naval escort,and we should be committed to action too operations at sea if French war ships should attempt to stop the expedition.      In view ofcertain other impending operations it mightbe difficult for the Admiralty to furnish asufficient escort.(9)    THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, with these operations in mind, he had withdrawn from theFrench Embassy in London the right tocommunicate in cypher with Vichy.     We were on strong ground in denying this facilityto the French;    its continuance could only he justified if we had representatives at 1Vichy in possession of similar facilities.(ID)    It was of the utmost importance to conduct the preparations for the expedition insecrecy.(11)   The Foreign Secretary said that M. Cambonthought it would have an exhilarating effectif it ^otild be arranged for some french troops to fight Italians.      This, however,meant sending French troops round the Gapeto Egypt.      In the circumstances, thiswas impracticableo(12)    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs referred to General Smuts&apos; interest inAfrican problems and asked whether he shouldbe informed of the position^

THE PRIME MINISTER thought that he shouldnot ho told until the position was a gooddeal clarified,(15)    THE FIRST SEA LORD said that a look-outwas being kept on the West African route for the French ship TOUAREG, which was reported to be carrying emissaries of the vichy Government to the French Gameroons.These might include a new Governor for theFrench Gameroons.      His Majesty&apos;s ships hadorders to intercept this vessel and to bringherminto Lagos, but not to take off any ofthe personnel on board.What action should we take if the ship wasescorted by French Naval vessels?THE PRIME MINISTER thought that General de gaulle should be consulted as to the actionto be taken in regard to the TOUAREG.; Meanwhile, the orders should be that, while  action should be taken to overawe any vessel,rxtt ;  escorting the TOUAREG, fire should not beI opened for the purpose of intercepting the! vessel.The War Cabinet:-(1) Agreed in principle that operation&quot;SGIPIO&quot; should be carried out.(S) Gave instructions that all preparations for the operation should be pressed forward by the Departments concerned.(3) Deferred a decision as to details ofthe operation until additional information was available.(4) Instructed Major-General Ismay toascertain how much importance general de Gaulle attached to the interception of the French ship TOUAREG.(5) Authorised the First Lord of theAdmiralty to issue instructions inthe meantime as at &quot;X&quot;.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
