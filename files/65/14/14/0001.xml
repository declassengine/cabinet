(40) 801stConclusions,Minute 1.)Discussion took place on the procedure adopted in regard to correspondence between theSecretary of State for Indie and the Viceroy whichthe War Cabinet of the.-;(4c; 176.had preceded the submission to draft Declaration appended tormjs PRIME MINISTER said that, in his opinion,!the proposals which the Secretary of State for Indiehai put forward represented so Important a departure from previous\?b policy that the Uar Cabinet should havebeen informed of the natter earlier.     lie thought that jthe Secretary of State would have been right to have consulted the War Cabinet before he ha   developed hisideas to the Viceroy.In consequence of telegrams from thesecretary or *tate of the 2nd, 16th and 17th June, theviceroy hau been under the impression that the viewsput forward by the Secretary of State had in factreceived the approval of the War Cabinet.Furthermore, he thought that the Var cabinet had cause for complaint in that, at their Meeting onthe 12th July (V:-.M. (40 ) 201st Conclusions, Minute 1),they had not been informed   f the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Viceroy in theperiod let to 22nd June, now circulated under cover of (40) 272.     As a result, the S?ar Cabinet hadbeen under the impression that the proposals which theyhad considered at that Meeting had been made on theViceroy&apos;a own initiative.     In ef ect, those proposals had only been made by the Viceroy after considerablepersuasion had been exercised upon him by the Secretaryof state.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOB INDIA said that hemuch regretted the misunderstanding which had occurred.In his Minute of the 19th July (Enclosure 3 toft.P. (40) 272) he had drawn attention to the variousprecautions which he had taken to make it  dear to theViceroy that his approach had been of a personal endexploratory character.     It was, he thought, thenormal end proper procedure that a secretary of statefor India should communicate his personal views to theViceroy and try to come to a general agreement with himbefore approaching the Cabinet.     It had not occurred to  him at the time that the Viceroy could look upon hispreliminary exchange of views with him in any otherlight,   his colleagues would have noticed that in his telegram Mo,754, of the 17th June, he had dropped

TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST    SECRET,COPY NO.W.M.(40)  212th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(25th July, 1940 - 11.30 a.m.)FRANCE.French north african Colonies^THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had raised with the Foreign Secretary the previous day theimportance of the North African coast line to us ifwe could only get a footing there.       To obtain thisshould not be beyond the bounds of possibility.      Itwas already clear from recent telegrams that the vichy government was not popular in Prance and he (the PrimeMinister) was considering the possibility of promoting a kind of collusive conspiracy in the Vichy Governmentwhereby certain members of it might levant to north africa.      It might be possible to negotiate with sucha Government to allow food, of which there was a great,scarcity, in to Prance on condition that the FrenchGovernment in North Africa continued the war.     Perhapsan approach to Marshal Weygand might be made as a first step in this direction.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thathe thought any approach to Marshal Weygand would beunsuccessful,  though there might possibly be a chanceof detaching a French politician for the purpose thePrime Minister had in view.     He considered, however,that the possibility of sending General de Gaulle to north Africa to raise his flag there was worth considering.      It would give de Gaulle the opportunity,which he had not yet had, of making a reputation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had consulted Sir Ronald Campbell on theidea of forming a French Government in North Africa.Sir Ronald took the view that no French politician would leave unoccupied France until some event had occurredwhich would give them more confidence.     Sir Ronaldconsidered that Marshal Weygand would not be an appropriateperson to approach, though there might be Frenchpoliticians who could be approached with advantage ata later date.THE PRIME MINISTER said he was seeing general de Gaulle that day and would sound him as to thepossibility of his forming a rallying point in north africa.     In the meantime, he would be glad if hiscolleagues would watch events, with a view to theformation of a French Government in North Africa.Richmond Terrace, SJ.1,
