MOST SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested thai special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.be.M.(40)  209TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.(22nd July, 1940 - 11.  30 a.m. )RTUGAL.jatic Islands.reviouserence:(40) 149thlusions,nut e 10 ).The War Cabinet had before them a report bythe Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(40) 265).In the course of discussion the followingpoints were made:-1.      The force earmarked for these operationsconsisted of two composite brigades, made up from four Royal Marine battalions, oneArmy battalion and attached troops.    Theforce had been concentrated at Plymouth and could be used for Home Defence purposes inthe event of an invasion of this countrytaking place.    Shipping had been taken up and stores had either been loaded or moved to Liverpool,  from which port it was intended that the expeditions should sail.The expeditions were at 48 hours&apos; noticetotil.2.      The brigades were fully equipped for theroles assigned to them.    Their Commandershad been informed of their probable task and had been instructed to prepare detailed plans,3.      Orders to move would not he given to theexpeditions without a further decision by theWar Cabinet,,    For the moment the WarCabinet were invited to give coveringapproval to the preparations which hadbeen made,and to approve in principle therecommendations of the Chiefs of Staff asto the conditions in which we should seize the Cape Verde Islands and the Azores,4.      These conditions, as set out in paragraph12 of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff(Wo P.(40) 265) were:-&quot;(i) In the event of Spanish or Portuguesehostility.(ii) When it became clear beyondreasonable doubt that either of these powers intended to intervene against us.(iii) If the exercise of economic pressure by control at source or control ofshipping failed to achieve adequateresults and we had to rely moreupon direct naval action.&quot;

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs pointed out that condition (iii) was difficult to reconcile with paragraph 2(j)of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the implications of French Hostility (W.P.(40)256)(see Minute 8) On the hypothesisof Gibraltar becoming unusable as a resultof enemy action from French bases in north Africa, that paragraph laid it down that it would not be to our advantage to precipitate Spanish and Portuguese hostilityby occupying the Cape Verde Islands andthe Azores, unless there were clearindications that Spain intended to enter the war against us.It was explained that conditions (i),  (ii)and (iii) were intended as alternatives,anyone of which would justify the seizure of the IslandscThe general view of the War Cabinet wasthat reasons of economic pressure(alternative (iii)) would not in them-selves provide sufficient justification for seizing the Cape Verde Islands andthe Azores.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theChiefs of Staff had examined the problemof maintaining our forces in the Islands,in the face of enemy air action based on french North Africa,      Their conclusion was that our forces should be able tomaintain themselveso      The Azores were some 700 miles from the mainland of Africa.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs reminded the War Cabinet that the Governmentsof South Africa and Southern Rhodesia had prepared plans for the capture of Mozambique,including the Beira railway^      General smuts had pointed out that action against the cape Verde Islands and the Azores mightforce the hands of the Governments of SouthAfrica and Southern Rhodesia into talcingaction agains&quot;t this railwaya      Moreover,in these circumstances surprise would be lost and these operations would becomemuch more difficult.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that general smuts&apos; anxiety was premature.      In thefirst place, the Atlantic Islands projectsrelated to a situation which might neverdevelop.       In the second place, further decisions by the War Cabinet would berequired before our expeditions were givenorders to sail.      We should certainly takeGeneral Smuts into consultation at that

stageo      Thirdly,  it by no means followed that we should at once be in a state of warwith Portugal as a result of our actionagainst the Atlantic Islandso     Portugalmight conceivably accept the situation underprotesto     In any event, it would benecessary to wait a few days, in order tosee how the situation developed, beforeencouraging General Smuts to take action inSouth East Africao9.      THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thoughtthat the knowledge that it might be in our power to take action against Mozambiquemight be a powerful inducement to Portugalnot to declare war on usrTHB War Cabinet:-(i) Approved in principle,  subject to&apos;X&apos;  above, the Chiefs of Staffrecommendations as to theconditions in which we should seize the Cape Verde Islands and the azores 0(ii) Gave covering approval to the preparations already made.(iii)  Invited the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to inform general Smuts of the gist of theplan, making it clear to him thatthe plan was of a contingent nature and that a further War cabinet decision would be required before it could be put into action.      Itshould be explained to general smuts that the action contemplated would not necessarily involve warwith Portugal.(iv) Took note of the amendments to theChiefs of Staff Report (W.P.(40)265)set out in the Appendix to this annex,Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.

Paragraph 10E1. Delete and substitute:-&quot;Naval patrols have already boon established, and willbe maintained as far as possible,  in the neigh-bourhood of the Portuguese Atlantic Islands toprevent enemy forces forestalling us there, but these patrols cannot prevent the Portuguesereinforcing them in existing circumstances,should they desire to do so.     We consider theforces shown in paragraph 9(c) and (f) are sufficient to capture the Islands againstopposition by the forces at present locatedthere.      Should the garrison bo reinforced,however, it may be necessary to increase these forces.&quot;.Paragraph 11.2. Delete paragraph 11(c) and substitute:-&quot;(c) The expeditions are at 48 hours notice tosail.&quot;Annex III - Parts 1 and 2, paragraph-phs 703. Delete paragraphs 7 on both the Parts of this annex and substitute in each case the following:-&quot;It is hoped that, unless enemy forces have adreadysucceeded in establishing themselves, thelocal authorities may submit to the occupationof the islands by British forces withoutresistance.      This is dependent on the politicalsituation at the timooIn planning the combined operation however you areto anticipate opposition and should aim atseizing the key points by surprise.     As soonas key points have been seized it will thenbe clearly desirable for you to gain touch withthe authorities with a view to limiting as faras possible the continuance of armed resistance,if any.&quot;AMENDMENTS TO W.P.(4&quot;Q 265 (Also Pirper No. C.C*.S.(40) 551).
