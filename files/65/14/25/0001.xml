MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(26th August, 1940 - 12.30 p. in.)MILITARY situation the MIDDLE EAST.Indications of animpending Italianoffensive against egypt.(previous reference:r.M. (40)233rdConclusions,Minute 3).Despatch of tankunits to Egypt.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that the Coraraanders-in-Chief in the MiddleE^sLhad Emitted two telegrams on the questionswhether a large scale Italian offensive against egypt was impending, and whether the armoured brigade should proceed via the Mediterranean or via the Cape      P/16981 and 0/17395   7    Day reconnaissanesover Bardia, Tohruk, Derna and Benghazi, had reportedno sign of imminent attack.     Night reconnaissancehad reported no abnormal movement in the areaBardia - Tobruk - Derna.Interrogation of the prisoners capturedat Fort Capuzzo on the night of 23rd/24th Augusthad confirmed that the Italian attitude in this area appeared to be defensive rather than offensive.A submarine patrolling from 5th August to 18th Augustoff Benghazi had seen ro &quot;transport movements.The conclusion of the Commanders-in-Ohiefwas that there were no local signs of any impendingoffensive.     Neither the quantily of dumps andtransport in the forward area nor reconnaissanceactivity in the air or on the ground seemed toindicate any intention of large-scale attack.     Unlessthe enemy had concealed his troops and preparationswith remarkable skill it did not appear that he couldbe ready for a large-scale offensive without at leastseveral weeks preparations.     On the other hand our intelligence was defective.     While it was certainthat transports with reinforcements had reachedLibya during the last two months, we had no idea oftheir extent or nature.The considered opinion of the threeCommanders-in-Chief was that on the whole the riskinvolved in sending our tank units through theMediterranean outweighed the risk of the Italiansmaking their main attack before the longer distanceround the Cape could be travelled.If the tank units proceeded through theMediterranean they would arrive at Alexandria aboutthe 5th September;   if via the Cape, they would arrive at Suez some nineteen days later, say on24th September.     There seemed to be no way orreducing the margin below nineteen days.     The marginwould have been greater if there had not been special instructions to the convoy to eliminate all possiblecauses of delay, for example, in re-fuelling.

In reply to a question, the Chief of theImperial General Staff said that it was possible thatthe Italian formations on the frontier might hecovering a secret concentration of mobile troopsbehind, and were purposely remaining inactive till the attack was ready for launching.     But recent air reconnaissance and other information gave no evidenceof this, and it did not seem probable.On the whole an attack in force appearedunlikely for the next three or four weeks but the enemy,with his present force on the frontier, could at anytime drive in our small covering force and occupySo Hum.There was no indication of any Germanformations having arrived in Libya.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that theWar Cabinet ought not to take the responsibility ofover-ruling the judgment of the Commanders on the spot that the tank reinforcements should make the longer voyage by the Cape.Nevertheless he acquiesced in this decisions with regret, since in his judgment the dangers of sending the tank units through the Mediterranean had beenexaggerated.   /&quot;)n the other hand, under these arrange-ments the VALIANT would be able to deliver her cargo of guns at Malta.JThe War Cabinet:(i) noted that in the view of the three.Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East,Uie Italian attitude and dispositions ontne Western Frontier of Egyptremained mainly defensive;   and thatin their considered opinion the riskinvolved in sending the armoured brigade through the Mediterraneanoutweighed the risk of the enemymaking his main attack before the armoured Brigade arrived in egypt and could be deployed,(ii) decided accordingly that the armoured brigade should proceed to Suez via the Cape.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.
