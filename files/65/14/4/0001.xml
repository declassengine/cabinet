(40)  195rd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 8,Confidential Annex.(4th July, 1940 - 11.30 a,m.)FRANCE.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M.  (40) 192ndConclusions,:Minute 5.)Vi/esternMediterranean.eastern mediterranean,,THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF gave thefollowing information to supplement that containedin Cabinet War Room Record No. 305.      The Frenchbattle-cruiser DUNKERQUE which had escaped undamagedfrom Oran had been subsequently attacked by torpedo bombers which had claimed one hit,  thereby reducingthe speed of the ship.      In reply to an Admiraltysignal ordering him to engage this battle-cruiser,Admiral Somerville had replied he was unable to doso and that, in view of the situation, he was with-drawing westwards and would send a full report on arrival at Gibraltar.,A 6&apos;ignal had been received early that morning that weather conditions were unsuitable foran air attack on ships at Oran and that he was on his way back to Gibraltar,,     He was expected to arrivethere about 400 p.m0 that afternoon.No reports had yet been received of the damage sustained by our forces, but in view of thefact that they had spent the night cruising aboutat 16 knots,  serious damage could not have beeninflicted0     No encounters had been made with theFrench Naval Forces despatched from Toulon andAlgiers.The position at Alexandria remained un-ss.tisfactc?y, since on receipt of the news from OranAdmiral Godfroy had declined to continue negotiations and had discontinued the process of discharging fuel oil.Admiral Cunningham had been faced with three alt international ives ; -(a) To send boarding parties to capture theships.(b) To sink the ships at their moorings.(c) To demand that Admiral Godfroy should either surrender his ships or submit themto internment;    failing which the ships would be sunk.Admiral Cunningham had rejected courses (a)and (b) as the French Forces would be on the alertand the sinking of the French ships at their moorings

would interfere with traffic in the port and wouldprobably result in a battle in Alexandria harbour.    Itwas of vital importance to avoid such a battle for thefollowing reasons:-(i)   It would be difficult to repair any damagesustained by our ships as facilities in theEastern Mediterranean were inadequate.(ii)   Great damage would probably be caused tooil tanks and other installations on shoreand burning oil would probably flow intothe harbour.(iii)   The usefulness of Alexandria as a Fleetbase would thereby become seriously reduced.We were not in a position at Alexandria totake the strong line of action that we had taken atOran.      In consequence,  a signal had been sent to admiral Cunningham suggesting that the British ships should be taken to sea and an ultimatum should thenbe presented to Admiral Godfroy, or, alternatively, and provided that the French ships were believed to be short of food and water, an effort might be made to starvethem into surrender.      On no account should the riskbe taken of a battle inside the harbour.     No reply had yet been received to this last signal.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a quick solutionof the problem must be reached.     It was most important for the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet to regain itsmobility and the spectacle of a deadlock in the harbourwould do great harm to Egyptian opinion.     For these reasons he deprecated the suggestion to starve out theFrench ForceSoTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that heshared the misgivings expressed by the First Sea Lordon the prospect of a battle in Alexandria Harbour, and hoped that no hasty decision would be taken likely to precipitate such an event.THE PRIME MINISTER said that no decision couldbe taken until an answer had been received to the latestAdmiralty signal.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF then raised thequestion of what action should now be taken by british forces if they encountered units of the French Fleet.The French Government had issued orders that all british ships and aircraft were forbidden to approachwithin 20 sea miles of any French harbours under penaltyof being fired on without warning.     Was it our intentionto impose a similar 20-mile limit and should all french naval Forces now be assumed as hostile and be engagedat sight?After some discussion, the view was taken thatthe course to be adopted in all circumstances where theavailable British Forces were considered strong enough,should be the same as that adopted at Oran.      It wastill our object to prevent units of the French Fleetfalling into German hands and to do so,  if possible,without bloodshed.

The War Cabinet(a) Took note of the above statements.(b) Agreed that when French naval forces were encountered on thehigh seas, the course of actionto be adopted should be as follows(i)    Signal to &quot;heave-to&quot;.(ii) Offer the ships the same terms as were offered tothe French Admiral at Oran.(iii)    If the signal to &quot;heave-to&quot;or the terms offered werenot complied with, action should be taken to obtainpossession of the ships or,if necessary,  to sink them.(c) Agreed that instructions shouldbe sent to the Commanders ofdefended ports on the lines of(b), but subject to such modification as might be necessaryRichmond Terrace,  S.W. 13
