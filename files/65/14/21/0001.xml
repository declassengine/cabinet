IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEF? UNDER LOCK AND FRY.It is requester? that special cere may betaken to ensure the secrecy of this doeu-ment.COPY No.2W.M *  (40)  225th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.(13th August, 1940, 12 Noon.)&quot; THE PRIME MINISTER sain that the plans in regard toGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s movements had now been changed.   Theoriginal plan had been that General fle Gaulle should landeither at Duala, or at Freetown or Conakry, and from thereshould make his way inland by the railway and approachDakar from the land side.    This, however, would take avery lonp time to accomplish.   Opinion had come round tothe view &quot;that it was essential to take quicker action.It would be an immense advantage to get General de Gaullefirmly installed on French territory.The question had been discussed at length with theChiefs of Staff, and agreement had been reached on a drastic change of plan.    It was now proposed to establishGeneral de Gaulle at Dakar by a coup de main.This plan was based on the fact that there were only 2,500 Senegalese troops in Dakar.   There were perhaps200 French Officers.   He proposed to put in two Brigsdesof well-trained troops (the 101st and 102nd Royal MarineBrigades) assisted by two independent Companies.   A plan had been made, and it had been put to General de Gaulleby. the Chiefs of Staff.   General de Gaulle had said thatthe plan was a good one and that he agreed with it;    buthe had stipulated that some of the Foreign Legion should accompany each of the landing parties. Every endeavourwould be made to secure the place without bloodshed, onthe plea that an Allied force had come to prevent theGermans seizing Dakar, and to bring succour and help tothe Colony.   Aircraft would fly over and drop suitablemessages promising food and freedom.Before leaving, General de Gaulle would make aseries of gramophone records which could be broadcast,disguising the fact that he had left this country.   Theforces which we sent would be sufficient to overcome thegarrison if it came to a fight.   The %vhole operation mustbe completed between dawn and dusk.   General Irwin would command the land forces, and Admiral Cunningham the Fleet.Once General de Gaulle&apos;s force had been successfullyinstalled, our forces would withdraw.What action would the Vichy Government take?It might be that they would declare war.    It would notperhaps matter very much if they did:    but, on the whole,it was unlikely that they would do so.    General de Gaullesaid that no doubt the Germans could tos^xfex make the vichy government declare vary this would involve giving Francea greater degree of coherence thai the Germans&apos;&quot; wished.Their intention was to break up France.

MOST SECRET.THE MIDDLE EAST,The Militarysituation,(previous reference:W.M. (40) 222ndConclusions,Minute 10. )anstire the secrecy of this document.W.M.(40) 225th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.(r-5$b   August, 1940 - 12 Noon).THE PRIME MINISTER gave his colleagues an account of his discussions with General. Wavell,    now that we were so much strongers he thought that wecould spare an armoured brigade from this country.He had asked the Pirt Sea Lord if he could pass 2armoured regiments (i.e. a light tank battalion anda cruiser tank battalion through the Mediterraneanon two fast motor transport ships, in conjunctionwith Operation &quot;Hats&quot;,The Prime Minister said that, later hehad thought it would be a pity not to send a thirdarmoured regiment of infantry tanks.    He had asked the Chiefs of Staff to look into the matter, but theyhad thought that it was too risky to send M.T.ships through the Mediterranean, and proposed thatthe force should go round the Cape.    He was now trying to persuade them to change their view on this matter.The Prime Minister said that he had taken a great liking to General Wavell,,    In Somaliland weshould stay on and fight it out, and a Brigade wasbeing sent there as reinforcement.In Kenya we had 6 Battalions of K.A.R,6 3attalions from West Africa and a Brigade from theUnion,     These forces were not all required in Kenyaat the present time, as no active operations could be started from Kenya into Abyssinia for some months.He thought that we should move a West African Brigadeto Khartoum.     He would also like to see the SouthAfrican troops moved up to the Canal zone.    Theessential point was to make Egypt secure, and, if need be, we could run a risk in Kenya.In Palestine we had 6 Regular infantry battalions, 11 Yeomanry or Cavalry Regiments, and13,000 Australian troops.       It was true that 2 Brigadesof this force were earmarked as a reinforcement for egypt, but he thought thatalarge force could be madeavailable from Palestine for service in Egypt.     At thepresent time we had 4 Regular Battalions at mersa matruh, and 7 Battalions on the Canal and for internal security.      The Union troops, if sent to the Canal, couldrelieve these 7 Battalions for service on the Westernfrontier.Generally, the Prime Minister thought that onthe present lay-out we might find ourselves in serious difficulties in the Middle East.     In the meanwhile,steps were being taken&apos;to accelerate the move of an indian Division to Egypt, while further artillery wasbeing sent to Somaliland, together with the BikanirCamel Corps.TO EE KEPT 1JNDER L.OCJKAND KEY. - f gIt is requested thai special care may betaken toCOPY NO.  1

The Prime Minister gave details of the anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns which werebeing sent out to the Middle East.     Regular batchesof aircraft of modern types were also being sentoutn     We had fine pilots in the Middle East, atpresent operating with obsolete machines,,     As thesupply of machines in this country had at presentoutstripped the supply of trained pilots, it was clearly right to send modern machines to theMiddle EastaThe War Cabinet took note of this statementoRichmond Terrace, S0Wel0
