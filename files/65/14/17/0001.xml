MOST    SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.W.M.(40)  216th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(31st July, 1940 - 12.30 p.m.)MILITARYOPERATIONS.Middle East.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 213thConclusions,Minute 1, )THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR read to theWar Cabinet a telegram from General Wavell, the effectof which was that the Italians had now concentrateda considerable force opposite Sollum, which we onlyheld lightly.      General Wavell thought that an attackmight now be imminent, and that it was too risky tocontinue to hold Sollum and to run the risk of losingthe mobile forces now holding the position.     Thepolicy which we had adopted had shown a good dividendto date.     Our losses on this front from the 10thJune to the 29th July had amounted to:-24 killed and missing.10 wounded.5 light tanks.5 armoured cars.The enemy had lost at least: -25 killed25 wounded472 prisoners12 tanks62 motor transport vehicles16 guns.In General Wavell1s view, however, the lack of equipment in the Middle East now necessitated a withdrawal.      General Wavell also urged that thereshould be no delay in meeting Middle East requirementsof equipment and ammunition.The Secretary of State for War said that some additional supplies of ammunition had already beensent out to the Middle East, and a further convoy was leaving in a few days.     He was taking all stepspossible -to ensure that some armoured cars and spareswould be sent out in this convoy.Sollum was itself of no importance, and itwas no new departure to suggest that we should not attempt to put up a strong resistance on the frontieritself.     Our forces would only retire a short distance, to Sidi Barrani.     A withdrawal from Sollummight, however, have unfortunate consequences fromthe point of view of prestige.

The view was expressed that it was of theutmost importance that, if we withdrew from Sollum,this should he represented as part of a well-considered and previously prepared plan.      It wouldhe important, too, to make clear that the policy whichwe had adopted had hitherto shown a good dividend.As regards sending out further equipment tothe Middle East, the Secretary of State for Warthought that it was impossible at the present timeto spare any considerable reinforcement in the wayof tanks, etc.       We might be able to spare something in a few weeks&apos;  time, but if we were to ensure thatit reached the Middle East early enough to be of effective use    (i.e. by the end of September),   we might have to take the risk of sending it throughthe Mediterranean.The War Cabinet took note ofthis statement.errace, S.W.1.
