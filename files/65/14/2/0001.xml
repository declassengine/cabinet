OW.M,  (40) 191st CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(2nd July, 1940 - 12 Noon.)OPERATION THE CHIEF OP THE AIR STAFF described the&quot;RAZZLE^o     preparations that had been made to drop incendiary wafersfrom aircraft to fire the German cropsc    Some 9,000,000of these wafers would be ready by the 9th July, and theycould be produced after that date at the rate of 7,000,000a week.    Trials with these wafers had been very successful.Owing to the earliness of the season,  it was expected thatthe crops would be in a suitable condition for firing anyday from the 12th July onwards.    The problem had been studiedvery carefully., and it was &quot;believed that the German corncrops would be very vulnerable to this form of attack owingto the large areas under corn unbroken by hedges or ditches.The possibility of making similar attacks on the Italiancrops in Campagna was also being examined.    The corndistricts in East Prussia were, however, out of range.    Itwould be essential to carry out the attacks on a very large scale, using all available aircraft.In discussion, the following points were made:-(i) In this country, owing to the heavy dews,our crops would only be susceptible to this form of attack, either in spells of verydry weather or in the late afternoons.Further, our fields were more broken up.The Minister of Agriculture favoured the idea.(ii) In principle, such attacks were merely anextension of the blockade designed to cutoff Germany&apos;s food supplies.(iii) Expert opinion was that there would bea corn famine in all European countrieswhich could not import cereals,(iv) The reactions on United States opinionwere not at all likely to be unfavourable.It was only inaction on our part which the americans were unable to understand.The War Cabinet:-Authorised the Chief of the Air Staff tocarry out Operation &quot;Razzle&quot; as and whentactical and other conditions permitted.Richmond Terrace, ScWolo
