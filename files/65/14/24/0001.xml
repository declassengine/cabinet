The directive alsoemphasised the importance of subordinating the politicalto the strategic situation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that an australian and New Zealand Army Corps was being created in the Western Desert.

(5)    The part of the Australian Division now inthxs country (some 9,000 men) and the partof the New Zealand Division now in this,country (some 7,000 men) were also due to goto the Middle East, leaving some time thefollowing months     This contingent would heaccompanied by certain Corps troops0(6)    A decision would have to be taken at some date as to whether and if so when the rest of theFirst Armoured Division was to be sent to theMiddle EastD(7)    The following material was being sent out atthe same time as the Tank units referred toin paragraph (4) above48 2-pdr, anti-tank gunse20 Bofors guns0500 Bren guns0250 Anti-tank riflesc48 25-pdrs050,000 anti-tank mines0X million rounds tracer S0 A.

Further the   &apos; VALIANTmight be prevented from delivering vital equipment axMalta necessary for Malta&apos;s protection,     It was aquestion of balancing risks and it might be that by thei6th August conditions in Egypt would be such that therisk of sending this unit through the Mediterranean wouldhave to be run,

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs asked whether it would he possible for the WarCabinet to be informed of the nature of the risks to be run in order that they could weigh thepros and cons of the case.Mt* cLc^   a VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that&apos; **** r:5-risks from enemy surface vesselsTyras oilmoct, y ,ts       -nil    but the convoy would have to pass throughL*ij narrow Malta channel where the danger of$ L** oi attack from submarines was considerablec     Further,k*&amp;c-&amp;cnr^ in the Mediterranean the Italians had a very goodc^eu^jL,-   reconnaissance service and would be aware of what)   we were doing.     There was also a danger fromnight attack.     The Italians had a number of E-boatsavailable, to which we had no counter.     Finally,there was the mine danger.     There was no part of the malta Channel which could not be mined, and itwas believed that the Italians had developed atype of mine which was effective in deep wateroAs an instance of this, one of the four destroyersthen on their way to Gibraltar had been mined in90 fathomso     As for the air risky this was not muchgreater in the Malta Channel than elsewhere^     if one of the ships was hit, it would not be possibleto wait in order to try and save the material on boardsThe ship would have to be sunk, and the equipmenton board would be lost.     The remainder of the convoywould have to proceeds     Altogether, he was of theopinion that there was considerable risk that if thisJUs&apos;,   mrf        donvoy was sent through the Mediterranean some of the*wij /&apos;  */0**^   ships might be lost;    the risk of loss being perhapsVjtTy some 20 to 25 per cent,AjEeaiier. fchnaugb        Ma4&amp;fceggafteag&apos; than round tag CagjhoTk***. . THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs asked if the War Office had any information as to how soon an Italian attack on Egypt might be heguja-vHe had received an impression from General Wavellthat, provided Italian forces only were engaged, hewas not too unhappy about the pc -.ition, but, in theevent of the attack being reinforced by a german armoured division, he understood from General Wavellthat he would regard the position as serious.THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERALSTAFF said it was obvious that the Italians must take some action shortly.     If the Germans intendedto send an armoured division to Libya, he hoped thatwe should get some inkling of their intentions.But it was possible that a German armoured divisionmight be there already a     Sir Percy Lorraine had informed him that a German division had been inNorthern Italy before he (Sir Percy) had left RomeoReconnaissance showed that the Italians had not carriedon with the water pipe-line, and he thought that thiswould be necessary to them if they proposed to use twomechanised divisions and ancillary troops in the attacks in reply to a question regarding the conditionof the Egyptian army, General Haining said that,although it was well equipped? the officers were somewhat unreliable and constant changes were beingmade in the higher Commando     He thought the armyrefleotedi fcJie attitude of Egypt itself;    theywere not sure of themselveso

IllAs regards (5) THE PRIME MINISTER saidthat he was very much in favour of the Australiansand New Zealanders in this country joining theircompatriots in Egypt, and thought they could wellhe   spared from this country, in view of the increasingimprovement of our defensive position at home.TH&amp;i Pafcfito. Minister said that it was nothis intention to take up with General Smuts thematter dealt with in Paragraph 4 of the GeneralDirective (the move of the South African Brigade,or a large part of it, to Egypt) until we hadreceived General Wavell&apos;s further observations onthe military situation in the Middle East.The War Cabinet took the view that the directive showed that the maximum possible wasbeing done to reinforce Egypt both with men and with supplies.     Considering the blow which we had suffered by the defection of the French, and thedanger of invasion in which we still stood, thedespatch to the Middle East of forces of the orders et  out in the General Directive would representa remarkable achievementoThe War Cabinet:Approved the General Directive tothe Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,circulated under cover of W.P.(40)330.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.
