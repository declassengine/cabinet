MINUTE 5,Confidential Annex.(13th July,  1940 - 10.0 a.me)BELGIAN and polish GOLD.(previous reference:ff.M.  (40)  200thConclusions,Minute 6,)THE PERMANENT UNDER-SECRETARY   OP STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS said that it had been ascertained thatthere had been a representative of the Bank of Polandbut no Belgian representative on the French armed merchant Cruiser which had taken the Belgian and Polishgold to Dakar.As regards the Belgian gold,  it was proposedthat one of the three Belgian officials who had authority to deal with the gold should proceed by flying-boat to Lisbon and thence to Dakar.     He should then ask that the gold should be handed over to him,and would inform the French authorities that he proposedto take it to the Belgian Congo.     In fact he proposedto take the gold to South Africa.As regards the Polish gold, the French had suggested that they should keep the Polish gold theyhad at Dakar,  and should transfer to the Polish account a corresponding amount of the French gold now in Canada.The Treasury, who had been consulted, said that thiswas inacceptable, as the French gold now in Canada wasblocked.     The right course was, therefore,  to tell the Polish Government that they should continue to urge the French to release the Polish gold at Dakar,The War Gabinet agreed with thissuggestion.Richmond Terrace, SoWola
