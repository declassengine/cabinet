COPY NO.    ../ uW.M.(40)  192ND CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.,(3rd July, 1940 - 11.30 a.m.)THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the bombingwhich had been carried out on the previous day againstoil refineries, aerodromes and marshalling-yards inGermany.     He said that there was a growing feeling that now that an attempt to invade this country mightbe imminent, our attacks should be directed against german ports.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that it hadbeen generally acknowledged that invasion could onlypresent a serious danger if the Royal Air Force had first been defeated.      This defeat could only takeplace at the hands of the German Air Force, and the attacks which were being made on oil refineries, air-craft factories and aerodromes in Germany aimed atreducing the scale of air attack on this country.At the same time, there would be no hesitation in givingfull priority to the attack of any assembly of trans-ports which might be reported.THE PRIME MINISTER appreciated the reasonsfor attacking objectives which would cripple theGerman Air Force, but considered that the comingweek might well be so critical from the point of viewof invasion that it justified transferring emphasisto the bombing of German ports.The War Cabinet agreed:-That the emphasis during the comingweek in bombing operations by theRoyal Air Force should be placedon harbours in which there were large accumulations of shipping.THE air situation.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 19istConclusions,Minute 1.)Choice of airobjectives.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.

(40) 192nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(3rd July, 1940 - 11.30 a.m.)COPY NO.PRANCE:The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 191stConclusions,Minute 12.)French ships at Portsmouth.Grant ofBritishNationalityto Frenchsailors.French ships at plymouth,THE FIRST SEA LORD informed the YUar cabinet of the progress of the operations in regard to the french fleet.The following were the main points dealt within the First Sea Lord&apos;s statement and in the subsequentdiscussioni-(l) The French ships at Portsmouth had been taken over without bloodshed.    The French sailorshad accepted the position cheerfully.    their officers had been sullen and had all said thatthey would carry out the instructions of theirAdmiral.      It was not clear what those instructionswould be, since their Admiral was in London.(2) A good many of the French sailors at Portsmouthhad informed the British Officers who were taking over their ships that they wished to becomeBritish subjects and to continue the fight onour side.It was suggested in discussion that it might be enough to offer these sailors British citizenshipif they served us well and still wished on theconclusion of the war to become British subjects.It was pointed out, however, that this would notsafeguard their position, and the general view was that the men&apos;s wishes should be granted.(3) The taking over of the French warships at Plymouthhad resulted in a few casualties, the SURCOUF^having offered resistance.    One British leadingseaman and one French officer had been killed.The Mediterranean.French warshipsat Oran.(4) A definite answer to our demands was expected from the French Admiral at 12. noon that day.Arrangements were being made for the French warships to return to Alexandria with skeletoncrews.(5) The War Cabinet were informed that H.M.S. FOXHOUNDhad arrived off Oran early that morning, butCaptain Holland had reported that the french admiral had refused to see him.    A letter had therefore been handed in,  setting out the terms offered.

The- War Cabinet were reminded that theinstructions issued had been that demilitarisationshould not figure among the alternatives offered,but might be accepted, subject to certain conditions, if volunteered by the French..    Thequestion arose whether a signal should now besent instructing our representative to includeamong the alternatives offered   demilitarisationof the ships to our satisfaction^.The War Cabinet decided:-That demilitarisation not having been included in the alternatives firstoffered, we should not offer it now,as this would look like weakening,(6) The French had been given a time limit withinwhich to reply, but a written reply was not expected before 11.30a.m. In the meantime,various French warships had furled their awnings,from which it appeared that they might intend to put out to sea.The War Cabinet decidedThat a signal should be sent to AdmiralSomerville in the following terms:-&quot;If you consider that the French Fleetare preparing to leave harbour,inform them that if they move you.must open fire.&quot;The War Cabinet were informed that AdmiralSomerville had already been given discretion to lay magnetic mines to prevent the French ships from leaving the harboura(7) Later in the meeting, the War Cabinet were informed that a telegram had been received asfollows:-&quot;Gensoul&apos; s reply refuses our conditions and repeats previous assurances resinking of shipsc    States he will fight.I am prepared to open fire at 1,30 p.m. &quot;Admiral Darlan&apos;s   (8) Tne ^ar Cabinet were informed that Admiral Darlaninstructions. had- sent instructions to the French Admiral at dakar calling upon him and his men to pay no attention to British demands and to show themselves worthy of being Frenchmen0    It was essential, Admiral Darlan had said, that theFleet at Dakar, with its aircraft component and its full complement of men, should remain under theorders of the French Government.,

Hevolunteered the suggestion that HisMajesty&apos;s Government might offer toconvoy all the French officers andmen back to France under a flag oftruce, give them a year&apos;s pay, delayundertaking to return the ships andtheir equipment to a free France afterthe war was over.      I asked him whether that meant that American opinion would support forcible seizure of theseshipso      He said certainly.        Theywould expect them to be seized rather thanthat they should fall into german hands and that he would do everything in his power to help this solution.He said that he had offered to buy theFleet from the French before theReynaud Government fell but that therewas nobody from whom he could buy ittoday. &quot;(10)      The War Cabinet were informed that some ofthe French officers at Portsmouth had askedwhether their vessels would continue to fly the Tricolor.      The view was expressed that this request ought to be met as far aspossible.      It was not possible to foreseewhat forces General de Gaulle would eventually have under his command, but itwas possible that these might include anumber of warships.      On the other hand therewere certain vessels in the French Navywhich we should need for our own purposes.These vessels might be re-commissioned either with a proportion of French seamen or withwholly British crews.      The best planseemed to be to leave the Tricolor flyingfor the present, but not to commit ourselvesfor the future.(11)    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he was drafting a communication tothe French Government as to action taken byus in regard to the French Fleet;    its completion might have to wait until therewas more definite news from Oran.The War Cabinet(1) Agreed that,for the present at anyrate, the Tricolor should continueto be flown on the French warships

at Portsmouth and. Plymouth, and that,if need he, the French Officers whohad enquired on this point should he informed to this effect;    hut thatwe should he careful not to enterinto any commitments which wouldmake it impossible for us to mansome of these vessels with Britishcrews.(2) Invited the First Lord of theAdmiralty to authorise the Admiralsat Portsmouth and Plymouth to promisethe grant of British nationality to french sailors who volunteered tocontinue to fight with us.(3)  Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to settle, inconsultation with the Prime Ministerand the First Lord of the Admiralty,the terms of a communication to theFrench Government as to the action taken in regard to the French Fleet.The general line to he taken in this communication would be that we had^detained&quot; the French ships toprevent their falling into the handsof the enemy.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
