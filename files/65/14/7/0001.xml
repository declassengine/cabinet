It had been decided that such action should be taken, and accordingly Force &quot;H&quot; could notbe spared to take action against the RICHELIEU at dakar.    It had been decided that the HERMES should deal with the RICHELIEU by means of torpedo-bomberattack.    The plan was that the HERMES should give a four hours&apos; ultimatum offering the same alternativesas had been offered to the Fleet at Oran, with theexception that we should not include the offer thatthe RICHELIEU should be sailed to a British harbour and continue to fight with us.The Prime Minister said that he had informed the First Lord that he approved action on these lines,which would take place that evening.Later in the Meeting the War Cabinet were informed that the sloop MILFORD, when seeking to enterDakar in order to give the warning of a four hours&apos;ultimatum, had been refused admittance to the harbour.It had therefore been impossible to deliver the ultimatum,and it was proposed that the attack should be carried out without warning.The War Cabinet agreed that this course should be adopted.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,
