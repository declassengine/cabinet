THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. &quot;...    .It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET,W.M.  (40) 190th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex. .-(1st July, 1940 - 6.0 p.m.)COPY NO. -;APRANCE.The french fleet.(previous Reference:W.M.(40) 189thi Conclusions,I Minute 15.)The War Cabinet had had a short, discussion onthis matter at the conclusion of the Meeting held at 11.50a.m. (W.M.(40) 189th Conclusions, Minute 15), thediscussion being adjourned until 6 p.ra. in the afternoon.The War Cabinet had before them the following documents:-(a) Draft instructions, prepared by theAdmiralty, addressed to Flag Officer,Force &quot;H&quot;.(b) Supplementary instructions to Force &quot;H&quot; ,prepared by the Admiralty, containing,inter alia, a draft of the communication to be made to the French Admiral at Oran,(c) A draft, prepared by the Prime Minister,of the message to be delivered to theFrench Admiral at Oran.,(d) Draft Admiralty instructions to theCommander-in-Ghief, Mediterranean.(e) An Aide-memoire by the Chiefs of Staffon &quot;Implications of Action contemplated in respect of certain French Ships&quot;(C.0.S.(40) 510).The following were the main points dealtwith in discussion:-(1) The Vice Chief of Naval Staff had hada discussion with Admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal that morning.    Admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal had said thathe had had a telegram from Admiral Darlanasking that we should reserve final judgmentuntil the details of the armistice conditions were known.    Discussions on the armistice conditions were starting at Wiesbaden onthe 1st July, and the conditions in regardto the French Fleet were to be dealt with first.THE PRIME MINISTER said that discussions as to the armistice conditions could not affect the real facts of the situation.

(2) Was it right to include,among the alternatives to be offered to the French Admiral at Oran,that the ships should he immediatelydemilitarised to our satisfaction?On the one hand, it was argued that any stepsof demilitarisation which could he carried outin a short time could probably also be fairlyquickly repaired.    The essence of the present plan was quick action.On the other hand, the FIRST SEA LORD took theview that demilitarisation was the measure which was most likely to appeal to the FrenchWavy.    If their ships were demilitarised, theywould hope to get them back after the war.It was possible to destroy the turbines in,say, half an hour, while guns could also beput out of action by an oxy-acetylene cutterin a rather longer period.The view taken on this point was that,while we should not offer demilitarisation,the Flag Officer    should be authorised toaccept it if the other alternatives were refused, in order to avoid bloodshed.(3) French ships at Algiers:    It was decided that,owing to the strength of the defences of thisport, it was not justifiable to carry out aseparate operation against that placei(4) The suggestion was made that the French shouldhand over their ships unmanned^ and that weshould take them to British ports.    It waspointed out, however, that in the circumstancesthis was not practicable, as it would meandenuding our own ships.(5) It was not desirable to state in the message to the French Admiral that it would bedishonourable to the French if their Fleetfell into German hands.    The point of Frenchhonour had better be differently expressed,namely, that the arrangements that we were proposing was consistent with French honour.(6) It would be worth while pointing out to theFrench Admiral that, if some of the French ships were in our hands and we undertook not to use them unless Germany or Italy broke the terms ofthe armistice, this provided some assuranceagainst the terms of the armistice being sobroken.(7) The Fr^rrch Admiral at &quot;Oran might say to the emissaryof the British Flag Officer that there was norisk that the French Fleet would ever fall into german hands. &apos; It would be worth while sending ;a separate signal to the Flag . Off ieer., Force ,rH&apos;,giving the answer to. this, arid any otherarguments likely to be used in any discussion between the British and French naval authorities.

sA revise of the instructions to the flag officer of Force &quot;H&quot; was prepared and approved generally^subject to amendment on points of detail.The War Cabinet:-Agreed that a copy of the message to &quot;be handed to the French Admiral at Oran,together with the supplementaryinstructions to the Flag Officer,Force &quot;H&quot;, should be finally settled by the Prime Minister and the FirstLord of the Admiralty at a Meeting tobe held at 10 p.m. that night.Instructions The instructions to the Commander-in-Chief,to Commander-   Mediterranean, were next considered and approved,in-Chief, subject to paragraph   B. 1    reading as follows:-Mediterranean.&quot;Detained at Alexandria with a skeletoncrew, but immediately put in a non-seagoingcondition.71     &quot;Instructions to Discussion then turned on the action to be takenFrench ships     in regard to the French ships at Portsmouth andin Portsmouth . Plymouth.    All the ships had now been brought into and Plymouth,    harbour and were alongside.   Provisional arrangements had been made for a strong force to be held in readiness to go on board these French ships early onWednesday morning.The French seamen were now believed to be reasonably content, except that they feared internment.Arrangements had been made for Admiral James to visitthem on the following day and tell them that, although there might he other difficulties in the situation,all those who wished to return home would be allowedto do so.&apos;The view was expressed that there was a difference between ships which had takenrefuge, in this country and ships elsewhere.    Itwas very undesirable that any action should be taken which might, appear like sharp practice.   For this reason,it was desirable that a party arranged at Plymouth for the night of Tuesday, 2nd July, should be cancelled.   At thesame time, it was iraportant to take steps to avoid therisk of these ships being sunk in our harbours.It was suggested that a suitable method ofdealing with the situation might be that an officer shouldbe sent on board each ship with a suitable message tothe captain, and that almost at the same time an armedparty should board the ship.The War cabinet decided to leave the detailed arrangements&apos;to be made, to obtain control of the french ships at Portsmouth and Plymouth, to bedetermined by the Admiralty, in the lightof the discussion which had taken place.

The EMILE BERTIN.(previous reference;W.M.(40) 188thConclusions,Minute 1,)THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF referred to thequestion of the EMILE BERTIN,   H.M.S. FIJI waswanted to escort H.M.S. ILLUSTRIOUS back to thiscountry..   THE EMILE BERTIN was under the guns ofMartinique, and it would be difficult to take any effective action in regard to her .   He thoughtthat,provided that theFrendi continued to unload thegold from the ship, the best plan was to take no action in regard to the EMILE BERTIN, at any ratefor the present.The War Cabinet approved thissuggestion.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
