(40) 194thConclusions,Minute 7.)Sinking ofFrench cruiserLA GALLISSIONERE,W.M.  (40)  195th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5,Confidential Annex.(5th July.  1940 - 10,0 a.m,)THE FIRST SEA LORD informed the War Cabinetthat our submarines in the Western Mediterranean hadbeen ordered to attack any French ship escaping duringthe operations at Oran0      This order was intended tocover only the actual period of the operation, but owing to an error one of our submarines had torpedoed and sunk a French cruiser on the previous afternoon,,This was,  of course, contrary to our present policy,which was always to give warning to French ships beforeattacking,      The French Government, however, mightassume that we had now begun, unrestricted attack onall their warships, which might lead to the Frenchactually declaring war upon us.      The news of the sinking of the French cruiser had come in late theprevious night,  and immediate action had been necessaryto inform the French of the true position.      The FirstLord of the Admiralty had accordingly authorisedAdmiral Phillips to see Admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal and explainexactly what had happened,,      The following note hadbeen handed to Admiral Odsnd:hal in confirmation:-&quot;During the operations off Oran on 3rd July,British submarines were ordered to attackany French ships endeavouring to escape.The instructions issued to the submarines on completion of the operation that French ships were no longer to be attacked did not reach the submarines with the result that a Frenchcruiser of the IA GALLISSIONERE Class was attackedan &apos;6 sunk,,This occurrence is deeply regretted.The channel of communication toGovernment of this explanation had now toWe could either allow Admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal&apos;stransmitted without the delay at presentcommunications, orthe Commander-in-the Frenchbe considered,telegram to be imposed on. hisby-, alternatively, we could instructChief, Mediterranean, to explain theposition to Admiral Godfroy, who was in touchwireless wi*!a his own Go% ernment.      The ^--^arose whether the explanation should &quot;bre from His Majesty&apos;s Governmentchannels,further  jue;made.officiallyinstead of through navalwereInmade:-the ensuing discussion the following points(i)    Since France had broken off diplomatic relations with us, it would be better to makethe communication through naval channels.

(ii)    Our ships were ordered not to make contact with French warships unless the british forces were in considerably superior strength,when they would offer the same alternativesas had been offered to the French Fleet atOran,     They were not in any case to firefirst.      It was known that the French had given similar instructions to their shipsnot to fire first,(iii)    ife had to consider the position which might arise in the future when perhaps theremaining French vessels would be takeninto -service against us,     Viewed from thatangle it would seem best to put out of theway as many French ships as possible     Onthe other hand, if we opened unrestrictedattack, the French might retaliate and doconsiderable damage to our ships with theirsubmarines,,     These two dangers had to be balanced one against the other  (iv)    It was explained that our present policy hadbeen designed to deal primarily with the fourmodern capital ships, and it had been realised that we could not hope to getpossession of all the smaller French ships and submarineSo      The Naval Staff felt thatit would be unsound to risk war with france for the sake of dealing with these smallerand less important ships,(v)    It was suggested that the communication to admiral odend&apos;hal!hal should include a statementof our present policy and of the orders which had been issued to all British warshipsto offer various alternatives to French ships in order to save bloodshed,(vi)    This might be on the following lines:-&quot;Orders to all British warshipsmeeting French warships are that theyare on no account to open fire without giving sufficient warning to enablealternatives to be considered whichwould avoid bloodshed,&quot;aircraft.       (vii)    Somewhat similar problems were arising overFrench aircraft,     French aircraft hadbombed Gibraltar and had attacked one ofour flying boats there, which had retaliatedand shot them down.      It was impossible for aircraft to give any warning as in the caseof warships.     A further complication wasthe desirability of providing some means forfriendly aircraft wishing to come over toour side.     For example, on the day previousto the attack on Gibraltar six friendlyFrench aircraft had landed there.

(viii)    It was suggested that the best means ofovercoming this difficulty v/ould be to let the French know that all aircraftcoming inside a certain zone,  to be laiddown, would be fired on without warning.Arrangements would have to be made to givefriendly aircraft special routeinginstructions.The War Cabinet:-(l)    Invited the First Lord of theAdmiralty to arrange for the communication already made to admiral Odendfhal to be supplemented by a statementof our general policy regardingFrench ships.(2)    Agreed that facilities should begiven to Admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal to despatch this communicationwithout delay to the FrenchGovernment.(3)    Invited the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary ofState for Air, in consultation,to draw up a notification to becommunicated to the FrenchGovernment, through Servicechannels, of the areas in whichFrench aircraft would be firedupon without warning.The Dunkerque. THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF reminded the WarCabinet that it had been intended that AdmiralSomerville should proceed to Oran the previous afternoon to dispose finally of the ships which hadbeen partially disabled.     The   Prime Minister hadtaken the view that it would be necessary to send ina destroyer to give warning of what was intendedbefore starting bombardment.     The Naval Staff had thought that this would be unfair to the attackingforce.     It had, therefore, been decided to carryout the attack by torpedo air attack.     This had beenH carried out that morning.     Six hits had been obtained and one heavy explosion had been heard0     Two Skuaswere missing.It had not been thought necessary to givewarning of this attack.     The risk to life was farless in an attack by torpedo bombers than bybombardment.     In any event, Admiral Gensoul had stated at the time of the original attack that theships in Oran had been evacuated.She Richelieu. Contrary to the report received from Tangier,the RICHELIEU was still at Dakar.   When the necessary

force arrived, (in about 4-g days time)  it was proposed to &quot;bombard her from the north side ofthe peninsulao      She would he warned of the bombardment by sending a destroyer into the habourcarrying a white flag.prench ships Some discussion ensued as to the Frenchat Alexandria. ships at Alexandria.THE FIRST SEA LORD was not certain whetherAdmiral Cunningham had given any undertaking to theFrench Admiral that the French ships would not beused by us after they had been taken over.The War Cabinet decided:-That instructions should be sent to admiral Cunningham that he should avoid giving any undertaking to the admiral  in command, of the french fleet at Alexandria that, after theships had been given into our charge,they would not be used by us0Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
