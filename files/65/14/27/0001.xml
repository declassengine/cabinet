M.(40)  258TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex,(30th August. 1940 - 11.30 a.. m. )//2jiEOYAL AIRFORCE.Training of pilots: proposalto send PlyingTraining Schoolsah road.Pre v iotasReference:F.M. (40) 233rdConclusions,Hi nut e 1. )In opening the discussion THE PRIME minister referred to the latest developments in the battle forGreat Britain.      In the new phase of that battle theenemy had ceased using dive bombers.,      It had largelybecome a- combat between fighters and fighters;    andthe German machines were now heavily armoured.      the losses on the two sides were tending to approximate,and we were getting through our reserves of aircraft at a dangerous rate.The following were among the principalpoints made in the course of considerable discussion:-(i) THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that nothing in the fighting of the last fewweeks had shaken the conviction of theAir Staff that we could hold our own inthe air battle of 1940.      Vie must thereforetake a long view and consider our pre-reparations for the air battles of 1941.The critical months might be from july to September of that year.      In next year&apos;sbattles we should be making a bid for the supremacy of the air;    we hoped to have sufficient aircraft for the purpose,provided there were sufficient pilotsto man them.      To obtain these pilotswe must start training them at onceBNavigation and night flying ?/ere arts inwhich our pilots had an undisputed technic&quot;!superiority over the Germans, but the latter were making a big bid to catch us up..      our advantage might disappear if we confinedour training of pilots in this country,under the hampering conditions of german air attack and an English winter,,      his recommendation therefore was that the   (jt^Jra^.training schools should be moved to canada and South Africa.      He asked for general approval to the scheme set out inAppendices B and C of the Prime Minister&apos;s paper, subject to the following modificatiowhich he was prepared to accept for thepurpose of reaching an agreed settlement(a) the number of Anson aircraft to be sentns,if

overseas between August and October ofthe present year would be limited to 134and the number of Battles to 69,(b) thenumber of pilots to be sent overseas in thosemonths would be limited to 117;    as higha proportion as possible of these would be over-age and other non-operational pilots.,/JLater in the Meeting the Secretary of Statefor Air said that, as a further concessionfor the purpose of reaching agreement, hewould be prepared to assent to the post-ponement of the transfer to Canada of No.10Service Plying Training School, with a consequent reduction in the number of aircraft and pilots to be sent overseasduring the next two months^His colleagues would appreciate that hewas prepared to accept a postponement of the main decisions on his training scheme if the preliminaries of that scheme could be got under vray in October, november and December of the present year.      if that were not the case the scheme wouldfalldown, and there would be a shortage of trainedpilots in the fighting months of 1941.(ii)    THE   PRIME MINISTER said that there was nodoubt that training at the Schools had been seriously interfered with, but he was extremely doubtful whether every effort hadbeen made to overcome the difficulties ofthe existing conditions.      It was absolutelyimperative that the Air Staff should make further efforts in this directiona      his suggestion of a 3 months delay before coming to a decision on the scheme wouldhave the advantage of enabling it to beseen which way the present battle was going,and of allowing the Air Staff to overcomesome at any rate of the training difficultiesin this country.(iii)    THE MINISTER OP AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION saidthat he was opposed to any pilots ormachines being sent out of the country.We could not justify a flow of invaluablespare parts to Canada and South Africawhen v/e had to face the double dangerof interrupted communications at sea, andof interrupted factory working at home..He was unable to accept the position thatAnsons and Battles were obsolescentmachines.      Our reserves of these aircraft might yet save us in the event of invasion.From the point of view of the Ministry of aircraft Production, the fundamentalobjection to letting even 134 Ansons and69 Battles go overseas, was that we shouldbe parting with that number of Ansons andBattle engines.

Richmond Terrace, S..W.1,(iv)   The view was expressed by THE LORD PRIWSEAL/flSfB&apos;THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIOthatTwe&apos;shoul*d not concentrate on the 1940campaign so exclusively as to find ourselvesunable to wage the campaign of 1941.   . Asimilar position had arisen in the last war,when it had been decided? in spite of the strong demands from France, to retain anumber of professional soldiers in thiscountry to train the new armies,(v)    THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that action should proceed in accordance with theproposals in his paper, i.e. the postponement of the scheme as a whole untilthe beginning of December would stand.He would agree to the position being reviewed again in one month&apos;s time.      Inthe meantime the Air Ministry should adjust their training plans so as to decrease theirpresent measure of reliance on the overseasscheme.      One Navigational Training Schoolwould go to South Africa, but the otherwould not for the present go to Canada.The Yifar Cabinet agreed:-(i) That action should proceed inaccordance with the proposals inthe Prime Minister?s Memorandum.(ii) To review the question on the 1stOctober, 1940,  in the light of the then existing situation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said thatthe essence of his case had been the undisputed factthat it took many months to train a pilot,      We hadno time to waste   if we intended to gain the supremacyof the air in 1941.      The decision of the War cabinet might well make it impossible to recover lost ground.In conclusion he referred to his responsibility to Parliament for the training of the Royal Air Force.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the positionas regards Ministerial responsibility was necessarilydifferent under a small War Cabinet from the positionin peace-time, when the Secretary of State was himselfa Member of the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said thathe would be glad if the Prime Mihister could see himlater in the day.
