MOST SECRET.HIE middle east.MilitarySituation.(previous reference:V.U*(407 225thConclusions vHinute 7.)W.H.UO) 886th OGMC8LU3IOHS, MINUTE 4,OonfIdential Annex.(15th August, 1940, IS Noon.)The War Cabinet had a short discussion on theMilitary situation in the Middle East, following thereceipt of a telegram from the Acting Coruraander-in-Chief, Middle East, reporting that strong italian forces had broken through our position at Tag-Argan,and that he had ordered evacuation.TEE PRIME MINISTER said that he was anxiousas regards the defence of Egypt.     General Wavellthought that a strong Italian concentration had beenmade in Libya, and that an attack might be launchedwhile our position in the Middle East was still week.The Prime Minister said that part of our main defensive position in Egypt had been assigned to egyptian forces, and was not as strongly fortified asthe part of the line assigned to our forces.   Ineffect, therefore, the weakest troops were holdingthe weakest part of the line.     It had been suggestedthat Egyptian troops should hand over this part ofthe line to us, together with some of the weaponsrequired for the defence of this sector.     Thissuggestion had given rise to political difficulties and had been abandoned.     Generally, it seemed thatthe disposition of our troops in the Middle East had. often been determined, not on strategic, but on quiteother grounds.The Prime Minister then referred to theproposal that an Armoured Brigade should be sent to reinforce our troops in Egypt.    The matter had been further discussed with the Admiralty, and it had beenarranged to defer a decision until August 26th, when adecision could be reached in the light of the latestavailable information.    Clearly these was a consider-able risk in sending the Brigade through theMediterranean, but the situation might make itnecessary fop us to run this risk.     It was of theutmost importance that the fullest reconnaissanceshould be carried out between now and the 26th, so asto enable the decision to be taken on the best possible Information.The War Cabinet took note ofthis statement.Richmond Terrace, S.w.1T0 BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 4Q4It is requested that special cars may betaken taensure the secrecy of this document.
