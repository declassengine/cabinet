(39) 11thConclusions,sinute 5. )THE WAR CABINET had hefore them a most secret Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W. P. (40)324).In an explanatory statement, THE CHANCELLOROP THE EXCHEQUER said that his colleagues should be fully aware of the existing position of our gold and exchange resources,  and with the dangerous financialpossibilities of the near future.      There would beno-difference of opinion as to the over-riding necessityof meeting our vital needs for the prosecution of thewar..      3ut he asked his colleagues to co-operate withhim to the fullest extent of their ability inmitigating the financial situation.There had been serious inroads on our resources since the previous January.      The position was as follows:    million.Gold and g.1st January, 3940. 525Mid-August. 1940. 290Readily       Total.MarketableSecurities.250200775490In the spring of the present year it hadbeen estimated in the Treasury that our losses of gold and exchange between July, 1940 and June, 1941 wouldbes as a minimum,  410 millions.      The collapse of france  had changed the situation.     We had taken overFrench contracts in America which we had found tobe considerably more onerous than those which we ourselves had made.      In addition, there had been the developments described in paragraph 6 of his memorandum and a sharp increase,  in July and the present month,in the rate of loss of our gold and dollar reserve.In this period of six weeks, that reserve had fallen by some  88 millions, i. e. from about  380 millions to the mid-August figure, already mentioned, of 290 millions.The Chancellor described the results of the visit which Sir Frederick Phillips had paid to theUnited States at the invitation of the Secretary ofthe United States Treasury.The problem with which we were now faced wasto hold out financially until the United StatesGovernment were in a position to take their majordecisions of policy, i.e. until well into november in the case of a Democratic victory, or until the20th January, when the new President would take office,in the case of a Republican victory.     If we continuedTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested, that special care may he taken toensure the secrecy of this document.

to lose gold at the rate we had experienced in thelast six weeks, we should have none left by the endof December,      It was not safe to reckon on a slower rate of loss   and unless steps were taken it might prove higher.      Moreover, to avoid complete financialdependence;  it was most important that we should keepsome minimum reserve in hand,  even after American helphad crystallised,,     When denuded of gold, our resources would be some  200 millions of securities, which were at present, and might then be, unsaleable in quantity.Taking a longer view, a continuance ofexpenditure abroad at the present rate would mean thatin the year July 1940 to June 1941, we should lose some 800 millions of gold and foreign exchange as comparedwith the previous estimate of  410 millions.Turning to the policy of &quot;scraping the pot&quot;,described in part VI of his Memorandum, the Chancellorsaid that a requisition of wedding rings and other goldornaments, ?/ould not produce more than s ome  20 millions,THE PRIME MINISTER thought that this was ameasure to &quot;be adopted at a later stage,  if we wishedto make some striking gesture for the purpose ofshaming the Americans.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatthe position as regards the gold holdings of our Empireand our Allies was roughly as follows:  millionsReserve Bank of India 64Reserve Bank of South Africa 70Belgium 200Holland 150Norway 20PranceIn New York 126At Dakar 130In Martinique 60In Canada (in the custody of the Bank of England) 70In Canada (in the custody of the Bank of Canada). 90In addition we were paying  60 millions in dollars to the French in connection with the assignmentto us of their American contracts.The Chancellor said that measures were beingtaken to press the Belgian, Dutch and Norwegian Governments for substantial contributions.      It was feared that they would be very reluctant to part with any oftheir gold.      As regards the French gold, it ought to bepossible to obtain the use of the  70 millions depositedwith the Bank of England in Canada, but we were exper-iencing the greatest difficulty in connection with the 90 millions deposited with the Bank of Canada.      Thematter had been put to Mr. Mackenzie King, who had chosen to take a high moral linec      The Prime Minister had been good enough to come to the assistance of the Treasury,and was about to send a personal telegram to Mr. King.If we were able to use both the sums of Frenchfold in Canada and the  60 millions which we owed therench in dollars, the immediate situation would be greatly relieved.

Tnx. MINISTER OP AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION took theview that the position which the Chancellor of theExchequer had disclosed was far from being unsatisfactory.We still had. a considerable gold reserve, and therewas the prospect - of obtaining some part of the Frenchgold reserve in Canada.     He concluded that we hadenough resources to meet all our requirements untilthe United States came out into the open.     On thepresent showing, therefore, it would be a great mistake to put a money limit to our Defence programmesoTHE MINISTER OP SUPPLY said that his department had. been through a period in which theyhad been restrained from spending freely in dollars.Their programmes had been much hampered during thatperiodo     The ban had then been lifted, with mostbeneficial results on production.     It would be avery serious matter indeed if there were now to be anyslackening of the rate at which his Department wasplacing orders in America, both for finished products andfor raw materials.      The directions which he had been giving to his officers were that the rate of orderingshould be increased, not decreasedc      In his view, we ought to be prepared to take big financial risks duringthe next six months, since any marked falling off inour programmes, even for a limited period, mightmaterially affect the outcome of the war.The following additional points were alsorelevant(-1* Had all unnecessary civil expenditure in dollars been brought to an end?(ii) Was it possible to float a BritishGovernment loan in Canada?(iii) Was it out of the question that some ofthe. West Indian Islands should be sold tothe United States?(iv) He did not exclude the possibility, afterthe Presidential Election, of the UnitedStates providing us with munitions as agift.His views might be summed up by saying that itwas better to take a risk on the financial side, ratherthan to risk losing the war.THE MINISTER OP AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION said thatwe ought to do everything in our power to fillAmerican factories with British orders.     No AmericanGovernment would dare to tell those factories to ceaseproduction, with all the consequences in the shape ofunemployment and industrial derangement.     Somethinghad to be left to chance, and we ought to trust to thecommon-sense of the Americans, and to their desire tosee our cause prevail.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War cabinet a letter which he had received from the Lord presidentof the Coiincila     The Lord President supported thegeneral recommendations set out in paragraph VIII ofthe Chancellor&apos; s Memorandum.,     He thought, however,that it would he necessary for us to gamble to someextent on the willingness of the United States to give us financial help on an extended, scaleo

SIR RICHARD HOPKINS said that imports ofluxuries into this country had been stopped.      Ifthere was to be any further restriction &apos;on importsfrom dollar countries it would result in reducingthe food supplies imported for storage.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY wondered whether anything further could be done to persuade theDominions to restrict unnecessary imports from foreign, countries, thereby increasing the difficultiesof the British exchange control.THE PRIME MINISTER thought it would be verydifficult to put any further pressure on the dominions in this direction.Summing up, the Prime Minister said thathe sympathised greatly with the Chancellor of theExchequer in his difficulties.      The   Chancellor had done right to bring the financial dangers of thenext few months so clearly before his colleagues.In his view, the Chancellor ought to be given thegeneral support for which he asked, although there could be no question at the present critical stage of the war of stopping the development of the programmes of the Supply Departments.   After all, thegreatest economy would be to shorten the war.Nothing could be more extravagant than to shape ourcourse in such a way that we had to fight a prolongedwar in a broken-backed condition.He agreed, therefore,, with the SupplyMinisters that we should continue to place large scale orders in North America.If the military position should unexpectedlydeteriorate, we should have to pledge everything that we had for the sake of victory, giving theUnited States, if necessary, a lien on any and every part of British industry.THE WAR CABINET:(i) Recorded the view that, subject tothe development of our war effort, which involves placinglarge orders in the United States *every endeavour must be made to limit dollar expenditure to vitalneeds.(ii) Invited Ministers in charge of spending Departments to co-operate with the Chancellor of the exchequer to the utmost extent in carryingout this policy, on the lines indicated by him in his Paper,Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,
