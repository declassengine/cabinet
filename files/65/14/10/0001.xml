MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(11th July, 1940 - 11.0 a.m.)MILITARYOPERATIONS.Middle EastOperations.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR gave theWar Cabinet the following information, which had beenreceived from a staff officer of the Commander-in-Chief of our forces in the Middle East who had just returned to this country.French Somaliland.The attitude of General le Gentilhomme hadbeen one of co-operation with the British.     With aview to strengthening his position, General Wavellhad sent the lst/2nd Punjabis from Aden to british somali land, to be followed shortly by a West Africanbattalion and a battery.      The Black Watch were being sent to Aden as a reserve.East Africa.General Dickinson had planned an offensive to be carried out by 3 King&apos;s African Rifle Brigadeswith the object of capturing Kismayu.       This offensivecould begin about the end of July but there were certain administrative advantages in deferring it for a fewweeks.      Should, however, the Italians take the offensive against British or French Somaliland, itwas possible that this operation might be launchedimmediately as a counter-measure.Sudan.General Wavell attached little importance tothe occupation of Kassala, which was of no tacticalor strategic value.     There had never been any intention of fighting for this place if the enemyattempted its capture.    Its occupation constituted nothreat to Khartoum.     The rains, which would nowcontinue until the beginning of October, probablyruled out the possibility of any Italian attack onKhartoum.

The ex-EmperorHaile Salassie.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 174thConclusions,Minute 1.)Libyan Frontier.The operations on this frontier had hitherto been of a tip and run nature and the Italians had consistently put up a very poor show.      The possibilityof a limited offensive against Bardia had been carefully examined but the place was very strongly defended with complete anti-tank obstacles and was garrisoned byabout 10,000 men with guns.      It was possible that an offensive operation against certain reserves forBardia, which the Italians were in the habit oflocating in the open desert in rear of the organiseddefences, might prove a more practical proposition.   .General Wavell&apos;s policy was to hold on to MersaMatrun and to strengthen this place by all the means in his power.       There was urgent need for moreanti-tank, artillery, A.F..V, &apos;.s and stronger anti-aircraft defence..The Secretary of State for War said that hewas proposing to go into the position of the ex-Emperor Haile Salassie-     He thought that it wouldbe desirable to have a meeting to consider theposition which was somewhat confused, and not very satisfactory.The War Cabinet took note ofthis    statementsRichmond Terrace, S.W.1.
