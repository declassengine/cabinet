MOST SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.feffi PAR EAST.previous reference:jf.M. (40) 207 th.onelusions,minute 14.)ction in thevent of Japanesettack on theetherlands&apos;last Indies,W.M.C40)  214th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.(29th July, 1940 - 11.30 a.m. )The War Cabinet had before them a Reportby the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(40) 289) asking fora decision on the policy of His Majesty&apos;s government if the Japanese attempted to occupy the netherlands east Indies and the Dutch decided   to fight but wewere not assured of U.S.A. co-operation.In the course of preparing an appreciation of the situation in the Par East a difference ofopinion had arisen among the Chiefs of Staff - on thepoint referred to the War Cabinet.    The First sea lord, while appreciating the strategical disadvantages of a Japanese occupation of the Netherlands east indies, felt strongly that in present circumstances we ought on no account to involve ourselves in warwith Japan, as a result of Japanese aggression inthis area.    The remaining Members of the Chiefs, ofStaff Committee took the contrary view,THE PRIME MINISTER read   out a        .minute which he had written on the point at issue.(A copy is appended).In reply to a question by the Prime minister the FOREIGN SECRETARY&quot; said that it was still hisopinxon tnat the Japanese would hesitate beforeplunging into war with the British Empire,    Theywould, no doubt, inflict every unssible annoyance onus short of war.At the invitation of the Prime Minister theFIRST SEA LORD said that his answer to the arguments of the other members of the Chiefs of Staff Committee,as Set out in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum, wouldbe on the following lmes:-In reply to paragraph 5(a), he considered thatit would be wrong for our strategy to be influenced by sentiment.    If the Dutch Navaland Air Forces were engaged with ours in defending British interests in Home waters, itwas because their only hope of restoring Hollandlay in participation, in our struggle.    Theposition in the Far East was very different.If we landed ourselves in war with Japan itwould become not easier, but much harder to defeat Germany, and thereafter to restoreHolland.

In reply to paragraph. 5(h), he could not see    59that we were open to the charge of pursuing aninsular policy.      The Dominions might well have laid that charge at our door if we had been in aposition to take effective action against japan in the East Indies, and had not done so.      in actual fact, at the present time we could onlydelay_a Japanese occupation of the netherlands east i.ndies.Our Imperial requirements in the East Indieswere -(i) A base for a Fleet, and(ii) A Fleet to send to that base.At the moment, we must hold on firmly to (i)until (ii) was available.      So long as we heldon to Singapore, we should not be following aninsular policy.In reply to paragraph 5 (c), Australia and NewZealand would be much more isolated in the eventof war with Japan.Recent experience showed that submarines alonecouldAprevent a Japanese occupation of the DutchIslands;From the point of view of the JapaneseGovernment, with the prospect of having to fight theBritish Empire and the United States, the essentialthing was to obtain some improvement in their economic situation.      The obvious v/ay was to obtaincontrol of the resources of the Dutch East Indies andof Indo-China.      This could not be done all in a moment;it would take a little time to consolidate thosecountries, after they were conquered.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that our positionwould have deteriorated gravely if we allowed theJapanese to take possession of the Netherlands east indies.      The Japanese would then be standing acrossour route to Australia and New Zealand.It was true that Japan would need neweconomic resources if she was to fight the BritishEmpire, with the possibility of having to fight theUnited States in addition.      The Japanese, however,never took a serious step without considering theconsequences.      In the present case, would they not .be likely to decide that their interests would bebetter served by remaining at peace with ourselves and the Americans, and thus remaining free to obtaineconomic assistance from us?THE PRIME MINISTER said   that, to his mind, &quot;foecentral fact of the situation,  if Japan obtained the mastery of the Netherlands East Indies, was thatshe would be able to prepare strong positions facingSingapore.,  including a base for her fleet.      If we didnot fight, she would be able to prepare these positions in peace, and to use them against us at the momentwhich suited her best.

so if we made it clear that we should fightto preserve the integrity of the Netherlands east indies, Japan might very well decide against attack.The danger of having to take on both this country andthe United States of America was a powerful deterrent.Russia also might be added to the number of Japan&apos;senemies.On balance,  the economic arguments told infavour of Japan&apos;s abstaining from war with the BritishEmpire.      Japan could not afford to see her shippingparalysed.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that it had been calculated that it would take two years of economic warfare to bring Japan to her knees.      Our patrolscould not interfere effectively with Japanese shippingwithout a battle fleet in the Far East to support them.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that insufficientattention was being paid to our prestige.      It would suffer a terrible blow if we let the Dutch East Indiesgo without raising a finger in their defence,  on thegrounds that they were not British territory.      It wouldbe almost as damaging as it would be to stand by and see the Japanese take Hong Kong.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY recalledthe fact that only a week or two previously we had madea big concession to the Japanese,  in closing the burma road,  on the principle that this country was not ina position to take on more than one war at a time.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the presentsituation was different;    we now had before us thepossibility of a rival base being constructed overagainst Singapore.        We could not afford to toleratethat.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESthought that our economic position vis-a-vis japan would be very strong., and,  if the United States wasassociated with us, would be decisive.      He favouredinviting the Netherlands Government to make an approach to the United States.      If the Dutch could be persuaded to say that they would blow up their oilfields if theywere attacked by Japan,  that might well be decisive.He thought that an early statement on theeconomic situation would have a considerable effect.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was noquestion of deciding that morning to tell Japan thatwe would go to war with her if she interfered with theDutch East Indies.      The decision required was thata mpoc should be prepared showing our general plan oicompaign if we went to war with Japan to prevent herinterfering with the Dutch East Indies,

The Prime Minister said that the lord president of the Council, who vm-  ill and could not he present that morning, had read the Chiefs of staff report,  and had reached the conclusion that if theDutch resisted Japanese aggression against the dutch east Indies, we ought to go in with them and try to shame the United States into joining in;    hut thatthe first thing was to get a plan from the Chiefs ofStaff on this assumption.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe Board of Admiralty must take a long view as wellas a short view on this question.      When the Chiefsof Staff had drawn up their plan of campaign,  it wouldhe necessary for the Board of Admiralty to considerwhether the carrying out of that plan was consonantwith the present Naval Programmes.      As the War cabinet were aware,  decisions had been taken in recent weeks to postpone work on certain shins which could not becompleted for some considerable time,  in order thatall our resources might be directed to ends whichwould be of immediate value in protecting this country against invasion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought that japan might well shrink from war.      From this point ofview two things were important;    first, to make itclear that we should regard aggression against the dutch east Indies as a casus belli; secondly;  that in that event the Dutch would&apos; destroy their oilfields.Consideration was then given to the questionwhether an approach should be made to the netherlands government.      The view was expressed that the EoreignSecretary should see the Dutch Minister,  and invitehim to make an approach to the United States Government.This might well be made on the lines that we were considering the problem, but that our capacity tohelp would depend considerably on what the UnitedStates would do.      It was important,  therefore,  thatthey should get in touch with the United States.Position of THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSthe Dominions.        said that certain important convoys were shortly dueto leave Australia.      He thought that Australia andNew Zealand would only be prepared to agree to the convoys sailing if they knew that we had reached adecision to resist by force Japanese aggression in ^the Dutch East Indies.      The Governments of Australiaand New Zealand had been pressing strongly for aFar Eastern appreciation, and the situation would notbe met by letting them know that a Report was being prepared on a certain hypothesis.      He thought thaton the -present occasion the Dominion governments should be given a summary of the Chiefs of Staff views and asked to express their own opinions.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought therewas no disagreement that we should take all steps inour power to keep the Japanese out of the Dutch east indies.        The real question was the adequacy of themeans at our disposal to effect this,  and theconsequences which would he involved to the generalstrategical position.      If the need arose, we mighthave to withdraw our Fleet from the mediterranean in order to station an adequate Fleet at Singapore.The first step was clearly that an appreciationshoiild he prepared to show what action would heinvolved in resisting Japanese aggression againstthe Dutch East Indies.The question of policy must he settled bythe War Cabinet in the light of the appreciation whichwould now be prepared by the Chiefs of Staff.      Thefinal decision taken would,  of course,  take accountof the means at our disposal to resist such aggression.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that he had basedhis views on the situation as it stood today, and was likely to be in the next few months.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed as to the importanceof playing for time.      In a few months our&apos; position might well be much stronger.The trend of the discussion emphasised theimportance of long-term projects.      He thought thatthe Admiralty might   well give further considerationto the question whether work should not be re-started on some at least of the Naval construction on whichprogress had been suspended.The War Cabinet: -(l) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to prepareappreciations of the situation in theFar East, the general assumption being that Japan commits an act of aggression against the Netherlands East Indies,that the Dutch resist and that thiscountry comes to their assistance.The appreciations should indicate our general plan of campaign (a) with, and(b) without, the support of the UnitedStates.      These appreciations should,if time permits, include a review of theeconomic aspects.(2) Agreed that, when this appreciationhad been approved,  it should be sentto the Dominion Governments who should be invited to express theirviews.

(3) Agreed that, while no decision toy theWar cabinet  as to our action in the contingency contemplated v/as called for at the present time,  it was important not to give the Japaneseany grounds for thinking that weshould stand asideif they interfered with the integrity of the Netherlands east indies.(4) Agreed that the Foreign secretary should approach the NetherlandMinister on the following lines:that we were considering our actionin the contingency contemplated, hutthat our capacity to help would depend consideratoly on the attitudeof the United States.      the netherland Minister should toeencouraged to sound the United StatesGovernment as to what their attitude would toe.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.

APPENDIX.Minute by the Prime Minister.I personally feel that an attack on theDutch East Indies by Japan is an even greater menace to our safety and interests than an attack uponHong Kong, when it is admitted we shall have to fight.We should in fact he allowing ourselves to be cutoff from Australia and New Zealand, and they would regard our acquiescence as desertion.      I should hope the United States would not remain indifferent,as their position in the Philippines would also beaffected.       I was not aware that any such attack was imminent, and I do not quite understand the urgencyfor a decision.       The American aspect might well be one to be discussed between the Staffs in the forth-coming conversations (when are these going to begin?).Should a Japanese attack on the Dutch east indies become imminent, we ought to tell Japanplainly that that will be war with us, and not wait until Singapore is directly menaced.     We shouldhave to rely mainly on submarines and a few fastcruisers at the outset.      I doubt myself whether theJapanese would wish to run the risks of such anadventure while they are entangled in China.If these observations should lead the staff to agreement, there would be no need to rouble theCabinet on the point till the Staff paper is completed.If however the difference persists, the case can beput to the Cabinet, next week.
