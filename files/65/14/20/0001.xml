TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST    SECRET.COPY NO.W.M..(.4Q) 222nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(8th August, 1940, - 11.30 a.m.)THE PAR EAST.Appreciation bythe Chiefs ofStaff.Assistance to theDutch in theevent of japanese aggression inthe netherlands east Indies.(previous reference:iV.M.(40) 214thConclusions,Minute 7. )The War Cabinet had before them two reports by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(40) 302 and W.P.(40) 308),THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it would be premature to take a decision on the question ofassistance to the Dutch in the event of japanese aggression in the Netherlands East Indies.The immediate point on which a decision was required was whether a digest of the appreciationcontained in W.P.(40) 302 might be communicatedforthwith to the Dominions Governments.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSassumed that in due course the Dominion governments would have to be informed of the conclusions reached in the second report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(40)308).     He feared the effect of these two documentsmight be rather discouraging.       He hoped that nothing would be done which would interfere withthe dispatch by New Zealand of a brigade to Fiji.THE PRIME MINISTER thought the situation could properly be unfolded to the Dominion governments in the following manner which would inspire them witha much greater degree of confidence.(i)   Our present policy was to beat the Italiansin the Mediterranean for which purposewe required to keep a considerable fleetthere.(ii) We had been handling our relations with japan very carefully and hoped to avoidwar with her.(iii)   Nevertheless we might at any moment become involved in war with Japan.     It did not follow that we must abandon our operations in the Mediterranean immediately Japandeclared war..     With China on her hands,it was unlikely that Japan&apos;s opening moveswould be a full scale invasion of Australiaand New Zealand.

Attacks on Hongkong, Singapore and theNetherlands East Indies were moreprobable,(iv)    If this appreciation of Japan&apos;s openingmoves proved correct we should contentourselves with sending one battle cruiser and one aircraft carrier to the indian ocean, to be based on Ceylon, for thepurpose of protecting our vitalcommunications.(v)    We assumed that Australia and New Zealandwould not ask us to modify our strategyon account of the presence of Japaneseraiders on their trade routes, or of small scale Japanese raids taking place on theircoasts,(vi)   If a full scale invasion of either australia or New Zealand was threatened the situation could be retrieved by the intervention ofthe United States a      Indeed, if the UnitedStates had previously made it clear thatthey would not tolerate the invasion ofAustralia or New Zealand, the japanese would never take the plunge.(vii) In the last resort, however, our course was clear. We could never stand by and see a British Dominion overwhelmed by ayellow race, and we should at once cometo the assistance of that Dominion withall the forces we could make available.For this purpose we should be prepared,if necessary, to abandon our position inthe Mediterranean and the Middle East,An assurance on these lines might ^form the basis of the telegram to the Dominions.*/v*THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that a declaration of the kind suggested by thePrime Minister would make a tremendous difference toAustralia and New Zealand.      It would put the wholeFar Eastern situation in a different light.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY drew attention to certain consequences of giving up ourposition in the Mediterranean,      Assuming that this meant also giving up Gibraltar, our direct traderoute to the Cape would be in danger of interruptionby Italian warships.       We should require to routeour shipping further out to sea and to increase our naval strength in the Atlantic in order to police the new route.^LfeW II    V&apos;

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs drew attention to the observation in paragraph 4 ofPage 9 of W.Po(40) 302 that there was a distinctprobability that Japan and China would soon come to terms.    He thought that this hardly represented theForeign Secretary&apos;s view.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that his view was rather the opposite.     he also felt some doubts as to the conclusion suggestedin paragraph (ix) of page 5 of W.P.(40) 302 namely that&quot;we should not in present conditions go to war with japan in the event of a Japanese attack on Indo-China&quot;o       He suggested that we should be wise if we took no decision for the present as to our action inthis eventuality.      Thus we might well decide to employ various forms of economic pressure against japan.The War Cabinet:-(l) Deferred consideration of the strategic issues raised in theReports by the Chiefs of Staff(W.P.(40)  302 and 308).(2) Invited the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to despatch telegrams to the Dominion Governments containing a digest of the appreciation in w.P.(40) 302, subject to the additionof a passage on the lines proposedby the Prime Minister at &quot;X&quot; and to(3) below.(3) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to verify, in consultation with theForeign Office, the politicalassumptions made in these twoReports.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.

L Despatched 11th August, 1940. Jmim ministerCopy to General Smuts.The combined Staffs are preparing a paper on the Pacific situation, but I venture to send you.in advance a brief foreword. (Stop)   We are trying our best to avoid isar vith Japan, both by eoneedijtjg on jointswhere the Japanese military clique can perhaps force a rupture, and by standing up v.here the ground is lessdangerous, as in arrests of individuals, (stop).   Jdo notthink syself that Japan will declare war unless germany can make a successful invasion of Britain, (stop)   OnceJapan sees that Germany has either failed, or dares not try,I look for easier times in the Pacific,   (stop)   in adopting against the grain a yielding policy towardsJapanese threats, m have always in mind your interests and safety, (stop).Para, 2.   Should Japan nevertheless declare varon us, her first objective outside the Yellow Sea would

probably be the Dutch East Indies, (stop)   Evidently theUnited States would not like this (stop). What they would do we cannot tell (stop).   They give no undertaking of support, but their main Fleet in the Pacific must be e gravepreoccupation to Japanese Admiralty, (stop).   In this firstphase of an Anglo-Japanese war, we should of course defendSingapore, which if attacked, which is unlikely, ought to stand a long siege.   We should also be able to base onCeylon a battle-cruiser and a fast aircraft-carrier, which,8?ith the Australian and Mew Zealand ships which would returnto you would exercise a very powerful deterrent upon hostileraiding cruisers.Para. %    We are about to reinforce with morefirst-class units the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet, (atop).This Fleet could of course at any time be sent through the canal into the Indian Ocean or to relieve Sing^ore. (stop)We do not want to do this, even if Japan declares war, until it is found to be vital to your safety, (atop).   Such atransference would entail the complete loss of the Middle

East, and all prospect of beating Italy in the Mediterranean Iwould be gone. (stop).   le must expect heavy ?:t acks onFleet      IEgypt in the- near future, and the Eastern Mediterranean/is   Ineeded to help in repelling then, (stop).   If these attacks Isucceed, the Eastern Fleet would have to leave theMediterranean either through the Canal or by Gibraltar,(stop).   In either case a large part of it would beavailable for your projection, (atop)   We hopehowever tomaintain ourselves in Egypt, and to keep the Eastern Fleet , Iat Alexandria during the first phase of an Anglo-japanese war, should that occur, (stop).   Ho one can lay downbeforehand what is going to happen, (atop).   We must justweigh events from day to day, and use our available resources to the utmost, (atop).Para. 4.   A final question arises, whether Japanhaving declared war would attempt to invade Australia orHew Zealand with a considerable arsy. (stop).   We think this very unlikely, because Japan is first absorbed inChina, secondly would be gathering rich prizes in the dutch east Indies, and thirdly, would fear very much to send an

imporUmtpart of her fleet far to the southward leaving theAmerican fleet &quot;between it and home, (atop).   If howevercontrary to prudence and self-interest, Japan set aboutinvading Australia or Hew Zealand on a large scale, I havethe explicit authority of the&apos; Cabinet to assure you thatwe should then cut our losses in the Mediterranean and proceed to your aid, sacrificing every interest except   niythe defence and feeding of this Island on which all defends.MSPara. %   We hope however that events will tskea different turn . (stop),   Bty gaining tine with Japan,the present dangerous situation-may be got over, (atop).   Weare vastly stronger here at home than when I cabled to youon June 16. (stop).   We have a large Ar^y now beginning tobe- ^ell-equipped, (stop).   We have fortified our beaches,(atop).   We have a strong reserve of mobile troops includingour Regular Army and Australian, Hew Zealand and Canadiancontingents, with several armoured Divisions or Brigades ?eready to strike in counter-attack at the head of anysuccessful lodgaents. (atop).   We have serried over from

the United States their grand aisL of nearly a thousand gunsand 600,000 rifles with aKasinition cosplete Utop).Believed of the burden of defending France, our Army is becoming daily aore powerful and munitions are gathering,(stop).   Besides this re have the Homo Guard of X,:3Q0,0Q0xsent mny of thea war veterans, and most with rifles orother arms, (stop).Para. 6. the Royal Air Force continues to show the same individual superiority over trie enemy on ;?hich Icounted so much in Ey aforesaid cable tc-yrui. (stop).Yesterday&apos;s important air action in the Channel showed that v/e could attack against odds of 3 to 1, and inflictlosses of 31 to 1. (stop).   Astounding progress has beenmade by Lord Beaverbrook in output of tlie best machines,(stop).   Our Fighter and Bomber strength is nearly doablewhat it was when I cabled you, and ^e have a very largo-reserve of machines in hand (stop),   I do not think theGerman Air Force has the numbers or quality t) overpowerour Air defences, (stop).

Para.        he Kavy increases in strength each boat and we are now beginning to receive the immense programmestarted at the declaration of war. (stop).   Between June and december lp40, over 500 vessels, large and small, but isanymost important, will join the Fleet, (stop).   The GermanNavy is weaker than it has ever been. (; top).    CKARallOho?and GNEISEHAU- are both in dock damaged, (atop).   BISMARCKhas nut yet done her trials, TIRPITZ is three souths behindBiaMABCK. (stop).   There are available now in this criticalfortnight, after which the time for invasion is getting verylate, only one pocket-battleship, a couple of 8-inch KIPPEBStwo light cruisers, and perhaps a score of destroyers, (stop)To try to transport a large arsQr, as would now be needed forsuccess, across the seas virtually without naval escort in tha face of our Havy and Air force, only to meet ourpowerful military force on shore, still less to maintain suetan army and nourish its lodgments with munitions and supplies would be a very unreasonable act. (stop).   On the other hand,if Hitler fails to invade and conquer Britain before the

weather breaks, he has received his first and probablyhis fatal check, (atop).Para 8.   We therefore feel a sober and growingconviction of our power to defend ourselves and the Empiresuccessful^, and to persevere through the year or two thatsay be necessary to gain victory. (Ends.),

TELEGRAM PROM HIS MAJESTY king GUSTAF OF 31/SDBHTO HIS MAJESTY king GEORGE VI.As Head of one of the few neutral states inEurope remaining outside the present conflict, Iconsider it my duty at this moment to offer ray bonaofficia to the Heads of the States of Great Britainand Germany to enable contact to he made if these powers should wish to establish such &quot;contact in orderto examine the possibilities of making peace,I would request to he informed whether   Youaccept my offer,I am today addressing a similar coamunicationto the German Chancellor,If an affirmative reply is received from bothsides, I shall consnunieate the fact.    If not, my offermust be regarded as having lapsed and 1 shall regard itas my duty to maintain strict secrecy regarding what has taicen place,EXPIRATORY IIQT3 BY THE SWEDISH MINISTER.The King has taken this step solely on his own initiative uninfluenced by any other consideration butthat of wishing if possible to try to stop furtherbloodshed in Europe.   As complete secrecy will bemaintained regarding this initiative, unless both parties accept the offer, His Majesty has felt that there could on neither side be any objection to this attempt.If the belligerent parties should agree to explore thepossibilities, a secret meeting might be arranged in sweden for this purpose.    I have further been asked to request that, in the event of a negative answer, HisMajesty&apos;s proposal should be regarded as strictly confidential.   The same request has been made to Berlin.London.   August Snd 1940.

DSAFSf R^PLY 1 have carefully examined with My GovorraaentVBQU HX3 majesty the K1HG IK) SHE       la the United Kingdom, Canada, the CommonwealthgI$G OF SWBSKK,of Australia, Hew Zealand and the union of SouthAfrica the communication which. Your Majestyaddressed to Me on the 2nd August,Your Majesty -will recollect that l.iy Governmentin the United Kingdom defined at length their position towards German peace offers in thematurely considered statement made by llr. Chamberlain,then Prime Minister, in the House of Commons, onthe  2th October, 1939.     in that statement my government made it plain that it was no part ofBritish policy to exclude from her rightful placein Europe a Germany which would live in amity and confidence with other nations, but that the peace on which      Government were determined moat be a real peace, by which the freedom and independence of nations was secured.Since then a nsssiSber of new crimes have beeneoEnaltted by Bassi Germany against the smallerstates on her borders.   Norway has been overrunand is now occupied by a German invading army,peamarlt hes: been seised and pillaged.   Belgium,Holland and Luxea&amp;urg, in spite of the assurances given to each of them by the Gersaan Governmentthat their neutrality would be respected, havebeen conquered and subjugated.     In Hollandparticularly, acts of long prepared treacheryand brutality (fulminated in the massacre ofRotterdam, where many thousands of Dutch civiliansof both sexes were slaughtered and an important part of the City destroyed.

Sfhese horrible events have dat&amp;ened thepages of Biropeaa history with an indeliblea tain.     But My Gcvernsnant see in them not the slightest cause to recede in any way from theirprinciples and resolves as set forth last October.On the contrary&apos; the intention of my peoples to prosecute the war until their purposes have been achieved has been strengthened to such a point that they would rather all perish in the Gossoonruin than fall or falter in their duty. - Thegrfirmly believe, however, that with the help of Godthey will not lack the means to discharge their task.It therefore lies with the Seraaa Governmentto maSee proposals by which the wrongs that Gerraanyhas inflicted upon other nations may be redressed,moreover, as. My oevarag*ent indicated on Octoberlsth,( it would be necessary, before any such proposals could be conei&amp;ered, that effectiveguarantees by deeds, not words, should he forthcoming from eeriiaisy which would ensure in a general peacethe restoration of freedom to France and to theother countries which have been deprived of it, aswell as the effectual security of Great Britainmad the British Bssipirs.Your Ha^asty will realise that, so long asthe conditions above mentioned are not satisfied,no useful purpose would be served by a meeting suchas Your Majesty contemplates between representatives.of Great Britain and Qemm&amp;t

I hove carefully examined v;ith my Oov- rnr.cnt? in theUnited Kingdom, Canada, -the Commonwealth of Australia, ViewZealand and the Union of i outh Africa, the communication which Your Majesty addressed to Me on the 2nd August.Your Majesty will recollect that Uy Government in theUnited Kingdom defined at length the!v position towardsGerman peace offers in the maturely considered statement madeby ;!r. Chamberlain, then   ?rime ISlnisfcer, in the House ofComons on the 12th October. 1959.    In that statement it wasmade plain, in accordance with the-view of all fSyGovernments, that it war no part of British policy to exclude from her rightful place in Europe a Germany which won.!-.&apos;: live in amity and confidence with other nations, but that thepeace on which Sy Governments wore determined must be a realpeace, by which the freedom and independence of nations wassecured.Since then a number of now crimes have been committed by Kasl Germany against the smaller states on her borders.Norway has been overrun and is pm occupied by a GermanInvading army,   Denmark has been seised and pillaged.Belgium, lloll&amp;Sd and Luxemburg, in spite of the assurances given to each of then by the German Government that their neutrality would be respected, have been conquered and sub-jugateu.    In Holland particularly, act; of long preparedtreachery and brutality culminated in the massacre ofRotterdam, where many thousands, of a utch civilians of bothsexes were slaughtered and an important part of the citydestroyed.These

12th August, 191+0;These horrible events have darkened the pages of Europeanhi story with an indelible stain.   But ??y Governments sou in them not the slightest cause to recede In any way from theprinciples and resolves ret forth last October.   On thecontrary the intention of My peoples to prosecute the war until121*71 r purpose.7 have been achieved has boon strengthened.   Theywill not falter in their duty and they firmly believe thatwith the help of Rod they will not lack the means to discharge their task.There has been nothing in the words or in the deeds ofthe present rulers of Germany to warrant the belief that theyare yet prepared to accept or observe a peace re-cognising theright of other people to life and freedom.   They have enslaveda great part of the Continent of Europe and are openly&apos;striving to bring the rest of the world under the same;tyrannicaI control*It therefore lies with the German Government to make proposals by which the wrongs that Germany has inflicted upon other nations may be redressed.   Moreover, it would benecessary, before any such proposals could be considered, that effective guarantees by deeds, not words, should, be forthcoming from Germany which would ensure in a general peace therestoration of freedom to Prance and to the other countrieswhich have been deprived of It, as well as the effectualsecurity of Great Britain and the British Empire.Your Majesty will realise that, so long as the conditionsabove mentioned are not satisfied, no useful pur-pose would be served by a meeting such as Your Majesty contemplates between representatives of Great Britain and Germany.
