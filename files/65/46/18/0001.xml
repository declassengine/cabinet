MINUTE confidential Annex(13th June, 19kk - 6.30 p.rn.)OVERLORDSECURITYCensorship ofDiplomaticCommunicationsfrom thisCountry(previous reference:W.M. (k4) 70thConclusions,Minute 6)The War Cabinet discussed a proposal made in a,letter, dated 11th June, addressed to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs by General Bedell Smith thatthe diplomatic ban should be lifted, not at D + 7 asthe War Cabinet had agreed at their meeting on 31st May,but at D h- 15,It was explained that consideration had beengiven to the question whether the ban could be liftedby private arrangement with the different embassies,anything in the nature of a public announcement beingforbidden, but that it was clear that, once the &quot;banhad been lifted, there was no hope of concealing thefact from the enemy;In favour of continuing the ban until 0+15*it was urged that there was good reason to believe thatthe enemy was not concentrating all his forces againstthe Normandy bridgehead, because of his fear that majorlandings might take place at other points on the coast of Western Europe, and that it would be of great help to the Supreme Commander if the enemy.could be kept inthis state of uncertainty for a further period of eight days.     The lifting of the ban would be interpreted as a sign that no further major landingwas intended.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, now that the initial attack had been launched, it was arguable that the lifting of the ban would do more goodthan harm.     There was no reason to suppose that foreign representatives in this country would be ableto guess the direction of our next move and they were more likely to send out large numbers of contradictoryand confusing rumours as to our intentions.     Further,the lifting of the ban might   well be regarded by theenemy as a deliberate move to put him off   his guard against landings elsewhere.     The maintenance of theban imposed a heavy burden on the Foreign Office,particularly in view of the exceptions which had hadto be made in favour of the French Committee ofNational liberation.-     In addition, an awkward situation had arisen in connection with the forthcoming MonetaryConference in the U.S.A, since there had beendifficulty in arranging for the delegates of AlliedGovernments .now in this country to travel togetherwith the British delegates.

/After- further discussion it was suggested thatit might be reasonable to maintain the ban until      ,Monday, 19th June.v ;THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he would not oppose this proposal on the &apos;understanding that he might make, one or two limitedexceptions, in special cases (e.g. where foreignAmbassadors were waiting to come to this country)o :The War Cabinet -&apos;   (1) Agreed that on Monday, 19th June,&quot;the Secretary of State for Foreign 1-Affairs should&quot;inform the represent-atives of foreign Governments concerned&apos;that the ban would be removed .&quot;      .forthwith.&apos; (2)vAuthorised.the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to malee exceptionsin special cases before that date, inregard to the admission to thiscountry of members of the diplomatic corps.   .(3) Agreed that arrangements should bemade to enable the Allied delegates to the forthcoming Monetary .       &apos;-Conference.to.travel with the Britishv    &apos; delegates.Offices of the&apos;.War Cabinet,f    S.W.1.
