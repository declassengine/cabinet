MINUTE confidential Annex(7th June, 1944 - 6.0 p.m.)PRANCE(previous reference:W.M.(44) 72ndConclusions,Minute 3)THE PRIME MINISTER invited the War Cabinet toconsider the difficulties which had arisen as regardsour relations with General de Gaulle.     At their meeting on 5th June (W.M.(44) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 3)he had reported to them the latest developments inconnection with General de Gaulle&apos;s visit and had informedthem of the discussions which he, Field Marshal Smuts,the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Labour had had with General de Gaulle (W.P.(44) 297);   of General de gaulle&apos;s visit to General Eisenhower and the discussions that had then taken place about a broadcast byGeneral de Gaulle;    and of the difficulties which had arisen with General de Gaulle over the appointment ofFrench liaison officers with the Allied troops landed inthat country.General de Gaulle had, in the outcome, declined to broadcast as a part of the series of broadcasts byGeneral Eisenhower, the Queen of the Netherlands, theKing of Norway and M. Pierlot, in connection with the landing of the Allied troops in France.     But he had made a statement on the wireless shortly afterwards.It was noticeable that he had omitted from it any reference to the share of the   Americans in the Alliedlandings.General de Gaulle had maintained his objectionto the despatch to France of the full complement of120 French liaison officers who were available, although he had agreed, without prejudice to the general issueinvolved, to 20 of them accompanying the Allied forces.General Bedell Smith had said that the Allied Forces could make do with this number for a considerable period.Lastly, difficulties had now arisen with himover the special currency notes which it was proposed should be made available to the Allied forces.     Hewould ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toinform the War Cabinet of the position on this matterand on the connected question of the arrangements to bemade for the control of civil affairs now that theAllies- had landed in that country, with a view to adecision being taken on the general Issue of policy tobe adopted in relation to General de Gaulle and theFrench National Committee.The Cabinet should also be aware that thePresident, as a result of the suggestion that had beenput to him by the Prime Minister, had now caused a message to be sent to General de Gaulle that thePresident would be ready to receive the General eitherbetween the 22nd and 31st June or between the 6th and14th July.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat a. difficult position had arisen as a consequence ofoAir inability to reach any agreement for the control ofcivil affairs in France on its liberation with the french national Committee, despite repeated attempts since last-September.     A major factor was the refusal of president roosevelt to come to any arrangement with the french national Committee in advance of our establishing ourselves in France.     The President&apos;s attitude was based on hisanxiety to avoid appearing to take a decision, which mustbe for the French people themselves to-take, as to thefuture Government of their country, or to influence thatdecision by appearing to accept the authority of a parti&apos;,,&apos;,&quot;or&quot;group of Frenchmen.But the absence of any understanding with the french national Committee was now causing much difficulty in several ways:--   (a) It complicated our relations with the french national Committee,  who   regarded themselves as&quot;being as representative of French opinion as theGovernments of the smaller-powers, such as Belgium,with which we had concluded agreements for the handling of civil affairs on re-occupation, andwere aggrieved by our failure to conclude similar arrangements with theme(b) Failing agreement with any authoritative Frenchbody, the administration of French territory as and when liberated would have to be undertaken bythe Allies in the same way as if France had been.   a. conquered country such as Italy and Germany*This was the more awkward as he had himself taken the line in Parliament that we should deal, on the  .occupation of France, with the French national committee. ;(c) Despite our. invitation to bring with him three members of the French National Committee, general de Gaulle had elected to come with military advisers only, and had taken the line that hecould not discuss political issues unless a united States representative was associated with&quot; the discussions.      That, of course, was a matter which was outside our control,,     While we had hadno official communication, we had reason to be!love-that the -French National Committee had approved   his action in coming alone, though under what degreeof pressure from General de Gaulle it was, ofcourse, impossible to say.(d) Finally a difficulty of immediate urgency had arisen over the currency notes.,      The Allied forces would require large quantities of French currencyfor the payment of the troops, local labour, etc.Available stocks of ordinary Bank of France noteswould not last long.      The&apos; recognised governments.      of Belgium, Norway and Holland had provided theirown new notes for this purpose which they had madeavailable to the Allied command,.     Owing to Americanapprehensions that a similar course in the case ofFrance might constitute recognition of. the french committee as the Government of France, a similar procedure has not been possible in the case of thatcountry.     French.notes with a design approved by

M. Monnet, under authority from the French Committee,had accordingly been provided.     General de Gaulle,while apparently prepared to accept these notes asa necessity, took exception to^their being madelegal tender in France by a proclamation of the \Supreme Commander and insisted upon the notes beingproclaimed legal tender solely by the french committee.     General de Gaulle had,.indeed, told M.   Vienot that if General Eisenhower were toauthorise these notes by proclamation it would-beimpossible for him to remain   here.    General de gaulle&apos;s objection was,of course,based on the contention that the issue of these notes would bean act of sovereignty.     M. Vienot had told us that unless agreement was reached in regard tocurrency he feared that any subsequent arrangements in regard to civil affairs would be out of thequestion.     We had asked Supreme Headquarters to suspend the issue of General Eisenhower&apos;sproclamation pending further consideration.     Onesolution would be to ask the Americans, whoseconcurrence would be necessary, to drop the ideaof a proclamation by General Eisenhower and to be content with the issue of some statement byGeneral de Gaulle in terms agreed with the supreme commander or, if the United States Governmentremained opposed to this, to the issue of parallelproclamations by the Supreme Commander and himself.A general discussion followed.THE PRIME MINISTER reviewed&apos;the course of relations     with General de Gaulle over recent years.There had been, he regretted to say, a steady deterioration of relations, which had had an unfortunate effect on thePresident&apos;s attitude towards -General de Gaulle.He himself had been driven, in the light of experience., to feel that there was a very substantialjustification for the President&apos;s view.      Indeed on21 st May, 19U-3, he had felt obliged whilst in Washington,to invite the War Cabinet to consider whether it would notbe wiser to terminate our relations with the General.The War Cabinet had not felt justified in taking thatdecision, and he had accepted the arguments that had weighedwith them.     But the position had not improved since thatdate.       There had been a variety of incidents of much difficulty and he was obliged to say that General de gaulle had shown a most non-co-operative attitude and had   .exposed himself to the suggestion that- he was primarily concerned with his personal position.  He. (the Prjime Minister)had himself done everything in his power to ease matters,both between General de Gaulle and the President and &quot;between general de Gaulle and himself;    though he regarded it asfundamental that in our anxiety to conciliate the general we should take no risks whatever of straining our cordial relations with the President.     But it was clear thatGeneral de Gaulle still felt most reluctant to work with us, save on the basis.that he and the National Committeeshould be recognised as the authoritative government ofFrance, a position which the Presidents for good reason,was quite unable to accept.     He-was anxious to have theadvice of the War Cabinet-on the broad general position,but repeated his own deep concern with the turn which it  -was taking.

We must not forget that the burden of liberationwas being carried essentially by British and american troops and while fully recognising the feelings thatmoved General de Gaulle we were, entitled to look for agreater degree of active and wholehearted co-operation from him that we had received, and to expect that difficulties would not be raised over relatively minorincidents.       Personalities could not be allowed to bethe decisive element in matters of such importance as this.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that he did not attach importance to the personal position of General de Gaulle.He thought, however, that it was. very important thatwe should lend what support we could to those friendlyelements in the National Committee which were anxious towork with us.     He was uneasy at&apos; the possible reaction in Prance were the impression, however mistaken, to gainground there that the Committee were being left in the cold.   . He was certainly not prepared to accept eitherGeneral de Gaulle or the French Committee as a provisional government, or. to go beyond the decision as to the status of the French Committee embodied inthe original Algiers Decree.      But he was anxious lestwe should find ourselves at variance on this matter with. the great masses in France who had helped us throughout. -   :Could we not tell General de Gaulle that we were readyto negotiate over currency and other questions if he brought members of his Committee to this country?     If,in fact, he agreed to do so, we could then go ahead with,discussions with him in the hope that the United states would either come into line in due course or wouldacquiesce in our going our own way.     As a power in the battle we were entitled to a voice of our own.      If, ofcourse, General de Gaulle refused either to negotiate,with us himself orto bring members of his Committee tothis country for that purpose, a different situation would arise. -   -THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OP HOME SECURITYsaid that he Would welcome a general agreement with theCommittee,, if it could be reached. .    But as regards the specific issue of currency notes, he saw advantage in. allowing the Commander-in-Chief to take full responsib51 iVfor its issue.      If the currency notes were issued with      *the support of a proclamation by General de Gaulle, thatmight give him a very dangerous weapon since if relationsdid not improve he might, in the near future, publiclywithdraw his backing from it.     He thought we shouldrevert to our original proposal under which we contemplateddiscussion with General de Gaulle and members of his committee.      If the General insisted that United Statesparticipation was a condition of any discussions he (theHome Secretary) would be.prepared to&apos;break offnegotiations.      He felt, howeverr that the United states would, in fact, be likely.to acquiesce in any reasonablearrangement we could come to with, the General and his committee.      It Was of-real importance to getrepresentative members of the Committee to this countryso. that they could be aware of our point of view andof our difficulties.O THE MINISTER .0F PRODUCTION suggested that if a realdeadlock arose over the currency issue we might do better to use pounds or dollars rather than fr.an.eSo     How much importance need we attach to a statement by General de gaulle or by-the French Committee in respect of thiscurrency?-k-

. &apos;    THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explained that theemergency currency must he&quot;issued on the authority of theSupreme Commander, who took the responsibility for declaringit to he legal tender and to be convertible into dollars and sterling, at the rate of 50 francs to the dollar and200 francsto the  .     In his judgment a formal proclamation by themilitary commander was necessary.     Prom the purely technical point of view no statement, by General de Gaulle or theCommittee was essential.      indeed, as the issue ofthis currency might be regarded as an act of sovereignty on french soil, he doubted whether General de ^Gaulle or theFrench National Committee could constitutionally take any effective action, but at the. same time the distinction thusinvolved between France and the recognised governments ofBelgium, Holland, etc. was naturally a sore point with theCommittee.&apos;   THE- DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER said the War cabinet felt the fullest sympathy with the difficulties of thePrime Minister who had their entire support in dealingwith this&apos; matter.      The really important thing was toreach a working arrangement with the French, independent of personalities.     What weighed with him was not so much the personal position of General de Gaulle as oursubsequent relations with France.     The resistance -groupsrepresented on the French National Committee were of greatimportance.     The more we could do to build up the prestige and authority of the Committee the better.     Therewas always the risk that by giving General de Gaulle a grievance, however unjustified, we were assisting to consolidate his position in France and elsewhere, sincethe true facts of the situation could not of course be known.Attention was drawn to a message from theAustralian Government (Telegram No. 128) expressing someuneasiness at the development of current Allied policy towards the French, and suggesting that comparisonswere bound to be drawn between this policy and the recognition accorded to the provisional Governments ofother European Allies.     While fully appreciating thenecessity for parallel policy with the United States, theAustralian Government were anxious to receive any information.we could give then regarding the conversations with General de Gaulle.THE PRIME MINISTER then summed up the discussion and formulated the general conclusions reached,.The War Cabinet agreed as follows:-(l) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in his conversations with General de Gaulle,should take the following line.(a) He should enquire whether General de gaulle was himself prepared to discuss with us the various matters affecting.    -  the control of civil affairs in France, etc,(b) If General- de Gaulle was not willing todo so., the Foreign Secretary should saythat we should like three or four members

of the French National Committee tocome to this country to go into thesematters with His Majesty&apos;s Government.In that event the Prime Minister&apos;would inform the President of the actionO which was being taken, and would saythat we should be glad if the president would either send a representative tobe present at the conversations, or would allow Ambassador Winant to sit in at them.(c) If discussions took place here as proposedby us and a reasonable basis of agreement was reached, we should commend it to the   &apos;.United States, and would be ready tosend a representative over to be present at the discussions in the United States-between the representatives of the french committee and of the United StatesGovernment.(2) The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should in the first place broach this matter-orally with General de Gaulle on the basisset out above.     Thereafter he should embodythese proposals in a letter to M. Vienot,a draft of which should be submitted to thePrime Minister.(3) Should General de Gaulle decline to acceptthe proposal in (l)(b) above, we should tell him that we greatly regretted his decision,which would have to be communicated to theFrench National Committee in a document which,might have to be published.(h) As regards the issue of Currency notes for theuse of the Allied troops in France, general eisenhower should be authorised to take action on his own authority as soon as necessary.      If negotiations with the french committee proceeded favourably, some e:c postfacto association of the Committee with theissue of this currency should admit of being arranged at a later date.(5), The Prime Minister undertook to advise The Kingthat in the opinion of the War Cabinet it was undesirable that His Majesty, should see general de Gaulle, unless and until the aboveconversations had had a satisfactory issue.(6) Our policy as regards propaganda should be toencourage the authority and prestige of theFrench Committee of National Liberation as awhole, rather than General de Gaulle?s personalposition, and the Minister of Information shouldbe asked to give guidance to the Press inthis sense.oOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
