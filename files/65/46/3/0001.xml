(1+2+) 31stConclusions, Minute 2)THE PRIME MINISTER said that on theprevious day he had held a meeting to considera Note by Sir Pindlater Stewart proposing that, in the interests of &quot;OVERLORD&quot; security,a ban should be imposed on uncensoredcommunications sent or received by diplomatic representatives in this country.The Prime Minister reminded the WarCabinet of the restrictions which had been imposed in this country in the interests of&quot;OVERLORD&quot; and what had been done to preventthe leakage of information through Ireland.If, however, we continued to allow uncensoredcommunications to pass between diplomatic representatives in this country and their governments, there would be a serious gap inour security measures through which valuableinformation might reach the enemy.The Supreme Allied Commander had pressed strongly for the imposition of a banon. diplomatic communications, end the meeting had come to the conclusion that, in view ofthe importance of leaving nothing undone whichmi5?ht promote the success of &quot;OVERLORD&quot;, his view should be accepted.It was accordingly proposed that from15th April, or as soon thereafter as possible,foreign diplomatic representatives in thiscountry should not be permitted to send orreceive uncensored communications, and thatno members of diplomatic staffs, should be permitted to leave the country.     Therestrictions would apply not only to neutral governments, but also to Allied Governments,including the French Committee of Liberationand the exiled Governments in this country,but excluding the United States and theU.S.S.R.     Similar restrictions would have tobe imposed on the movement of French military -personnel from this country to Algiers.

In discussion the following points were made;-        -(a) It was pointed out that it wouldnot be possible to prevent entirely the reception in this country of wireless cyphermessages from overseas transmitters, e.g.the French National Committee&apos;s transmitterat Algiers.     There might also be difficultyin controlling messages sent by the Polish and Czech Governments to their undergroundmovements, and certain of the Allied armed forces in this country might have wirelesstransmitters which might be used for the sending of cypher messages oversoas*,(b) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINIONJSFFAIRS said that it would be desirable toinform the Dominion Governments in advance ofthe steps which it was proposed to take.(c) It was suggested that there mightbe exceptional circumstances which would justify allowing important foreign representatives, e.g. representatives of theFrench National Committee of Liberation now on a visit to this country to proceed over-seas.The War Cabinet(1)   Approved the action which had beendecided on at the meeting on theprevious day0 v(2)   Asked the Minister of Production,as Chairman of the Sub-Committee on&quot;OVERLORD&quot; Security, tobe responsible for coordinating thenecessary action to give effectto their decision, and to consider what action could be taken to meetthe points raised in sub-paragraphs(a) and (c) above,(3)   Agreed that the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs should givethe Dominion Governments advance information of what was proposed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,
