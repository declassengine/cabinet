(hh) U&quot;5rd Conclusions, Minute 3Oonfidential Annex(3rd April, lgUh   -   5.30 p.m.)BOMBING POLICYTargets in occupied Territory(Previous ReferenceW.M,(U3) 120thConclusions, MinuteTHE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF raised thequestion whether permission could now be givenfor certain railway targets in occupied territory to be attacked by day or night,without any operational restrictions, as partof the OVERLORD bombing plan.     Up to thepresent time the Air Staff had kept their2) bombing of targets in occupied territory withinthe restrictions imposed by the War Cabinet.Under these restrictions it was only possibleto bomb 13 out of the 7*4- railway centres inFrance and Belgium which the Supreme Commanderconsidered should be attacked^     The Ministryof Home Security had given an estimate that,unless evacuation reduced the number of civilian population living near the targets, between80,000 and 160,000 casualties might be causedby the bombing, of which perhaps a quarter, would be killed.     The Chiefs of Staff had considered this question,,     They thought thatif railway operating personnel in France and-the Low Countries ,were warned that importantrailway centres in their countries might atany time be subjected to heavy air bombardment,and were advised to- evacuate the vicinity ofsuch centres, this would reduce the number of casulties,.     Furthermore, it would probablyincrease the difficulties of operating therailways as a result of the bombings     They,therefore, recommended that such a warning should be issued as soon as possible,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he under-stood that there had been a division of opinion among the experts as to whether the Allied AirForces should be employed on bombing railwaytargets or other targets, but that it had nowbeen decided to recommend the bombing of railwaytapgetso     He felt some doubts as to the wisdom of this policy.-1-*   These restrictions   rro the result of a number of decisionsgiven from time to time, but the broad effect  Eay be ounmcriaedas limiting bombing operations against targets in occupied territory to circumstances in which the likelihood of the lossof life to civilians was reduced to the minimum.

It was also suggested in -discussion that there were other military targets whichwould repay bombing better.     For example,dumps, camps and so forth.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said thatall these targets would be bombedi     After some preliminary doubts, he was now in favour of thepolicy of bombing railway targets rather thanattacking, say, German oil targets.     He was satisfied that attacks on railway targets were,the best way of assisting in the initial stages of OVERLORD.Discussion then turned on theconsideration that these attacks were likelyto involve heavy casualties, on the Frenchcivilian population.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that at the present moment the prestige of the Royal Air Force stood very high in occupied territories on account oftheir reputation for accurate bombing.     Thisgood repute of the Royal Air Force would be lost if these attacks were carried out.Secondly, he feared that the French railwaymenwould no longer give us the substantial help which we now received from them in the way of sabotage.     Thirdly, he feared that these attacks would affect our position in France andBelgium vis-a-vis Russia (whose reputation inthese -countries now stood very high) and mightbe a handicap to us in re-establishing ourrelations with these two countries after the warTHE PRIME MINISTER agreed that attackswhich involved very heavy casualties on theFrench civil population might have serious repercussions.     It was true that the AmericanAir Force would carry out the attacks with us,but even so our relations with the French mightsuffer a set-back.     In any case, he felt that before action in the sense proposed was decided upon, the policy should receive the endorsement of President Roosevelt and Mr. Hull.The proposal to issue a preparatorywarning was also referred to, and the view was expressed that the Germans would make itimpossible for the French railway workers toleave the vicinity of tho railway centres.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were asfollows:-(1)   The. question of bombing railwaytargets in occupied territories should be considered by the DefenceCommittee at a meeting to be   held that week.     It would be convenient if the meeting could have before thema report compiled by the Intelligenceauthorities as to the probable re-

actions of French opinion to the bombing policy proposed.     TheChiefs of Staff were asked to give directions for a report on theselines to be prepared.(2)   ; In the meantime, the Foreign office should prepare1 a draft communication to tlie U.S. authorities on thesubject.(3)     For the present Allied bombers should,be restricted to bombing thoserailway targets in occupied territories which could be attacked with relatively little&quot;risk of injury to the civil population.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W. 1,-3-

MINUTE hConfidential Annex(3rd April, 19kk - 5.30 p0m.)THE PRIME MINISTER reviewed recent developments in the Italian situation consequent on the Russiandecision to exchange representatives with the BadoglioGovernment.     That decision had strengthened the positionof Marshal Badoglio, had eliminated Communist opposition,and had brought out the weakness of.the Bari grdup.From our point of view, the more representative, andthe stronger, the Italian Government we had to dealwith, the betterj    and to the extent that the Russianmoves had strengthened Marshal Badoglio9s position, hewelcomed them.   - He thought it quite likely that we might now achieve the objectives suggested by theForeign Secretary at an earlier stage, i^his telegram1783 of 29th February to Washington.   /The broad effectof this telegram was that we should make it clear that wecould tolerate no attempts to change the Italianadministration, or the position of King &quot;Victor, until after the capture of Rome;   but that thereafter we expected a solution to be built up round the crown prince Umberto who might either become Lieutenant ofthe Realm, or become King on his Father&apos;s abdication.yThe Prime Minister added that we must bear inmind the proviso that, even after we.had reached Rome,the basis of any Italian Government could not be finally settled, as it would have to be still furtherbroadened by the introduction of elements from Milanand the North.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY remarked that, reviewing the situation as it had developed, he was left with considerable doubt as to the motives which had animatedthe Russians.     He could not altogether exclude thepossibility that their ultimate object might be   oheestablishment of a Communist Government in Italy, at alater stage, and he feared that that, rather thancollaboration, might be what had really been in their minds,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that Italy was an Anglo-American theatre of war.     Russia had not now and never had had any Forces in that area, to the    .-subjugation of which she had made no military contribution.    .The decisive voice in issues such as &amp;the present ought, he felt, to rest with those who htiicarried the burden.     He reminded the War Cabinet thatwe were not claiming to interfere with the Russianhandling of the situation in conquered or liberated countries in Eastern Europe.     In his view it would bewell to allow the situation to develop and he saw noreason for uneasiness at this stage.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1*
