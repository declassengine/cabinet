If the President adhered to the attitudeindicated, this would mean that no agreement could be concluded between the U.S., the French and ourselves on Civil Affairs.  .

THE PRIME MINISTER said that we might haveto indicate that the U.S. Government and ourselves wouldmake separate statements on this matter.Reference was also made to the fact that, as atpresent advised, although representatives of certain other countries occupied by the enemy would be makingbroadcasts on D-day, no arrangement had been made fora representative of France to broadcast.
