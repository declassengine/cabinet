(lih) U9TH conclusions confidential Annex(li+th April, - 12 Noon)DISCUSSIONSUNDERARTICLE VII(previous reference:W.M. (kh) 2ZvthConclusions^Minute 3)The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda:-.   (i) By the Secretary&apos;of State for Dominion Affairs(W.P. (1+4) 192), covering the agreed summaryof discussions with the officials fromthe Dominions and India;(ii) By the Chancellor of the Exchequer(&quot;,.&apos;.P. (Uk) 198), setting out his views onthe proposed International Monetary Fund,and dealing with the procedure in connectionwith the proposed publication of theStatement of Principles for the Fund;(iii) By the President of the Board of Trade.(V/.P. (hh) 199). summarising the proposals for commercial policy as they stood after therece,nt conference with officials from theDominions and India.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he was anxious that the War Cabinet should reach conclusions on their general attitude towards the scheme for anInternational Monetary Fund.     The question had assumed added urgency since it now appeared that president Roosevelt desired a further international conference this summer which would clearly have to be seized of the Statement of Principles which had beenagreed in the discussions between the official representatives of the United States and the UnitedKingdom,     Mr. Morgenthau who, he thought, was undera good deal of pressure from the President, had strongly urged that unless the scheme &quot;can bepublished next week at the latest, it would not be practicable to have an International Conference in May.In that case, there was no saying if and when aConference could be held.&quot;The Chancellor said that in his Memorandum(W.P.(hh) 193) he had suggested that, subject to the qualifications set out in paragraph-3* the objective of the International Monetary Union was sound andthat it could usefully be pursued in a further international Conference.    He gathered from his communications with Mr. Morgenthau that the conference would not be of Ministers, but a wider discussion onthe official level following on the discussions that had already taken place.      He trusted that the War

Cabinet would feel able to agree to publication ofthe Statement of Principles.      In his judgment, itwould be very awkward to fall out with the UnitedStates on that issue.    It was relevant that two plansproduced by Mr. White and Lord Keynes respectively hadalready been published,yt&amp;g-othcr- with- a Keynes - Whiteplan which embodied some of the features of both.    Thetwo- important points outstanding on the Statement of[Principles were:-(a) Publication of the proposed quotas of different countries.(&quot;b) The arrangements for the management of the fund and that it should be non-political.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said he was strongly opposed to publication.     The Plan was the same oldPlan, with certain suggestions for modification/     Therewas nothing .new in those suggestions.      In accepting the Plan, we would be going contrary to the view ofthe Bank of England, the Joint Stock Banks, and asubstantial body of political opinion.      The questionwhether the Plan was. the gold standard or not was oneof fact.     The Bank of England,. he-contended, held that it was.      The Joint Stock Banks were opposed toit for the same reason.     Lord Keynes was unique in-the financial community in supporting the Chancellor&apos;view..     It was important that Lord Catto should be &apos;consulted and that, before expressing a final opinion,he should consult his staff who were opposed to thescheme.     He had no doubt that if we did not sustain the sterling bloc, the result would be a flight fromsterling, and he regarded the statement made by theBank of England (quoted in W.P.(hh) 121) as supporting the view that the sterling bloc could be sustainedwithout the assistance of the United States.      There .was grave danger that we should repeat the cycle ofevents-which started in 1922 with the American debtsettlement, and&apos; ended in&apos; 1931.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that itwould be impossible to sustain sterling&apos;without some assistance from the United States.     He thought thatthe Bank of England agreed with him.     It was, ofcourse, vital to maintain the sterling bloc;   but therewas nothing in the present plan inconsistent&apos;with thataim.    If; on the other hand, wo antagonised the UnitedStates, the generous assistance needed from thatcountry would not be made available,,    Opinion critical of the scheme could not be well-founded or based on a&apos;knowledge of the facts since no publicity had beengiven to the plan.     That, indeed, was one of thearguments that weighed with him in favour of publication now.      We could reasonably take the line in publishing that this was a plan which had beendiscussed between the technical experts;    that itsobjective was good:    that its machinery admittedlymight not be the best, but that publication wouldelicit the views of the leaders of the bankingindustry (and not only in this country) when thequestion of machinery could be reviewed Internationally.Refusal to agree even to publication would, he feared,antagonise our friends and those who were anxious toco-operate with us in the United States.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that he   -was not against publication, but he was strongly opposed to our committing ourselves  to the objective of the scheme.      He regarded the plan as a gold standardplan with easements, and as one which was not&apos;consistent with maintaining stability  of the,international price level, or full emp. oyment.     Inthe event of its adoption, sterling must lose caste.He believed that the Bank of England&apos;s fears were well-founded from that point of view.      The scheme,too, was intimately bound up with the commercial policy scheme to which reference was made in theMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(W.P. (Uh) 199)*  the object of which was to encouragepromiscuous trade.     We were, he feared, beingcommitted, step by step to the course of policy that - -had failed so disastrously for us and for the worldover the period 1925 to 1931s. merely in order togratify the United States.      The whole objective ofthe scheme was wrong.-     In his opinion, trade shouldbe regulated in the national interest, with GreatBritain first;    the Empire second, and the rest ofthe world third.THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION made three points. .First, he could not accree that international controlof rates of exchange was not an objective to which weshould subscribe.     His business experienceconvinced him that tho groat obstacle to theexpansion of international trade was the absenceof a medium of exchange.Secondly, it was a fantasy to think thatconfidence in the sterling area would be helped by making sterling inconvertible.      The real danger tothe stability of the sterling area lay primarily inthe dangerous position which would arise if heavysterling balances had to be blocked at the end of thewar and sterling declared inconvertible.Thirdly, the present scheme pre-supposed thatthe world would settle down before it was put intooperation.      It could not be used in the transitional period unless the scales had been reasonably balanced.He thought it most unlikely that we should reach that point under at least five to six years.     The clearingfacilities of  325,000,000 allowed us under the scheme would be adequate when a reasonable balance had beenestablished, say, in five or six years&apos;  time, but notat any earlier stage.     He saw nothing wrong, however,in the objective of the scheme.In reply to the Prime Minister,&apos;THE CHANCELLOROF THE EXCHEQUER confirmed that the Monetary Scheme,as embodied in the papers circulated under W. P.(Uh)l92,had been practically agreed between the technical experts on each side, and that Governments were&quot; not committed to it.    Mr. Morgenthau&apos;s replies to his enquiries as to the attitude of the United StatesGovernment had been somewhat difficult to follow buthe (the Chancellor) thought that the intention on theAmerican side was clearly that publication should not commit governments, but should provide a basis forfurther talks consequent to which, at a date whichmight well be quite far away, there should be apiKinouncement by the Governments concerned.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that- it seemed clearthat Mr., Morgenthau did not intend to commit theUnited States Government to this scheme.  , But it was &apos;essential that we should be clear as to the attitudeof the United States before publication.     He thoughtit very desirable that&apos;the scheme should be ventilatedand the reactions to it ascertained of expert opinion,of the general public, and of Parliament.      It was,however, equally important that we should not commit ourselves in any way in regard to it, or as regardsthe soundness of its objectives.     We should not go beyond publication, with a view to discussion, making it clear that the Government was entirely uncommitted,and that it was important that the public and Parlia-ment should have time to consider the valuable reportof the experts,,     He did not think there was any riskof the serious misunderstanding of this attitude by theUnited States,,   We must make clear to the United StatesGovernment what our attitude was.     He would be readyto assist in&quot; the drafting of the communications.    The.line of any public statement might be that there *wouldbe general agreement that the ideal to be arrived atwas the largest possible volume of beneficial exchangeof goods and services throughout the world, coupled with reasonable stability in price movements..      There might be a case for&apos; a reference to full employment, giventhe attitude of the Australian Government on thematter. ;THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that hewas in favour of publication, without conimitment.Vie ought, however, to be clear what line would beadopted in an early debate.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that this might be on the lines which the Prime Minister had indicated.     -He would, himself, have liked tq go further and say that he regarded as sound the objective of the scheme (which he would have defined as being in general terms &quot;to provide machinery for the orderly   regulation of exchanges with a view topromoting the fullest possible expansion ofinternational trade&quot;).     But it was clear that therewas not general support in the Cabinet for our doing so and he did not think it essential to go so far.THE PAYMASTER GENERAL expressed his agreementwith the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     Hewas in favour of publication;    he was in agreementalso with the objective and thought that any difficulties could be overcome by careful phrasing ofany announcement.     There was obvious advantage in discussion which would get this matter into the open.THE .MINISTER OP STATE was in favour of publishing the Statement of Principles but of disclaiming any commitment.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that, while fullyaccepting the explanations which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had given, he still had an uneasy fear that in some way the scheme would anchor us to gold.The point was,&apos; at any rat,e, debatable, and those whohad had the experiences of 1925 to &quot;1931 might beexcused for feeling uneasy.      THE CHANCELLOR OP THEEXCHEQUER felt that there was no real foundation forthese apprehensions.      The object of this scheme wasto enable the relations of national currencies togold to be adjusted from time to time.    This was essentially/ a machinery plan.

A short discussion then ensued on commercial policy.      THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADEmentioned that he had received a request from thePrime Minister to prepare and circulate-a summary ofthe main points that had emerged from the discussions on commercial policy with the Dominions, and suggestedthat a discussion might be adjourned until this wasin the possession of Ministers.      The Dominionsdiscussions had,  in his judgment, been very valuable;But the time was not yet ripe for the publication ofthe commercial plan, though it might be useful if further conversations on the technical level couldtai-:e place with United States representatives so thatthe technical plan could be brought to the same pointof development as the plan on monetary policy.      TheUnited States Government were not pressing for its publication and it would be desirable to discuss withthe Dominion Prime Ministers before publication wasconsidered further.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESsuggested that the commercial plan had already been disclosed in the United States, and felt that thiswas an argument for publication in the United Kingdom.- The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows:-International Monetary Fund(1.) It was agreed, in principle, that, subjectto the settlement of outstanding points,we . should offer no objection to the-publication at a very early date of theStatement of Principles for an international monetary Fund, which.had resulted from thetechnical discussions, on a non-committalbasis, between the off icials of H.M. treasury and the U. S, Treasury.(2) When the Statement of Principles was published,  it should be accompanied by afurther statement which would make itclear that while H.M,&apos; Government regarded the scheme as a valuable contribution toour objectives in the field of international trade,H.M. Government were in no way committed to. it;   and that they wished thescheme to be the subject of informeddiscussion in Parliament and elsewhere before any commitment was undertaicen,,* THE SECRETARY OP STATE POP DOMINION affairs referred to-the position, of the Dominions.     He wasin favour of publication, and felt that we should probably have no choice but to .accept the early dateof publication for which the United States Governmentwere pressing,      It was, however, unfortunate, from&apos;the Dominion point of view since -most of their PrimeMinisters were actually en route to this country.    Ifthe Prime Minister&apos;s formula were adopted, that wouldease matters, but he felt that it was essential that&apos;an immediate explanation should be,given to theDominions so that, if they desired, they could publishsimultaneously with any announcement here.      the argument could be used that the United States were going to publish in any event and - that We should haveno option in those circumstdnces but to agree.

(3) It would be necessary to arrive at, an understanding with the U.S. Governrnenrt as tothe general line of the statements to bemade by both Governments when the &quot;schemewas published.      In particular, it would benecessary -to make quite certain what was, theattitude of the U.5. Government in thismatter.    Would their attitude be non-committal;    or were they in the position of .sponsoring the scheme, and inviting other nations to adhere.to it?(Lj.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;undertook tosubmit to the Prime Minister a draft telegram to the U. 3.- Government informing them of thegeneral lines of the statement which we suggested should be made (see conclusion (3))*and&apos;enquiring as to the U.S. Government&apos;attitude towards the scheme.   1(5) The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs undertook to inform the Dominion PrimeMinisters of the reasons why it had been necessary to agree to publication of theStatement of Principles for the international monetary Fund-at this juncture* and also of our general attitude in regard to the  .schemeCommercial Policy(6) The time was not yet ripe for publicationof the proposed scheme for the commercial union.      In the first place the discussions in regard to it were not so far advancedas were those on monetary matters.     Inthe second place, it was desirable thatthere should be discussion with the-Dominion Prime Ministers, before publication.(7) The President of the Board -of Tradeundertook to submit to the War Cabinet amemorandum setting out the main points for decision in regard to the proposed commercial union, as a basis for discussion by theWar Cabinet prior to the meeting with theDominion Prime Ministers.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.1Y
