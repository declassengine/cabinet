MINUTE confidential Annex(22nd May, 1944 - 6,0 p..rrio)PORTUGALSupply of wolfram tothe Axis(previous reference:W,M.(43) 145 th conclusions,Minute k)0THE SECRETARY OP ST*lTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSbriefly reviewed the latest developments in connectionwith the supplies of wolfram from   Portugal to the Axis.We had put* to the United States a compromise proposal,the effect of which would have been to restrict ship-ments to the Axis over the next four months to some20 tons a month, as against, say, 150 tons a month atpresent.     The State Department had, however, pressed strongly that we should require Portugal to impose acomplete embargo on exports of wolfram to the axis power.     The position thereafter had been complicated by a suggestion from the Combined Chiefs of Staff thatthe moment had&apos;now come to invoke, our alliance withPortugal, and ask Dr. Salazar to come into the war onour side and, in the meantime, to put a temporaryembargo on wolfram.      The Foreign Secretary thoughtDr8- Salazar most unlikely to respond to a proposal suchas that suggested by the Combined Chiefs of Staff.Moreover, he felt that were we to put this suggestion to him, we should merely help him to spin outnegotiation, while all the time susbstantial suppliesof wolfram would be going to Germany.     He thoughthimself that the right course was to hold, despite thehesitations of the State Department, to the compromise proposal for wolfram restriction, under which exports would be reduced to some 20 tons a month.     He would himself regard such an arrangement as fairly satisfactory.THE I RIME MINISTER thought that the-wise course was to press our original proposal for restriction, andto keep in reserve for the present the invocation ofour alliance with Portugal.     That was a card whichcould be played with much greater effect after a victory,-     He felt that we were in a strong positionto press our case on the United States.    He read to theWar Cabinet a draft of a telegram which, subject totheir approval, he proposed to send to the President.The War Cabinet -Agreed that we should press for a drasticrestriction of wolfram supplies from Portugalto the -itxis Powers;    and invited the PrimeMinister to telegraph to President Roosevelton the lines proposed.-Offices of the Wa* -Cabinet,3.W.1.
