MINUTE confidential Annex(30th May, 1944 - 6.30 p.m.)PRANCE(previous references.M.(44) 66thConclusions,Minute 2).fr1THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought that theWar   Cabinet should be aware of the latest developments in connection with General de Gaulle&apos;s visit to thiscountry.     He now had it in mind to issue an invitation to him at dawn on D-Day.     The general would, he thought, need 48 hours&apos; notice and his journeywould take him 24 hours.      On his arrival, he wouldbe taken fully into confidence, and would be allowed tomake full use of his cyphers.      That would get overthe difficulties which would otherwise arise from thefact that General de Gaulle would be reluctant to visit this country unless he were entitled to communicate with his supporters, with due regard to security, andto operate his cyphers.     He thought that the best coursewould be to explain this to Ambassador Duff Cooper and ask the Ambassador to do what he could to get theGeneral in a good moodj    and to assure him that an invitation in the exact terms which he wished would reach him in due course.      On this programme the&quot; battlewhen the General arrived would be in full swing.There would be no difficulty thereafter about his payingvisits to such area in Prance as we might have occupied,and there were, he thought, various ways in which itwould be possible to gratify him without endangeringsecurity, consideration of which must be paramount.While the President had taken a very unbending linetowards the General and the French Committee he (thePrime Minister) felt that his attitude would be greatly influenced by the course of operations.     As regardsa possible declaration by General de Gaulle, the ambassador might be advised to say that, in his own interest, we trusted that he would decide not to makeany declaration or statement until after his arrival inthis country when he was in a position to know all thefacts which would, of course, be laid before him whenhe reached here,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS wasuneasy at the arrangements proposed.     He accepted theforce of the security arguments.     On the other hand,he was apprehensive that once France was entered,General de Gaulle would feel it essential to make some statement.      If he did so from Algiers, it might wellbe unhappily phrased.     Would it not be possible toarrange for him to arrive here on, or before D-day when any statement could be concerted with us?     he fully recognised the force of the arguments that had carried weight with the President.     But what was in issue nowwas our future relationship with France,rather than the position of General de Gaulle;    andhe was concerned at the position into which we might

-drift if the General were not to arrive herebefore D. Day.   We should not overlook that, asmatters were developing^ we (with the United States)risked having to carry all the odium, while at thesame time General de Gauile&apos;a position would hefbrtSfled even with those of his fellow countrymen who might not he sympathetic to him.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR was disposed to thinkthat on the broad view it would be wiser to face theri3ks of misunderstanding by General de Gaulle and ofhis making an unwise and premature declaration, and to postpone his arrival until after D. Day.   He enquiredthe reasons which carried weight with the Presidentin relation to the recognition of the french committee of National Liberation.- THE PRIME MINISTER said that what had weighedwith him personally so far had been the argument of security which, he felt, was of decisive importance.He had himself suggested to the President this visit by General de Gaulle, together with three of hisGovernment, and had made it clear that as the decisivehour approached, we felt it indispensable to have some kind of understanding with the French national committee.    The Prime Minister then read to the WarCabinet the text of his telegrams No. 682 of 26th Mayand No. 68h of 27th May to President Roosevelt and president Roosevelt&apos;s reply of 27th May (No. 5kh).^inee the date of that telegram we had endeavoured tosecure American concurrence in the inclusion in the proclamation which General Eisenhower was to issueof a reference to the leadership of the Committeeof National Liberation, but without success, and ithad been made clear that the matter was one on whichthe United States Chiefs of Staff were not in aposition to express any View as it was being dealt withhy the President.The Prime Minister felt that the argument that carried decisive weight with the president was the fear that we might be forcing on the Frencha Government, as to the entire value of which we might still be uncertain, without the people of France havirghad a chance to express their views.   He could not himself but regard it as fundamental that we shouldnot risk any misunderstanding with the Presidentmerely because of General de Gaulle.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR suggested that thedifficulty was how to reconcile our anxiety to havesomeone to deal with on behalf of France withoutimposing the individual in question on the french people as their leader.   He assumed that we wishedto see in being a body with which we could deal asan administration and which would pull the loosestrings together?   Might it not be possible to getthe President to go so far as that limited objective?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that we were concerned to get in the first place an arrangement over civil affairs, and secondly, the implementation of the decree which the french committee had themselves recorded as to the actionsthey should take after their return to France.   Heagain suggested that we should very seriously consider making arrangements which would ensure that

General de Gaulle arrived in this country perhapson the night before D. Day or even a little earlier,and he repeated his apprehensions of the possibleevil affect on future relations with France of adopting too uncompromising a view on this matter.THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER though there wasa real risk that the attitude favoured by thePresident, as disclosed in the telegrams that hadbeen read, would put General de Gaulle on a pinnacleand give him the satisfaction of a grievance andthe support of elements which would not otherwisesympathise with him,, but which would feel that hehad been badly treated.   We should not overlookthat the Committee of French Liberation containedelements accredited by the resistance movement inFrance.THE PRIME MINISTER &quot;said that in the early days after our landing, in battle conditions,there would be no question of a civil Governmentin France.   Conditions might well change after wegained further ground, and when that happened there might be problems which the Committee of national liberation could best solve by dealing with the localFrench authorities.    He fully accepted, on theother hand, the force of the arguments advanced in the discussion.   He suggested that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff should be invitedto consider, as a matter of urgency in the Chiefsof Staff Committee, what disadvantages, comparedwith the proposal that General de Gaulle should beInvited at dawn on D. Day to visit this country,there would be, from the military and securitypoint of view, if the invitation to visit thiscountry were to be issued to him 24 or, alternatively,48 hours before D. Day, coupled with the mostbinding instructions to him as to the Vitalimportance of absolute secrecy as to his movements.The War Cabinet -Endorsed the Prime Ministerfe proposalat X and invited the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to take action accordinglyand to report as a matter of urgency.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.-3-
