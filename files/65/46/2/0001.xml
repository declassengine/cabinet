ftWM DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC BflAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.Copy No.... ?..It is issued for the personal use of.........S^&amp;s*tc^.Tap aMOST SECRET.(Ui,) U7TH CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 2&apos; Confidential Annex(,11th April, 19hh - SoO p0m0 )OREIGN AFFAIRSoumaniaPreviousReference:W.M. (43) 176th.Conclusions,Minute k)THE PRIME MINISTER said that the rapid russian advance into Roumanian territory greatly affected theposition of that country      As the War Cabinet knew&quot;,Prince Stirbey had been in Caiiso for some time with aview,to negotiations;   but for some time past he hadnot been able to get any answer from his country.Meanwhile, the Russians had now told us that they wanted to settle the minimum armistice terms which could beaccepted from Roumanian........These-.were as follows:-(a) Roumania should rupture relations with theGermans and join in the struggle against them.(b) The&quot;Roumanian-Soviet frontier would be established in accordance with the Agreement of 1940 (this meant that Bessarabia came back to Russia],(c) The Soviet Union would be indemnified for the losses inflicted on its territory, as a resultof hostilities and Roumanian occupation.(d) All Soviet and Allied prisoners of war andinternees would be repatriated.(e) No demand was made that Roumanian territory should be occupied during the Armistice by soviet troops, but Soviet and Allied troops,must be able to move freely across Roumanianterritory if the military situation so demanded,(f) The .Soviet Government considered the ViennaAward to be unjust and was ready to conductoperations jointly with Roumania against theHungarians and Germans, with a view to the. restoration to Roumania of the whole ofTransylvania or the greater part: thereof.(g) If Roumania wished, for the purpose of contact with the Soviet Union, to have besides a General. Officer as representative for military questions,a Political Officer for political questions,, theSoviet Government.would have no objection.The Prime Minister referred to the question ofthe restoration of Transylvania to Roumania.      This was,Of course, an important matter.     The Foreign Officetook the view that Roumania had as good, if not abetter, right to Transylvania than Hungary.     This hadbeen the view taken at the end of the last war.    It was

no doubt, undesirable to make a final settlement of a territorial question in advance of the Peace Conference.But the object of getting Roumania to change sidesjustified, in his view, talcing prompt action.      He(the Prime Minister) had, therefore, sent a telegram toM. Molotov to the effect that we were in agreement withthe terms proposed subject to two points.     First, we suggested the addition to the clause dealing withTransylvania of the words &quot;subject to confirmation atthe Peace Settlement&quot;.     He had also asked that theBritish and U.c. Governments should&apos; have representatives on political matters accredited to the roumanian government if Roumania changed sides and joined theAllies,  just as the Russians had a political -roproocnt--seMs^ss^a^d^^Sonxb-oi CgaE^Bsagrgggfr Italy.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the text of the telegram which he had sent to M.. Molotovcovering these points, and of a reply which he had just received saying that M. Molotov agreed on both matters.As regards Transylvania, it was proposed to add to theclause the words &quot;This to be .subject to approval at thePeace Settlement&quot;.Discussion of this matter had led.to considerationof the frontiers between Bulgaria and Roumania.      Itwas pointed out that nothing had been saitl about this in the draft minimum armistice terms prepared by theSoviet Government.&apos;MR. BRUCE said that the Russian habit ofembodying in the Armistice Terms what was proper to a peace Treaty might well lead to trouble with theDominion Governments.     He had thought it right, inview of his knowledge of the views of the australian government, to inform them at once of the Russianproposals in regard to Roumania, and to explain to themthat it had been necessary to act so quickly that prior consulation with the Dominions had not been possible.He thought, however, that there was a risk that some ofthe other Dominions might take the.point amiss unless it was explained to them very carefully.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked Mr. Bruce for theaction which he had taken in regard to the australian government, and said that the point should certainly be&apos;borne in mind, and an appropriate telegram sent to thePrime, Ministers of the other Dominions,land THE PRIME MINISTER acquainted the War Cabinet withthe latest developments in the Russo-Polish situation,&quot;previous He was informed by the Prime Minister of Poland that aieferenoe: much better situation had supervened in relation to the.M.(1)4) i+Oth       underground movement.      In obedience - to the instructionsonclusions, of the Polish Government in London, that movement,minute 1) despite certain unfortunate incidents in the early stages, had continued to co-operate with the advancingRussians who, as they moved further west,- became increasingly conscious of its widespread character,reality and power.     An agreement&apos; had now been reached between the Russian armies, with the approval of the(D Soviet Government, and the underground Polish leaders,with the approval of the Polish Government in London.That agreement (the text of which the Prime Ministerread to the War Cabinet), while providing for the

operational subordination of the underground movementto the Soviet, also contained, provisions v/hichrecognised the existence of the Polish authorities in warsaw and in London, and re^rded their approval ofthe arrangements now reached.     The Prime&quot;Ministerregarded this development as, full of hope,,   He hadno doubt that the attitude which His majesty&apos;s government had adopted and. the stiff terms of the latestcommunication which he had made to Premier Stalin, had had their influence on the Russian attitude, and hewas confirmed in the view he had expressed at an earlier stage that, despite the somewhat intransigenttone adopted by the Russians in their diplomaticcorrespondence with us, they might in practice provemuch more accommodating than theyusere anxious to allowus to anticipate.The War Cabinet took.note with satisfaction ofthis information.inland THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the latest developments in the Russo-Finnish situation.     HePrevious - could not but regard the indemnity demanded by the references Soviet Government as excessively heavy, nor could it beW.M. (IHh) i3rd       overlooked that we had British interests to protect in conclusions,        Finland.     At the same time, if this were the onlyMinute k) obstacle, he thought that it would be to the interestof the Finns now to reach a settlement with the Russianseven on the onerous terms put forward, in the hope thatthe indemnity clause would come under review at the timeof the Peace Conference as part of the general settlement to be reached with Russia.*benefices of the War Cabinet,3.W.1.,
