(44)43rdConclusions,Minute 3)iff-THE PRIME MINISTER said that since the matter had last been discussed by the War Cabinet,  the DefenceCommittee had held weekly meetings.     The first estimateof between 80,000 and 160,000 casualties, of which per-haps a quarter would be killed, had now been reduced to an 1estimate or io,00u killed^     The bombing which had alreadyeen carried out, which had included attacks on targetswhere the heaviest casualties weretOjjjbesxpected, had shown that the total number of ^^^^luintllcd&apos; was likelyto fall below the revised estimate     To date, some 3S000to 4*000 persons had been killed and the cost of thefull programme m.ight work out at approximately 12,000killed-a^v-A. /X-*J*\ r\*.a.\%i L*-^**X-*A .The attacks had, however, offered the Germancontrolled Vichy propagardists an advantage which they hadnot been slow to seize, and there was no doubt that thepeople of Prance were feeling the results of the bombing vary much.He recalled that when the policy was firstmooted there had been considerable differences ofopinion among the experts as to its value.     At ameeting of the Defence Committee the previous evening,he had felt that the majority of his political colleaguewere agreed that the plan should not be proceeded with.He was also disturbed by the disproportionate efforts of the British and American Air Forces, respectively,,So far the R.A.F. had dropped some 12 times the weight of bombs dropped by American aircraft, and he felt that therewas a danger that we should later bo told that thegreat loss of French life was entirely due to the blindnight bombing Carried, out by the British,,He was. not satisfied that the strategic merits of the plan justified its continuance, and it was certainlywrong on humanitarian grounds.    No doubt if the bombingwere continued for a sufficiently long period, the effectmight be   sufficient to interfere with the enemy&apos;military movements.      But he did not believe that such an effect could be achieved in the relatively short tineavailable and thought that attacks on other targets,such as large dumps and parks of mechanical transport,would be more effective.      If, in the heat of battle,, itwere decided that it was necessary to attack a part-particular railway target to stop movement of enemy forces,then he would agree that any casualties which might beinflicted on friendly civilians must be accepted.      Thepresent attacks, however, were not being carried out.in theheat of battle,  and if we continued to kill large numbersof French civilians,  there might well be a change in french feelings towards us.

j He thought he should tell the President thatwe saw grave objection to the plan on political grounds and had grave doubts as to its merits on strategicalgrounds.      On balance, we felt that it might well do more    evil than good.     The time available&quot;was not sufficient to achieve the effect desired and there were     \other targets which,  if not quite so good as railway centres from the point of view of assistance to&quot;OVERLORD;.1 would produce valuable results without incurring the hatred of the Frenoh people.     We thought,therefore, /that attacks on railway centres should beonfined to those targets where heavy casualties tothe civilian population were not likely to be caused, andthat the bombing plan should be revised to includeI   targets such as MoT. parks, dumps, aircraft factories and&apos;!   targets in- Germany.Before despatching the telegram, he would discuss the matter with the Supreme Allied CommandersTHE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION said he was informed .by the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London Midlandand. Scottish Railway   that, for strategical reasons, theFrench railways had widely dispersed their, repair fac-ilities;    and that, contrary to the practice on theBritish or German systems, their repair sheds wereequipped to manufacture spare parts as well as to carryout overhauled      One railway alone had 70 such centres,and it was estimated that there were approximately 350serving the whole railway system of France.     His informanthad expressed the view that the French railways could notbe knocked &quot;out, by attach a on thols? repair and servicingfacilities? to a sufficient extent to prevent the raovo-ment of troops,,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR-   said that hecertainly did not like bombing targets in France.He would much prefer to bomb-germany      The present plan, however, did not cause any appreciable diversion of effort from Germany in the dark periods which weresuitable for such attacks;    it did provide for the full employment   of the bomber force during the moon periodswhich were not suitable for attacks on German   targets.He agreed that a number of Air officers had opposed the plan in the early stages.      They had however oeen convinced by a study of all possible alternatives that there was no other plan which offered the same prospect of assisting &quot;OVERLORD&quot;.Enemy dumps, camps and vehicle,   parks would be attacked in due course0     But once such objects were attacked, we must expect the enemy to adopt a policy ofdispersal, and it would therefore be v/iser to leave such attacks until nearer the time of the battlecHe pointed out th&amp;t the German controlled Vichybroadcasts had had to admit that there were largenumbers of Frenchmen who asked that&quot;the British and americans should continue their bombingo     He asked the Cabinet to consider the position shortly after ourassault had been launched, and when German counter-attacks were developing.      The crucial point was&apos; to defeat thesecounter-attacks, and he did not see any grounds to justifythe adoption of a second best plan, in preference to onedesigned to hamper the movement of the enemy troops to oppose our landing.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the seriousness of the problem   arose from the length of time over which     -the attacks were to be made.      The long continuance of the attacks would, he felt, gradually alienate the mass ofFrench opinion.     He would be prepared to face this prospectif he were convinced that the attacks were essential to thesiiccess of the battle.     He did not, however, believe thatthis was the case, and felt the plan should be reconsideredand attacks confined to phbs&amp; railway centres where the risk to the civilian population was small, and that the remainder of our effort should be diverted to other targets.THE LORD PRESIDENT agreed with the views    - -expressed by the Foreign Secretaryc     He was not afraid of the effects of Vichy propaganda, but of the effects on french public opinion of the attacks themselves, which,he felt, would arouse hostility in those areas where wemost needed help.     He did not think that the case for theplan showed that it was of sufficient assistance to&quot;OVERLORD&quot; to outweigh the political disadvantages itentailed.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF read a statement36expressing the agreed views of the Chiefs of Staff.      Hehad himself examined the plan and possible alternativesin detail, and had discussed them with the Deputy supreme commander and the Air Commander-in-Chief, allied expeditionary Air Force.     As a result, he was convincedthat there was no alternative plan which offered an equalprospect of helping the army to resist the German counter-offensive.     This conviction was shared by the supreme allied Commander. &apos; .THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said that&quot; he had always been of the opinion that attacks on railway centres would havea long term effect.     He understood this opinion had alsobeen expressed by many of the railway experts with whomthe plan   had been discussed in its early stageseThe Air Commander-in-Chief had himself at onetime spoken of extending the attacks over a period offrom 6 to 9 months     He (the Paymaster General) did notbelieve that in the time available the plan could achieve the reduction in the capacity of the French railways whichwas necessary if military movements were to be affected.He suggested that an alternative plan should beprepared, which should include attacks on railways yardswhere the estimated number of fatal casualties was lessthan say 100, and attacks on such targets as dumps,vehicle parks arid military camps.      If it were decided tocontinue with the present policy, we should insist on the americans assuming a full share of responsibility.THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION said that when the attacks were first launched the French, had believed ourinvasion to be imminent,,      As time had passed and the attacks had been continued with no sign of an invasion, theFrench mood had shown signs of changing,     He thought this change would become more marked.It was significant that Swiss Broadcasts and newspapers, which had previously been friendly towards us, now expressed horror at the results on the civilian population of our attacks on railway centres.      He felt thatthe continuance of such attacks would not only turn theFrench,and such friendly neutrals as still remained, against us, but would also be opposed by home opinion.*   Annex-3-

The War Cabinet -(a) Agreed that the plan for bombingk targets in enemy occupied, territory should be revised to include attacks on only those railway centres where- y, the estimated casualties did not&apos;&apos;  . exceed 1O0/15Os and that consideration should be given to including attacks on such targets as dumps, militarycamps and vehicle parks;(b) Took note that the Prime minister would prepare a telegram to thePresident on the lines suggested atlX&apos; above, and that he would discuss this telegram with the supreme allied Commander before despatchingit.Offices of the War Cabinet, S0W.1*-h-

ANNEXBOMBING OF FRENCH RAILWAY CENTRESI-o The Plan now in process of execution and.approximately one third completed is based on the belief that the smooth working of the railways in occupied territory during the critical period following the&quot;OVERLORD&quot; assault will be of importance to the Germans.2. The principle on which the Plan is conceived isthat the destruction of some 60 railway centres in voccupied territory, particularly of the repair andservicing facilities and the locomotives to be found inthese centres, will greatly reduce the German capacity for rapid movement of troops by rail and will restrict the number of alternative routes available.3. It is contended that when once the generalefficiency of the railways has been lowered and whenthe number of alternative routes has been reduced itwill be possible by air action after the assault toimpose far more serious delays on movement than wouldhave been possible if the railway system were relativelyintact at that time.ki No-one has been able to produce an alternative plan for the employment of the bomber strength availablein sueh a way as to offer an equal prospect of helping the Army to resist     the German counter offensive.5. It therefore seems that if the railway plan hasto be cancelled on political grounds this will mean that&quot;OVERLORD&quot; will be launched with some thing less than thebest possible chance.      How much less no-one can say,nor is it possible either to affirm or to deny that thismargin may be decisive.      The military advice which, theChiefs of Staff offer is that everything which ispolitically feasible should be done to give &quot;OVERLORD&quot;the best possible chance and they therefore recommendthat the Plan should proceed unless political considerations are held to be over-riding.27th-April. 19liU
