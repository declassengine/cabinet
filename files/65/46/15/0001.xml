THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he thought that therehad perhaps been some misunderstanding on the subject.     Heread to the War Cabinet an extract from a note made by his private Secretary (who had acted as interpreter at themeeting between General Bedell Smith and General  0 Gaulle).The effect of this note was that General Bedell Smith had.indicated to General de Gaulle that if he wanted certain modifications made in General Eisenhower&apos;s broadcast heshould indicate what they were, provided, of course, thatthe framework was not changed.     He had also said that theapproval of the Combined Chiefs of Staff would have to beobtained to any alterations. . -THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the time when this discussion had taken place on the previous day,, ithad been thought that D. day would have to be postponed for at least three days, in which event there might have been time to refer any proposed amendments to the combined chiefs Of Staff.     In present circumstances this was outof the question.FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS pointed out thatGeneral de Gaulle had said on the previous day. that, ifhe had not been invited to visit this country, he wouldhave broadcast from Algiers.     He thought thatGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s attitude indicated that he preferred to broadcast independently, and not as part of a programmecomprising several other broadcasts.     He did not thinkthat General de Gaulle was likely to say anythingindiscreet or embarrassing when he broadcast.     In fact,General de Gaulle, by refusing to broadcast on this occasion, had missed a golden opportunity to get himself on to the right alignment.     This would have unfortunateconsequences, for General de Gaulle but not for us.     Inany case there was nothing which we could do about thematter now, as it was too late to start any further negotiation.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that no action was called for on our part.     He would be content thatGeneral de Gaulle should go back to Algiers as soon asthe operation had started.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY then read to the WarCabinet a message which had at that moment been received,reporting a telephone conversation between Major-GeneralGrasett and General Koenig.      The latter, under instructions from General de Gaulle, had said that hecould not agree to the French Liaison&apos; Officers accompanyingour forces across the Channel, because General de gaulle had not reached any agreements with the Americans and ourselves on civil affairs-     /The duty    of theseLiaison Officers was to point out to the AlliedCommanders, when in. France, the right people on whom toplace the responsibility for carrying on civil affairs./General Grasett was sending a written answer, in whichhe asked for confirmation, in writing, of the message which he had received and pointed out that the dutiesassigned to the French Liaison Officers had been laid downin a document which had been agreed with the French Committee.The action taken by Major-General Grasett was endorsed.

There was general agreement among Ministers thatthis action on the part of General de Gaulle was far more serious than his refusal to broadcast.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had had avery long and satisfactory talk with M, Vienot that afternoon.     In view of General de Gaulle&apos;s attitude he proposed to tell M. Vienot that there was no good in continuing discussions with him on civil affairs or,indeed, on other related matters.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if General de Gaullerefused to. agree to the Liaison Officers proceeding withOperation &quot;OVERLORD&quot; it would not be possible for us tohave any further discussions with General de Gaulle on civil or military matters.     It might even be necessaryto indicate that an aeroplane would be ready to take himback to Algiers forthwith.Later in the meeting a further message was brought in, to the effect that General Bedell Smithproposed that General Eisenhower should say, on the conclusiorof his; broadcast on D. day,, that General de Gaulle had come to this country and it was hoped, that he(General de Gaulle) would broadcast later on.; The War Cabinet agreed that no mention shouldbe made of General de Gaulle in General Eisenhower&apos;broadcast.      THE PRIME MINISTER undertook to convey thisdecision to General Bedell Smith.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.1.
