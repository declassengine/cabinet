(44)  68TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2Oqnfidential Annex. (24th May, 1 944 - 6.15 p. m. )proposed statement BYPRESIDENTROOSEVELTThe War Cabinet had before them a note by thePrime Minister (W.P. (44) 265) covering a personal telegram No. 541 of 20th May, from President roosevelt to the Prime Minister asking his views as to the issueof a statement by the President to the German peopleafter D-Day.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed satisfaction thathe should have the advice of Mr.. Curtin and field marshal Smuts in dealing with this matter.     He was anxious to help the President in every possible way,and for his own part he would be ready that thePresident should act as spokesman.       But he askedhimself whether it was well to issue an appeal to theGerman people not to fight at a time when the battlewas about to begin, and whether we would not in facttake serious risks in doing so.     He would rather thatany 3uch message was postponed.-   FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS said that he was uneasy atthe proposed message.      It was addressed to the Germanpeople, yet it was couched in the most casual and almostconversational language;    he did not like either the6tone or the occasion.     If the German, people were tobe addressed, either by the President or by the BigThree, that would be a very formal and important step,a step which had not yet been taken in the course ofthe war.     When President Wilson in 1918 had addressedthe German people he had made a formal declaration ofhis 14 points.     Any move of this character would beof great significance, and the question at what stage,and in what terms, the German people should beaddressedwas of first-class importance.     Psychologicallyhe thought this rather informal approach a   mistake.He did not himself feel that any message should issuebefore the battle.     It should be postponed until theGermans had been thoroughly beaten on all three fronts,and it should then be in a form to have the maximumeffect.     We had said nothing to Germany yet save&quot;unconditional surrender&quot; - a declaration that hadbeen very bad propaganda from our point of view.      Ournext word to Germany should be first-class propaganda,and we should make our first declaration a documentto which the German people would listen, and should,issue it at a time when they would pay most attentionto it.     We ought to tell the President that this was our feeling and that the moment before we started thegreat fight was inopportune;    and that the note to be struck would in any event require very carefulconsideration.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that a message to. the German people, whendespatched, would be as important as anything could be.It would in fact be the basis of a conclusion ofhostilities.     If it was so important he felt that it ought to be a statement by all three Leaders.      Therisk could not be overlooked that if a statement weremade by President Roosevelt alone, the Germans wouldbe left in doubt as to the views of Russia and thiscountry.MR.  CURTIN said that he did not like either the tone or the idea of the proposed message, or theseparatist treatment which it represented.       he recognised its importance from the point of.view ofthe German element in the United States,  and thepossible anxiety of the President from that point ofview to avoid a joint declaration now, and to moveaway from the basis of his previous declaration of&quot;unconditional surrender&quot; by a statement such as that proposed.     A statement such as that now proposed would, he felt, strike a division &quot;in the unity of theAllies in dealing with the war.THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;said he felt that this wasno moment to show weakness, and that the statement as drafted admitted of being construed almost as a peace offer.     He felt grave doubt as to its effecton German morale and suggested that, in view of theattitude of the Cabinet, he should inform the President,that the Cabinet hoped he would not pursue thisproposal, that we felt that a statement such as he proposed would have an unduly encouraging effect onour enemies, that any message to the German people should be postponed until we had secured a victory,and that the text of any communication to them ofthis character, which might conceivably be taken asa peace offer, must, in our view, be agreed betweenthe three major Allies.There was general agreement in the War Cabinetthat the arguments against a statement of this natureat this moment by the President were decisive.The War Cabinet -Agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s view and invited him to communicate with president Roosevelt in the sense whichhe had suggested.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.
