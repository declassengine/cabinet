(44) 61ST conclusions confidential Annex(2nd May, 1944 - 7.15 p.m.)BOMBING POLICY THE PRIME MINISTER said that as a result of the- last meeting of the War Cabinet at which this matter had been discussed he had spoken to General EisenhowerTargets in and had also sent him a letter enclosing a copy of occupied the War Cabinet1s conclusions, together with a summaryTerritory of the arguments which led them to oppose the policyof attacking railway centres.(Previous &apos;Reference; He had now. received General Eisenhower&apos;s reply.W.M.(44) 57th     This might be summarised as follows:-Conclusions,Minute 2) The political considerations involved had been realised throughout and it   was   in   thelight of these considerations that instructions had been given that two railway centres inthe Paris area should not be attacked untilWithin a few days of D-day and that other targets, where it was estimated that heavy casualties would be caused, should be leftuntil the end of the programme.     Thispostponement v/ould inevitably ftffect the fullefficacy    of the plan, but this handicap couldbe accepted in view of the weighty political considerations involved.   . General Eisenhowerhad gone on to point out that civilian casualties were inherent in any bombing plan.They had been caused by our attacks onsubmarine bases and on aircraft factories,and would certainly be entailed in attacks on headquarters and communication centres whichwould be of vital importance immediately priorto the assault.     Experience had shown thatthe casualties inflicted had been less than had been estimated, and that in a number ofcases many Germans had been killed.It had never been suggested that the plan wouldstop essential military movement.     its object was so to weaken and disorganise therailway system as a whole, that at the critical time German railway movements couldbe effectively delayed.     In this connection the delay which would be involved by theenforced .use of motor transport would initself be of inestimable value.C Alternative plans had been fully and sympatheticallyconsidered.     Some of the targets which hadbeen suggested were already scheduled for attack.&quot;     None of the alternative plans would effectively delay or disrupt enemy concentrations.

- If itwas   still considered that political considerations were such as to limit attacksto those centres where the estimated casualtieswould not exceed 100-150, General Eisenhowerthought such modification would emasculate p.the whole plan.     He concluded by statingthat the OVERLORD concept was based on theassumption that our overwhelming air power would be able to prepare the way for the assault., and that the extensive programme of bombing operations against various types ofmilitary targets planned to take place from        .   jD - 30 onwards, would inevitably involve considerable civilian casualties,,      If air operations were to be limited, the perils ofan already hazardous undertaking would be greatly enhanced.The Prime Minister said that General Eisenhowerhad an onerous responsibility and care should be taken not to add to his burdens unnecessarily,       Verygreat consequences might follow from interference -with his plan on political grounds.     He (the PrimeMinister) had not fully realised that our use of airpower before OVERLORD would assume so cruel andremorseless a form.      It was clear that great slaughterwould inevitably result from the air attacks planned in support of OVERLORD.      He felt that these air operations should be governed&quot;by some laws of warlaid down by the War Cabinet, and should be accompanied   Iby an immense programme of leaflet dropping, to warn the inhabitants of the threatened areas, even if this involved some additional risk to our airmen.      It was for the War Cabinet to decide whether they should send a statement of their views, together with general eisenhower&apos;s reply, to the President and ask his views.THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION said that he was concerned by the reaction of opinion in the occupied territories to the attacks on railway centres.     Hecited the attacks on Malines in particular.       Thistown, which was the cultural and religious centre ofBelgium, had been attacked three times.     the marshalling yards had not been seriously damaged butthe Cathedral, hospitals and schools had been damaged,and many civilians killed.     There was little doubtthat the opinion of the Church in Belgium had turnedagainst us as a resultsTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that theSupreme Commander would no doubt be prepared to considerexcluding Malines from the list of targets if a special case were made.-,     But there were many targets, attacks on which would inevitably.result in civilian casualties and in the destruction of buildingsj    and the casualties to be expected from attacks on railway targets wouldbe but a small proportion of the total casualtiescaused by air attacks in support of OVERLORDn      If therailway plan were given a chance it might well be thatat the critical period, some 10 days affter the beginningof the battle, the Germans would find themselves unable    ^to throw reserve divisions into the battle until oneof two days later than they had planned.        The effectof such delays, even if they were as little as 12 hoursmight well be very considerable      In reply to astatement that despite our air superiority we had been unable to prevent the enemy concentrating 8 divisions

against the Anzio Bridgehead, he pointed out that the flying conditions at that time had been referred toby crews as flying through &quot;clouds stuffed withmountains&quot;.     Since the weather had cleared, air attacks had been successful, and all railways leading to Romehad been cut for the last month.-THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the aim ofthe railway plan was to restrict railway communication on the broad routes from east to west and to destroyfacilities.       This would reduce the number of alternative routes and diminish the resources availablefor repair work.     It would thus simplify the problemof cutting the remaining routes and of delayingmovement of enemy forces at the criticial period of the battle.       The night bombing on railway centres hadbeen very accurate, and he thought that very few people had been killed at distances of more than a mile or a mile and a half from the target.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he was perturbed atthe possible reaction on European opinion.       Afterthe war, Eastern Europe and the Balkans would be largely dominated by the Russians, whereas the peoples of Western Europe would look to us.       If the presentattacks were continued we might well find that they regarded us with hatred.     It had in the past been necessary to take decisions in favour of courses ofaction which entailed horrible results.     He would be quite prepared tp take such a decision now if he were convinced that it was a case of victory or defeat;   hewas not, however, so convinced.THE PAYMASTER GENERAL referred to the views which had been put forward by various authorities atearlier stages of the consideration of the RailwayPlan.     He said that he thought that the Cabinet were entitled to have before them a clear statement of theevidence on which adoption of the Railway Plan had been regarded as justified.     So far as-he was aware, the weight of expert evidence was against the plan.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITYsaid that he thought that the War Cabinet was in a difficulty in deciding on this matter unless they werein a position to balance the military justification forthe plan against the loss of civilian life involved.THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION said that thedestruction now envisaged was something new in war andhe considered that devastation, on the scale mentionedwas unacceptable.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the whole concept of OVERLORD was based on makingfull use of the terrific air power at our disposal.He doubted if we should have undertaken a task whichwas almost super-human had it been anticipated thatour use of air power would have been restricted.     he pointed out that ,when the enemy launched his attack against Poland and on the Western Front, he had nothesitated to make the most ruthless use of his airforces.

At the outset, he had been doubtful whether therailway plan offered the maximum results for- the effort involved, and had thought we might have over-estimated the results of our attacks on the German AirForce and that it might have paid us to persist inthose attacks. . Not; that we had&quot;devoted so.much effort to the railway plan,     it   Would   b&apos;9iunwise to sacrifice this.effort and change over toa hew policy.     The plan would certainly make it moredifficult for the enemy to move his forces.     Hewould certainly require to move some of them by railas well as by road.      If the railway system weremutilated, the number of routes would be restrictedand those remaining could be more easily cut,,     Hesuggested that bywarning the population of impending.attack   wg   might, in addition to sparing French lives,still further hamper the railway system by encouraging the dispersal of essential staff.     Heavy.civilian casualties were bound to be caused by air attacks on other essential targets, such as certain gunemplacements and centres of communication of tacticalimportance.      In order to maintain security it wouldbe necessary to attack targets in areas other thanthose where the assault was to take&apos;place;    this would inevitably increase the number of casualties,THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEthought it would be unwise to approach the&apos; Providentregarding the railway  plan    alone, since it was apparent&apos;that the effects of this policy were likelyto be small as compared with the total results of air action in support of OVERLORD.     He would like to know the implications of our air policy as a whole0     Itwould then be possible to weigh the balance betweenthe military and political considerations involved.He suggested that the Deputy,Supreme Commander andpossibly the Supreme Commander himself should beinvited to attend a meeting of the. Defence Committees,   .or a Staff Conference, to explain details of the air operations planned and the military considerations involved if these operations were curtailed.      Themilitary considerations could then be reported tothe War Cabinet, who should decide whether theyjustified the political risks they entailed,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would arrangefor a meeting of the Defence Committee,, or a StaffConference, in the course of the next few a.ays to hearan outline of the air operations planned in support ofOVERLORD and to consider the military implications of restricting such operations.      It would then be forthe War Cabinet to consider whether an approach should be made to the President on political grouhdScIn,the meantime a memorandum should be prepared,setting out the views of the War Cabinet on thepolitical implications of the air operations planned and their probable effect on our future relationswith the&apos; occupied countries.     The drafting of thismemorandum obviously could net be completed untilfull details of the air operations in support ofOVERLORD had been received and Considered,,     But it seemed clear that we should inform the President thatwe should not be ready to support such operationsunless we were assured of the full support of&apos; theU.S. Government both in the execution of the operations and in any political difficulties which might subsequently arise.-k-    &apos; -      ...

The War Cabinet agreed as follows -(1) A meeting of the Defence Committee,or a Staff Conference, should heconvened in the course of the nextfew days to discuss with the DeputySupreme Commander, and possibly the -Supreme Commander,  the air operationsplanned in support of OVERLORD and toconsider the military implications of restricting such plans,(2) That in the meantime a document shouldbe drawn up on the lines suggestedby the Prime Minister.(3) That after hearing the report of theDefence Committee on the military aspect, the Vifar Cabinet would decide whether the political considerations were,such as to necessitate an approach to the President.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W. 1.
