MINUTE confidential Annex(31st May, 19hk - 6.0 p.m.)FRANCE(previous reference:W*M.(kh)69thConclusions,Minute 5)The War Cabinet resumed consideration ofthe timing of General de Gaulle&apos;s visit to this countrvTHE PRIME MINISTER read out a telegram from Mr. DuffCooper (No. 631) in which he urged that General de Gaullemight he exasperated by the prolonged uncertainty about his visit.     Indiscretion was not one of the General&apos;sweaknesses, and Mr. Duff Cooper asked that he shouldhave authority to give General de Gaulle some indicationas soon as possible as to the date when he would beasked to come to England.The Prime Minister said that this matter hadbeen further considered by the Chiefs of Staff.     they still felt that General de Gaulle&apos;s departure fromAlgiers coupled with certain Naval movements whichwould he in progress, would give the enemy a very good -clue to the imminence of D day.     They recognised, however,that political considerations might outweigh themilitary risks.The Prime Minister said that he found itdifficult to-believe that General de Gaulle&apos;s departure from Algiers would have the consequences feared bythe Chiefs of Staff. .   Even if it were known that he had   eft Algiers to come to England, the enemy might wellassume that we should arrange such a visit to take placewell in advance of D day.     Furthermore, it might be putahout that he had gone to Italy or Corsica, therebylending colour to the threats to Southern France from theMediterranean.The Prime Minister said that he favouredsending a telegram that night to Mr, Duff Cooper asking him to tell General de Gaulle that we should be glad to welcome him and his friends here, as soon as it wasconvenient for him to come.     He would also offer to puthis York aircraft at the disposal of General de Gaulle,He thought that the General would probably leave in a day or two&apos;s time.     On arrival in this country, he might heseen by the Foreign Secretary or his representative andmight then join the Prime Minister.     In this way, theessential intervening days would he occupied, and weshould be&apos; able to make certain that no message was sent out of this country which would compromise the date ofD day.

Continuing, the Prime Minister saidthat he regarded it as an important point of policy that General de Gaulle, as the Head of theFrench Coznmittee of National Liberation, shouldbe consulted before OVERLORD operation was launched.     He thought that the consequences mightbe serious if this was not done.The Prime Minister read to the WarCabinet the terms of a telegram to Mr. DuffCooper to give effect to this proposal.The War Cabinet -Approved the Prime Minister&apos;proposal, and agreed that atelegram should be despatched to Mr. Duff Cooper in the sense proposed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.

(44)51 stConclusions,Minute 5)THE PRIME MINISTER said&apos; that furtherconsideration had been given to the question of thedate to which the censorship of communications toand from all allied and neutral diplomats in thiscountry (other than the United States and U.S.S.R.)should continue.The Prime Minister said that the supreme allied Commander had asked the British.Governmentto agree to the continuance of the ban after D day,until such time as we should have been able to appreciate the enemy&apos;s reaction to our first assault.He feared that if the ban was lifted immediately afterD day the enemy would at once assume that no otherassaults were&quot;intended, and would concentrate his forces to repel the assault which had been made.The Prime Minister said the foreign secretary anticipated very great difficulty in maintaining the ban for any appreciable time afterD day.     He (the Prime Minister) thought that theright line to take was that the diplomatic ban shouldbe continued only -until D t 7;    and that the matter should be discussed in the interval;   but that unlessthe Supreme Allied Commander could show some newfacts, we should not be able to prolong it beyond that day.The Prime Minister suggested that consideration should also be given to the question whether the bancould be lifted by private arrangement with thedifferent Embassies, anything in the nature of apublic announcement being forbidden.The War Cabinet -Agreed to the course proposed, and invited the Prime Minister to informthe Supreme Allied Commander accordingly.^Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
