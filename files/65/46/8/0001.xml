MINUTE confidential Annex(5th May, 19*4^ - 3.0 p.ra. )PROPOSEDINTERNATIONALMONETARYFUND((Previous(Reference;(conclusions)The War Cabinet had a discussion as to what line should he taken by the Chancellor of the exchequer in replying to the following Motion on Wednesday, 10th May -&quot;That this House considers that the Statement of Principlescontained in Cmd. 6519 provides a suitable foundation forfurther international consultation with a view to improvedmonetary co-operation after the war.&quot;The War Cabinet also discussed the line whichshould be taken in regard to recent requests from theUnited States Government that we should send representatives to a conference in Washington on the proposed international monetary Fund,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that in hisopinion the Statement of Principles set out in Cmd 6519was a suitable foundation for further discussions, although we had certain reservations to make.     Thus, we had alreadytold the United States authorities that their draft proposalsfor an international organisation for long term internationallending (proposals which were complementary to the proposed international Monetary Fund) were in our view unsatisfactory.We had also pointed out to them that we should prefer that any scheme of the kind set out in the Statementof Principles should be brought into force by stagesj   and,in particular, that we ought not to be asked to undertake the burden of full convertibility until there was a reason-able prospect that we could carry out the undertaking.Again, we had made it clear that -aa-suagfa oohomo ojoii3xL.^*.*iparn; fronT these stipulations, which nad alreadybeen conveyed to the United States authorities, there were certain other respects in which we should desire to see theproposals modified.      For example, under the proposals asthey stood, if a member country was unable to secure the assent of the Fund to a change in the par value of its currency, its only alternative was to withdraw from the Fund.We felt that it would be possible to amend the proposals,so that in such a case the member country would not be compelled to withdraw from the Fund, but would be merely&amp;?? &amp;T.fd ot 5*ke advantages of the Fund. Thft ^o-h* tr,withdraw would, however, remair, j   Tne right t0It-was quite clear that the proposals had thebacking not merely of the Secretary Go the United states treasury, but also of the President and of the Secretaryof State (Mr. Hull)j    and he had recently received messagesfrom the Secretary tq the   United States Treasury indicating that it would be helpful to the President if there couldbe an early agreement on discussions with the United States.In view of the difficulties which would face us in the transitional period it was essential that we should retain the good-will of the United States.     Accordingly, he recom-mended that in the debate on the motion it should be made clear that the Government were prepared to enter into further consultations with the United States and with othercountries on the basis of the proposals in Cmd. 6519.-1-

In discussion, the view was expressed &quot;by certain ministers that acceptance of the proposals contained in theStatement of Principles would, to some extent at least,result in our committing ourselves to link sterling to gold.It was also asked what justification there was for theGovernmentfebeing asked at the present stage of the war to embark on discussions in which they would be committed-to detailed proposals in regard to a scheme which could notbe put into full effect for a very considerable period afterthe warP     In the ophion of some Ministers the transitional period might- well last for five or six years.It was explained to the War Cabinet that thePresident of the United States was very anxious that anInternational Conference should be held on the proposed international Monetary Fund before the Conventions for the presidential Election.     It was clear that in any event weshould require a considerable measure of help from theUnited States during the transitional period, and it was most important that we should not adopt an attitude whichwould result in the United States being unwilling to affordus that help.   This was- out ported by an analysis of the probablevolume of our imports and exports after the war.As against this, it was urged that owing to theimportance of Great Britain as a market for United Statesexports, the United States would not be in a position toadopt policies which would make it impossible for us to take their exports.The War Cabinet were informed that the general desire expressed in Parliament had been for a Debate in which members could have an opportunity of setting out their views.There was much to be said for allowing full discussion to take place in Parliament in public in regard to a matterof this nature before His Majesty1s Government made a formal statement of their position in regard to the scheme.Discussion ensued as to whether the motion couldbe accepted.     The suggestion was made that the words^favourable :    opportunity&quot; should be substituted for &quot;suitablefoundation&quot;.     It was pointed out that it would be difficultto make such an alteration at this stage, and it was generally-agreed that the motion was in sufficiently general terms and could be accepted by His Majesty!s Government consistently with their general attitude of not entering into commitments in regard to the scheme at this stage.As regards the Government&apos;s attitude in the forth-,coming Debate, the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained thathe had not intended to state in Parliament all the points.whichhe had mentioned in opening the discussion, but he had thought that he would be&apos;on safe ground in saying that theGovernment accepted the objectives of the Statement .of principles.     This view would have the support of his advisers in the Treasury and the Bank of England.

So far as concerned the proposal that we should send representatives to a conference in: Washington on theproposed Monetary Fund, the view of the War Cabinet wasthat it would be impossible at this stage to refuse to sendofficial representatives.     At the same time, there was no good reason why His Majesty1s Government should commit themselves to so far-reaching a scheme until the attitudeof countries such as Frances, Holland and Belgium had been declared.Mention was also made of the attitude of theDominion Governments and doubt was expressed as to whetherAustralia fully supported this proposal.     The Chancellorof *he Exchequer said that he thought that Australia wouiusupport the   poheffio     provided that they were satisfiedthat the arrangements in the Commercial and Economic fieldwere such as to promote full employmentsAfter discussion the War Cabinet agreed as follows:(1) The Government&apos;s general attitude should bethat they welcomed the Debate as givingParliament an opportunity of discussing thescheme and, of expressing their views upon it,and thereby assisting in the crystallisationof informed opinion, before further inter-national, discussions on the proposals tookplace0(2) The motion was in sufficiently general terms and could be accepted;   but theChancellor of the Exchequer in replying to the Debate would not commit HisMajesty&apos;s Government to acceptance of the specific proposals contained in theStatement.(3) Subject, of course, to the outcome of the.discussions with the Dominion Prime ministers on this matter,. and of the forthcoming debate in Parliament, we should inform theUnited States Government that, while wewere ready to send delegates to a conferenceabout the scheme, we were not at the  -presenttime in a position to send representativeswith power to enter into commitments onthis matter on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
