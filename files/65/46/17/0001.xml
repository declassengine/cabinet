(Ulj.) 75thConclusions,Minute 2)THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the War Cabinet ofthe difficulties that had arisen in connection withthe issue of special currency notes for use by allied troops in France.    He had been in communication on thismatter with the President.     He had said thatGeneral de Gaulle was ready to make a supportingproclamation, but might press for his proclamation toinclude the words &quot;Provisional Government of France&quot;.Should we agree to thisj    or should we take the burden on ourselves for the time being, and look to settling the matter later at the Peace Table?     (Telegrams696 and 697).The President had now replied that he sharedhis (the Prime Minister&apos;s) view, that this issue wasbeing exploited to stampede us into according full recognition to the French Committee, and that he didnot think the situation as critical as it might atfirst appear, or that it was essential from the pointof view of the acceptability of this currency that any statement of support with regard to it should be madeby General de Gaulle.      The President suggested thatGeneral de Gaulle should be informed that we intendedto use this currency as planned and as had been fully understood by the representatives in Washington of theFrench Committee;    that if this was not acceptable tothe French public, General Eisenhower would have full authority to use yellow seal dollars and british military authority notes, and that any adverseconsequences that might flow from the employment ofsuch notes would be the responsibility of General de gaulle and the Committee.     The President added thathe was satisfied as regards both the design and thesecurity aspects of the notes.    (Telegram 559).THE PRIME MINISTER doubted whether the Presidentsreply faced the essential difficulty of the backingbehind these notes, since in their present form theybore nothing to show by what authority they were issued, .Once they were issued, the United Kingdom and theUnited States were, in his judgment, morallyresponsible for redeeming them.     He felt that thematter could not be left where it was.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hehad now received a formal protest from the french national Committee, which he read to the War Cabinet,about the issue of these notes.    The Committee urged,in particular, that the right to issue money hadtraditionally belonged to the national authority inthe country concerned and that they-j as the Governmentof the country, were perfectly willing to make the

necessary ordinances.     He agreed that, once thespecial currency was issued, we were under a legal and moral obligation to redeem it.     He felt that we were taking serious &apos;risks in allowing it to circulatewithout any understanding with the French authorities.Not only was the currency open to objection as bearingno Indication of the authority behind it, but, in the\ . absence of agreement with the French, its circulation/contemplated   cut across our/financial arrangement with the french committee..     Under that -arrangement the Allies were topay their troops in France, but for services of allkinds in France the principle of mutual aid was to operate, and.the burden to be carried by the French.It would be most undesirable that, in the absence ofany understanding, we should move into a position inwhich the whole of the burden of financing the conductof operations inside France might fall on us and noton the French authorities, and in which we should find ourselves responsible also for the very seriousreactions of this special currency on the internal,economy of these areas.      The French had very substantial gold reserves, but these were blocked.General de Gaulle had himself been prepared to accept responsibility for the issue of currency notes and,indeed, clearly was anxious to do so.      The Chancellordid not feel himself that the General&apos;s support neednecessarily involve a recognition of the french committee as a provisional Government;    and he agreedthat there could be no question of recognising, it assuch.     But he did not feel that we could refuse torecognise&apos; the continued existence, of the french committee on the same basis as before whatever stylethe Committee might now wish to adopt.THE SECRETARY OF&quot; STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSfelt that it was not altogether reasonable for thePresident to suggest that the French representativest     in Washington had acquiesced in the issue of this special currency.     M. Mohnet had argued strongly infavour of a &quot;French national currency&quot; and in the endhad only acquiesced in the preparation of this specialcurrency on the express condition that a separate issueof French national currency should be printedconcurrently, and should be used to redeem the allied military currency &quot;very promptly&quot;.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he was fullyconscious of the difficulty of this problem.     But hewas not prepared to recognise the French national committee as a provisional Government whatever theconsequences of refusal.     He was himself anxious toget back to the basis of the Algiers Decree, and totake our stand on that until the people of Francecould form a judgment for themselves.  .   If an arrangementcould be reached with the French National Committeeon the basis of the Algiers Decree, he could notbelieve that the President would maintain his unbendingattitude.     From his talks with Left Wing elements inFrance he was conscious that those elements were greatlyworried lest, in the absence of recognition of some form of French authority, bodies such as the Comitedes Forges, sympathisers with which were thought to bein a position to exercise influence on the President,should establish themselves.      The mistake of theNational Committee was in not sending representativeshere, clearing the situation up with us, and thereafterestablishing themselves, with our assistance, on firm

ground with the United States.      Gould they not be persuaded even now to pay such a visit?     If they did,these affairs would soon be established on a footingwhich would dispose of our difficulties not only overcurrency but generally,,      If, of course \  they took theattitude that they could not come to this country untilrepresentatives of the United States were associatedwith any.discussions, a real deadlock must result,THE SECRETARY OF STATE.FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the President had experienced certain difficulties in working with the French Committee evenon the basis of the Algiers Decree,       The president was, he thought, inclined to judge the situation interms of the United States, where the President was theexecutive, and to apprehend that General de Gaullewould occupy a corresponding position in France.     he did not himself think that there was any justification for that..      He attached real importance to some formof authority being established with which we could.dobusiness.      Would It be possible for his officials inthe Foreign Office,  taking advantage of the suggestion made by General de Gaulle that &quot;there should beconversations with Mo Vienot, to work out with me Vienot something on the basis of the Algiers Decreeand reach a text without commitment on either side?We could then, look at this, and- if it seemedacceptable, commend it to the Americans,..THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF home security reminded the War Cabinet that our policy wa&apos;;.&quot;so far as we could, to concentrate on the Committeerather than on General de Gaulle individually.    he felt that v/hat weighed with, the President was therisk that an unrepresentative Government might beplaced in authority in France,, and felt that therewas substance ih thisoA general discussion followed from whichit appeared that the general sense of the War cabinet was strongly in favour of the suggestion made by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs at ;X5  andthat, despite the difficulties to which General de gaulle&apos;s personality and the attitude which he had adopted since arriving in this country gave rise, itwas important, if at all possible, to reach some workingarrangement without, however, recognising the french national Committee as a provisional Government. .General de Gaulle&apos;s THE PRIME MINISTER, after summing up the visit to France     discussion, added that General de Gaulle had, on his arrival here,,  told him that he hoped that beforereturning to &quot;Algiers it would be possible to set footin France.      The Prime Minister had given sympathetichearing to that request and, despite the difficulties .that there had been with General de Gaulle since his arrival, was very anxious to implement his undertaking.He accordingly invited the War Cabinet to authorise him to ask General Montgomery to arrange for animmediate visit to France by General de Gaulle, to becompleted within 2li hours,,m

The War Cabinet agreed:^(l) That President Roosevelt&apos;s telegram to thePrime Minister of 13th June, No. 559   took-insufficient account of the foil owing:&apos;-(i) the difficulties caused by the absenceon.the currency notes of any indication of the authority by which they were issued;(ii) the danger that, if issued without anyunderstanding with the French authorities,the U.K. and the U.S.A. would be morallyresponsible for honouring them;(ill) the fact that unilateral issue would leave us liable to carry burdens which,\inder the financial arrangement con-templated with the French Committee,would be borne by the French authorities on the principle of mutual aid.and that these matters should be taken up with the U.S. Government.(2) That as regards general relations with france, it should be our object to get back, in agreement with General de gaulle and the French National Committee, to thebasis of the Algiers Decree.(3) That General de Gaulle&apos;s suggestion forconversations with Mu Vienot s&apos;hould beaccepted, and that we should developconversations in the first place on theofficial level, with a view to working out, without commitment, the text of an understanding on ciwil affairs questionsgenerally based on the Algiers Decree.(k) That the questions between the French national committee and ourselwes in regard to the specialcurrency notes issued to the troops in france should also be discussed in the first placeon the official level with representativesof the Committee, possibly in connection withthe reply to be sent to the formal protestreceived through Mr. Vienot from the Committeeon the. subject.(5) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,When he saw General de Gaulle that evening,should do his utmost again to persuade him tosend members of his Committee to this country.He should emphasise that in inwitingGeneral de Gaulle, to this country beforeD-day, the Prime Minister had been anxiousto serve his best interests;    that the PrimeMinister had been chilled by General de gaulle&apos;s attitude, and greatly regretted the absence of members of the french national Committee, who could have been associated with general discussions priorto General de Gaulle&apos;s visit to America.-it-

(6) That the reply to Questions which had beenput on the Order Paper in the House ofCommons for answer on Wednesday, ll+th June,as to our relations with the French national committee and General de Gaulle, should ingeneral take the line that it would not, inthe opinion of the War. Cabinet, be in thepublic interest at this stage to debateQ the issues between the British Government.the French National Committee and the&apos;UnitedStates;    that the Government had the matter,     constantly under revise*ew and was well aware of all opinion and factors relevant to it;and that he would greatly regret it if itwere to be pressed to debate these.matters in public, or even to deal with them by question and Answer.General de Gaulle&apos;s . (7) That immediate action should be taken to giveVisit to France effect to the undertaking which had beengiven by the Prime Minister to General de gaulle on his arrival here that .he should been abled to visit the troops in France before his return to Algiers, and that General\ Montgomery should be asked to &quot;expect himtomorrow, and that the necessary arrangementsbe made for his journey and for extending tohim all appropriate courtesies.Later in the evening the War Cabinet were informed that a report had been received that some ofthe 20 French Liaison Officers who had gone to Francewith Operation OVERLORD had said that they would not accept the &quot;supplementary currency, which they.regardedas &quot;false money&quot;.      General Koenig was said to have,expressed tho same view.      There was some indication that General Eisenhower, was considering recalling the-French Liaison Officers to this country. .   There wasalso some reason to suppose that the U.S. Governmentwere considerably perturbed at reports which they hadreceived from the Supreme Commander, Allied ExpeditionaryForce, on this matter, and that President Rooseveltmight make a unilateral statement at a press conferencein the near future.     Thus it wes thought that he might,say that the notes were all right because they had the 1backing of General Eisenhower.,A awg 3tfan had Irftn raafio to ths Rxceign Secretary,with which he agreed, th?$it-ml&amp; t be wise for the Prime Ministerto send a short telegram to the President that night,to the effect that there were certain passages in hislatest telegram about which we were rather.uneasy, andthat we. were proposing to send him shortly our comments on the situation.     A telegram on these lines mighthold the situation, and avert a statement by thePresident, which would make it harder for us to reach a satisfactory settlement of this position.      It seemedall the more desirable to do this because the President&apos;latest telegram seemed to show that he was not fully  .   ...seized of the whole position.A general discussion ensued in the course ofwhich the PRIME MINISTER indicated that, having regardto the strong views which the President obviously heldin this matter, he (the Prime Minister) was disinclined&apos;to telegraph to the President on the lines proposed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
