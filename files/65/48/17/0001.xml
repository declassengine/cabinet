(kk)  168TH CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex: X&quot;13.th December,,. 19kk - 6,15 p.m.)JEECEPreviousleference:I.M.(hh)l66thlonclusions)The War Cabinet considered the latest developments in the Greek.situation in the light of a personal message fromMr. Macmillan to the Prime Minister of 13th December(Athens telegram 587 of 13th December).Mr, Macmillan&apos;s message, which was in reply to telegram No.hh1 despatched after the meetings of the WarCabinet on the 12th December, expressed the gratitude ofMr. Leeper and himself for the support of the War cabinet and for the efforts that had been made with the King of greece.      They strongly urged, however, that the King sfrou.again be pressed to agree to appoint the Archbishop ofAthens Regent.     Nothing else was likely to meet the case.The local position, was a serious one;    failure on theKing&apos;s part to respond would further endanger his cause;while His Majesty&apos;s Government and the British peoplegenerally would bo accused of &quot;connivance with the King&apos;sself-defence policy&quot;.     The regency of the Archbishop wasnot merely a sudden idea of the British Embassy or Minister,but the general hope and wish of the people.Moreover, there was strong reason to believe that the archbishop would not consent to act as Prime Minister.In that capacity he would have neither the necessarydetachment from the political scene nor the requisitestability.     He must be appointed.to a post and for aperiod calculated to give confidence to all.     Such a postshould naturally be that of Protector.      The regency should remain until by plebicito or free election the people were themselves able to express their will. We must not abandon the only political weapon,- i.e. the appointment ofthe Archbishop as Regent, which there was in view to get -us out of the present impasse.In discussion the following points were made -(a) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the King was likely to be obstinate.     Further, while we had understood yesterday that the King was willing that Mr. Leeper should inform Monsieur Papandreouthat a new Prime Minister could be sworn inwithout a direct message from the King,* HisMajesty now said that he could not agree to this,and that there could be no swearing in without prior reference to him;(b) Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Leeper, who were on the spot,were more likely to have formed a correctappreciation of the position than was the King.The messages which His Majesty was receiving fromhis supporters in Greece urging him to stand firm. might be no more than an attempt to give him what he wanted to hear;

(c) Prom the King&apos;s personal point of view as wellas from that of Greece,  the appointment of the archbishop as Regent appeared to be the right course.    &apos; He would be-free at any time to dismissthe Regent, and the appointment of the archbishoprj       would bring the Crown back into the picture undermost favourable auspices and in the only way possible.(d) It was essential to do something to relax theexisting tension.      If the King refused toappoint the ^rchbishop could we not recognise the Archbishop as Protector     (the terra used by Mr. Macmillan)?The general sense of the War Cabinet was that,in the light of Mr. Macmillan.Ls advice, the King of greece should again be strongly pressed to agree to theappointment of the archbishop of Athens as. Regent.The War Cabinet invited the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary to make representations-to HisMajesty in this sense.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.f,l.
