(kh) 129thConclusions,Minute 7)At their meeting on 29th September the War Cabinet had agreed to resume consideration of the following memorandadealing with the future of B. O.A. C. and the question of the ownership of the British air lines.(1) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air(v.P.(Uh) 523);Secretary of State for IndiaMinister of Aircraft Productionlie(ii) a memorandum bv^h(iii) a m^ra^ bg^hThe War Cabinet also had before, thera again. W.P. (Uh) .268, 263 (revise), 277, 279 and 282.THE PRIMS MINISTER said that he had come to theconclusion that the problems connected with the future ofBritish air lines ought not to be settled before theappointment of the Minister to deal with Civil Aviation,The meeting which he had had with the Conservative andUnionist Members Committee had made it clear that therewas a very strong feeling in favour of the creation of aseparate Department of Civil Aviation under a Minister ofCabinet rank, and he had decided that this was the right course at the present time.      The question whether the new department should be merged in the Ministry of V/ar Transportafter the Japanese War could be decided at a-later date.He proposed to ask Lord Swinton whether he would be willingto serve as the new Minister.      If a new Minister was to beappointed, the right course was for the Government to post-pone any announcement with regard to future Civil Aviationpolicy for some weeks, so as to give the new Minister time tosettle into his post and to consider the issues of policy involved.      In the public^ interest it was most important that these issues should not be dealt with on party lines.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that, while hewould warmly welcome the choice of Lord Swintonj if a newMinister were to be appointed, he remained convinced thatthe separation of Civil Aviation from the Air Department,whether by the creation of a separate Department or other-wise, would be a mistake.     Moreover, the Machinery ofGovernment Committee after an exhaustive examination of thepossible alternatives had reached the conclusion that sincethe Ministry of War Transport could not accept responsibility jfor civil aviation during the war, the best course would be   &apos;1to leave civil aviation for the whole duration of the warwith the Air Ministry.   , There might be difficulty in establishing the new Department under the Government&apos;semergency powers, and since it could not be regarded as a       j.Vote of Credit Departments it might find that.it was less       jable to give, assistance to B. O.A.-C.  in present conditions.If, however,.&apos;the War Cabinet agreed that a separateDepartment should be created, heJwould do everything inhis power to make the new arrangement a success.E

DisouaBion contreu on the problem of therelations between the new Department and the Air ministry and the Ministry of Aircraft Production.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the- primary function of the new Department would toe to carry but planning andpreparatory work and that in view of the close relations which it would have to have-with the Air Ministry and the .Ministry of Aircraft production he envisaged the &quot;settingup of a co-ordinating Committee of the three ministers concerned under the Chairmanship of the Secretary ofState for Air.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that, whateverarrangement was made, the Air Ministry must, in his view,retain Until the end of the Japanese war full executivecontrol of all air transport resources with a view totheir use to the maximum advantage in support of our operations against the enemy.     The need for air transport in the Japanese campaign would toe very great.The general feeling of the War cabinet  was that,while control toy the Air Ministry should toe maintainedover any air transport required for war purposes, it  &apos;would toe necessary&apos;.as time went on to give the CivilAviation Department control over&apos;such resources as wereavailable for civil purposes.      In particular;, the CivilAviation Department must have a say in any development ,of European air services after Germany had been defeatedbut before the end of the Japanese war.      Given goodwill,it should not toe impossible to devise arrangements whichwould preserve the necessary control of the Air Ministryover,the use of civil aircraft in support of operations,and at the same time give the new Department - proper scope for development. \There was general agreement that so far as theproduction of aircraft, for civil purposes was concerned,-the relations between the Ministry of Aircraft Productionand the new Department would toe the same as those now -subsisting between- the Ministry of Aircraft Productionand the Air Ministry or the Admiralty.      It was emphasised that if the Ministry of Aircraft Production could beregarded as the.Supply Department for the Civil AviationDepartment this..would help- in distributing the limitedsupply of highly skilled labour to the best advantage^Discussion then turned to the arrangements for the debate on civil aviation in the House, of Lords.      It wasagreed that the Lord Privy Seal should announce theappointment of the&quot;new Minister, emphasising that it was essential that he should have time to settle into hispost before any statement1 could be made as to future,policy.Offices of the War cabinet , S.W.I.
