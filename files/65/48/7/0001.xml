(hll-V 152ND,C0HCLtfsl6l!3. MINUTE confidential Annex .(21st November^ 19hk - 6 p.m.foreign AFFAIRS &quot; THE FOREIGN SECRETARY informed the War.Cabinet of the latest developments in connection with Persia the dispute which had arisen between Persia and theSoviet Government as a result of the refusal of thePersian Government to grant, the Russians request for an oil concession in North Persia.&apos;     The Russianobject was by no means clear, but we were uneasy at-the pressure that was being brought to &quot;bear onPersia, and representations had been made both by our Ambassador in Moscow and (in the Ambassador&apos;sabsence through illness) to the Counsellor of theSoviet Embassy in London.     The.United StatesGovernment were also uneasy at the situation thatseemed to be developing and had worked in close collaboration with us throughout.     No reply had yet&quot;been received to any of the representations made,either in London or in Moscow, to the Soviet.     he felt that public. opinion in this country might &quot;be.critical if, consequent on Russian pressure, a newPersian Government were to be formed which wouldconcede the oil concession in dispute.Consideration had been given to the action that might be taken. There were fourmain possibilities(a) that our Ambassador at Teheran should be told, for hisown guidance, when a new Prime Minister wasappointed, to inform him that we trusted thathe would follow the policy of his predecessorabout the concession;(b) that Sir R, Buuard should tel the Shah or the Ministerof Court that we had drawn attention ofthe Russian Government to the situation andhad asked them what the position was.(c) that, if the Prime Minister and the WarCabinet agreed, the Persians should beinformed that we proposed to discuss the oilconcessions at the next meeting of the BigThree.      Such a communication might help to steady the position.(d) the Prime Minister might feel disposed tosuggest to the President the possibility of  -a joint statement, indicating to the Sovietthat we proposed to discuss these matters0 when the next meeting of heads of Statestook place.     He felt that public opinion might well be critical of an apparentsurrender to Russian demands;   while theRussians, if no communication was made to

them &quot;by us, might be able to representthat they had not been warned of   thestrength of our view,: THE PRIME MINISTER said that the balance! of advantage rested with a joint message by! President Roosevelt and himself, on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary, to the effectthat they were uncertain with regard to the.position of the dispute that had arisen;   andthat they would like to discuss it on the occasion of the next meeting of Premier Stalin, the! President and the Prime Minister, and felt(confident the U.S.S.R. would refrain from takingI any action in the matter until there had been anI opportunity for such discussion.In reply to the Lord Privy Seal, he addedthat he contemplated that any such&quot; discussions would of course be confined to new concessions in North Persia, and would not affect our existing concessions in South Persia.At the Prime Minister&apos;s request,THE&apos; SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs undertook to prepare a draft for his considerationof a message to President Roosevelt.The War Cabinet -(l) Agreed that the Foreign secretary should act as proposed at (a) and(b) above.(2) Approved the course of action proposedby. the Prime 3/minister  at &quot;X&quot; and took note that the Foreign secretary would prepare a draft telegram to president Roosevelt for hiscons consideration.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
