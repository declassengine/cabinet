(hh) 155TH CONCLUSIONS.. MINUTE confidential Annex(24th November, &quot;iSkh - 11.0 a.m.)PALESTINE(previous reference:W.M. (kh) 153rdConclusions,Minute 1)The War Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies(W.P.(kh) 678) on the situation in Palestine, asking for decisions on certain questions arising out of the murder of Lord Moyne and reviewing the various proposals for action suggested here and in the middle east,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES firstgave the War Cabinet information about Secret JewishOrganisations and Jewish opinion.     He said that arapprochement had taken place between the two principle terrorist bodies, viz.  the Stern Group(numbering 300-hOO) and Irgun Zvai Leumi (numbering2,000 - 3,000) in the Spring of this year.     It was now thought that the same individual was the effectiveleader of both;     The Jewish Agency had been non-co-operative when outrages had revived earlier thisyear, and while there had been a measure of denunciation,it had beeh accompanied by anti-Government propaganda and militarist movement in the ranks of the Agency.As a result control of the younger element had begun to pass from the Agency to the terrorist groups.Later in the summer Mr. Rymer Jones, the InspectorGeneral of Police, who had established a remarkableposition with the Jews, had been able to arrange for greater co-operation between the Agency and thePalestine Police.     Even so,  the information received through the Agency was very rarely of material value.In no case had it enabled action to the taken againsta Jew.      The Palestine Police had, however, independently of the assistance of the Agency, during the last fewmonths, achieved great successes with these two groups.Over 200 arrests had been made up to the time of therecent deportations from Palestine and another 200since.      These included the individuals believed tohave led the attack on Sir Harold MacMichael and thetwo main attacks on Police Stations.Since Lord Moyne&apos;s murder the Jewish Agencywere, he was now advised, for the first time, reallyalarmed.      They feared that the prospects of asettlement favourable to the Jews in Palestine would suffer.     They realised also that the terrorist gangs,which had hitherto been substantially directed against british Police or Palestine officials, might turnon themselves.      There had, in particular, been a sharp increase lately in the blackmail levied by the terrorist organisations on Jewish individuals and establishments in Palestine.     Since Lord Moyne&apos;s

murder there were signs of a fairly deep division of opinion in Jewish circles in Palestine as to the line to follow.But although the majority were now prepared to support theGovernment, the minority were averse from anything whichwould involve handing over Jews.This division of Jewish opinion was reflected inthe reports attached to W.P.(hh) 678 as to the next step tobe taken.     The General Officer Commanding and theauthorities in Egypt looked on the matter as an Arab-Jewishconflict.     The Palestine authorities, who were more concerned with terrorist activities, favoured severe action.,against Jews involved in such activities, but were reluctant to risk action that would set the Jewish opinion., as awhole, in Palestine, against us before it had been given a chance to collaborate.      It was in those circumstances thatthe Commander-in-Chief, Middle East and the Ambassador in cairo urged the immediate suspension of immigration and immediate searches for arms, while the High Commissioner inPalestine favoured an immediate warning that immigrationmight have to be stopped, and a reinforcement, if possible,of the troops available to him so that searches for armscould be undertaken without delay if the Jewish offers of collaboration proved insincere or ineffective.The War Cabinet proceeded to consider the proposalsof the Secretary of State as follows:-1.   A Public warning that if-further outrages, occur H.M.Government will be.obliged, to suspend jewish immigration into palestine the High Commissioner still felt that it would be helpful if it could be impressed on  Palestine Jewrythat if further outrages occurred H.M. Government would be forced to take action and even to divert elsewhereimmigrants destined for Palestine until more settledconditions could be re-established there.     The Secretaryof State for the Colonies agreed with this view and askedfor authority to make such a statement publicly, if possiblein the course of the debate on the Address next week.The following points were made in discussion:-(a) A proposal for a public warning, supported bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies, the High commissioner in Palestine and the Middle East Defence Committee, mustcarry great weight.      On the other hand, a. warning that wehad it in mind to suspend immigration if outrages did notstop, might play into the hands of Extremist elements whichwere anxious to force the issue.     There was equally therisk that non-Jewish elements might, for different reasons,take advantage of the situation created by the warning.(b) There seemed to be substantial support and sympathy for our position not only from the soberer Jewishelements in Palestine but from world Jewry.     Was it wise to risk forfeiting that, and possibly giving rise to an active campaign of misrepresentation in the U.S.A., by taking any action until it was clear that no effectivecollaboration could be looked for from the Jewish Agency?

(c) W-s it not better to decide on ^the factswhether immigration must be suspended, and to announce our decision without previous warning?     It was argued, on theone hand, that an absence of warning would further embitterJewish feeling.      Other members of the Cabinet felt thatthat was unlikely and that it might even be easier, interms of American opinion, to act once a case was establishedwithout warning&apos;.(d) Action should be justified, if and when taken,on the impossibility, in their own interests, of allowingfurther immigrants to enter a country in which the outlookwas so uncertain, and not as a punitive measure.(e) The course of discussion showed that the WarCabinet was against any public warning.Consideration was then given to the suggestion thatthe High Commissioner might be authorised to. speak privately to Dr.. Weizmann.      It was suggested that he might speak tohim on the lines that the continuance of terroristactivities would clearly lead to a position in whichimmigration would have to be suspended;    that he knew thatthis matter had been under consideration by H.M. Government,and that such a course might well have to be adopted if theoutrages continued.     While speaking on these lines theHigh Commissioner should of course be careful not to say anything which would either commit H*M. Government tosuspension of immigration, or might create an impression that there was any difference of view on this matter betweenthe High Commissioner and H,M, Government,The War Cabinet was in favour of action beingtaken on these lines*2.    Search for ArmsThe War Cabinet next considered whether wholesalearms searches should be instituted   in Palestine as proposedby the Middle East Defence Committee.(f) It was urged on one hand that a very threateningsituation was developing ana that the 60 Jewish armscaches represented a very serious potential danger.(g) On the other hand, THE CHANCELLOR OP THEEXCHEQUER pointed out that experience showed that a veryelaborate organisation and simultaneous action throughouta country was needed if searches for arms were to be successful.      Searches were rarely productive;    secrecy asto the action contemplated was difficult to maintain;mistakes were made by the troops;    and bad feelingengendered.      The slower, less spectacular, but only suremethod of dealing with this problem was&apos; the building up ofthe Police.(h) While the Middle East Defence Committee favouredwholesale arms searches, the High Commissioner was aversefrom such action unless further outrages occurred, and theChiefs of. Staff considered that a military commitment wouldbe involved which would directly affect operations againstGermany, and that even then success could not be guaranteed.The general sense of the War Cabinet was that nowholesale searches should at this stage beundertaken.

3.    Strengthening of Palestine police the War Cabinet then considered the adequacy of thepresent Police Forces in Palestine and the extent to.whichthey might require strengthening.The following points were made:-(i) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat the Palestine Police were at the present time below their establishment of 3*000.     He had good hope that itwould be possible, thanks to the help of the Minister ofLabour and National Service and the other ministers concerned, to bring the Police fully up to strength in thenear future.      The suggestion was also made and met with considerable support that there was much to be said foran increase in the present establishment of PalestinePolice. A strong organisation would certainly be needed todeal with        post-war situation in Palestine.(j) THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER urged theimportance of organising the intelligence side of thePolice Force.     Admirable results had been achieved inIndia by appointing European military intelligenceofficers with police powers in the villages.     He suggestedthat, in order to deal effectively with terrorism inPalestine, steps should be taken to recruit&apos; more than thenormal complement of Intelligence Officers.(k)  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatthe. intelligence side of the Palestine Police was workingvery well;    but &quot;he undertook to consider the Chancellor&apos;suggestions.ij..    Movement as soon as practicable of additional militaryforces into Palestine so that they might be at hapdfor immediate use.in connection with arms searches.should further outrages occur in the course of discussion of&quot;this proposal, thefollowing points were made:-(l) It was desirable to strengthen the high commissioners hand by increasing the forces at his disposalin Palestine.    The movement in of additional, troops would show the public how seriously we took the situation.      Itwould also equip the High Commissioner to pursue armssearches if they were necessary, and to maintain internal security.(m) On the other hand, it was urged that thesituation was not necessarily best dealt with by increasingthe military forces in the country and that, apart from greatpractical difficulties of finding troops, the problem was essentially one for armed Police.      While some smalladdition to the military force might:be justified, theimportant thing was the organisation of the troopsstationed from time to time in Palestine, and that the fifth Division should be so organised as&apos; to provide&apos; mobilecolumns of,  say, 200 men who would be available to conductsearches for arms or deal with outrages,  etc.  as might benecessary at short notice.

5.    Collective PinesThe imposition of a heavy collective fine on thewhole.Jewish community in Palestine had been consideredbut rejected by the High Commissioner.(n) In discussion THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUERpointed out that a collective fine might take two forms -(i) an ordinary levy in respect of the actual costof additional Police posted to the localitywhere outrages had taken place;(ii) a punitive collective fine imposed on alocality after an outrage.He suggested that both should be explored and that experience showed that both could be effective.     If Policeintelligence services were sufficiently good, there was&apos;little risk that a locality which had no responsibility,direct or indirect, in connection with an outrage wouldhave a fine imposed on it.The point was taken, on the other hand,  that therisk of a fine being imposed without sufficient justificationcould not altogether be excluded.6.    Introduction of a system of compulsory national registration if the High Commissioner shoulddefinitely recommend this stepThe War Cabinet accepted the proposal of theSecretary of State for the Colonies that such a system should be introduced - if definitely recommended by theHigh Commissioner.The War Cabinet reached the following conclusions:-(1) The fullest support must be given&apos; to the colonial secretary and to the High Commissioner forPalestine in their efforts to break up the\ terrorist organisations and hunt down the membersof the murder gangs.The   balance of advantage was against any publicwarning at this stage that immigration would be discontinued if outrages did not cease.The High Commissioner in Palestine should,however, be authorised to speak to Dr. 7/eizmannprivately on the following lines -A continuance of terrorist activities would clearly lead to a position in which immigrationwould have to be suspended;    he knew that thismatter had been under consideration byH.M. Government and such a course might well have to be adopted if the outrages continued.All possible steps should be taken to bring thePalestine Police up to their authorised strength,and consideration should be given to thequestion whether their authorised strength was sufficient.(2)(3)

(5) Special attention should be given to thequestion whether -the intelligence side ofthe Palestine Police organisation requiredstrengthening by the addition of carefullypicked expert personnel.(6) Consideration should be given to the praticability of. making some addition tothe military forces in Palestine because .of the effect that this-would have on public confidence and because also of theimportance of strengthening the HighCommissioner&apos;s hand as much as possiblein the event of further disturbances.(7) The organisation of the troops stationedfrom time to time in Palestine and,immediately, the Fifth Division, should beso arranged as to provide mobile columns of,say, 200 men, who would be available to conduct searches for arms or deal withoutrages etc.  as might be necessary at short notice.(8) No systematic searches for arms should,however, at this stage be undertaken.(9) A system of compulsory national registrationshould be introduced in Palestine if that stwas definitely recommended by the HighCommissioner.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W;1.

MINUTE confidential Annex(21+th November, 1944 - 11*0 a.mi)ARGENTINEMEATCONTRACT(previous reference:W.M.(44) 149thConclusions,Minute 11).The War Cabinet had before them -*(a) A Memorandum by the Paymaster-General(W.P.(44) 674);(b) A Memorandum by the Minister of Pood, (W.P,(44) 682)j(c) Copies of telegrams exchanged betweenthe Prime Minister, President Rooseveltand Mr. Hull on this matter.(Not circulated as a W.P, paper).In his latest telegram of the 19thNovember (T.2133/4), the President had pressedthat we should carry on, on a month-to-monthbasis, and should not conclude any long-term     -contract for the supply of Argentine meatat the present time.     This telegram was in conflict.with the assurances given in earliertelegrams to the effect that the U.S. Governmentwould not object to our concluding a new contract,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said .that there had been a recent change in the this.attitude in the negotiations about lease-lendjparticularly in regard to the present restrictions on our exports.     At a meetingon the 22nd November, our representatives hadbeen informed tli&amp;t it would not be possible to announce that any new policy on exports had beenagreed before the defeat of Germany.     It wasjhowever, the intention of the Administration tomake administrative concessions which wouldlargely free our exports from their present restrictions, with operation from 1st January,1945*     These concessions would be representedaa a development of existing procedure.     Therewas reason to think that the substance of our case had been gained if the undertakings wereimplemented, but we could not make a very .satisfactory presentation to Parliament.The second change was that the U.S.Government representatives had informed us thatthey proposed to treat the important negotiations with had been taking place, as quasi routinediscussion on lease-lend arrangements in whichthere had been no agreements breaking new ground,and that no publicity would be given to the new arrangements.

The conclusion to be drawn from this seemed to be that for some reason or other,the U, So Government were exerting pressure upon us.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that a communication had very recently been received in the Foreign Officefrom the U.S. Embassy, to the effect that untilthe position with.regard to the Argentine hadbeen cleared up, the State Department were reluctant to authorise the export of materials which might be used in connection with exports from the Argentine.     This seemed to refer forexample to tin-plate used in connection with thepacking-of Argentine meat.General agreement was expressed with theview in the Minister of Food1s Memorandum thatin order to ensure our meat supplies in a periodof world, shortage, the businesslike course was to conclude a long-term contract with Argentine.     Atthe same time it was felt that, as pointed out inthe memorandum by the Paymaster-General, theadditional.expend!ture likely to result fromfailure to conclude a long-term contract was a relatively small matter in comparison with thevery great advantages which we were trying tosecure from the United States in the lend-leasefield.     The risk on supply grounds of carryingon for several months on a month-to-month basis,was not very serious, if we asked the americans to use their, best endeavours to prevent othercountries and UNRRA from entering the Argentinemeat market, and if we also asked them to guarantee to supply us with such additional meat as wasnecessary to make up for any deficiencies we mightsuffer as a result of falling in with their wishes.After some further discussion the PRIMEMINISTER said that he thought he should now send atelegram to President Roosevelt on the following lines -He would first draw the President&apos;attention to the salient points in the series of telegrams of which a copy had been sent to thePresident.    He would bring out that we had always! made clear that, while we intended to do what wecould to support the U.S.Government in their policyvis-a-vis the Argentine, notwithstanding our doubts; about its wisdom, this must not interfere with ourmeat supplies from the Argentine, or with the-conclusion of a long-terra contract. This has beenaccepted.After rehearsing the main points in;&apos; this exchange of telegrams, he would say that,-i nevertheless we were prepared to act as the U,S.proposed, and that we had decided that we would continue on the present month-to-month basis fora further period of six months.     We reliedj,^however, on the U.S,  to make sure that othea?nations and UNRRA did not cut into the market

and obtain Argentine meat which we shouldhave secured by a long-term contract;    andwe should also look to the U.S. to supply us with such additional meat as might be necessaryto make up any deficiencies we might suffer asa result of acceding to their views.He would point out that since we had decided on this action, a communication had beenreceived from the U.S. Embassy as to the supplyof raw material from the U.S. which might beused in connection with Argentine exports.The terms of this communication amounted almostto a threat of indirect blockade,  and were, he felt sure, not such as the President would wishto sustain.     He would therefore ask that this communication should be withdrawn before we sent a final answer in regard to Argentine meat.Otherwise the matter was one we should-have to disclose to Parliament, perhaps in a secret session.Discussion ensued as to whether theForeign Secretary should speak to Mr. Winant aboutthe communication which we had. received from theU.S. Government.                                         , .The general view of the War Cabinet wasthat the Foreign Secretary should take the opportunityof drawing the attention of Mr. Winant (who had only recently returned from the United States) to this communication, but that he should not ask him towithdraw it.The War Cabinet -    \      *Agreed that the matter should bedealt with by a communication fromthe Prime Minister to the president on the lines proposed at *X&apos;, and authorised the Prime Minister to despatch a telegram accordingly.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1
