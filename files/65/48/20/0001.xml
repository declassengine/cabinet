(Uh) 169thConclusions)The War Cabinet then considered in Greece.the situationAttitude of Dominion governments the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that no further communications had been receivedfrom the Dominion Governments.      The Prime minister informed the War Cabinet that he had sent Mr. Mackenzie^King the texts of the telegrams which had been exchanged with the President in August last as to thepolicy to be adopted in Greece and the responsibility to be assumed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, togetherwith the text of the Caserta Agreement of26th September, 19hh.      The basis on which we had undertaken our present responsibility, and the factthat we had done so in full agreement with the President,would be   evident to him from those documents.Military situation the PRIME MINISTER said that following on the&apos;discussion in Cabinet on 16th December he had askedField Marshal Alexander for his appreciation of themilitary situation.     Pie then read to the War Cabinethis unnumbered, personal telegram to Field MarshalAlexander of 17thunnumbered reply.December and the Field Marshal&apos;s

Field Marshal Alexander was not immediatelyanxious over, our position in the city but the task of our troops was not an easy one.      He thought we.could hold our present position in Athens, butnot perhaps defeat the rebels there yet.      If thepresent rebel resistance continued (and it might increase) he would be compelled to send anotherinfantry division to Athens, which could only comefrom the Italian front, with serious results onthe battle there.      If E.L.A.S.  intended to have ashow down and fight it out to a finish, he mightwell &quot;have to employ this other division, and adecision might not be reached until several weeks after its arrival.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the latestnews available through Press sources suggested thatthe military position was now taking a turn for the better, and a forward move of British troops was reported to have begun.Political   situation the PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet    &apos;that he and the Foreign Secretary had seen the king of Greece, as desired by the Cabinet, on .1 6th December.,The King still saw strong objection to a regency, andXhad made it clear that his doubts as to the suitability of the Archbishop as sole Regent remained undiminished.He had again stressed in conversation the attitude ofhis Ministers and the onerous nature of the decision which we were anxious that he should take.      It wasplain that His Majesty was under great stress.The following points; were taken in discussion:-(a) While the case for a regency still appeared,despite the King&apos;s hesitations, to be a good one on merits, ought we not to be more sure than we were ofthe reliability of the Archbishop as sole Regent, andof his previous record?     THE FOREIGN SECRETARY saidthat the Archbishop had been elected by a majority of votes to the See of Athens in the time of GeneralMetaxas.      The General had, however, arranged for the see to be filled by the-unsuccessful candidate.When the Axis took over control they had found theincumbent of the See difficult and ..had replaced himby the present Archbishop whose record in dealing withthe Germans had, however, been entirely satisfactory.While it had been stated (Athens telegram 619)that nothing but the appointment of the Archbishopas Regent would have any influence on the Left, therewas no evidence that he was under the. thumb xg E.L. A. S., &quot;r ^e- i^c^g X*yJb^JiJ&amp;*     l^o^x rKJL,,(b) The fear was expressed that if we- agreed tothe appointment of the Archbishop as Regent, weshould at once be faced with new demands by E.L.A.S.Could we rely on the Archbishop to resist in that event?(c) We !$ust be at pains to avoid establishing the Archbishop as sole Regent in face of the King&apos;sopposition, and recognising him in substitution forthe King as the lawful government of Greece, only tofind that we had replaced the lawful constitutionalmonarch by a dictator, who would have no support fromM. Papandreou or the Royalists, and who would bedifficult to dislodge.

(d) Was there any risk that the King andM. Papandreou wished us to remain responsible forthe situation until the keft had been defeated anda Sight Wing administration established on a firm basis?(e) THS FOREIGN SECRETARY said that whatever    ..objection might be seen to the Archbishop he feltthat a Council of Regency of three was not the answer..    While the Russians had imposed such anarrangement in Yugoslavia, in that countryMarshal Tito was in effective charge of administration and the Council of Regency mattered less.     There-   was no real parallel between the situation in yugoslavia and that in Greece,(f) No objection had been raised by the LeftWing to the return of the Mountain Brigade to greece.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that there wasno reason why we should not agree, if that seemed desirable once immediate fighting had stopped,that the brigade should return to its work in italy.The general sense of the War Cabinet was thatthere would be advantage in postponing any decision as to the line to be taken for two or three days.That would give opportunity for the militarysituation to clarify itself:   we should be in a stronger bargaining position once our control hadbeen re-established, and there seemed no risk thatthe delay would have any serious consequences.Line to be taken in parliament the War Cabinet then considered the line tobe taken in the event of the Greek situation being raised in the House.in the debate on the adjournmenton Thursday, 21st instant.     Since the matter had last been debated in the House there had been no fresh development of any importance, save inconnection with the appointment of a regency.   our objectives were to avoid any massacre or the taking of reprisals in Athens, to produce the conditions for a free and fair election to be followed by a plebiscite, both as soon as possible;    and to await the inauguration of a government which could hold the elections before we ourselves handed over our responsibilities in Greece.     We had no selfishaims and wanted nothing from the Greeks.     nothing would please us better than to leave the country assoon as circumstances made it possible for us todo so with honour and consistently &quot;with our obligations.If, however, pressure developed for a day to be set aside for debate, it should be made clearthat any motion critical of the Government&apos;s policy would be regarded as a vote of censure.After further discussion the War Cabinet -Agreed to resume discussion of the Greeksituation in two or three days&apos; time, andto defer any decision on policy untilthen.
