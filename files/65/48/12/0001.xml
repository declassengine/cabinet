(44) 160th conclusions; minute confidential Annex(30th November, 1944 -6.15 p.m.)CIVIL AIRTRANSPORTChicagoConference(previous reference:w.m. (44) 156thConclusions)The War Cabinet had before them president roosevelt&apos;s reply No.^6&amp;4-, dated 30th November to the telegram (No. 836 dated 28th November) sent him bythe Prime Minister consequent on the discussion inthe Cabinet on 27th November.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Special CivilAviation Committee had, at the Prime Minister&apos;request, considered the President&apos;s telegram togetherwith the most recent telegrams received from lord Swinton.     The latest proposals received byLord Swinton from Mr. Berle contemplated the grantof all Five Freedoms, coupled with the right of any state to contract out of the Fifth Freedom.       TheCommitteee agreed with Lord Swinton in regarding thatas entirely unacceptable and he did not propose todiscuss it further.The President&apos;s telegram did not represent any material concession to our point of view, but expressed a readiness to consider a settlement on thebasis of a plan which had been put forward by theCanadian Delegation at Chicago.There v/as some doubt as to what precisely thatplan covered.     Telephone enquiries were being madeof Chicago.      The Committee had, however, proceededon the assumption that it could be defined as follbwst-(i) Fifth Freedom traffic would be limitedinitially to two-thirds of the trafficoriginating at the home port of theaircraft.(ii) Thereafter an Escalator Clause should apply as before.(iii) States would have the right to contract out at any time on six months&apos; notice.The Committee had been anxious, if at allpossible, to find a basis on which an understandingcould be reached with the United States.      Their.unanimous view was, however,  that if they hadcorrectly interpreted the Canadian plan, we should bejustified in accepting it only subject to the additionof a fare differential amounting to a minimum of25 per cent., the amount of this differential to beagreed at the Conference, andnot to be left to bedetermined by the international body.    If this could beachieved, they would recommend, though with great reluctance, that the Canadian&apos;plan should be accepted.

The following points were made in discussion:-(a) The Americans were likely to object to a .25 per cent, minimum differential on the ground ofits strangling effect.       It was pointed out, on theother hand, that the principle.of a differentialhad already&quot; been Under discussion, and that it mightwell, prove that it had been retained in the Canadianplan.      In any event, the American lines were in so strong a position that they could face a differential,and there was good reason to think that they wouldnot object to it.      It was relevant that thePresident!s telegram had not raised any difficulty inr. connection with it.(b) A 25 per cent, minimum differential, if itcould be secured, would represent substantialprotection for our interests, and one more reliablethan the provisions of the Canadian plan.     Admittedly,the American lines might be able to. collect a gooddeal of traffic even in face of the differential.But the longer the route, the more the 25 per cent,would operate as a deterrent.(c) The offer in the President&apos;s telegram tomake transport aircraft freely available to us onthe same terms as to the United States was of little value.      Its acceptance would enable the americans to establish their types of transport aircraftthroughout the world with unfortunate results to theBritish aircraft industry.(d) The President had remarked that he did not   &apos;see how increased frequencies on long routes woulddominate traffic on short routes.     We were not infact resisting increased frequencies on long routes.If this were conceded, with the power to pick uppassengers on short routes, it would, of course, havea -prejudicial effect on competing short route traffic.(e) While the President was correct in statingthat a larger number of States (viz. Peru, four otherSouth American States, Brazil, the Netherlands, Sweden,Denmark, Liberia and the Phillipines) supported theUnited States proposals, the following countries hadfavoured the proposal to grant the Fifth Freedom with no Escalator Clause in respect of Fifth Freedomtraffic:-     The United Kingdom, France, Belgium,China,.. Greece, Australia, New Zealand, South africa and India.      The degree of opposition was not,therefore, negligible.(f) Parliament might well regard the proposeddifferential as insufficient protection for our interests.      On the other hand &quot;the Conference was likely to register agreement on a number of points of much importance,  and the amount of the differentialwas less likely   in these circumstances to attractgreat attention.

Summing up the discussion THE PRIME ministers aid that he thought the general sense of - the WarCabinet was in favour of accepting the unanimousrecommendation, of the Special Civil Aviation Committeesubject to further expert examination and consultationwith Lord Swinton once the details of the Canadian-plan and the text of the clause were available.He would, in these circumstances&quot;, send an interimacknowledgement to the President, promising a-very early reply and informing him that we were, consulting- Lord Swinton.      In the event, it might proveunnecessary to trouble the Cabinet as a whole withthe answer to be sent to the President.-After discussion the War Cabinet -(1) Invited the Special Civil aviation committee to report to the Prime minister the result of the further enquiries that were being made as to the Canadian plan.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to sendah interim answer to the president to the effect that the matter was&quot;being examined urgently, and thata reply would toe .derit as soon asthe position had been cleared up with Lord Swintou.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1
