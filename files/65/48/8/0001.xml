(Uk)  -153RD CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(22nd November, 13kh - 11*30 a.m*)CIVIL AIRTRANSPORTChicagoConference(previous reference:W.M. (kk) 151stConclusions,Minute 2)(The War Cabinet had before them a personal telegram 65k of the 21st November from president roosevelt to the Prime Minister referring to theimpasse which had arisen at the Chicago Conference,and urging that we should meet the demands put forward by the American negotiators at that Conference.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that private discussions had been proceeding during the last few days at Chicagobetween representatives of Great Britain, the UnitedStates and Canada,   with   a view to arriving at abasis of agreement which could be put before the wholeconference.     At one time provisional agreement hadbeen reached on the following lines:-(i) the number of services to be run by the operators of each nationality should bedecided upon the basis of the trafficembarked in each country.     This gave us,broadly speaicing, a basis of fifty-fiftyas regards frequencies. ...(ii) the traffic was to be divided on thebasis of each aircraft carrying 60%of its maximum load.(iii) a provision had been inserted (to which wehad agreed with the greatest reluctance)for what was known as an escalator clause.Under this clause, if any country8saircraft consistently carried more than65% of their maximum load, that country wouldbe entitled&quot; to such increased frequencies as would reduce the load of its aircraft to65%;   but there would be no corresponding altei*-ation in the frequencies of other operators.(iv) the Americans had only been willing toaccept this system of frequency allocationprovided the- fifth freedom was also granted. -This meant- the right to pick up and setdown traffic at points in countries otherthan that to which the aircraft belonged.Thus, U.S. aircraft flying on the routeNew York - London- Cairo - Karachi, couldpick up in London and set down in Cairo orKarachi, and vice versa.

We had been prepared to agree to thisprovided that the rates charged for, say/a flight from London to Cairo on aircraftflying on the New York, Karachi route,were higher than the rates charged by&quot;local&quot; air services flying between suchintermediate points.      This had beenaccepted in principle.The United States claimed that in thisprovisional agreement they had made considerableconcessions to us.in agreeing that frequencies shouldbe determined on the &quot;traffic embarked&quot; basis, and in agreeing to protect local operators by charginga higher rate for flights by aircraft on the throughroutes.     But the effect of these concessions was largely neutralised by American insistence on theescalator clause.Nevertheless, the provisional agreement wouldhave represented a workable and acceptable basis.But at this point the American negotiatorshad put forward a new, and quiteunacceptable demand.      They had claimed the right toduplicate any intermediate traffic v/ith their throughaircraft,  irrespective of whether any of the trafficoriginated in America.      Thus, on the New York - LondonCairo - Karachi route already given as an example, theyclaimed to run as many aircraft from London to Cairoas we did, and the same from London, to Karachi,regardless of whether the traffic originated inAmerica.      On this&apos; basis, the United States wouldcapture the world&apos;s air traffic.      This proposal was quite unacceptable since it meant the demand for ashare of.the local traffic between two neighbouring countries by the aircraft of a third- country beyond what was warranted by the grant of a right to pickup and set down traffic on the through service.    Itwas in these circumstances that the President had approached the Prime Minister.The Lord Privy Seal added that the SpecialAviation Committee felt that we had gone to the limit of concession that could wisely be made.    Lord Swintonhad throughout had their full support, and they werein full agreement with him in regarding these latestdemands as unacceptable.THE MINISTER OP AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION supported the view stated by the Lord Privy Seal.     He read tothe War Cabinet a note explaining in greater detail the position that had arisen, (copies of which havebeen   circulated separately as W.P. (Uh) 680.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that, accepting thatwe had a good case for standing firm, we must also consider to what extent we could in fact hope tomake our point of view prevail, account being taken of the possible reactions on other matters of aserious divergence of view on Civil Aviation.    Inparticular consideration must be given to the risk that we might be misrepresented as taking action inrestraint of trade;    and that the United States mightplausibly claim that they asked no more for themselvesthan they were willing to concede to others, includingourselves. s

In discussion the following points were made:-(a) The issues involved were so grave as to necessitate -a firm stand.      Our future in civilaviation was at stake.     From the Dominion pent ofview, there was the risk that Empire unity might be threatened if, by conceding the American demands, weled the Dominions to feel that we could not be relied on to protect their interests, and that they would do better to turn away from us and towards the UnitedStates.(b) It could not reasonably be contended thatthe withholding of consent&apos;to the Americans&apos; latest proposals was in restraint of trade.     Under theprovisional agreement the Americans would have theright to use our aerodromes.     What was, in issue nowwas the right to increase frequencies on the basisof local traffic to which they would not otherwise have boeh entitled.(c) In the allocation of war manufacture, the americans had taken responsibility for the building of transport aircraft while we had concentrated almost wholly on operational types.     We were consequentlyin a difficult position in terras of stocks orproduction of transport aircraft, and this would lastsome time.      It was the more important not to give theUnited States a flying start by conceding their demands.      Were we to do so, we should find itimpossible to catch up at a later stage.((d) There was much to be said for postponinga decision as regards the grant of the Fifth Freedomfor a further period until we were in a strongnegotiating position.-    The Lord Privy Seal said,however, that the Special Civil Aviation Committee hadregarded this as impracticable, while a proposal theyhad made to Lord Swinton for a three-year delaybefore the escalator clause was to operate had met with no response from the other side.(e) The provisional agreement reached between mr. Berle and Lord Swinton on 17th November had beena very fair compromise.      There was no justification for going further.      So far from our making additional demands, as suggested by the President,  the impassethat had arisen was due to additional demands putforward by the American negotiators after provisional agreement had been reached.(f) We should urge the Americans to revert tothe basis provisionally agreed on 17th November.    Ifthey refused to do so, we should suggest that anagreement should be reached on the technical side,where a considerable advance had been made, but thata decision on the transport side should be postponedand the Conference adjourned.      It was important inthat connection to avoid a situation in which theUnited States negotiators could take the agreementof 17th November and, in particular,  the concessionsembodied in it as regards the escalator clause, asthe jumping-off point for any fresh negotiations,  if and.when they were resumed.-3-

(g) The suggestion was also.made that if agreement could not be reached on the regulation offrequencies, the Americans should be asked to agreeto this issue being deferred until the next meeting\  between the Prime Minister and President Roosevelt.It was pointed out, however, that exception would-  be likely to be taken, both by the Dominions and by countries outside the Empire, to anything which couldbe represented as a purely-Anglo-American settlementreached without their being directly associated with it.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clearthat the general sense of the War Cabinet was thatthere could be no justification for accepting the supplementary proposals put forward by the United^States negotiators.     He invited the Special CivilAviation Committee to consider the matter further in the light of the discussion, and to let Jjim havea draft on which he could base a personal telegram to president Roosevelt.      The draft should include thefollowing points:-(i) The difficulty in which we were placed byrequests   for decisions on matters so .grave at such short notice,(ii) The importance of the concessions that&apos; had been made by us in the provisional agreement of 17th November,(iii) The fact that the breakdown was the resultof supplementary demands put forward not by us but by the American negotiators, andthe reasons for which those demands could-   not be conceded. \(iv) That while we remained ready to supportthe provisional agreement of 17th November,we could not go beyond that.(v) If, therefore, the President -was unable to confirm the provisional agreement arrivedat on 17th November, we suggested that theConference should finalise the valuabletechnical agreements which had been reached,and that the rest of the matters should be adjourned for a time, during which weshould consider the matter more fully and see whether there was not some solution ofthe problem at which we could arrive.The War Cabinet -   .Accepted the Prime Minister&apos;s view and invited the Special Civil aviation committee to prepare a draft telegram on the lines indicated by him,NOTE:    The telegram as despatched is attached as an appendix to the printed conclusions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.-4-
