The Conference was still in session, but there seemed little hope of agreement on major issues, and it was likely to come to an end on tuesday, 5th December.On 28th November, Mr. Berle had put forwardfresh demands for the unconditional grant of all fivefreedoms and the right of any operator to fly anywherewith any number of aircraft.     These proposals wouldhave resulted in unrestricted competition, and theyhad been rejected by Lord Swinton.Canada had then put forward an alternative plan which did not, however, represent much of a compromise.     Under it Fifth Freedom traffic would besubject to an Escalator Clause.     Any air line achieving65 per cent load factor between two intermediate stageson a through route over a given period would be entitledto an unlimited increase in frequencies over the wholeroute, subject to the rolanqtiishiaent of the extra frequencies ifafter three years the average load factor fell below50 per cent.     Such an arrangement would have put theUnited States in a very strong position.Lord Swinton had made a counter-proposal that theallocation of Fifth Freedom traffic on a through routeshould be made by the proposed (advisory) international organisation on the basis of -(i) the capacity to which a State was entitled under the &quot;traffic embarked&quot; principle;(ii) the public needs of any section of a route for air.transport;(iii) the state of development of local air services, and(iv) economy&quot;of air transport operation on throughservices.: These proposals had been rejected by Mr. Berle.At this point a reply had been received from thePresident . (NaT. 2225Al )      to the Prime-Minister&apos; s telegram(No. T.2212/h).      In his telegram President RooseveltQ emphasised his desire for agreement, avoided entering in the merits of the points in dispute, and suggested furtheconsideration of the Canadian plan.     Meantime, however,at the Plenary Session on 1st December, Lord Swinton, afterconsultation with Mr. Berle, had proposed that the questions

remaining unsettled should he referred to the international organisation, agreement toeing registered on the technicalsubjects which had been before the Conference and on those other matters 6ri which agreement had &quot;been reached.     Mr.Berle had accepted this, hut-Mayor la Guardla had criticisedthe failure to Secure agreement on the major issues and had moved to refer the matter hack.     Mr. Symington^ speakingfor Canada, had been inclined to give him dome support. .The latest indications were, however, that the Conference   ,would end tomorrow without agreement having been reached ottthe major issues, and that these accordingly would have to .stand over for consideration by the International Organisation.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had discussed theposition informally with the American -Ambassador, in Lbhddtiwho was disturbed at the impasse that had arisen.     In the conversation the possibility had been suggested of an understanding withrthe United States under which &quot;cabotage&quot;for Great Britain would be greatly enlarged so as to covere.g. flights to Paris.     This would go some way to compensate for the existing position whereby the United States cabotagetraffic v/as greatly superior to ours.     He could not saythat any such arrangement would in fact prove-acceptable tothe United States, but it might merit confidential discussionelsewhere. &quot;THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet the text of the telegram from President Roosevelt referred to bythe Lord Privy Seal (No. T.2225/h of 2nd December) and ofa draft reply which the Lord Privy Seal had prepared forhis consideration, the despatch,of which he had postponed pending further news as to developments in the Conference.In all the circumstances the balance of advantage was1against any further move on our part.     Peeling in thiscountry would support us in resisting a wholly one-sidedagreement, and he refused to believe that the United states could afford to alienate Great Britain as well-as Russia inthese matters.     The possibility could not be excluded, if     -American pressure to run us off the air became unreasonablystrong, of legislation to prevent British nationals travellingby foreign planes.     He&quot; felt that the wise course was tomake no further concession, to reply politely to thePresident, as suggested by the Lord Privy Seal, and there-after discuss between ourselves and see whether some newway out of the impasse could be found.The War Cabinet -(l) Took note of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s reply.(2) Expressed agreement with the Prime Minister&apos;view and invited him to reply to the president on&quot;the general lines indicated, with a view tosuch a reply reaching the President before theConference came to an end.

MINUTE 10Coafidential Annex(4th December, 1944 - 6,00 p,m.)FOREIGNAFFAIRSGeneral de gaulle&apos;visit toMoscowTHE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet thelatest correspondence that had passed between him andPremier Stalin on -(i) the Western Bloc (telegram T.2183/4 to premier Stalin dated 25th November, andPremier Stalin&apos;s reply T.2234/4 dated 1st December);(ii) the conversations between Premier Stalin andGeneral de Gaulle.    (Telegram T.2127/4 of 16thNovember from Prime Minister to Premier Stalin,T. 2151/4 of 20th November,   T.2253A Of 2ndDecember and T, 2250/4 of 3rd Decemberfrom Premier Stalin to the Pfime Minister).As regards the Western Bloc. Premier Stalin had expressed appreciation of the Prime Minister&apos;s message, andhad added that he would not fail to profit from his goodadvice and inform him as to the development of the conversations.As,regards General de Gaulle&apos;s visit. premier stalin had asked the Prime Minister for his advice on two   .questions likely to be raised by the General:-(a) the conclusion of a Franco-Soviet pact of mutual assistance similar to the Anglo-Soviet pact;(h) the question of the eastern frontier ofFrance and the extension of the french frontier to the left bank of the Rhine..   He had subsequently reported that he had informedGeneral de Gaulle that it would be necessary to consult theUnited States and the United Kingdom on the question of thefrontier, while the mutual, assistance pact would call forstudy from-all points of view, including the juridicalaspect and the question of who would ratify any such arrangement in France.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed satisfaction at thecordial tone of Premier Stalin&apos;s messages, and at his request for our advice.     He had been in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary as to the reply to be sent;   and was anxious that it. should be in cordial terms and should issuewithout delay.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat Premier Stalin1s telegram made it clear that he,was inno hurry finally to conclude a pact with General de Gaulleduring his present visit.     He suggested that the replymight he that we were wholly in favour of a pact, hut that from every point of view a tripartite pact would be bettor.It was proposed in any event to inform the United StatesGovernment.     The fact that France had no treaty with theUnited Kingdom might create misunderstanding in the eventof a pact of mutual assistance confined to France and theSoviet.     A tripartite arrangement would have the furtheradvantage that it would enable us to bring our existingtreaty with the Soviet up to date in certain respects.Would it not suffice the Prime Minister should reply that&apos;in principle he was entirely in favour.The moving of the eastern frontier of France to the left bank of the&apos; Rhine or, alternatively, the formationof a Rhenish-Westphalian province under international -control were clearly matters for settlement at the peace-table.     In replying in this sense to Premier Stalin, we might, however, make it clear that there was no reason why, when Pi*emier Stalin, President Roosevelt-and the PrimeMinister next met, they should not come much closer toconcclusion than they had ao far done.     The -President,as Premier Stalin was aware, did not expect General de gaulle to come to the meeting of the Big Three, but we wo.uldhope that this could be modified to his coming later onwhen decisions affecting France were under discussion, whilePremier Stalin might care.to consider whether it wouldnot be a good thing to let the European Advisory Commissionsitting in London, of which France was a member, explore thetopic without committing in any way the Heads of governments.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed his agreement withthe Foreign Secretary, and invited.him, subject to theapproval of the War Cabinet, to prepare a draft of a reply to be sent that evening to Premier Stalin.     he explained the special reasons which made.a very urgentanswer desirable.The War Cabinet took note with satisfaction ofthe above statement and approved the line of the proposed reply to Premier Stalin.^&quot;see telegram 2258/k of 5th December,/Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,
