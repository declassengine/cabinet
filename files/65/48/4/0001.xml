(UU) 1U5RD conclusions confidential Annex(1st November, 19M+ - 5.30 p.m. )The War Cabinet had before- them the -note(W. p. (Ijlj.) 612) of a conversation on 31 at Octoberbetween the Polish Foreign Minister and Sir alexander cadogan.     Monsieur Romer had put certain questions to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and thought that iffavourable answers could be given&apos; to them it mightfacilitate a decision by the Polish Government.Sir Alexander Cadogan had undertaken to submitMonsieur Romeros questions to the Prime Minister,but had made it clear that he could himself give no answer to them.THE PERMANENT UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS said that Monsieur Romer had alsotelegraphed to Washington the points he had put toHis Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to ascertaining the Views of the United States Government, but had as yet had no answer.The War Cabinet proceeded to consider thequestions which had been raised by the PolishGovernment as follows:-I. Was the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government onthe territorial compensation which Poland hadbeen promised in the West so decided that eventhough the United States might not agree to theterritorial changes in question, His majesty&apos;s government would still consider themselves boundto advocate these at the peace settlement?THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that an affirmativeanswer should be given to this question.     The reason why the United States Government could not be quoted in this frontier guarantee was, of course, becausethe treaty-making power was reserved to the Senate andat present required a two-thirds majority.     But thePresident and State Department had seen all the correspondence that had passed on the subject, and hehad no reason whatever to believe that they were notmost strongly in favour of a settlement on the linesthat we favoured.     Even if the United StatesGovernment could not for these reasons be associatedwith the guarantee, there was no reason why we shouldnotsay that we and Russia stood together in thematter.(1) The War Cabinet agreed.-1-

\II. Is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentdefinitely in favour of extending the Polishfrontier up to the Oder?-THE PRIME MINISTER said that Monsieur Rorner&apos;sstatement to Sir Alexander Cadogan made it clear thatthe Poles did not want to carry too heavy a burden inthis matter or to bear the whole responsibility foraccepting territorial concessions so extensive asthose the Russians wore ready to make.      If, however,when the time of the peace conference came they wishedto accept some less generous measure of territorialCompensation in the West, he saw no reason why theyshould not convey this to their Allies, when theGreat Powers could take on themselves the burden of imposing a particular frontier.     He was fully alive to the magnitude of the problem which arose inconnection with the interchange of populations, butthe difficulties involved should not be insuperable.THE PERMANENT UNDER SECRETLY OP STATE FORFOREIGN aFF^IRS said that, as stated by Monsieur Romer,the Foreign Secretary had hinted to the Poles that atoo far-reaching change of the frontier in the Westmight, if it became known, stiffen German resistance.He thought himself that M. Mikolajczyk was probablyunder great pressure at the moment to secure fromGermany the widest territorial compensation that hecould obtain.THE MINISTER OF STATE suggested that theterritorial changes envisaged meant not only asubstantial diminution in German territory, but thecrowding of the German nationals from the area tobe transferred to Poland into the diminished GermanState.      The operation involved was one of far greater magnitude than any of this nature that hadever taken place.The point was taken,  on the other hand, that german losses in the war,  the repatriation of themillions of foreigners who had been moved into germany for war work during the war, and the repatriation ofprisoners of war would greatly ease the problem.While the undertaking was a formidable one in theconditions of a country like Germany,  there was noreason to regard it as impracticable though it wouldtake time.After further discussion, the War Cabinet -(2) Agreed that the Poles should beinformed that the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government was definitelyin favour of extending the Polish-frontier up to the line of theOder, unless Poland, of her ownvolition, should desire at alater stage a more restrictedterritorial compensation inthe West.-2-

- HI* Composition of &apos;any future Polish GovernmentTHE .RRI&amp;ES MINISTER- said- that this point wasone of some difficulty.     M. Mikolajczyk had spoken to him about there being one arrangement to save the prestige of the Soviet Government and the LublinCommittee, and another understanding between him(M. Mikolajczyk) and lvl. Berut as between the., Polesthemselves.   &apos; Thus it might be that some-members would be on M. Berut13 list who would, in fact, bethoroughly satisfactory to M. Mikolajczyk, and soon, with the result that the latter would, in thenew Government, have a&apos; larger number of supportersthan would appear to be the case from the numbers&apos;comprised in the two lists.      These were, of course,matters for negotiation.     He understood thatM. Mikolajczyk had proposed that each of the five     . .Polish parties should     put forward a list of its best men from which the choice should be made, butthat the Lublin Committee had demanded 75!&quot;$ Q  thenew government.     He (the Prime Minister) had told   .Marshal Stalin, who had taken it well,  that this was .a wholly excessive demand anC that world opinion would never regard a government 75% of which wasnominated in such circumstances as a free agent.In his own view, M. Mikolajczyk ought to have atleast 50% in the reconstituted government.     Whileall these matters were for negotiation andarrangement, he&apos; doubted if the composition-&apos;.of the new government could be solved on satisfactorylines until the frontier question had been got out .of the way.      The fact could not be concealed that agreement might be reached on the frontier, and yet feverything break on the question of joining forces with the Lublin Committee.     That would be a greatpity, but the Polish Government would be in a muchbatter position on a point of this kind, where theywould have the support of Great Britain and probablyof the United States-, than on the frontier question.It would be.we11 that we should bring-these considerations out in our reply to the Poles.THE MINISTER OF&apos; AIRCRAFT: PRODUCTION suggested &quot;that if a settlement of the frontier question on lines satisfactory to Marshal Stalin could be obtained,it might help to secure a satisfactory settlement asbetween the conflicting Polish parties if the frontiersettlement could be linked with the question of reconciliation. &quot; . THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.      Hisown wisb. was that M. Mikolajczyk should return toRussia on the basis that the Eastern frontier was settled and then resume his conversations.* THE SECRETARY OF &quot;STATE FOR AIR - enquired whatthe position of His Majesty&apos;s Government would bigif, after we had stated that our policy was&apos; toextend the Polish frontier up to the line of theOder, negotiations broke down over the composition of the Polish Government.THE PRIME MINISTER said that out of these discussions there must come either agreement ordisagreement.      If, unhappily, agreement could not bereached,  then . the representatives of the PolishGovernment in London would return to this country,and matters would have to be left to take their course.

In that -event we should stand to the line which wehad always taken, namely,. that   we should recognise ino territorial changes before the peace conference,and that failing agreement changes of frontier must-be reserved until.then.      He had, of course, at thesame time made it clear that he would himself beprepared to say at the peace conference that in his judgment the Curzon Line was a fair basis of settlement.      There would be no question in the eventof a breakdown of our recognising or guaranteeing a polish Government with which we had no continuity,such as the Lublin Government.The War Cabinet - - :. - -V(3) Took note,-wj.th approval, of thePrime Minister&apos;s statement,&quot; andof the lino, of action suggestedby him.     , -IV. Will His Majesty&apos;s Government guarantee theindependence and integrity of the New Poland?THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had toconsider whether, if such a guarantee were given,it should be a British guarantee or a joint guaranteewith Russia.      It seemed clear that the Poles who, inany event, would like us to give a guarantee, would prefer a joint Anglo-,&apos;Joviot guarantee,  the effect ofwhich would be to cover both sides of vtheir territory,-with -which the United States should be associated.If we refused to give this guarantee and negotiationsbroke, down in consequence between the Poles and theRussians, matters would have to take their coursewith the disastrous consequences that could be foreseen.He felt himself that wc- would be justified in givingthe guarantee asked for, x^^particularly if it&apos; was- a joint guarantee with Russia and if. the United States couldthereafter be associated with it,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL was opposed to    giving aguarantee of this nature.   &apos; We had the lesson of 1939before us and should not again give guarantees, to poland which we could not implement.      He thought that ,the great bulk of British public opinion would be opposed to a .further commitment of this nature.THE PRIME MINISTER did not agree that theposition was parallel to the position in 1939^     Theguarantee now proposed to .be given had a differenthistorical background.      It would recognise &apos;a situation reached by agreement between the two parties,which would be confirmed at the Peace. Conference.    Ifit was joint, we should have the support of Russia-and in due course it might be hoped the U.S.A.Finally,  the guarantee had to be set against the background of the- proposed World Organisation, whichwas to ensure respect for frontiers and maintainpeace and good fellowship between the nations.      Itwas in these circumstances that he felt that exceptioncould not reasonably be taken- to the Polish request.

In the. ensuing, discussion the following points were made:- ,(a) The case for a joint guarantee with Russia,, withwhich the United States should be associated later,was a strong.one.     An individual guarantee might be misunderstood by the U.S.S.R.j    would impose adisproportionately heavy burden on us and would beof less value to the Poles.      If Marshal Stalin&apos;svarious statements were to be taken seriously,difficulty ought not,to be experienced in securingRussian participation, while the United StatesGovernment were fully aware of what was happening.(b) Any guarantee given should be operative only untilthe proposed World Organisation had been established and the responsibilities accepted by us under theguarantee had been merged in the larger guarantees which the World Organisation would afford.    ; The factthat our guarantees would be.operative until they hadbeen effectively merged in the World settlement should make it easier to secure Dominion support forthem.(c) If, during the currency of a guarantee by theRussians and ourselves of the integrity and independence of &quot;the- new Poland, Russia were, inbroach of the guarantee, to attack Poland,  theguarantee would no longer be binding upon us.(d) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs suggested that the Dominions should be consulted before any reply was given to &quot;the Poles.    . The^ case was a classic instance of a commitment by HisMajesty&apos;s Government which might gravely affect theDominions.      THE PRIME&apos; MINISTER pointed out that itwas of the first urgency to give an answer to thePoles.      The point was made also that the dominions had agreed to participate in the World Organisation,and it was contemplated that the guaranteenow in view should in duo course be absorbed,in a World Organisation guarantee.(e) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSobserved that if the Russians were to maintain theposition they had taken up at Dumbarton Oaks, theycould effectively block any discussion or action, inregard to a breach of the guarantee, by the Councilof the World Organisation.      THE PRIME MINISTERobserved that our whole position had to proceed onthe assumption that Russia would in fact rank as apartner.(f) If we told the Poles of our readiness to give aguarantee such as they asked for, and negotiations between them and Russia broke down, the positionremained as at present and all matters in issue would stand over for decision at the Peace Conference.After further discussion the War Cabinet -(kj Agreed that a guarantee of theindependence and integrity of thenew Poland should be given to thePolish Government.

(5) Agreed that such a guarantee shouldbe given jointly by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the U.8.3.R, an,, that. the U.S.A.  should, in due course beinvited to associate themselves with. - it.        &apos; * &apos; .(6);Agreed that the guarantee so givenwould subsist until merged&quot; in the   .&apos;larger guarantees which would begiven by the ../orld Organisation onits establishment.(7) Invited.the Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to prepare a draft of a reply to be sent to the Poles and submitit to the Prime Minister&apos; for approvalbefore despatch.        * &apos;(8) Agreed that the Dominion Prime ministers should be informed forthwith of theproposalvfco give this guarantee, butthat prioi^assent need not be obtained.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.1,
