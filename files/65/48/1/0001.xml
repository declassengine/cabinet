MINUTE 3&quot; Confidential Annex(2nd October, - 5.30 p.m.)POLAND(previous reference:W.M. (4U)l27thConclusions,Minute 3)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that as the War Cabinet were aware, GeneralSosnkowskl had now been removed from his post of commander-in-Chief.      In his place the PolishGovernment had appointed General Bor-Komorowski.This appointment had been violently attacked in astatement made by M. Morawslci on behalf of thePolish Committee of National Liberation in moscow on 30th 3epte.-v.ber.     He had stated that his Committeeregarded General Bor as a criminal, and that he was more hated than General Sosnkowskl.It was generally regarded as unfortunate that the General appointed to succeed GeneralSosnkowski should apparently have been regarded inthis light.      The view was expressed, however, thatthe B.B.G. had given undue prominence to My   Morawski&apos;attack on General Bor on the 30th September.     this action was hardly consistent with the request whichhad been made to Members of Parliament to say nothing which would exacerbate the difficulties of the Polishsituation.After a short discussion:The Minister of Information was invited todiscuss this matter with the Governors ofthe B.B.C., and to inform them that theWar Cabinet hoped that in future lessemphasis should be given in news bulletinsto the Polish political difficulties.The Foreign Secretary thought that it wouldbe advisable that we should now endeavour to dropfurther agents in Poland with a view to obtainingadditional information.     This was approved.Of^^ of the War Cabinet, 3.W.I.
