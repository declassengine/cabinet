(kk) I6i).th conclusions,Minute 2) *The War:Cabinet met to consider the situationin Greece.and had before them -(i) a telegram from Mr. Leeper, No. 5U9 dated10th December, containing a. jointappreciation and recommendation byGeneral Scobie and himself;(ii) a personal message (Athens telegramNo. 563 of 11th December) to the PrimeMinister from Field Marshal Alexandercontaining his appreciation of thesituation in Athens and his recommendations.The main points in these telegrams were asfollows:-Mr. Leeper and General Scobie, recommended on both military and political grounds the &quot;appointmentof the Archbishop of Athens as Regent,     There was reason to believe that theto impose conditions for aeventual disarmament whichaccept. They had reason to would accept, and that InThe political parties aArchbishop would be able&quot;Cease Fire&quot; and theGeneral Scobie couldknow that the Archbishopwas wholeheartedly pro-British,well as the E.A.M. had pressedhim to accept this role to break the present politicalimpasse.      It would be best if the Archbishop were appointed Regent until a plebiscite had been held.If the King of Greece would not agree to such a period,Mr. Leeper and General Scobie enquired whether it would do if the Archbishop were appointed Regent until inhis (the Archbishop1s) opinion the present emergencywas over.Field Marshal Alexander reported that themilitary situation was more serious than he had thoughtfrom the information which he had had in London.After consultation with all concerned in Athens, he,and Mr. Macmillan as his political adviser, recommended proclamation of all civilians against ua as rebels,and a declaration that those found in civilian clothesopposing us with weapons were liable to be shot, andthat 2k hours notice should be given that certain areas held by the rebels were to be wholly evacuatedby the civil population.     Both he and Mr. Macmillan

were strongly opposed to any offer of terms since this, following on their visit,would be regarded asa sign of weakness.      On the other hand, theysupported Mr. .Leeper&apos;s proposal that the Archbishopshould be made Regent and urged that the King shouldtake immediate steps to this end.      &quot;In this way jt -proper measure of responsibility can. be restored tothe Head of the Greek State and the most powerfulcry against us - foreign intervention - effectively&apos;answered&quot;.     The Field Marshal added that strongreinforcements were urgently required and that he -was putting this in hand.THE PRIME MINISTER said that after consultation,and in agreement, with the Foreign Secretary he had laid the proposals contained in Mr. Beeper&apos;s telegramNo. 549i as supported by Field Marshal Alexander andMr. Macmillan, before the King of Greece at 12.30 p*m.that morning and had read both telegrams to HisMajesty.      The King had reminded the Prime minister that, a fortnight ago, he had himself wanted to gc to greece and stake his life on his crown.      In deference to our wishes he had agreed not to do so.      He now agreed that we Had been right and that his presence in Greece would help neither his dynasty nor thesituation.      The King had asked for two hours in which to consider the proposals.     His Majesty, at first sight, preferred the second alternative, viz. thatthe Archbishop should be appointed Regent until inhis (the Archbishop&apos;s) opinion the present emergencywas over, since we could not tell how-long a plebiscite might be delayed or how things would go.&quot;He had added that the Archbishop was a very ambitiouspolitician.The King of Greece had come back to see him(the Prime Minister) at 2,k5 p.m* and had broughtwith him a written statement, which was read to theWar Cabinet.      The King had also brought a me isagefrom M.- Sophoulis urging that it was his duty to cutneout and act as arbiter between the partiesoThe King&apos;s written statement was to the effectthat, as always, his foremost desire was to assistthe British Government and that, following on the communications that had been made to him and his conversation with the Prime Minister, he would beready to appoint the Archbishop of Athens or anyother suitable person to form a new- government, and toauthorise M. Papandreou (whom it would be necessaryto persuade to resign the Prime Ministership) toswear in the new government in the King&apos;s name,     Thenew Prime Minister would be given full power to take such measures as he considered necessary for therestoration of order.      (Mr. Churchill said that heread this phrase as including power to make anarrangement and to use methods of conciliation).

&quot; &apos; -The ..establishment of a Regency would, however,be of no assistance to.the Government in dealing withthe military situation, and would certainly be interpreted by.a large majority of the Greek people as an abandonment of the struggle by the King.      Ineffect the King was unwilling to agree to theappointment of the Archbishop as Regent, but was prepared to accept him as Prime Minister in succession to M. Papandreou.In the discussion which ensued the followingpoints were made:-(a) THE SECRETARY OP -STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the suggestion now put forward by the king was one which the Foreign Office had had it in mind to make a day or two ago.      It was, however, difficultto say that it was any longer right in the light of-Field Marshal Alexander&apos;s views.It was arguable that the best course might befor the Archbishop to undertake the task of PrimeMinister, given the uncertainty as to whether theKing would agree to.give him formal authority asRegent.     Alternatively, M. Papandreou might stay in power and the Archbishop act as intermediary.(b) It would be very dangerous if theimpression got abroad that the. new government hadbeen nominated by the King.     M. Papandreou had beenapproved by all parties at the time of his appointment.If he resigned and was succeeded by a governmentnominated by the King, this   might give rise to.misunderstanding.     This, however, would not arise if the government were nominated by a Regent v/ho wason the spot and in the best position to judge.(c) We had certain obligations to M. Papandreou,who was the head of the government, which had invitedus into Greece.      It would be undesirable to givethe impression that we had thrown him over. &apos;    this criticism would not hold if the Archbishop were madethe Regent.(d) Mr. Leeper had proposed that the Archbishopshould be appointed Regent until in his (the archbishop&apos;s) opinion the present emergency was over.But an ambitious politician might&apos;be reluctant to declare that the crisis was over and to remit power.      Shouldthe&quot; Archbishop&apos;s Regency be limited to a fixed period,say, three months?     The general view was that the term should be &quot;until the present emergency is over&quot;,without further definition.(e) Wife must make it clear that we would notbe parties to setting up a dictatorship whether ofthe right, left or centre.(f) How far were- the War Cabinet entitled to&apos;go in giving&apos; formal advice to the ruler of a foreign state, on a matter such as this?     THE FOREIGN secretary thought there were precedents, but that in any event we need not be afraid of adopting the course underconsideration.      It would be a case of recommending a particular course of action to the King, not oftendering formal advice to him.

(g)  THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFinformed, the War Cabinet that the Chiefs of staff had considered&apos; the military proposals put forward by&quot;Field Marshal Alexander in his telegram No. 563and were in full agreement with them.. The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows:-&apos; (1) The military proposals put forward byField Marshal Alexander were approved.(2) The prime Minister and Foreign Secretarywere invited to see the King of Greece, andto inform him that the War Cabinet favoured the appointment of the Archbishop ofAthens as Regent, in the terms of thefollowing Memorandum - ^&quot;The War Cabinet have carefully considered Your Majesty&apos;s Memorandum.--i    &apos;   They have also taken into account theadvice which they have received fromtheir representatives in Greece,including Field Marshal Alexander.&quot;In the light of this, the WarCabinet have reached the conclusionthat the wisest course for Your Majesty   ,.to adopt is to appoint the archbishop of Athens as Regent, until the present emergency is over.&quot;They feel bound to urge   your majesty most strongly to accept thispolicy, as being in the best interestsof your country.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that a narrativeof events be prepared to eomaunicate to the Dominionsand the United States.     So far as concerned theUnited States, the telegrams exchanged with thePresident, and referred to at the meeting of the WarCabinet on 7th December, showed that the United states had authorised our plan of sending forces into Greece,after the German withdrawal, to maintain order.     Wheninforming the President of the latest developments,he would endeavour to persuade him &quot;to make some public statement, e.g. wishing the. Archbishop success in his mission. &apos;        .So far as Russia was concerned he thought itwould suffice to inform them of what had happened..If the King were prepared to accept the course recommended to. him, instructions to Athens&apos;co,uld be repeated to Washington and to Moscow with a shortaccount&apos; of the military position.The War Cabinet took&apos;note of this statement.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that a question had been put down by Mr.  Granvillefor answer, in the House of Commons,, asking whether there had been consultation with the Dominion . *Governments over Greece.     We had, in fact, kept theDominions informed day by day and so far there hadbeen no.reaction from them.THE PRIME MINISTER1 suggested that the answer should be to the effect that it was not physicallypossible to obtain the formal assent of all theDominions to every step that had to be taken in the rapid development of the situation, but that constantinformation was given to them day by day and thatthey were consulted where circumstances made thatpossible and desirable.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Marshal Badoglio&apos;s At their meeting on 11th December the WarPlace of Refuge     Cabinet had agreed that, subject to discussion withthe Colonial Secretary, arrangements should be madeto send Marshal Badoglio to Cyprus in the interestsof his safety.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES now suggested that, given the substantial.Greek population in Cyprus, it would be. better if possible to findan alternative place of refuge for the Marshal.Kenya was suggested.After discussion of various possible alternatives, the general sense of the War cabinet was that an approach should be made In the first place to the Vatican and to Portugal, and that,  if theseapproaches failed, consideration should be given tosending the Marshal to Bermuda.&apos;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs undertook to telegraph to the United States Government,informing them that we proposed to take action on, these lines.The War Cabinet adjourned at U..us p.m.The War Cabinet met again, at 5.30 p.m.Greece THE PRIME- MINISTER informed the War Cabinetthat,  together with the Foreign Secretary, he had seen the King of Greece,     They had put to him, as strongly as possible, the view reached, by the WarCabinet at their meeting earlier that afternoon.The King had, however, refused absolutely to agreeto appoint the Archbishop as Regent,  and neitherthe Foreign Secretary nor he saw any prospect of moving His Majesty.      The King had informed themthat he continued to receive   messages from Greeceurging him to stand firm^     If he made the ArchbishopRegent he would in effect be handing, over, and wouldft be held by his followers to have deserted the causes of the monarchy, and to have abandoned thera to their$ fate.    . He would not feel it compatible with   his duty,  or his conscience, in these circumstances toadopt this course.      He was still the lawful King ofDominionsConsultationparliamentaryQuestion

Greece,-had not dene anything contrary to the Allied  -cause, and could not divest himself of his responsibility, as he would if he appointed a Regent,On the other hand, he was ready to give whoever was -appointed Prime Minister full power (plein- pouvoir),.and to instruct M. Papandreou to swear in the archbishop as Prime Minister on that basis.      He.was not, however, prepared to go beyond this orbeyond the statement embodied in the paper he had handed to the Prime Minister earlier in the day.In giving &quot;full power&quot; to the new.Prime Ministerand authorising him to &quot;take such measures as he considered necessary for the restoration of order&quot;,he intended to cover either force or conciliation.He would be agreeable to Mr. Leeper tellingM. Papandreou that he (M. Papandreou) had the King&apos;authority to swear in the Archbishop^ or anyone else,in his place without waiting for a telegram from theKing himself.The difference between a Regent, divorced fromparty strife, and the Prime Minister of a.Partycabinet had been emphasised to the King of Greece,but it had not modified his view.Points made in discussion were:- -(a) So far as military measures were concerned,THE FIRST SEA LORD and THE CHIEF OP THE AIR STAFF,on behalf of the Chiefs of Staff, said, in reply toa question by the Prime Minister,  that they agreedthat Field Marshal&apos; Alexander must be authorised totake the military.measures which he regarded as. necessary;    and they concurred in the measures proposed.(b) On the political side,  it seemed thatthe real question at issue was whether an arrangement,on the lines of the suggestion put forward by theKing, would be regarded as adequate by our representatives in Greece.-(c) Discussion ensued as to what sort ofGovernment the Archbishop would probably form, and how it was.likely to be received. &quot;   The War cabinet were informed that the Archbishop, who had opposed the Axis staunchly, had been ejected from his Seeby General Metaxas and was thought to be hostile todictatorship.      There was nothing to suggest thathe had any strong political leanings.      While itwas clearly desirable that any government should be.  as broad-based as possible, it was important to avoidpressure that could be represented as foreignIntervention, since we were concerned solely for thev restoration of peace and order.      There would,however, be no objection to Mr.&apos; Deeper being told togive the Axschbishop any assistance he.&quot;could in theformation of a government.(d)  It was also argued that the establishmentof a new Government under the Archbishop might beregarded as., getting rid of the last vestige of populargovernment, and thus expose us to criticism.      It wassuggested,  on the other hand, that the appointment ofa Regent nominated by the King, with power to

constitute a governments might be -open to still greater misinterpretations especially as it wouldinvolve the replacement of M. Papandreou who hadbeen the head of a broad-based six-party government,appointed in the normal constitutional manner by theKing.(e) Some play might be made in publicity withthe fact that the Archbishop was believed to be .better placed, given his past record and his positionof detachment&apos;from all parties, for bringing them together. -Summing up the discussion,  the PRIME ministers aid that he thought a telegram should be sent to athens on the following lines:-(i) Field Marshal Alexander should be told that the War Cabinet would support him in the military measures which he considered necessary.(ii) On the political side the King of Greecehad rejected, notwithstanding strong pressure,  the proposal.that the archbishop .should be made Regent, his reasons being explained.(iii) There remained the alternative ofmaking the Archbishop Prime Ministerforthwith, in which case the King was   (ready that he should be sworn in atonce by M. Papandreou, and should havealso the necessary power to deal withthe- situation.(iv) If our representatives at Athens were satisfied with course (iii) theywere authorised to arrange matters onthese lines forthwith, without further-  &apos;      reference to London.The War Cabinet -Agreed that instructions should be sentto Athens on the above lines forthwith,and invited the Foreign Secretary toarrange for a telegram in this senseto be drafted. .4Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
