(44) 156TH CONCLUSIONS&quot; Confidential AnnexCIVIL AIR TRANSPORT(previous reference:W.M. (44) 153rdConclusions.Minute 2)(27th November, 1944 - 12.30 p.m.)The War Cabinet had before them a note(W.P.(44) 693) by the Prime Minister on Civil air transport, giving the text of President roosevelt&apos;s-telegram T.2176/4. of the 24th November and of thedraft reply which the Prime Minister proposed tosend.The following were the main&quot;points in discussion:-(a) THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the draft telegram proposed by.the Prime Minister had beenconsidered, by the Special Civil Aviation Committee.Subject to certain amendments they were unanimous in. approving it, save to the extent that itconceded Freedom II - to land, fuel and repair.Oh that issue there was a division in the Committee.He was satisfied that our attitude in the past hadbeen consistently favourable to the grant of.Freedom II.     In June, 1943 the Minister without portfolio had recommended (W.P. (43) 251) that theUnited Kingdom should support it at a commonwealth conference;    the Prime Minister had agreed withthis (W.P.(43) 257).     Again Mr, Howe had taken the- same attitude when negotiating in March, 1944with Mr. Berle at Ottawa,     Mr, Howe had thendeclared that freedoms I and II were basic rights which would be automatic and not contingent onlicensing by the international body&quot;.The Minister of Aircraft Production, whowas&apos; unable to be present, had asked him (the Lord   .Pri^y Seal) to say that, while he would prefer thatthe passage which would concede Freedom II should be withheld from the telegram until we had negotiateda&quot;broader agreement, he would concede the secondFreedom if we failed to reach such an agreement,(b) The point of view against the concession of the first two freedoms was then, stated byTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR (who said that hewas otherwise in complete agreement with the PrimeMinister&apos;s draft telegram).     This concession would give -  the United States, without anybilateral agreement over the regulation of competition, the right to land, refuel and re-service, though not take up passengers, in ,iheUnited Kingdom or at other air ports throughoutthe Empire.      The Cabinet&apos;s view had been consistently opposed to the concession of FreedomsI and II save in return for a general agreement.

Recently Lord Swihton had been authorised to concedeFreedom I only if the course of the negotiations requiredit.     From Lord Swinton&apos;s latest report it was clear that canada was strongly opposed to conceding Freedoms I and IIsave as part of a full settlement.(c) In a number of bases refuelling facilities were all that the Americans wanted.      If we granted the secondFreedom as following inevitably from the first, there wasforce in the argument that pressure from our travellingpublic for the consequential grant unconditionally of &quot;Freedoms III, IV and V would follow.     Canada, India and       *Newfoundland were opposed to the grant of the first twoFreedoms;    South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, which    ;were less directly affected, would be willing to supportopposition.     We could not be accused of an illiberalattitude since we were ready to join in proclaiming allfive Freedoms provided that arrangements were first reached ;:for proper regulation of traffic.     Finally, Lord Swintonhad not as yet asked for authority to concede these Freedomsand the necessity for him to concede tham, apart from a Igeneral settlement, might never arise.     Surely it was better not to deprive him at the present stage of thisvaluable card...which he might turn to great advantage in negotiation.                                                                                   t(d) The main argument in favour of the concession of the first two Freedoms was that this was a matter which :must be decided on wider and broader considerations ofgeneral policy, rather than by reference to the immediateadvantages which it was thought -might be obtained in thenegotiations now in progress.       A refusal to concedethese two Freedoms would hardly be consonant with the gener 0Jpolicy of this country,  which had resulted in our enjoyingthe support of other countries at critical periods in ourhistory.(e) Moreover,  if we were now to refuse to concede the first two Freedoms, we should be exposed to the chargeof adopting a dog in the manger attitude, and this would be   Iturned to our great disadvantage by American publicity.Was it not in fact clear that, if we refused to grantFreedoms I and II we should find ourselves in an&apos;impossible \position, and that the wise course was to concede thesetwo Freedoms at once, before pressure was brought to bear upon us publicly, and thereafter to take a stand on the vital ground of Freedoms III, IV and V.(f) It was also evident that while, as the PrimeMinister&apos;s reply to the President of 22nd November hadalready made clear, we were not prepared to be dictatedto in matters of this kind, if we were to adopt a rigidand indefensible attitude as regards the concession ofthe first two Freedoms, this would clearly have reactionson other issues of importance now under.discussion with the:United States Government.(g) Discussion then turned on the position of theDominions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS feltthat the issue involved was nicely balanced;    but that since Canada wished to stand firm against the concession of the first two Freedoms, there was a case on grounds of empire unity for supporting her attitude.

On the other hand, it was pointed out that, whileCanada was anxious for our support in a refusal to concede the first two Freedoms, this was only in order that she would herself be able to use these two Freedoms forbargaining purposes with the U,S. later on.     It was certain that Canada Y/ould in due course concede the first two Freedoms&quot; and His Majesty&apos;s Government would then beleft in an unenviable position.(h) It was pointed out that judging by his latesttelegram, Lord Swinton was impressed by the Dominion support for opposing the grant of Freedoms I and II, and would beplaced at a disadvantage in negotiation by a decision inthe opposite sense.      It was felt however that this dangercould be averted by a full explanation to Lord Swinton ofthe considerations that weighed with the War Cabinet infavour of conceding Freedoms I and II, and by sendinghim in advance the terms of the communication to the president   The Dominions should also be informed :confidentially in advance.After further discussion,  the War Cabinet -(1) Agreed that Lord Swinton should be instructedto concede Freedoms I and II.(2) Approved the draft telegram from the PrimeMinister to the President, subject to certaindrafting alterations, of which a Schedulele appended, proposed by the Special CivilAviation Committee and in the course of thediscussion.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to inform the Dominion Prime Ministersconfidentially of the reasons which had led the War Cabinet to the decision in (1), and authorised him to send them for their secret .and personal information an advance copy ofthe reply to the President, and of his telegram.(4) Invited the Prime Minister to telegraphpersonally to Lord Swinton explaining the- considerations which had weighed with theWar Cabinet, and to arrange that he shouldhave advance information of the terms ofthe reply to be sent to the President.
