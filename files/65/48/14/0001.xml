(Uh)l03rdConclusions,Minute *i )The War Cabinet were informed that arrange-ments had been made for a debate to take placeon the following day on the following Amendment tothe Address.&quot;But humbly regret that the Gracious Speechcontains no assurance that His Majesty&apos;^ forces will not be used to disarm the friends-of democracy in Greece and other parts of Europe,or to suppress those popular movements whichhave valorously assisted in the defeat of theenemy and upon&apos;whose success we must rely for future friendly co-operation in Europe.&quot;The War Cabinet had a discussion as to thepoints likely to arise in the debate and the line tobe taken by the Prime Minister.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF. THE COUNCIL said thatin the course of the debate on the following day anumber of questions were likely to be asked, in orderto elucidate exactly what the position was.   Thus -(.1) What had been the terms of the agreement made as to disarmament of the irregularforces;(2) Were the Greek Police the same force as had existed during the German-occupation, or was it some new body;(3) Was the Mountain Brigade a partisanbody, or could it be relied on to actimpartially;(4) Which side first had recourse to violencein Athens.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that as regards(l)**the arrangements for disarmament, there was nofoundation for the suggestion that E.L.A.S. would bedisarmed but not E.D.E.S.    It had been intended that both bodies should be disarmed pari passu.As to (2), the Police were believed to have maintained a firm attitude during the german occupation, and not to have given help to the Germans.As to (3), the Mountain Brigade was the force which had mutinied in the Middle East;   but themutineers had been removed from the Brigade, whichhad since distinguished itself in fighting in Italy.

- THE. HOME&quot; SECRETARY AND THE MINISTER OP home security said the allegation was -being put about      -(he did not know whether there was any justification for it) that Zervas&apos; men were being merged into theregular army while E.L.A.S. bands were being broken up.    It was feared in some quarters that the Greek ...regular army might be being organised on a basis whichwould give it a tendency to favour the right.H.M. Government would no doubt make it clear that theirpolicy was to disarm all. the private armies, -and to p through with the present measures until law andorder had been restored in Athens.THE PRIME.MINISTER then rehearsed the sequence ofevents in Greece.    He read to the War Cabinet a tele-gram he had sent to the President from&apos;Italy on the16th August (CHAIN 57) to the effect that we were concerned with what would happen in Athens, and indeed in Greece, when the Germans evacuated the country.    Ifthere was a long hiatus after the Germans left Athens&quot;before an organised government could be set up, it seemed, very likely that the E.A.M. and the Communist &quot;extremists would attempt to seize the city and crush allother forms of Greek expression but their own.    he therefore thought that, while the Greek people must havethe fullest opportunity of deciding between a monarchyand a republic as soon as tranauility had been restored,an arrangement should be made through 1he AlliedStaff .in the Mediterranean for a British force to&quot;be made ready to be sent into the capital when thetime was ripe.The President had replied on the 26th Augustagreeing to this course, and to the use of Americantransport aircraft for this purpose by General Wilson(CLASP 235).At the Quebec Conference the^Combined Chiefsof Staff on 15th September, 19kk,-had taken note that a small British force was &quot;being held ready to occupy Athens area and so pave the way forcommencement of relief and establishment of lawand order and a. Greek Government. . This report(CCS.680/2 Octagon) had been iritialled by himself and the President.Following on this a telegram had been dispatched to General Wilson (Z0.208) from the combined Chiefs of Staff giving the necessarydirections.    It was clear therefore that theUnited States Government had given their fullestauthority to the plan of action proposed.

belgium.PranceItalyProceeding with the sequence of events in Greece,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY reminded the War Cabinet that we hadbeen at particular pains to bring representatives of all parties, including the communists, out of. Greece in-orderto form an all-^party government.     When he had been in     ;Athens the Communist Leaders had asked to see him in orderto thank him for the help we had given the Greeks, and tosay that they intended to co-operate with the PapandreouGovernment.Coming to the recent disorders,the PRIMS MINISTER    -said that on the hth/5th December he had, after consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, despatched the following telegrams(1). to General Wilson, to say that it was his responsibility to make sure that General Scobiehad all possible forces in his hands.&quot;*     (2) To General Scobie, to say that he was responsible   &quot;for maintaining order in Athens and forneutralising or destroying all E.A.M.  - E.L.A.S.bands approaching the city, and would be supportedin&apos;all reasonable and sensible action which he took.(3) To Mr. Leeper to say that while the presentsituation lasted there could be no., changes inthe Greek Government.Discussion then turned on the position in Belgium.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleagues that,some little time back a critical situation had arisen and armed bands of resistance groups from Liege and Mons had started to move on the capital.     General Eisenhower had himself given orders that action was to be. taken toprevent these bands reaching the capital.      They had been stopped and the bands disarmed.       At &apos;the time of thiscrisis, General Eisenh^&amp;ir had himself visited Brussels.The Prime Minister added that there had been a mount in the liberation of France when the situation inParis had looked difficult and General Eisenhower had arranged for two United States divisions to march throughthe streets of Paris.The War Cabinet next considered the situationin Italy.(previous reference;, THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the recent StateW.M.(44)126th Department announcement criticising our attitude in theConclusions     case of Count Sforza.     He had protested strongly to the minute 7)        President (Tel. No. T.2263/4) and had added that theposition of His Majesty1s Government would have to be made clear in Parliament, and had asked the President1s authorityQ to read out Count 8forza&apos;s letters of 23rd September, 1943to Mr. Berle.      The President in reply had agreed and had pointed out that the message it contained had already been published by Marshal Badoglio ^at the time of its receipt.

THE PRIME MINISTER read/to the War CabinetCount Sforza&apos;s letter (see W.P.(kh 712), and explainedthat the Count had subsequently confirmed those. pledges to him personally in the presence of twoW ts\ 1*^^ l^fte*i94wwMB. On the strength of those pledges we had0\ withdrawn our objection to his return to Italy.    HeW- had however failed to honour them.   He had beenmaterially responsible for Marshal Badoglio&apos;s replace-ment by the Government Of Six Parties, had thereafterintrigued against Sighor Bonomi.   As,head of the Purge: -   Commission he was now, in the unsettled interval before a stable Government could be formed, doing his* ^ / best to bring about the arrest of the Marshal, who hadtaken refuge in the British Embassy.    GivenMarshal Badoglio&apos;s distinguished recorg. of service tothe Allies, the responsibility which he had taken forthe surrender of the Italian fleet, the armistice hehad signed with General Eisenhower, and his continuedinfluence with the Italian armed forces, there couldbe no question of abandoning him to his enemies.It was clear that we had thus every justification for   our attitude towards Count Sforza, and he proposedto make that, and our.general objectives in Italy,clear in his speech.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat an apology had now been received in reply to thevery strong;remonstrances which he had addressed toMr. Stettinius. in respect of the State Departmentsannouncement.The Foreign Secretary then read to the War&apos; Cabinet the nwft of a telegram to. the United StatesGovernment which he proposed, subject   to the Cabinet&apos;s approval,to despatch, informing the U. S. Government oi the positionof Marsnal Badoglio, and of the latest threat to hisliberty and perhaps safety, pointing oat the veryserious effect on our good name and our position in italy of any failure to protect him, and asking fortheir concurrence in the issue of instructions by the combined Chiefs of Staff to the Supreme allied commander, Mediterranean, that, for military reasons,Marshal Badoglio was not to be arrested or in any wayinterfered with.The War Cabinet -Approved the draft telegram toLord Halifax proposed by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.The War Cabinet then discussed the broad line tobe taken in the debate.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, the motion being an amendment to the Address, was in fact a vote of censure.   The specific points likely to be raised on ourconduct in various countries could be dealt withwithout difficulty.    But he was clear that the debate would turn not on the answers to such points, but onthe fundamental principles governing the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.   We were faced, owing to theannouncement by the State Department, with thesuggestion that the policy of His Majesty1s Governmentin Greece and other liberated countries was at themoment anti-democratic.    For that suggestion thereGeneralPosition ofHis Majesty&apos;sGovernment.

was no shadow of foundation.&apos;    He proposed in &quot;these circumstances to make an&apos;over-whelming case for democracy, and to bring out that the objectof Hie majesty&apos;s Government and of this country was toensure that in these liberated countries the ordinary humbleman should be at liberty to express himself in freedomthrough the ballot box, and that in exercising his franchisehe should not be subject to intimidation or spying.      Itwas to bring that about that we had had to take unpopular &apos;action in countries such as Greece and Belgium.     Pair play,a fair trial,, the untrammelled vote of the people, the will of the people freely expressed without fear or favour,no leaning to one or other political party was, and wouldbe, our policy.     He would make it clear that in going intothose countries, we had been concerned solely to liberate     -them from the enemy, thereafter to re-establish law andorder and to hold the fort until the recognised constitutional government of the country could hold free elections.     Theresult of which we would be bound and were ready to accept.&quot;We had no selfish aims, and objectives in any of thecountries which we had liberated save those which he had mentioned.     He would indeed be very ready to express thehope that where we were responsible, those free electionswould be supervised by representatives of the three great powers so as to ensure their complete freedom from anyBias on our part for a particular political yiew op party.Complete agreement was expressed with this line.It was aJLso pointed out that there would be great.,advantage if the Prime^Minister could in his speechbring out that His Majesty&apos;s Government held no brief for anything but the will of the people of the liberated countries.      There was a feeling in certain quarters thatwe had a preference for the restoration of dynasties,independently or against the will of the people of thecountry and it would be well to.dissipate this.Arrangement A discussion ensued, as to the timing of the Primefor the Minister*s Speech on the following day&apos;.EebateThe alternatives were -(a) that the Prime Minister should postpone his speechuntil towards the end of the Debate when he would make theonly speech on behalf of the Government.(b) that the Prime Minister should intervene much earlier, perhaps after the Mover and Seconder of the motion had spoken.     The Foreign Secretary might then ..conclude the Debate on behalf of the.Government and deal in the course of his speech with any points raised afterthe Prime Minister had spoken.The general view of the War Cabinet favoured (b).It was pointed out that speakers in the Debate might feelthat they had been placed at a disadvantage if the factswere not made available until the Prime Minister&apos;s speech at the end of the Debate.     Moreover an early speech would ensure that our case got immediate and effective publicity in the United States and throughout-the world.     Finally,. .  were.the Prime Minister to intervene early in the Debate theresult might be wholly to undermine the case of the criticsand to kill the Debate.THE PRIME MINISTER undertook to speak after the mover and Seconder had spoken, leaving the Foreign Secretaryto wind up the Debate.Offices of the War Cabinet, 8.W. 1.
