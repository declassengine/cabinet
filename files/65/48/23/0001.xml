THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.&quot;It is issued for the personal use of.......................TOP SECRET ., Copy No.W.M.(UU) 176TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(30th December, 1944 - 12 noon)FOREIGN AFFAIRSGreece(previous reference:W.M. (44) 175thConclusions)The Prime Minister and Foreign secretary reported to the War Cabinet the results of their discussion with, the King of Greece, which had started at 10 p.m. on Friday evening and endedat 4*30 a*m* Saturday morning.   In the result, theKing had agreed to Issue a declaration appointingthe Archbishop to be Regent during the period of .emergency.     A copy of the English text of thedeclaration (Telegram No, 606 to Athens) hadalready been circulated to Ministers.The War Cabinet was informed that arrange-ments were being made for the Greek text of thedeclaration to be telegraphed to.Athens and announced on the authority of the King that afternoon.      It was hoped that, it would be announced on the B.B.C. that evening on the 9 p.m.news.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the King of greece had been very anxious to be informed as toArchbishop Damasklnos&apos;s views and intentions.It had been made clear to him that we- could not,without reference to the Archbishop, give under-takings as to the policy which he would follow.A private and confidential note had, however, beengiven to the King of Greece (on the understandingto which the King had agreed, that it should notbe published) reporting the views which the archbishop had expressed to the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary during their visit to athens.     The main, points in this private and confidential note were -(i) The Archbishop was prepared to undertake;   the Regency.(ii) He would attempt to form as broadlybased a Government as was possible inthe circumstances, but not includingthe Communists&apos;.(iii) The Archbishop was prepared to hold office as Regent for the period of thepresent emergency.(iv) He would treat the Crown with allconsideration and respect, and would- guide the nation in this period ofemergency with a view to the restor-ation of order so that the views of thepeople could be freely expressed in conditions of normal tranquillity.(v) Acceptance by E.L.A. S. of General Scobie&apos;terms for the cessation of hostilitieswas indispensable.

bill the War Cabinet took note with great satisfaction of the results of the discussions with&apos;the King of Greece.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinetthe text of a telegram from Field Marshal Smuts .about the Greek position..Ro^creroc&quot;was made to Telegram No. 5h fromMr. Rapp, Consul-General at Salonika, asking for information as to the policy to be pursued in macedonia and Thrace following the Prime Minister&apos;visit.     The Prime Minister&apos;s insistence onclearing Athens without specific reference to therest of Greece had led the anti-communist elements in Salonika to fear that E.L.A.S. domination salonika might be acquiesced in.      Mr. Rappsuggested that; it would probably be best to aimas far as possible at peaceful dispersion ratherthan any formal act    of disbandment of E.L.A.S.,or a combination of. the two, since many E.L.A.S.officers and men were anxious to quit theorganisation;     He therefore suggested thatpreliminary plans should be worked out aiming at disintegrating E.L.A. S. by encouragingdesertion on favourable terms.The War Cabinet agreed that the foreign secretary should inform Mr. Rapp that heshould proceed on the lines proposed.Reference was also made to the need for supplying equipment to the Greek battalions nowbeing raised.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this matter was of importance, and asked that General Ismayshould report to him in the course of the dayhow it stood.The Prime Minister also read to the WarCabinet the text of a draft telegram to president roosevelt reporting the latest developments inthe Greek situation.

The War Cabinet had before them copies of president roosevelt&apos;s telegram No. 681 of29th December containing Premier Stalin&apos;s reply,dated 27th December, to the message of 20th Decemberwhich the President had sent him about the recognition of the Lublin Committee.Premier Stalin&apos;s reply developed the case forthe recognition.of the Polish Committee of national liberation and suggested that, if the Committee wouldtransform itself into a Provisional PolishGovernment, then, given the manner in whioh thesituation had developed, the Soviet Governmentwould not have any serious ground for postponement of the question of its recognition.     He proceeded to express the view that it would be natural, just and profitable for our &quot;common cause if theGovernments of the Allied countries as the first step have agreed on an immediate exchange ofrepresentatives with the Polish National Committeeso that after a certain time it would be recognised as the lawful Government of Poland after the transformation of the National Committee into a provisional Government of Poland.     Otherwise Iam afraid that the confidence of the Polish people in the Allied powers may weaken.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that Premier Stalin18reply was far from helpful.     The possibility couldnotj of course * be excluded that indiscreet messagespassing between the Polish Government in London andthe Underground Movement in Warsow had been inter-cepted by the Russians^ or again that individuals in the Polish Underground Army might have been responsible for incidents which it would be difficultto defend.     He regretted all the more that thePolish Government should not have taken advantage ofthe Moscow discussions which at one time gave good reason to hope that M. Mikolajczyk might be appointed as the Head of the Polish Government.He felt, however,  that* subject to the viewof the War Cabinet, we ought to continue to pressPremier Stalin not to recognise the Lublin Governmentand tell him plainly that we should not do so, andthat in our view the matter should be reserved forthe coming Conference between Premier Stalin, thePresident and himself.THE PRIME MINISTER read the draft of a replyto President Roosevelt in this sense.The War Cabinet -Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement and approved theterms of the draft reply to president roosevelt.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, given theattitude of the Russians as disclosed by Premier0 Stalin&apos;s reply to President Roosevelt, he felt thatwe should reconsider the existing arrangements underwhich Poles in the Polish forces in our armies in italy were allowed to conduct flights which, inpresent circumstances, passed over Russian occupiedPoland.(previous reference:W.M. (WO 171st^Conclusions,Minute 1)

territory, with a view to dropping arms, supplies etc.to the Underground Movement In Poland.     There wasthe risk that they might he shot down and, in.any event, these flights were against the declared policy- of the: ^Russians.     He douhted very much the valueof the flights in terms of supplies dropped thoughW admittedly they had a- value from the point of viewof the morale of Polish forces fighting with theAllies. &apos;   *These Polish forces had done valiant service.If events so turned out that it would toe impossiblefor substantial elements in those Polish forces toreturn tqlheir country, or that they would be reluctant to do so, then consideration ought to toegiven to the question whether they could toe settled in the-British Empire, or possibly in the UnitedStates. &apos; &apos;-   The War Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.-W. 1.
