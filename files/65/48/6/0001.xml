(hk)lh6th[Conclusions,pinute 5)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave theWar Cabinet an account of the reception he and the PrimeMinister had had on their recent visit to Paris and of thequestions that had come under discussion with the french governments ^2. Arrangements had been admirable and secrecy had been well maintained and the crowds well handled by the police.Impressions were difficult to formulate.     But he had been left with the feeling of a people who had been in a prisoncamp, and who were still slightly dazed on recovering their freedom.     They still knew very little of what had beenhappening In the world outside France, and had repeatedlyimpressed upon him the extent to which the Prime Ministersspeeches and the E.B.C. had kept up their courage and keptthem going.     France had been through a great deal.     that had given, in his judgment, a new depth to her desire towork with us - the demonstrations In Paris had been neitherhysterical nor organised.3. There were two big problems before the French.     Thefirst - the rearmament of their Forces.     They were v;;---anxious to get some equipment for the F.F,I. not only tc-enable them to fight Germany, but because they felt that unless they could engage their troops against Germany beforethe y/ar was over it would be more difficult for them tocarry out the occupation.   The Prime Minister had given careful consideration to this and had felt that we oughtto make a grert effort to give any help we could.     TheFrench had eight divisions in line and were anxious to equipa further eight if possible.     While it might be beyond our capacity fully to equip eight further divisions any assist-ance we Could give would be most welcome.HiThe second problem was coal.      The shortage was acute,whether for cooking^ heating, or for hospitals, and he feltwe ought to consider whether we could do anything to help.,The difficulty over the transport of pit props was a greathandicap.     It was for consideration whether we&apos;could notmanage to despatch even a small consignment of coal for the paris hospitals.     The psychological effect would be great,and he suggested that the War Cabinet might consider It.worth investigating.5. As regards personalities the general impression lefton him had been that the French Government was a younggovernment, and that they were dealing capably with a new state of things.      Some of the figures of the old regimehad reappeared on the occasion of the visit, but this wasonly an act of courtesy towards them.-1-

6.        Monsieur BidaU.lt&quot;&quot;had impressed him as a tougher edition ofM.   Reynaud.     He felt Mr. Bidault, who had been.the head of the resistance movement^ knew what he wanted and would be a great asset.So far as internal conditions went M. Bidault had not been seriously alarmed about the communist menace.     General de Gaulle&apos;sown position was very strong and the general feeling seemed to be that^   he was    a   man to whom Prance could&apos;rally*7.        Political conversations had taken place between the PrimeMinister, General de Gaulle and himself.     They had covered a wide field - the admission of Prance to the European Advisory Council(the announcement regarding which could not have been more.happilytimed);    the future of Germany, the Russo-Polish question (the Frenchposition proved to be very similar to ours - they felt that the Polesshould accept the Curzon line, but that we on our side should do everything possible to insure an independant Poland.     France was anxious to sign a treaty with Russia in due course, and to establishgood relations with her.     The French felt&apos; that, unless a satisfactory and equitahle settlement could be reached.with Poland, such a treaty with Russia would lack national backing and might prove a cause ofinternal dissension.) *8.        The conversations had also touched upon the position in Spain.&apos;It was clear that the French Government were worried about theSpanish position, and realised the problem presented by the largenumbers of Spanish exiles in the South of France.     They were anxiousto avoid a fight with Spain little as they might like Franco.9.        The Russian Ambassador in Paris, whom he had seen the nightbefore, thought the French situation was steadying and improving.That was also his own (the Foreign Secretary&apos;s) feeling.10. The military talks had all centred round armaments. Generalffsmay added in this connection that the French were very anxious for arms for the police who had been stripped of theirs by the Germans.11.       As regards Germany the conversations had shown the French were anxious, in particular, about the Ruhr and the Rhineland.     Theyadvanced no territorial claims except for the return of AlsaceLorraine, and expressed the hope that the Dutch would not ask for too much.     They attached great importance to the international controlof the Ruhr and the Rhinelandi so that German heavy industry wouldnot be available for German rearmament.12.       There had been a great deal of discussion on Syria.     On this the French attitude had been more difficult.     They had, however, .confirmed that they had no intention of going back on theirdeclaration about Syrian independence, but had emphasised that they wished to liquidate their position with dignity, and wished for some arrangement as regards a treaty, in respect of which they were anxious for our help.     He had replied that we had given them all possible assistance and had taken them over the ground that had been covered in the discussions;   but he felt that they were not wholly satisfied with the line we had taken.     He had found them, in general, ratherobstinate about any further concessions to the Syrians until a treaty was in sight, and he thought that the French under-estimated the strong feeling against them and the difficulty of getting a treaty.There were signs, however, that they would straight away be preparedto arrange for some small transfer of the Troupes Speciales.13.       The Foreign Secretary, in conclusion said that he had foundGeneral de Gaulle most reasonable during the visit. , He repeated thatgl he had formed the strong impression that our relations with France were&quot;    now based on deeper foundations than in the past.     The French wer-every anxious to see more of our forces than had so far been able to visit Paris from the fighting line.The War Cabinet took note with satisfaction of the foreign secretary&apos;s statement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
