MINUTE confidential Annex(11th December, 19kh - 6.0 p.m.)FOREIGN AFFAIRSGreece(previous reference:W.M. (kk)tS5r&amp;conclusions minute 3)THE PRIME MINISTER drew the attention ofthe War Cabinet to the telegrams exchanged with president Roosevelt which had been circulated tothe War Cabinet, and in particular to the message of congratulation contained in the Presidentstelegram No. 672 on the vote which the Go-wernmenthad secured in the House of Commons on the Debate onthe Greek situation.     The exchange of telegramscirculated made it clear that the United states had no cause for complaint.As regards developments in Athens, Britishcasualties were perhaps of the order Of 30 or UOkilled and perhaps 100 wounded.     We had on theother hand 1800 prisoners.     Reinforcements were on their way, while Field-Marshal Alexander and&apos;Mr. Macmillan, acting as his political adviser,ought by now to have reached Athens.     He.assumed that Field-Marshal Alexander would announce his arrival, and we might expect toreceive his advice as to what supplementary steps were necessary from the military point of view.The great thing was to establish order in and around the capital.     Thereafter it might be hopedthat negotiations would be set on foot which wouldresult on a purely Greek government assumingresponsibility.     when that had been achieved our task would, in his view, be done, and it wasto be hoped that we might be able to leave Greece toherself.THE PRIME MINISTER added that he thoughtit of great importance that we should, at theappropriate moment and in the appropriate way, putour case before the world.     Gross misrepresentationsof our. attitude were being circulated, and no attention given either to the fact that we had gone into Greece at the invitation of. a Greek Governmentcomposed of all parties, or to the pains at whichwe had been to get such a government together.Italy(previous reference:W.M.(UJU)l62nd-Conclusions)iThe War Cabinet discussed the arrangements to be made in the case of Marshal Badoglio.     Thelatest reports suggested that while the efforts ofCount Sforza to secure his arrest and possibly hisexecution by means of the Purge machinery had been unsuccessful, and while Senor Bonomi had given instructions that he was not to be arrested, therewas still reason to think.that his life might be in danger if he remained in Italy or out ^f our protectionWhile Malta had been under consideration as a placeof refuge, anti-Italian feeling there could not be overlooked.

7hTHE PRIME.MINISTER suggested that subject to consultation with the Colonial Secretary, arrangements should he made to send Marshal Badoglio to Cyprus,     Weshould make prior reference to the United States Government,and might also inform the Soviet Government of what was proposed.The War Cabinet - /(1) Agreed and invited the Secretary of StateForeign Affairs to proceed accordingly.forYugoslavia(previous reference:W.M. (kk) 79thConclusions,Minute k)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs informed ,the War Cabinet that while apologies had beenreceived from Marshal Tito in respect of a series ofrecent incidents in which his followers had behaved in a hostile or unmannerly fashion, to&apos; British Forces orrepresentatives, further incidents had now been reported on the Yugoslav Coast.     No action was called for here and Brigadier Mclean would take the matter up direct with marshal Tito.The War Cabinet -(2) Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.Macedonia The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum(W.P. (ii4) 707) by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs circulating a memorandum on the Macedonian problem,and the: idea of a union between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.The memorandum suggested that we should inform theSoviet Government of our views and make it clear that v/hilewe would welcome&apos; a Federation between all the Balkan States,allied and enemy alike and including perhaps Turkey, wecould not regard an exclusive Yugoslav-Bulgarian union as -in any way an alternativet   and that while we wereprepared to acquiesce in  he creation of a Macedonian state in the future Federal Yugoslavia, we must insist that this state should not &quot;annex nor lay claim on any territoriesbelonging to either Bulgaria or Greece, on the ground thatthese territories were &quot;Macedonian&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he thought there would be advantage in our talkingto the Russians in London on the lines proposed inparagraph 11 of the papers circulated under W.P.(hh) 707.&apos; Admittedly it might be rather optimistic to hope that weshould in fact he able to veto a Yugoslav/Bulgariancombination.     That was the more reason why we should,,without delay, talk the matter over with the Russians and make it.clear to them that if the object of the manoeuvreswhich appeared/now to be taking place was to enable Bulgariato. acquire Greek territory, and possibly, at the expenseof Greece, an outlet on the Aegean, we should be strongly opposed to this. /THE PRIME MINISTER urged the importance of ouravoiding a clash with the Russians over this matter.     there could be little question under present circumstances thatCommunist influence, under Russian patronage was   in due course, even without specific action by Russia, likely toestablish itself throughout the Balkan peninsula, savepossibly in Greece.     He thought in any event that therewould be advantage in awaiting the restoration of stability

in Athens before any conversations were initiated.The suggestion was also made that there would&quot;be advantage in leaving this matter to be discussed in moscow by Sir A. Clark-Kerr on his&quot; &quot;return instead ofbroaching it with M. Gusev in London.   t   ,After further discussion the War Cabinet -(3) Approved generally the line&apos;of approach&quot;    suggested in paragraph 11 of the paperattached td. W.P..(W 707;(h) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign- Affairs to discuss the matter with Sir A.Clark-Kerr with a view to the latter takingit up at an appropriate moment after his return to Moscow.Offices of. the War Cabinet, S.W.I.

(11th December, 19U4- 6.00 p.m.)MOTOR THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said &quot;that the taxation      Motor Manufacturers wanted some indication of the future policy in regard to motor taxation.     Subject to thefpproval of.the War Cabinet, he intended fa state inSrlfamenx that he would propose tftat^xHe  oasisoula-off the ,iiorse-power tax should :fce   changedrroift-the present basis, namely, the section of thecylinder, to the,cubic capacity of the cylinder.     he proposed to leave over for later consideration the further questions as to whether the steps in graduation of the horse-power tax should be more widely spaced.Discussion showed that all Ministers favoured the change, to taxation on the cubic capacity, and therewas some support for the pruposal that the steps ingraduation of the tax should be more widely spaced.- It was also suggested that it would be desirableto abolish taxation based on horse-power, and to make up the deficiency by Increasing the petrol tax.     This would afford the most effective way of encouraging Motor manufacturers to make more powerful engines, thus enabling them to competeto good purpose in the export market,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER, said -that thisraised very serious issues.     Any switch from vehicle tax t-*fuel tax would alter the incidence against the highmileage utility car. .-,rid in favour of the luxury carintermittently, used.     Moreover, the taxation, on motor spirit was already very high, and if the tax was raisedstili further the temptation to evasion in variotis formswould be great  ..tly increased.     He did not feel able to goany further at the moment than to make a statement inParliament on the lines which he had proposed.. The War Cabinet -Agreed that the Chancellor shouldmake his proposed statement-.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
