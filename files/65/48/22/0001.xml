(Uh) 17UthConclusions,Minute 3)THE PRIME MINISTER,, who was welcomedback on his return by the War Cabinet, said that hiscolleagues would be aware from the full telegrams which he and the Foreign Secretary had sentof the developments in the situation in Athensand of the discussions that had taken place withArchbishop Damaskinos and others.     He wasperfectly satisfied that the- advice that we had .received from our representatives in Athens hadbeen entirely correct.     If We had not intervenedthere would have been a massacre.     He was gladalso to feel that no harm had been done by his not having paid his visit sooner.     The satisfactory progress of our military operations (we now heldfive-sixths of the Piraeus and about three-quarters of Athens, which contained rather over one-seventh of the entire population of Greece)had been of material value in easing thesituation.     He had been greatly impressed by theattitude of our own troops as disclosed both byconversations on the spot and by letters (a selection of which he would circulate to the WarCabinet).     All were convinced that we had beenvery badly treated, and felt strongly that thechange in the original friendly and welcomingattitude of the people of Athens was dUe toorganised infiltration of elements of a different character from outside the cityiAs the War Cabinet were aware, he had-telegraphed personally to President Roosevelt(NOSi 859 and 860 of 28th December) informing him of the course of events, and asking him to supportour endeavours to persuade the King of Greece toagree to the appointment of Archbishop Damaskinos asRegent.     He had just received through theAmerican Ambassador the text (which he read to theWar Cabinet) of a letter which the President had sent to the King of Greece in response to this request.     While this letter stated, that theUnited States were not directly involved, and thatthe Greek people must be free to decide the formof their government, etc., it also urged HisMajesty very strongly to give the-most favourable&apos;consideration to the recommendations that thePresident understood had been made to him toappoint the Archbishop Regent;   and added thatreaffirmation of His Majesty&apos;s intentions, and an assurance that elections would be held at somefixed date, no matter how far ahead it lay,, wouldbe of real assistance.     The letter would greatlystrengthen our hands in discussion with the King.

bill the Prime Minister then gave the War cabinet an account of the discussions in Athens and of hisimpressions.He was satisfied that the case for a Regencywas decisive, and that the only man for&apos;the Regency wasthe Archbishop.     The conference of leaders, which included the representatives of E.L.A.S. and E.A.M. had unanimously been of that opinion (though the members ofthe Popular Party thought the Regency should not beestablished until E.L.A.S. had accepted General Scobie&apos;terms for a truce)j    and the fact that E.L.A.S. andE.A.M. had agreed would make it difficult for them to-make trouble if and vrtien the Archbishop was appointedRegent by the King.     M. Papandreou, after changing his mind three times, had telegraphed the King advising theappointment of a Regent and the selection of the archbishop.The Archbishop had made a most favourableimpression.     He was shrewd, able and forthcoming.     ThePrime Minister felt little doubt that when he securedpower he would be ready to use it, and the present stateof anarchy in Athens showed how much a strong hand was needed.     He was definitely anti-Communist, though thatwas shown by his attitude rather than by any declarationsmade by him.The Archbishop&apos; considered that what was now required was an executive body T/hich could get an armytogether and could act as&apos; a government of the country.He had in view a small Cabinet of the best men, toinclude responsible Left Wing leaders other than the communists, whom he was utterly opposed to including.The position might soften up in a few weeks, when itwould be possible to broaden and to extend his govern-ment, perhaps to form one of a more normal character.The Prime Minister had not tiiought it right to press the archbishop as to the detail of the composition of hisgovernment.      It was, however, clear that he had inview General Plastiras (who had impressed the PrimeMinister as a grim, thin man of the utmost determination)as his Prime Minister, and that M. Papandreou (thougharrangements would be made for his personal security,etc.) was not likely to be a member of it.On the conclusion of the discussions in thesecond conference the Archbishop had reported on thegeneral position to.the Prime Minister.     The PrimeMinister had informed him in the light of his reportthat the utmost pressure would be put on the King of greece to appoint him (the Archbishop) as Regent., whichhe felt sure would be the general wish in this country.Meanwhile the Archbishop should begin to consider v/hatgovernmental arrangements he would make.     He (thePrime Minister) had now come to the conclusionthat the Regency should last for a year, or until a plebiscite could be held under conditions of normal tranquility.     The Archbishop, who said that hewould use the King and the monarchy with the utmostconsideration, indicated that he would prefer to leavethe decision to the Prime Minister and that any decision which the Prime Minister might take as to the period ofthe Regency would be acceptable to him.

The Prime Minister added that^ the recommendationwhich he and the Foreign Secretary now made to the WarCabinet was that contact should he established with theKing of Greece this evening.      His Majesty&apos;would be toldof the Prime Minister&apos;s appreciation of the situation andwould be informed that we were satisfied that it wasnecessary for him to appoint Archbishop Damaskinos asRegent without further delay;    that if he was not preparedto do so we would have no option but to advise the archbishop to go forward as if he had in fact beenappointed by the King, would recognise the Archbishopas Regent, and would recognise, of course, the governmentwhich he would appoint;    and that we were aware of the message which His Majesty had received from president roosevelt, and had no doubt in the light of it that theUnited States Government would follow the lead set by us,and that other powers would equally do the same.He trusted that the King would respond to this invitation.     His Majesty had a great opportunity to makea dignified gesture and to confide the Regency to the archbishop on terms that would reflect credit on himself,,and possibly strengthen his position.     It might well bethat in&apos;a year&apos;s time the Archbishop would have real need of. the King&apos;s&apos; support, while the views which the archbishop had expressed about the King and the monarchymight act as a reassurance to His Majesty.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had little to add to the Prime Minister&apos;simpressions.     He was, of course, in entire agreementwith the recommendation which he had made to the WarCabinet.     There had been only two courses open to us.The first, to make an attempt to establish a furthercoalition government.     That was impossible, since the archbishop would not be a party to it, and in any eventin his judgment it would have resulted in a re-opening ofthe struggle within 3 months time.     The second was toproduce the circumstances which would lead to the formation ofthe strongest government that was possible without trying to bring in the Communists.     That was what in fact had now been done.The. following points were made in discussion:-(1)     THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the conclusionof the discussions the two E.L.A.S. delegates to theConference, MM. Siantos and Partsolides, had asked to see him.     He had been much inclined to accede to this request, but the Archbishop, whom he consulted, was strongly against it, as had been the Foreign secretary and our advisers in Athens.      He thought that there might be criticism of his decision but had no doubt as toits wisdom.     He had been at pains to write, a diplomaticletter giving his reasons to these two gentlemen, thoughthe real reason was of course that if the responsibilitywas to be placed on the Archbishop he must be left to playthe hand in such a way as he thought fit.      THE foreign secretary thought it unlikely that the E.L.A.S. delegateswould admit that, they had asked for an interview and been refused.

(2)     It might he that the negotiations that had been opened would continue^ hut it was difficultto judge.     E.L.A.S, and E.A.M. had adopted a very vtuncompromising attitude.      The terms that they haddemanded,would enable them to wreck any government,and it was of&quot;interest that the offices for whichthey had asked were the same as those that had beenasked for in the Polish Government by the Lublin vPoles.(3)     If affairs in-Greece worked out as we hoped they might, the effect might be to stop an enormous amount of anarchy in Europe and to-discourage similar outbreaks in other countries.The War Cabinet -(1) Took note with approval of the actionstaken by the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary during their visit to. Athens.(2) Invited the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary to approach theKing of Greece, on the lines indicated at &quot;X&quot;Offices of. the War Cabinet, S.W.-1.
