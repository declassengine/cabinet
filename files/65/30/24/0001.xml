POSITION The War Cabinet had under consideration aIN THE MIDDLE     Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsEAST. (Do0o(,42) 48) of an inquiry into two questions whichhe had been asked to undertake by the Defence committee at their Meeting on 2nd March (Du00(42) 7th Meeting)oThe first point- inquired into by the Secretaryof State.for Dominion Affairs was&quot;Why no repor; fe was rendered by the Middle east command after- the battle in June,,- 1941, to theeffect that the German tanks were armed witha gun firing a 4g--pound projectile. MThe Dominions Secretary&apos;s report stated thatthe Middle East Command had been in no way remiss inreporting what came to their knowledge about the German5-centimetre gun.     He was not satisfied, however, that adequate steps had been taken at the time of the november, 1941, offensive in Libya to make availableto the War Cabinet or the Defence Committee this andother information  available in this country,,The following were the main points in discussion&apos;(i) Copies of their operational telegrams were sent,under a regular procedure, by all three service departments to the Offices of the War Cabinetwhere a selection of the more important telegramswas made for the Prime Minister.    Copies of the telegrams containing information as to, the equipment of enemy units with this gun had beensent to the War Cabinet Offices under this procedure(ii) The reason why this information had not beenbrought to the notice of the War Cabinet gener-ally was almost certainly that the possession ofthe enemy of this gun was not, at the time,regarded as a factor of special importance.(iii) THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION confirmed this fromhis experience as Minister of State, in the MiddleEastc     His recollection was that he had.neverheard the Commandors-in-Chief in the Middle lastexpress the view that the possession of this enawas a factor which would prevent our offensive in November, 1941, from being successful. ,.He thought that the first time that the military^ -  Commanders had pressed strongly to be suppliedV.J with the 6-pounder anti-tank gun as an answer tothe German gun was in December, 1941, after the battle of Bid! Rezegh.     Previously it had been thought that the advantages which,this gunpossessed would be largely counter-balanced by&quot;: the speed of our cruiser tanks. -     ,

Civ)     There was general agreement that, if the- attention of the Defence Committee had&quot;been Specifically drawn a^the enemy5s possession of this gun, itwould not have altered the decision takento launch the offensive in*November, 1941a(In this connection, it was relevant thatat this date the authorities in thiscountry were anxious that General Auchinieckshould launch his offensive sooner ratherthan later, and that if the latter had thought -&quot;&quot;hat the existence of this gun wasa material factor he would have brought itto the notice of the War Cabinet. )(v)    Nevertheless, the view was expressed thatit was unfortunate that the Ministers onthe Defence Committee should have been inthe position in which they were asked totake decisions on military issues without,having brought to their notice, knowledgeof this gun which was  available -in thisi;ountry0(&quot;7&apos;ii)   It was accepted that the reason why this knowledge was not specifically brought totheir notice.,- was probably that theinformation was not regarded at that time as of special importance,.   But it was-agreed that it was incumbent on each ofthe Service E;lnistera.    to bring to. thenotice of the War Cabinet  all    - Lrelevant factors of general importance witha bearing on the conduct of militaryoperations, together with an expression oftheij? judgment on the matter,,   it was not enough that these matters should be studied by the Staffs concerned^(vii)   Importance was also attached to Departmentsconcerned with defence preparations making certain that they were organised so as toensure that any information with regard to new methods of warfare or types of equipmentdeveloped by the enemy were at once studiedand suitable counter-measures brought into action as quickly as possible;.The War Cabinet:-Agreed that the attention of Departments &quot;concerned should be drawn to the general considerations set out in these Minutes.

The second part of the Report was concerned viththe. defects in the Crusader tanks which had disclosedthemselves in the  battles   * at    Agedabia and Agheila,and why these had not been detected earlier.    The findingson these points were as follows:-(a.) The time taken to rectify the defects in thefan-drive assembly (approximately 11 months)was excessive.(b) The defects in the engine water pumps and pipeswere attributable to the extra strain imposed by the conditions, of battle in the desert.(c) Leaks from oil galleries were due to faultyworkmanship or slovenly assembly, whichescaped notice during the manufacturer1sinspection.(d) In general, the Crusader tank was pressed into production before the pilot model had been. adequately tested and before defects had beendetected and rectified.   Large-Scale production% was achieved only at the cost of mechanicalreliability and fighting efficiency.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that while he .accepted the statement of facts set out in the Report,he felt that it.did less than justice to Mech. and AeroLimited, the parent firm responsible for the manufactureof the Crusader tank.   Although in this particular tankthe manufacturers had been responsible for faults of designwhich they should have detected and rectified more quickly,the firm had done good work in tank manufacture generally,for which they should be given full credit.   He agreedthat the history of the Crusader tank was unfortunate;but the lesson to be drawn from this was that, if a tankwere put into full production before the pilot mo el hadbeen adequately tested, the probable result was, not only that mechanical and fighting efficiency would be sacrificed in the interests of numbers, but also thatdefects disclosed after production was in full swing could never be satisfactorily remedied.   The main difficulty with this, and with certain other existing types oftarikj was that the defects could not be cured withoutfundamental re-designing of the tank as a whole.   the alterations which had been made were no mare thanpalliatives, and it was not clear even now that all of them would be satisfactory.In discussion the following points were raised(a)   It was suggested that the Director of Tank Designshould have been able to arrange for the defectsin the fan-driv^ assembly to be rectified ina shorter period than eleven months.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY doubted &quot;whether thesedefects were &quot;capable of a comparatively easyremedy&quot; and said that it was not certain&quot;even now that the difficulties had been successfully

overcome,,   He agreed that these defects shouldhave &quot;been dealt with more quickly;   but the blamedid not rest wholly  with the Director of TankDesign.    In any event, the Minister had confidence in the ability of the Director, even though he.   might have been at fault in this particular matter.(b) Attention was drawn to the fact that the Ministry.of Supply do not carry out any detailed inspection of the tanks during manufacture and assembly, this being left to the manufacturers.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY considered.that more intensive inspection by his Department, even ifit were practicable,would tend to impede production.The best method of detecting defects was to spendan adequate time in trials of a pilot model beforefull production was begun.    This was the method nowapplied in respect of new models, and he was confident that by this means it would be possiblein future to avoid the type of defect described in the Report.(c) The defects described on page 4 of the Report hadnot been discovered until the trials at Lulworth,which took place seven months after the pilot modelwas first sent to the Experimental Establishment atParnborougho   Would it not have been possible tocarry on simultaneously the different types of testapplied at these two stages, so as to eliminatethis delay?THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY said that this source of delaywas now being eliminated to a large extent bytesting the separate components before assembly.(d) The defects of the earlier tanks had been due mainly to the fact that work on the design had been toohighly specialised and too much sub-divided.    Thenotable exception to this rule had been theValentine, the success of which was attributablelargely to the fact that it had been designed andproduced by a single firm.(e) THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY drew the attention of theWar Cabinet to certain corrections in Appendix II ofD.0.(42) 48, which are being circulated as, aCorrigenda to that paper.The &quot;war Cabinet took note of thereport of the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs,
