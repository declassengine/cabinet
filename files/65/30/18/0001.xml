MINUTE 6,Confidential Annex.(1st Jane,, 1942   -   6.0 pa)THE PRESS,The &quot;Daily-Worker&quot; .(previous reference:W.M.(41) 72ndConclusions,Minute 6. )The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Home Secretary (W.P.(42) 230) regarding the banon the &quot;Daily Worker &quot; .The Memorandum referred to the growingsupport for the view that, having regard to the changedattitude of the Communist Party towards the war, thecontinued prohibition of this newspaper was no longerjustifiable and involved an undesirable interferencewith the freedom of the press.    The Home&apos;secretary ownviev/ was that,, while there could be no question ofrevoking the ban immediately, revocation ought to beconsidered at some appropriate date, if possible beforethe end of the war0     Por his guidance in answeringforthcoming Questions in Parliament, the Home Secretarywished to know whether the War Cabinet shared his view andin particular, whether they agreed that requests for theimmediate lifting of the ban should continue to beIn discussion THE HOME SECRETARY reminded theWar Cabinet that at the recent Conference of the LabourParty a resolution in favour of the lifting of the banhad been carried by a small majority.    The question was likely to be considered at other Conferences, and theadoption of similar resolutions would be embarrassing.In particular, it would be awkward if the Trades UnionCongress passed such a resolution.   So long as theCommunist Party maintained their present attitude towardsthe war and continued to refrain from the openprosecution of their&apos; revolutionary aims it would become increasingly difficult to hold the position.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was thatit would be preferable to await further developments, atany rate until the beginning of September next, and that meanwhile nothing should be said to imply that theGovernment had any intention of modifying their policy inrespect of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;*The War Cabinet took note with approvalof the attitude which the Home secretary proposed to adopt in answering parliamentary questions on this subject, as set out inhis Memorandum W,P.(42) 230*0Great George Street, SicWoloTOBEKEPTUNDERLOOKANDKEY.^ ^
