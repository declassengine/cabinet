Q/^11.3:MOST SECRET -..0QPY NoWoMti (42)  83rd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2,Confidential Annex.(29th June, 1942, 5.30 p.nio)PRANCEoRelations withthe vichy government.The french fleet at alexandria.(previous reference&apos;.W,MC(42 )  63 rdConclusions,Minute 2 .)THE FIRST LORD OF   THE ADMIRALTY said that AdmiralHarwood had discussed with Admiral Godfroy theposition in regard to the French ships at Alexandria.Admiral Godfroy had stated that his instructions fromthe Vichy Government were that he was not to let his.....ships    fall into any foreign hands .   He would not agree to scuttle his ships before the German forcesarrived, as there was a chance that the Germans mightallow him to return to Franceo   Admiral Harwoodthought the best course would be to allow admiral godfroy to sail his ships to Bizerta if he would agree to certain conditions designed to secure thatthe ships would not fall into the hands of theGermans.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested two other alternatives .    The first was that we shouldpersuade Admiral Godfroy to sail the ships toJibuti.   The second, was whether, if evidence could,be adduced that Admiral Godfroy had been sendinginformation contrary to the terms of theagreement^, we       should be justified in takingforcible steps to ensure the destruction of the ships.The War Cabinet were reminded that   an agreement-had been concluded between Admiral Cunningham and admiral Godfroy, and later on between Admiral Harwoodand Admiral Godfroy.   The agreement   was   personal,and not in inter-Governmental form.    The main question for decision was whether we could compel admiral godfroy to move his vessels from Alexandria withouta breach of the agreement.It was pointed out that a direct threat againstAlexandria had. not been foreseen when the agreement-had been signed..-    It was felt that we should&apos;bejustified in taking the view that if Admiral Godfroyrefused to sail his ships from Alexandria if and when we. were compelled to evacuate the port, he would becommitting an act hostile to us and thus infringing .the agreements    Indeed, since action could, not beleft until the last moment, he would be committing an act hostile to us if he refused to leave Alexandriain advance of the danger developing.   The spirit ofthe agreement required, that if he left Alexandriahe should go to another port under British control

The War Cabinet were informed that Admiral Harwoodhad advised against, $he ships.being moved through the suez Canal, presumably on security grounds.   In viewof the objections to other destinations, however, the right course was that the ships should be sailed through the canal, provided that this was done quickly.We could use our Control of fuel to retain full control over the vessels&apos; movements^    If Admiral Godfroyrefused to sail his ships from Alexandria^ if and whenenemy occupation of Alexandria became imminent, we shoulddestroy has snips.The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the First Lord of the admiralty to concert instructions to the Commander-in-*Chief,Mediterranean, in the sense of the above discussion.,/The text of the instructions actually sent(0205/30 June) was as follows:-His Majesty&apos;s Government have&quot; decided thatyou should invite Admiral Godfroy at once to remove his ships from Alexandria throughthe Canal,   Ultimate destination not yetsettled,     but it would be a British port,-   You should arrange for fuel to be given by stages so that you retain control overvessels1 movements.You should intimate to Admiral Godfroy thatto insist on staying in Alexandria and thereby to risk his ships falling into enemyhands would be a hostile act, and that weshould therefore consider the agreement atan end.If Admiral Godfroy refuses Ho go we shouldbe conpelled, if and when enengr occupationof Alexandria becomes imminent, to destroyhis ships, and a hint should be given him that we should be forced to take this course^/Great George Street, S.W.1,
