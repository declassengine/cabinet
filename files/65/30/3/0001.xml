It is requested that special care may.be taken to -IS THE PJBM^6 oTOs0^^^^COPY NO.9W.M*(42) 45TH CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex.(9th April,, 1942.   -   12 Noon)The War Cabinet had before them the followingtelegrams956S.f 957S0 and 958S, from the Viceroy tothe Secretary of State for India.The second of these telegrams set out a revised formula in regard to defence, which, after discussion between the Viceroy, the Lord Privy Sealand the Commander-in-Chief, had been taken by ColonelJohnson^ as his own suggestion, to Pandit Nehru.    Thethird telegram contained,   a further revised formula,which had also been sent to Congress, but before theViceroy or the Commander-in-Ghief had had an opportunityof seeing itoThe following points were made in regard tothese formulae(i) Both formulae gave a changed emphasis to the division of duties between the Commander-in-Chief and the proposed new Defence Minister,since both took the form of assigning to theDefence Minister all defence functions otherthan those specifically assigned to the war department to be set up under the Commander-in-Ghief.(ii)   It was explained that the General Headquarters,Naval Headquarters and Air Headquarters inIndia (which were within the sphere of the proposedWar Department)included all the work whichwas done by the Military Branches of the three service Departments in this country, butexcluded the Secretariat and Finance Department.(iii)   It thus seemed that,so far as concerned theactual functions to be assigned to the war department under the Commander-in-chief,    ithere was no very substantialdifference -between the fcu formulae,1but there were a number of doubtful points.(iv)   For example, it was not clear whether, under thelatest txgcazkz.,. the&apos; Cc8anander-in**0hiex would have authority to ^i&apos;?o final sanction to proposalswithin the,general financial provision made forthe Bcsrcices, o.v whether tee JD$ ence Minister-------^would have power .*.o veto, any proposal on,financtlal gro^d&amp;o(v)   Exception was also taken to the phrase in(a) of telegram 958S, that tne Commander-in-Chief would be in control of the war activitiesof the armed forces in India, and would be a,        member of the Executive. Council for that,     ...    purpose0    It was important to make clear   that,like other members, he remained a member ofthe Council for all purposes.

Objection was- seen^ to the suggestion in paragraph (d).of thistelegrara. that, inthe event of any new functions falling tohe discharged in relation to defence, or any dispute as to allocation of old functions, thedecision should rest with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,, &quot;The language used in regard to the divisionof functions between the War Department andthe Defence Department was felt to be aomewliatderogatory to the ConBnander-in-Ohief and opento misconstruction.   It was undesirable to agreeto a formula which, when published,. would leadto questions to elucidate the real, position.Would it not be more satisfactory to saythat the present -Uefence Department was to be divided between a War Department and a defence Department, and to state what functions were to be assigned to each.No decision could, bo reached inregard to these questions of defence untilthe Commander-in-Chief&apos;s views were known*But the War Cabinet should,in the meantime,despatch a telegram in order to clear up theabove points.On the more general issues, the intervention ofColonel Johnson, the President&apos;s personal representative,was regarded as unfortunate.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet the text of two Personal telegrams which he had sent to theLord Privy Seal (T. 550/3 and 551/3)*   In these telegramshe had explained that Colonel Johnson was not thePresident&apos;s personal representative in any matter relatingto Indian Constitutional issues,but had been sent out todeal with questions relating t o military matters and supplies.   He had also asked that the Lord Privy Sealshould not commit us in any way to the latest formulauntil the War Cabinet had studied the matter and had communicated with him.Generally, it was felt that we were in dangerof being drawn away from the clear position which hadbeen explicitly stated in the terms of the Declaration.It was not easy to envisage as a whole the stages by whichthe present position had been reached, and the WarCabinet felt that it would be desirable to call a halt andto obtain a clear statement of the developments proposed under heading (e) of the Declaration, which dealtwith steps to be taken to ensure the immediate and effective participation of the leaders of the principalsections of the Indian people in the counsels of theircountry,.(vii)(viii)-2-

In particular, certain phrases had been used - as, for example, in the letter from the lord privy Seal to Azad (telegram 930S.) - which seemed to contemplate handing over a number of importantportfolios in the Viceroy*s Council to representativeIndians.   If it was contemplated that all the membersof the Viceroy&apos;s Council would be Indians,, this would put the Viceroy into ah impossible position.    In theoryhe would have the power to override his Council! hutwhat.would his position be if all the members of the -Council wore opposed to him?   Furthermore, how could he carry on the Government unless there were some member or members who could act as his spokesman in theLegislature?   The proposal that a representative Indianshould be put in charge of the Home Department also raised difficult questions in regard to the secret service.   Again, if the whole of the Viceroy&apos;s council was to be composed of Indians, this would almost certainly result in the Moslem League refusing toparticipate unless they were given half the seats.Finally, it was important to bring&apos; the matterback to the plan approved by the War Cabinet, and toobtain an assurance that, if agreement was reached on defence, the scheme in other respects was acceptable..The War cabinet agreed to the text of two telegramsembodying the above points, and authorised the Secretary of State forIndia to arrange for their despatch./Note:    These were later despatched asTelegrams No. 456 and 457 from theSecretary of State for India to theViceroy^/Great George Street, S*W.l.

Most Secret.   Superintendent Series.Following for Lord Privy Seal from War&apos; Cabinet. Begins:1.    War Cabinet deeply sympathises with difficulties ofyour tasks but is greatly concerned to find that latestformula was propounded to Nehru and to Working Committeewithout previous knowledge and approval of Viceroy andWavell.   There is also grave danger that Johnson1s publicintervention may be misunderstood as representing actionon behalf of U.S. Government, which of course is not thecase.2.     It is essential to bring the whole matter back tothe Cabinet-s plan which you went out to urge, with only such amplifications as are agreed to be put forward.3.     The most practical course would be to have from you,in clear and continuous form, the developments in orunder (e) which the Viceroy,, the Commander-in-Chief-andyourself are propounding, so that the Cabinet can see the.position as a whole.4o     It is also necessary to know what is meant byallusions to a National Government as though the membersof it would all be Indians,5.     We have not received any assurance that if agreement was reached on defence, the scheme in all other respectsis acceptable.6,     Following telegram raises some questions on 958-Son which we have as yet no clear information.

Superintendent series.Following for Lord Privy Seal from War Cabinets Begins.Viceroy1s telegram 958-S,   Following points need tobe definitely cleared up.(1) Last, line of (a) &quot;for that purpose&quot;.We presume Commander-in-Chief remains member of council for all purposes, like all other Members,and that the phrase above only refers to. hisspecial raison dyetre.   This must be quite clear.(2) First sentence of (d) appears completely to side-track position of Viceroy and Government, of Indiaand if so is clearly unacceptable.   The decision should be by Viceroy.(3) Does &quot;sanctioning&quot; under (d)(i) cover authority togive final sanction to proposals within general financial provision made for the services, or doesit give to the finance branch under the defence minister power to veto any and every proposal on financial grounds,(4) Generally speaking the whole document is obscureand couched in terms derogatory to the commander-in-Chief&apos;s position.   If the scheme is acceptable to Commander-in-Chief in substance, would it notbe much better to -say- clearly that the present defence Department is to be divided between a war department and a Defence Department and explicitlydefine the functions &quot;assigned to each.
