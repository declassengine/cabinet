1 :     On Sunday night      Molotov had told theForeign Secretary that he liked the Treaty of mutual Assistance better than he expected.At a. Meeting held that afternoon Mo Molotovhad informed the Foreign Secretary that he had reported to his Government that both the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary were in favourof concluding a Treaty of Mutual Assistance, and that .Mr. Winant had confirmed that President, Rooseveltwould also prefer this course.   He had informed his..-Government that the draft Treaty of .Mutual assistance was, in his (Mo Molotov&apos;s) view, of great importance.The Foreign Secretary said that he andMo Molotov had then discussed the text of the draft treaty of Mutual Assistance.   At the end of thediscussion M. Molotov had said that he might receiveinstructions from his Government on the matter inthe near future.    If he received instructions, would the Foreign Secretary&apos;be prepared to sign the Treaty .of Mutual Assistance on the following day?   TheForeign Secretary had said that he was meeting hiscolleagues that evening, and that he had little doubtthat they would be ready to agree to this course.The War Cabinet then went through thedraft Treaty of Mutual Assistance (W.P.(4S) 218).The view taken was that the Treaty of mutual assistance was greatly to be preferred to thedraft Political and Military Treaties and that weshould welcome a Treaty on these lines.The Foreign Secretary said that the onlypoint of substance which had been raised concerned-the second sub-paragraph of Article IV. &quot;This sub-paragraph provided that the Treaty of Mutual assistance should remain in force for twenty years, unless and.until it. was superseded by the adoption of - the proposalscontemplated in Article III (i;.   m. Molotov had asked who would decide whether the Treaty of mutual assistance was so superseded?   The War Cabinet agreedthat the Treaty, of Mutual Assistance would remain inforce   for the stipulated period (20 years) unlessboth parties agreed that it was superseded by theproposals contemplated in Article III (!)*The Foreign Secretary said that he hadreminded M. Maisky that both the Russians and ourselves were under an obligation to tell Turkeybefore we. signed a Treaty.   He proposed that theyshould see the Turkish Ambassador in London togethermid inform him of what was proposed.The Foreign Secretary said that he was nowconvinced that M, Molotov was anxious to co-operate with us after the &quot;war.    It was also quite evidentthat M. Litvinoff had not kept the U.S.S.R.authorities informed of opinion in the U.S.A,

THE PRIME MINISTER said that if*contrary to expectation, M0 Molotoy did not receive authority to sign the Treaty of mutual assistance and reverted to the former draft itwould be undesirable that a Treaty on the linesof the former draft should be signed beforeMo Molotov had visited the United States.,   He alsoemphasised the importance of keeping secret, for&apos;thb present, the signing of the proposed Treaty.The War Cabinet:-(1) Agreed to the conclusion withthe Soviet Union of a Treatyof Mutual Assistance on thelines set out. in W,P.(43) 218:(2) Took note that the Secretaryof State for Dominion affairs had made arrangements to telegraph to the Dominion PrimeMinisters informing them of thelatest developments, and thatthe Dominion High commissioners in London would be informed ofthe position on the followingdfternoon.Great George Street,  SeW0l*
