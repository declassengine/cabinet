SW.M*(42)  81ST CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE  1,Confidential Annex.(25th June, 1942 - 5.30 p.m.)SHIPPING(SITUATION,previous reference:W.M,(42)80thConclusions,Minute 3) *The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister ofWar Transport. (W.P.(42) 265).This Memorandum, after reviewing the prospectivebalance of shipping losses and new building, and themeasures already taken or projected for increased protectionof convoys and intensification of the anti U-boat campaign,reached the conclusion that the shipping situation over thenext 12 months would become critical unless the scale of attack on U-boats in the Bay of Biscay could be substant-ially increased.THE    DEPUTY   PRIME   MINISTER   said,that the specific recommendation, made in paragraph 27 of thoMemorandum, for the divex^sion of bomber strength fromBomber Command to Coastal Command was now being consideredby a special Committee appointed by the Chiefs of Staff;and he suggested that for the present the   War Cabinet should confine themselves to a preliminary discussion of thegeneral appreciation of the shipping position given in theMemorandum,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that duringthe next twelve months the shipping situation would be such that our difficulties could not be met only by relying on new building - both here and in the U.S.A.-and by such reduction of imports as could be secured by reducingconsumption and   running down stocks.     The estimates madein the first Report of the Shipping Committee (s.C.(42)20)were tbxaight by the Admiralty to be somewhat optimistic.Unless the rate of sinkings could be reduced, the gap tobe bridged would be larger than was suggested in that Report.Total sinkings this year already amounted to 3^ million tonsby enemy action;    and losses from other causes were running at the rate of more than 600,000 tons a.year.     In the second half of 1942, we might expect that losses in the WesternAtlantic would be substantially reduced, as a result of the progressive introduction of the convoy system off theAmerican sea-board;   but the weight of the U-boat attack would probably be transferred to the Eastern Atlantic, where we were now less well-equipped .to resist attack in view ofthe extent to which our escort strength had been reduced bythe necessity of diverting escort vessels to the Americancoast.     It was estimated that by March 1943 the germans would have about 500 U-boats available for service   (lesssuch losses as might be inflicted on them in the intervening period);- of which say .140 would be required for trainingor fitting out.     Unless we could inflict heavy losses, the

enemy might bo able to keep as many as 500 in operation atany one time by July 1943. In these circumstances it was essential that we should concentrate the masimum effort onthe destruction of U-boats at sea,THE  DEPUTY   PRIME   minister suggested that the War Cabinet should consider the situation under three heads(a) the prospects of the shipbuilding programmes;(b) the efficacy of the convoy system;(c) the merits of offensive action against U-boats ascompared with improved defence of merchant vessels.The following were the chief points raised in discussion:-(i) U.S.A. programmes.     THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTIONsaid that the American programme had beenrevolutionised by the success of new buildingmethods involving extensive use of welding and-pre-fabrication.     As a result the Americans were likely to reach their original target of 8 million tons dead weight in 1942 (cs, say, 5^ million tonsgross) - or at least to come within -g- million ton?of that programme - and in 1943 would probablyreach SO million tons dead weight (=, say, 14million tons gross).       These figures would be correspondingly reduced if it became necessaryto devote the production of one or more ship-yards to the building of escort,   vessels - thoughthe gain in protective strength   resulting froman increased number of escort -vessels would ofcourse offset this reduction to some extent.(ii) Allocation of ships built in U.S.A.    IncreasedAmerican building would off-set our losses only if we could be reasonably sure that we should get a substantial share of the new ships built in theUnited States.     So far, it had not been possibleto obtain any definite assurance on this pointfrom the U.S, authorities, though Mr, Harry Hopkinshad said to the Minister of War Transport that weco Id rely on our imports being kept up to the24 million ton level.     Our present calculations -had, however, been based on the assumption that american building in 1943 would not amount to more&apos;than 14 million tons (dead weight);    and theestimate now given by the Minister of Productionrepresented a substantial increase on the previousestimates.(lii) Building methods in this country.     In thisconnection it was suggested&quot; that shipbuilding capacity in this country could have been increased if there had been less reluctance to adoptnovel methods of construction,     THE MINISTER OPPRODUCTION said that an enquiry was now being made into shipbuilding methods in this country byMembers of his Industrial Panel;    and he suggestedthat the War Cabinet should suspend judgment onthis issue until the report on that enquiryhad been received.&apos;

(iv) Cargo Shells.     THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether any help could be found in constructing cargo-shells which could be towed by other vessels.THE MINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT .said that this wasa very difficult task except in very calm weather,and involved considerable risk for the towingvessel,     Nevertheless, he was asking for the.matter to be further investigatedo(v) Proportion of faster ships being built.     Gouldwe obtain relief by the construction of a higher proportion of faster ships?THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY gave figures which showed that the higher number of voyages which thefaster vessels could complete in a year was morethan counter-balanced by the extra amount of spaceoccupied in these vessels by bunkers and engine room in proportion to cargo space.There was also the consideration that the fasterships took longer to build.9THE MINISTER OF WAR TRANSPORT said that, from thepoint of view of military requirements, it wasnecessary to build a considerable proportion offastex^ vessels.     The number of ships of 15 knotsand over now being built had however been increasedto 28 per cent, of our programmeo     It was genv . i&quot;agreed that our ship-building programme nowprovided for a sufficient proportion of fastervessels.(vi) Rates of losses sustained by faster vessels.Losses of &quot;ships &quot;sailing/at .15-knots or over outof convoy had been less in proportion than thoseof slower ships sailing in convoy.,     It wassuggested, however, that, if losses in convoysequivalent to military operations wero excludedfrom the convoy losses, the balance of advantage would not appear to lie so clearly in favour of theindependent faster sailings.(vii) Efficacy of the convoy system.     THE FIRST LORD OFfHiS MmxBdJ/^ referred to the&quot;&quot;figures given inTable A of the Joint Memorandum^     These showed that in the second half of 1941 the losses ofmerchant ships in the North-Western Approacheshad been very greatly reduced.     From aboutDecember, 1941, however, the position had deter-iorated, owing to the strain on our escortingforces caused by . S&quot;apau9.a -entry toto the warand by the Russian convoys.     In the result,while eight or twelve escorting vessels hadaccompanied convoys in the latter half of 1941,this number had had to be reduced to four or sixvessels.(viii) Proportion of unsuccessful jattacks on vessP&amp;s in convoy.&quot;    In answer to a question, THE FIRST-LORDOF THE ADMIRALTY said that figures could beproduced,&apos;if necessary, showing the numbers of attacks made by enemy submarines against ships in convoy which had been unsuccessful.     Such figuresmight not, however, bring out fully the fact that

enemy submarines showed some reluctance to attackvessels in strongly-escorted convoys.(ix)    Convoy arrangements on the Bast Coast of America.The War Cabinet were informed that in a short timethe convoy system on the Eastern American sea-board would extend as far South as Aruba.   while a certain number of vessels would still have toproceed beyond this point, the convoy system north of this point should afford good protection and?in the opinion of the MINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT,there was reason to expect a sensible improve-ment in the rate of losses sustained.     On this account he thought that there was no reason atthis stage to increase the estimate of losses in 1942, which had been put at 6^ million tonsgross.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY, however, thoughtthat when account was taken of the anticipatedincrease in the number of enemy submarines whichwould be operating against us, it would not be right to jpoossoa on any reduction in the scale of losses now being sustained.Scale of air attack on U-boats while in the bay of Biscay.     Preliminary points only were dealtwith under .this head.     THE FIRST LORD OF THEADMIRALTY said that Une experience of an increasedscale of air operations against enemy submarinesover the past few weeks had been very encouraging.Attacks on enemy submarines in the Bay of Biscaycould, he thought, only be carried out effectivelyby aircraft, since it was impossible to keepcorvettes operating in an area liable to attack by enemy land-based aircraft,?THE MINISTER OF WAR TRANSPORT said that there was reason to believe that the United States, when theyhad introduced their improvements in their convoy system in the Western Atlantic, would ask what steps we proposed to take to hamper enemy sub-marines operating from bases in the Bay of TMrrr--(xi)   Air attacks on yards building Submarines.     THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said&quot;that, while theRoyal   A:&apos;,?   Force were anxious to play their full part in dealing with the shipping situation, they felt that offensive action was more likely   to beof value if directed against centres in whichsubmarines were built,     84$ of the enemycapacity devoted to building submarines was within   reach of the Air Force throughout theyear, and 64$ was concentrated in Bremen, KAsland Hamburgc     The recent raid on Emden, wherethere was a submarine building yard, had been particularly successful. ------(xil)   Need for air protect!onjat convoy dispersal pointsnTHE MINISTER OF WAR TRANSPORT said &quot;that as soonas the United States had established a satisfact-ory convoy system it was certain that the enemy would launch a heavy scale of submarine attackat the points where convoys converged on* or were dispersed from, terminal ports.     He consideredthat it was of the utmost importance thatal (x)0

arrangements should be made for strong aircraftprotection of these crucial areas.     But the mattei&apos;would only be effectively dealt witji if it wastaken up at a high level.     We had bought our experience in this matter dearly in the last war,THE DEPUTY PRIMS MINISTER asked the First Lord ofthe Admiralty and the Minister of War transport to arrange for a draft telegram dealing with thispoint to be prepared, for submission to the PrimeMinister on his return from the United States,,The War Cabinet -Agreed to defer further consideration of thismatter until the Report on the operationalaspects of the shipping situation, preparedby the Committee appointed by the Chiefs ofStaff, wan available0Great George Street.
