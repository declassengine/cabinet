TO BE KEPT&apos;UNDER LOQK AND KEY.It is requested iisal special cara may betaken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO.   .rW.MPreviousReference:W.M.(4S)56thConclusions,Minute l).1.(42) 65th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Oonfiuential Annex.(21st. May, 1942, 5.30 p.m.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(W.P.(42)210) containing a copy of a telegram, dated 13thMay, 1942, from the Prime Minister of the   Commonwealth ofAustralia to Dr. Evatt,   about strategic considerations affecting the defence of Australia.DR. EVATT said that the Directive issued to GeneralMacArthui required him (a) to hold the key military regions of Australia as bases for future offensive action against japan:    and.   (after setting out a number of other objectswhich he need not recapitulate), (b), to prepare to take theoffensive0One of the groat difficulties with which we were faced was that, while the United States Chiefs of Staffought to look at the South West Pacific area as a whole,irrespective of the Allied forces located in it,they tended to &quot;concentrate on- equipping their own forcesin  this area.,Mr. Curtin&apos;s telegram of the 13th May had, of co11&quot;^;been drafted before he knew the grand strategy of the war.At his Meeting with the Chiefs of Staff in the previous weekhe (Dr. Evatt) had been irformedthat tho gKRXid Strategy of the war, aslaid down in F-ebruary,. 1941, was that Germany was the dominant member of the Axis Powers whose defeat we mustcompass.     Notwithstanding the entry of Japan into the war,the view was still held that Germany was the principal enemy,and that, once we had secured the defeat of Germany, the defeat of Japan would necessarily follows     In passing, he observed that the Australian Chiefs of Staff had not had any.part in drawing up this strategy.More recently the British Chiefs of Staff, in an aide-memoire on strategy, had stated that the broad strategicpolicy was that only after Germany&apos;s defeat would the united nations assemble superior forces against Japan.     This wasthe doctrine set out in W,W.lo, which remained fundamentallyunchangede, .The Australian point of view was that to declare thatGermany was the^primary enemy   and   should therefore be attacked first   was a thesis which was basically open to &apos;doubt*Notwithstanding the above, views, it was stated inparagraph 18 of W.W.1.    that the- security of Australia andNew Zealand must be maintained.     Again, in the aide-memoire which the Chiefs of Staff had handed to tiim, itwas stated in paragraph. 15 &quot;that, apart from our Intentionof giving Australia all practical help, we depend upon heras a base for the final offensive against Japan*     Neverthe- ;less, it   is. essential that the utmost care is taken inrelating her defence requirements to our general warstrategy and to our forecast of enemy intentions,&quot;. -i- -

The view held by the Chief s &quot;or&quot;Starr&quot; Itr^reair-Br^ltninwas that a full-scale invasion of Australia was unlikely.The Australian advisers held a different view0   Moreover,they held that the invasion, of Australia could be prevented by a reasonable expenditure of resources at &apos;this momentjwhile if such expenditure was not incurred now, heavy expenditure would be involved later.on0Dr. JUvatt also quoted from paragraph 4 of telegram ZNo. 57, sent on 4tli May, 1942 to the Dominions PrimeMinisters:-&quot;Whilst the primary object is to concentrate on anattack on the Western Front, it is absolutely essential to safeguard the defence of India andthe Middle East, as well as Australia and the island bases connecting that country with theUnited Stateso     Adequate forces must be allocated for these tasks0&quot;Dr. Bvatt also quoted from a telegram which had beensent to the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand on11th August, 1940, in which the Prime Minister had said:-&quot;If however contrary to prudence and self-interest,Japan set about invading Australia or New Zealandpn a large scale, I have the explicit authorityof the Cabinet to assure you that we should thencut our losses in the Mediterranean and proceedto your aid, sacrificing every interest except -only the defence and feeding of this Island onwhich all dependso&quot;Dr. Evatt emphasised that, notwithstanding the factthat according to our grand strategy   the defeat of germany was our prime objective, all these documents emphasised the,importance of ensuring the security of Australia, as a b??flof operations against Japan0THE PRIME MINISTER sa,id that he entirely stood by the assurance given in the cable to Mr. Menzies quoted byDr. Evatt.     The contingency   of invasion on a large scale had not yet arisen, however, and ho hopod that      2it would never ariso0     If it did ariso.. one BritishArmoured Division!(the 8th) and one Infantry Division-(the44th), which would be rounding the Cape in the course of thenext few weeks, could be diverted to Australia more quicklythan forces from any other theatre^Continuing, the.Prime Minister said that,  sinceJapan had come into the war, Australia had made a directappeal for help from the United States., and we had fallen in with Australia&apos;s wishes in this matter.     The line of demarcation which had been drawn in the Pacific putAustralia into the United States sphere^     Notwithstandingthis demarcation of spheres, we did not, of course, regardour obligations to do what we could to help Australia asbeing lessened in any way      The position   must be, however,that while we would do all in our. power to come toAustralians help if she was invaded, we could not afford tolock up in any theatre (Australia included) sufficient troops to meet all possible-invasion risks.     Our strategy must be touse our available forces to meet the main enemy effort,whenever it might be made p..-.  At the moment it was not easy for us to forecast where Japan.would strike next.     Therewere a number of possibilities,!,     Before long we should see in what direction Japan&apos;s threat developed^    We would,

however, do what we could to give Australia more air supportsWe were encountering difficulties ourselves with the americans over the allocation of aircraftQ     They had made proposals: under which they Would keep for themselves 5j,000aircraft which had been allocated to us.     These were      \enough to equip 100 new Squadrons, the personnel for whichhad been provided for.     He was not unmindful of the factthat there were 7 squadrons in this country manned byAustralians, and we would like some of these squadrons tobe sent to Australia.     He had asked the Chief of the AirStaff on the previous day to consider the despatch fromthis country to Australia of three Spitfire squadrons.DR. EVATT then referred to the system of allocation.This was.carried out by the Combined Chiefs of Staffs, andthe Australian advisers had   no share in it.     He thoughtthat there, was a risk that, if Australia was in the UnitedStates sphere, there would be a tendency for our representatives on the Assignment Board to regard theUnited States as responsible for Australia.     The result might be that our representatives would press for munitions to be assigned to India rather than to Australia.     Hewould be grateful if our representatives could be asked tobe on the watch against a tendency which would be injurious to the Empire.Dr. Evatt then referred to the Naval position.Half the Australian Navy had been lost.     While the UnitedStates Naval authorities had carried out some brilliant raidsthere was no concentration of Naval force within the area., Summarising the matter. Dr. Evatt said that he wishedto call attention to three points.     First, the vital need of strengthening the Naval forces.     Secondly, the questionof assignment of munitions., which had been dealt with inhis letter of the 20th May to the Prime Minister.   Thirdly,the question of aircraft^THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF then explained the positionin regard to the supply of aircraft.     Every theatresubmitted its requirements, the total of which was greatly in excess of the aircraft available.     All that the Chiefsof Staff could do was to look at the position from the broad strategical point of view and to instruct the assignment Committees to proceed on that basis.     If it wasnecessary to inject a view other than the strategical visvinto the machinery for Assignment, means for doing soalready existed.The Chief of the Air Staff then dealt, with theproposal that two Australian and one British Spitfiresquadrons should be sent from this country to Australia.Since the aircraft had to be tropicalised^ this wouldmean that they would be sent at the expense of the middle east theatre, or of Malta.     The result would probablybe that Malta&apos;s.July ration of Spitfires could not arriveuntil the end of  that month.     Tho convoy leaving in thomiddle of June would ho the oar Host by which they could be sont.     It was also likoly that thoro would bo ashortago of certain sparos^ with tho result that thosquadrons might become unserviceable rather quickly0

The Chief of the Air Staff also pointed out thatin Australia trained personnel v/oro available in excessof aircrafto     He thought, therefore, that it might be abetter plan to arrange for sufficient Kittyhawks to equipthree squadrons to be.made available from the United States,together with a sufficient supply of aircraft of the same .type to maintain the squadrons thereaftera     He believedthat this would result in giving Australia greater help at greater speed, and with more economy of general effort, thanby sending three squadrons from this countryoDR. EVATT said that the arrival in Australia fromthis country of three Spitfire squadrons, including one UnitedKingdom Spitfire squadron, would have a tremendous effect.This matter was then discussed by the War Cabinet, and.the Ministers present agreed that these three squadronsshould be sent as proposed, notwithstanding the fact thatthe supply of Kittyhawks would be a more economical use of.resourceso     The symbolic effect of sending these squadronsfrom this country would be very great0     Moreover, it mustbe borne in mind that while there were Australian squadronsfighting in this country, and an Australian Division in theMiddle East9 there were at present no United Kingdom units in Australia.)    , tTHE PRIME MINISTER asked the Chief of the Air staff to draw up a paper explaining shortly the measures proposed for the despatch of these three squadrons to AustralianThis should form a basis for  a communication to bo made- byDr.  Evatt to the Australian Government.   No comminicationshould be sent in the meantime by the United kingdom authorities on the matter.DR. BVATT expressed   his   gratitude   tothe War Cabinet for the decision reached,,     He hoped that itwould be understood that the despatch of the two Australiansquadrons was a decision of the United Kingdom Government,and that it would not be said that the Commonwealth Govern-ment had asked for their recall.THE PRIME MINISTER assented and added that, notwith-standing our own diff difficulties,we wouldtate all ^possible steps tosee that nothing was lacking which would ensure thesuccessful operation   of these squadrons in Australia.DR. EVATT also asked that the decisions taken-should not be regarded as affecting Australianapplications for allocations of aircraft to the SouthWest Pacific^    .   .THE&apos;5PRIME MINISTER assented,, pointing out that; thethree squadrons were a special contribution to australia in an emergency.Great George Street, S.W.1.
