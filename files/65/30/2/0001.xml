It would easematters greatly with the President ifMo Stalin would accept this condition.   Hethought that the best chance lay in expressing this condition as one of general application to all territories which had changed or might change hands since thelast general Peace settlement (VersaillesTreaty)o     On merits there was much to besaid for this proposition.The War   Cabinet concurred in thissuggestion, and authorised the foreign secretary to adopt it0(S) A question arose on Article 3 of thedraft Treaty (Annex II to W.P.(42) 144)* ,Should we attempt to make reciprocalbetween the U,S,,S.R. and ourselves theundertaking given as to the restoration of frontiers violated by aggression?   Thedifficulty about doing this was that those parts of our Empire which had been overrun,had been overrun by Japan, with whom russia was not at war0The War Cabinet took the view that weshould not seek to make reciprocal theprovision in regard to restoration of frontiers.,(3) Should we ask M. Molotov to come over andsign the Treaty provided the negotiationswent satisfactorily?     M. Molotov might wellnot be able to accept such an invitation,but on the whole, it was thought right toextend one to him.    If he was going to theUnited States.,, it would be natural for him to spend a few days here en routeoThe War Cabinet:-Approved the line of action proposedin the Memorandum, and authorised the.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. -, - to proceed accordingly*Great George Street, S.W.lo
