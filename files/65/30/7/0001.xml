TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. $1(this^OOUMMT IS ^J^,^^^^^^&quot;^^^^^^^^^^ ^MAJ3STYTS GOTEMT) J*MOST SECRET, , *n8^e the s&amp;Gr6^ of thls ^ooumeot. copy m^  fQW.M.(42)  54TH CONCLUSIONS. ,,   Opnf idontial AnneXo(29th April, 1942 - 6,15 p.m.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe.Chiefs of Staff (0.0.8* (42) 103 (0) Final) setting out the scheme proposed for developing operations onthe Continent, as a result of discussions which hafltaken place with Mr Hopkins and General Marshall.The War Cabinet had also had circulated to them the Minutes of the Meeting of the Defence Committee   -held on 14th April (D.O. (42) lQth Meeting), and asingle copy of:-(l) A Memorandum received from general marshall:(2) The comments of the Chiefs of Staff onthis Memorandum (CoOoS. (42) 97 (0)).It was explained that the genesis of- the proposedoperations had been the consideration of what help wecould give the Russians this year.    It did not seem likely that we should be able to divert enemy land forces fromthe.Russian front, in 1942.   On the other hand, we mightsucceed in diverting enemy air forces by an air offensivealone.   But we. could not rely upon being able to bring&apos;this about by air action alone, since the enemy might decide to refuse action in the air.   If this happened,the only way to compel them to fight would be by establishing a bridgehead on the Continent.    The pre-reparations how being pushed forward would include raids on an increasingly &quot;large scale..   These were intendedto test the defences.   The actual moment, however, atwhich we should attempt to establish and hold a .bridgehead must be for later decision.   Thus, it mightdepend upon the degree of demoralisation of the german forces, or on the extent to which action on our partbecame essential in order to relieve pressure on Russia.In any event, the preparations now   in hand would laythe foundations for operations on a large scale on theContinent, in 1943 ,One feature of the plan was that we should haveto start at once to bring back the South Coast portsinto use, and otherwise to make plans to use theSouth Coast as a base for operations on the Continent.This would, no doubt&apos;, create a sense of nervousnessin the enemy and, taken with our active raiding policy,,would probably result in holding enemy troops in theWest.Discussion took place regarding co-operationbetween.air units set aside for Army co-operation andthe Army.&apos;   The rc--arming of these squadrons with modern-type air craft-was seriously behindhand, owingto American production having fallen behind programme.The view was also expressed that the personnel of the squadrons concerned had had. insufficient training inco-operation with-Army units.     .The War Cabinet were informed^that the Chiefs ofStaff had in preparation^&apos; for submission,to. the DefenceCommittee, a Memorandum setting ,out the points on which:agreement had not been reached between the Services on &quot;this   matt or&apos;o . .FUTURE OPERA-TIONS.Operations onthe Continent0

.ecommodation. Another point raised in   discussion   was the great-pressure on accommodation which wouid&quot;&quot;&amp;mue when american troops arrived in bhis country in considerable^nmribers.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL suggested that further arrangements should he ,made to ensure due co-ordination of the exercise of powers to requisitionbuildings.    So far as practicable, the Ministry of works and Buildings should be used as ,agents for all Depart-ments in regard to certain categories of accommodation.This suggest ion was. approved, an&apos;, the&apos;lord president was -askec to take   the matter up..-. THE PRIME MINISTER, in surnraing up the discussion,said that he thought the War Cabinet were, agreed thatwe should go ahead,, at full speed, with the plans for operations on the Continent, and that we   shouldcontinue, without relaxation, our pressure  on theenemy&apos;s air force.   While preparations should proceed on the basis that we should make a resolute effort to capture a bridgehead on the Continent-in the late summer,we were not committed to carry out such an operationthis year.,The War Cabinet:-Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up&apos;   of the position, and agreed that prepara-tions for operations on the Continent should proceed without delay.OperationIRONCLAD.(previous reference:W.M.(42) 52ndCon el us ions ,Minute 1.)THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet thefol lowing t el e grams : - -(l) no&quot;81 from the Prime Minister to thePresident, dated 28th April, asking theUnited States Government to take certainaction with a view ,to making clear thatthe United States approved our proposed action:(2) No. 142, from the President to the PrimeMinister, dated 29th April, indicatingagreement with two of the suggestions madein the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram:(3) Noe 82!from the Prime Minister to the-President, dated 29th April,All the Chiefs of Staffs indicated that they were satisfied with the plans made for the operation itself.There remained, of course, the question of the possible reactions of the Vichy French Government. THE CHIEF OFTHE NAVAL STAFF drew attention to the serious conse-quences for us if the French forces based on Dakar tookhostile action with a view to preventing us from using the port of Freetown..THE PRIME MINISTER and FOREIGN SECRETARY thought.  that the risk of the Vichy Government taking hostile action against us, was one which should be taken.The War. Cabinet:-Agreed that operation IRONCLAD should proceed without further reference to them, Unless any .*, events or developments in the next few daysmade it necessary to   reconsider the matter.Great George Street ,&apos;s.WdV
