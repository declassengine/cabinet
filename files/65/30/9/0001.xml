MOST SECRET.St Is requested that special care may be taken trOnsure the secrecy of this document . -OOPY NOW.M.  (43) 58-bh CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(7th May, 1942, 12 Noon).(previous reference;WoM.(42)51st1 Conclusions,[Minute 1.)The War Cabinet again considered the questionwhether we should issue a declaration that we should use gas against the Germans if they used it againstthe RussiansoThe War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum,dated 5th May, by the Foreign Secretary, reportingan interview which he had had on that day with theSoviet Ambassadorwho had stated that he hadbeen strongly pressed by Moscow for information asto the date when the declaration would be made,,The Foreign Secretary had indicated that theposition hadr on investigation, proved to be more complicated than it had seemed when the PrimeMinister had spoken to the Ambassadors     the ambassador had been considerably distressed atthis remarksThe War Cabinet was also informed that therewere some indications that the Germans might intend to use gas against the RussiansoOn behalf of the Chiefs of Staff it was stated that their views remained as set out in w.P.(42) 171.     In this Paper they hadpointedout that, while we were in a position to engage in chemical warfare by our air forces againstGermany and in the Middle East, the Army was notyet adequately equipped with chemical weapons inany other theatre.     The. initiation of gas warfarein certain Eastern theatres would involve usin the gravest difficulties, especially in India,and they considered that it would be to our gravedisadvantage if we became involved in chemical warfare in the immediate future..THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF read to the War Cabinet a summary of a report which hadbeen received from General Mason-McFarlane as tothe extent of Russian chemical warfare preparations,,In discussion the view was expressed thatthe Japanese were unlikely to be influenced in adecision whether or not to use gas by events inEurope.     They might think that by refraining from

using gas in&apos; India they would be likely to obtain a more favourable reaction from Indian opinion.But if they thought that&apos; the use of gas was in their interests, they would use it.On the other hand, it was felt that there was some chance that a declaration of our part mightdeter the Germans from using gas.     It was alsoclear that, whether or not a prior declaration wasmade, if we were satisfied that Germany had initiatedgas warfare against Russia, we should have to usegas against Germany ourselves.As regards this country, while gas warfarewould probably result in difficulties for a few days,our anti-gas precautions could be regarded as satisfactory.A further consideration was that it would bevery difficult to explain to the Russians a decisionon our part not to make a declaration at this time,more especially in view of the position of the treaty negotiations.The War Cabinet therefore reached theconclusion that the balance was in favour of a public declaration being made in the near future,to theeffect that if we were satisfied that Germany hadinitiated gas warfare against Russia, we shouldnot hesitate to use gas ourselves against Germany,and that in this matter the Russians and ourselvesstood together.It was pointed out that it would be important that the declaration made should be so worded as tosafeguard us. against Russia initiating gas warfareagainst Germany, and to provide for our being satisfied that gas warfare had been started by theGermans.     Presumably the Russians would give usfacilities for investigation.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it mightbe appropriate that he should include a declaration on this matter in his broadcast on Sunday night.The War cabinet agreed that a public declaration should be made by the Prime Ministerto the effect that ,if we were satisfied that the Germans had initiatedgas warfare against the Russians, we shouldnot hesitate to retaliate againstGermany with the same weapon.Great George Street, S.W.I.
