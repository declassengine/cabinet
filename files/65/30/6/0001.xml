(42) 52nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(24th April, 1942, 12 Noon.)B)operation THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet that theIRONCLAD&quot;, force for Operation IRONCLAD had turned the Cape and that all arrangements had been made for the Operation to,be carried outearly in May   by a force of two, or if necessary three, Brigades.The object of the Operation was to prevent our being fore-stalled by the Japanese in the occupation of Madagascar.    Thequestion had been raised whether the change of Government inFrance made it necessary to reconsider the Operation.   Hisown view, in which the Foreign Secretary concurred, was thatthe change in the Government of Vichy France did not make itnecessary to call off the Operation.The Prime Minister said that the United States Governmenthad been informed of the Operation, but had preferred   not tobe openly associated with it.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he hoped, nevertheless,that on the morrow of the Operation the united States Govern-ment would make it clear tha-t they^heartily concurred in it.THE PRIME MINISTER added that no final decision as towhether the Operation should take place-need be made untilthe 3rd May, All that was necessary at the moment was todecide whether preparations for the Operation should continue0Field-Marshal Smuts had been informed of the position, andwas very pleased with the prospect of this operation.The general view of the \;ar Cabinet was that theOperation should go forward, subject, of course, to any changein circumstances before the date at which the final decision must be taken.Some discussion ensued as to whether suffi&amp;ient forces had been made available, particularly Air.forces, to make sure that, if once the Island had been taken, we could hold it ifthe Japanese attacked in force.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explained that the basis ofthe scheme was the denial of Madagascar to the Japanese, theobject being to make it impossible for them to obtainpossession of the Island   cheaply.     We had not, however,sufficient forces to make ourselves so strong in the Islandthat we could hold it, whatever force Japan might send against it.     But Japan might well hesitate before sending a largeforce to attack Madagascar, more especially/ in view of thevery long distance involved.As regards Air forces, the South African Government wouldprobably agree to send a couple of squadrons to Madagascar^Steps would be taken to see that we got as&apos;much Air support as possible from the Union Government.The War cabinet agreed that Operation IRONCLAD should go forward,.subject to any change in circumstances before thedate at which the final decision must be taken.Great George Street.

In the circumstances,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Defence Committee,at their Meeting on Wednesday, 22nd April, (D.0.(42)12thMeeting, Minute 2). had decided that General &quot;TJobbieshould he relieved as Governor of Malta   and Lord Gortappointed in his places   .

Dobbio&apos; has^-&quot;howavog. not takongpy^arj^thought there was some intriguethe circumstances, it had been thoughtthat the best plan would be that the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should go out to Malta to talk mattersover with General Dobbie.     Lord Cranborne would be accompanied by a Q. Staff Officer, who would go into the island&apos;s needs in stores in detail.An alternative course had since been suggested,namely, that General Dobbie should be brought home for consultation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES gave thearguments in favour of the latter course.      If a Ministerwent out specially, it would be clear to all that therewas something special in view.     On the other hand, to recall General Dobbie for consultation was a natural course which would not give rise to these suspicions,     WhileGeneral Dobbie was in this country, Lord Gort might take his place, and if it was finally decided that GeneralDobbie should not return to Malta, Lord Gort could then beappointed permanently, to succeed him as Governor. ,1HE LORD PRIVY SEAL said&apos; that the&apos; vital question was the relation of the Governor to the three military commanders.     This could not be settled by General Dobbiecoming home to this country.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF also saidthat what was wanted was a Governor v/ho was in command ofthe fortress, rather than a locum tenens.The War Cabinet then considered whether the best,course would not be that the Minister of State shouldaccelerate his journey to Cairo, starting on thefollowing night, and proceeding via Malta,     This coursewould have the added advantage that the matter would be.enquired into by a member of the War Cabinet;    and, more over it   would be specially appropriate that this matter shouldbe dealt with by the Minister of State on his way to.Cairo*General Agreement was expressed with this view.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Minister of state might also take an opportunity of discussing the position with Lord Gort, when passing through Gibraltar, onthe hypothesis that a decision wouldlater be taken thatGeneral Dobbie should be replaced by Lord Gort.The war Cabinet%-(-.) Invited the Minister of State to visit:ialta on his way to Cairo, and to report whether, in his view, a new governor should be appointed in place of GeneralDobbie;(2) Invited   the Prime Minister to send atelegram to General Dobbie informing him of   this change of plan.air THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF informed the War CabinetReinforcements.that 47 Spitfires had been flown successfully into Maltafrom the WASP.      He detailed the circumstances which had led to a considerable proportion ofthese aircraft having since been damaged, some in air fight:.&quot;..;r but mainly on the ground,THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that,by putting all our large submarines in the Mediterraneanon to carrying supplies into Malta, the utmost whichwe could manage would be to put in 50 tons of storesevery three days.The War Cabinets-agreed that this diversion from offensive to defensive action was not justified.Great George&apos;Street3...SeW,.lo.?-2-

(43) 52nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 4.fionfiriential Anney.(24th April, 1942, 12 Noon.)r.s *s .r o&apos;reviousdeference:?.M.(42) 44thConclusions,Minute 4.)THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet partof telegram No. 139 from the President, dated 22nd April,reporting that he had received   a cordial message fromM. Stalin, who was sending M.&apos;Molotov and a General to visit him (the President).   The President had suggestedthat they should visit the United States before coming to England, and asking whether we agreed about this.The Prime Minister then referred to telegram No.540from Kuibyshev, dated 22nd April,  containing a personal message from M. Stalin to himself, saying   that he proposedto send M. Molotov to London in order to dispose of allthe matters which stood in the way of the signing of theAgreements.   It was clear that he intended that M.Molotovshould visit this country before going to America.The Prime Minister said that it was important toensure that we so handled matters as to avoid givingoffence either to the United States or to Russia.   Hethought   that the   right line would be to say to theU.S.A. that as M. Stalin was proposing to send M. Molotovto visit us, we could not refuse;   but that it was important that M. Molotov should go to the United Statesbefore any irrevocable decisions had been taken here.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY and THE LORD PRIVY SEALthought that we might bring the negotiations for theproposed Treaty up to the point at which substantial agreement had been reached, without, however, actuallysigning the text.In putting the matter to M. Stalin, all that we need say&apos;^at the moment was that we would be glad to receiveM. Molotov.The War Cabinet agreed with the course proposed, and the Foreign secretary undertook to draft telegrams for thePrime Minister to send to president roosevelt and M. Stalin. ,Great George Street, S.W.I.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested thai special care may betaken toensure the secrecy of this document.
