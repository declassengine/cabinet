MOST SECRET,COPY HO,StW,M,(43)64TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2,Confidential Annex.(18th May, 1942 - 5.30 p.m.)TLIESRUSSIA.eviousftferanee:M.(42)61stfcnclusions,iLnute l) oTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the Chiefs of Staff had raised.the question whether the next convoy to Russia shouldsail, iii view of the substantially increased risk of air attack from NorwayoWith the ice barrier in its present position the convoy must sail for 6-7 days within range of enemy bombersbased in Norway0     The Germans had about, 100 bombers in this area, of which 69 were long-range bombers;    and they had avery good system of air reconnaissanceo     The scale and duration of the air attack on the next two convoys, was likely to be greater than any yet experieneedo     The. Chiefsof Staff feared that, unless the weather conditions were particularly unfavourable for air operations, it was likely that our losses would be considerable^..In addition to the loss of merchant vessels, wehad also to take into account the risks to which theescorting vessels would be subjected.In these circumstances the question arose whether itwould be expedient to cancel the convoys due to sail inMay and June, and increase the size of the convoys sailingafter the beginning of July, when it would be possible totake a more northerly route which, for the greater part ofthe voyage, would lie outside the range of Ju.87&apos;s andJUo 88&apos;s.The main points raised in discussion were:-(a) If the May and June convoys were cancelled,how far would it be possible to make up the deficit by increasing the quantity -of suppliessent thereafter.After the beginning of July the admiralty would be prepared to take the risk ofincreasing the size of the convoy to 50 shipscBut, if no convoys sailed until July, the congestion of shipping destined for Russia wouldbe very large.     And, if the supplies which hadbeen dammed . up were released too rapidly, agreat strain would be thrown- on the port facilities in Russia.(b) It was recognised that the Navy would be relieved of a heavy responsibility, and asubstantial risk, if these sailings could be deferred until after the end of June.     On theB  other hand, it would not be easy to convinceeither Premier Stalin or President Rooseveltthat it was right to interrupt the flow ofsupplies to Russia.It is requested that s^Zi^ZT&quot;- T&quot;

(c) It was suggested that the position shouldbe explained to-Premier Stalin, who might beasked to say whether he was in such immediate &apos;need of these supplies that he would wish anattempt made to get through the May. and Juneconvoys during those months, even though, say,half  the amounts shipped might well be lost en route,  rather than to face postponement until July,when conditions would be easier.In reply to this suggestion, it was pointedout that the decision was one which we must    .take ourselves, and ought riot to place on othershoulders.     In any event, Premier Stalin was/almost certain, &quot;if the.point was put to him,to reply that an attempt should be made to force through these supplies, at whatever cost.(d) The Prime Minister expressed the view that itwas our duty to fight these convoys through,-   whatever the cost.     The Russians were.engaged   .in a life and death struggle against our common-enemy.     There :was little we could do to help them, except by maintaining the flow of suppliesby this northern route.     In the last convoy,&quot;22 out of 25 ships had got through, in spite ofour apprehensions:    and this time we mightagain do better than we feared.The effect on war comradeship between theUnited Nations, of cancellation of the MayConvoy would, he feared, be very serious.(e) It was not thought that any appreciable advantage would be gained by confining the convoy tofaster vessels.     On the whole the First sea lord thought that if the convoy was to sail,we might as well send 35 ships.The War Cabinet decided as follows:-(l) The May convoy-, due to leave that night, shouldsail as arranged,(2) Premier Stalin should be informed that we had given orders for this convoy to sail, notwith-standing the additional risk to which it wouldbe subjects .   He should be strongly urged tosend heavy bombers to attack the aerodromes in .Norway from which the German aircraft were operating, and warned that it might be necessaryto cancel the sailing of the June convoys(3) The question whether the June convoy should sailshould be decided by the War Cabinet in the lightof the losses sustained by the May convoy,(4) The Chiefs of Staff were asked to prepare adraft telegram, covering the points set out in(2) for the, Prime Minister to send to premier stalin,Great George -Street ,S.W.1*
