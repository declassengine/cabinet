MOST SECRET.O BE KEPJJJNDERJ^ ND KEy!t &apos;ZZltd that ?P8Cial CRre may be **** tooneure the secrecy of this documentW.M.(42)  59th CONCLUSIONS *Confidential Annex9(8th May,  194*3, 3.0 p0m0)COPY NO,yUTUREOPERATIONSThe War Cabinet had before them a telegram from the commanders-in-Chief, Mediterranean and Middle East., dated6 th May (No. CO.36), circulated as W.P0 (42)195.In this telegram the Commanders-in-Chief set out thepros and cons for launching an offensive in the western desert during the next three months.     Their argumentswere largely based on a numerical comparison of the armoured forces on both sides and the conclusion which they reached was that an offensive would not be Justified beforethe 15th June... -   THE PRIMS MINISTER read to the Cabinet&quot;an interimreply which he had sent saying that the Commanderf-an- chief^telegram raised grave issues, which were being carefully     * &apos;considered by the Chiefs of Staff, Defence Committee and war Cabinet;    in the meantime, preparations shouldcontinue for an offensive on the date originally contemplated.     A telegram had been ^received in reply fromthe Commander-in-Ghief, Middle East, saying that preparations were proceeding in accordance with previous plans.tot1THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that, the telegram did not deal with two vary important factors^ irsty the bearing which operations in Cyronaica wouldhave on the Malta situation; secondly? the possibilityof German offensive action, which, by&quot;all indicationstake place at the end of May,     It seemed strange that tnoCommander-in-Chief had not taken into account the)ossibilit.v of imgPifcMno- ma -&quot;vie. pXana, by timing his,General Auchinleck1 s) offensive so as to^f-ruotrato the offensive contemplated by General Rommel.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff handed rounda Paper setting out ,the present Orders of Battle in Libyaand the numbers of tanks available to both sides.     Themain point was that,    on the best estimates available,excluding 2o0 Infantry tanks, on the 1st June we shouldhave 566 tanks to 521 of the enemy, whereas on the .15th-June we should have 748 to 590 of the enemy.     The Chiefsof Staff felt that, in view of the opinion expressed by the commanders-in-Chief, it would be wrong to give general auchinleck a direct order to attack on, say, the .15th&apos; MaynAt the. same time, the Chiefs of Staff thought it would be right to tell General Auchinleck that his attack shouldbe carried out in such a way as to provide, the maximum &apos;support for the convoy to Malta.. in the June dark periods&apos;&apos;The Chiefs of Staff favoured putting thewe views toGeneral Auchinleck and seeing whether he agreed with themo

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that he had receivedho-recent appreciation from the Middle East of the airposition.     He had telegraphed a request for such an appreciation to be furnished.     He gave particulars of a comparison drawn up by the Air Staff in this country, ofour forces in the Middle East, with the enemy forces in north Africa, Crete, the Dodecanese and Greece, but excluding SicilyThe position was&apos;as followsj^-at,line atrengthnEnemy Forces.

In this connection great importance was attached to the position at Malta.The following particular points were made in discussion&apos;(l) THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that- the crucial part ofthe telegram was paragraph 90   General Auchihleck,    feared the effect on the defence of the Delta .of 1&apos;        an unsuccessful offensive,.     Ho was also, nervousof being called on to defend Syria or thoNorthern Frontier while attacking in tho WesternDosort*     Ho-therefore wanted to soe,f, some thingapproaching a certainty of success bofore he- attacked, and was anxious that the risks of a,   partial success or failure- should be appreciatedhereo&apos;.  . &apos; ,;&quot;::;;*:- : -

-        (2) THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs thought thai: it would pay us to attack as-   soon as practicable.(3) &apos;.CHE MINISTER OF. PRODUCTION pointed out, the great value which would accrue from the capture of theMartuba aerodrome from the point of view of theJvxiq convoy to Malta.     This pointed to an offensive at the very beginning of June.     THEPRIME MINISTER said that the disadvantage ofthis date was that 12,000 Germans were due toarrive in Libya by tho beginning of June,(4) THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that, looking at the situation from the Naval point of view,- itappeared that the enemy was intensifying the.    investment of Malta, in order to prevent inter-ference with the despatch of reinforcements toLibya-     Taking a long view It seemed, therefore,that delay would make our ultimate task moredifficulto        &apos; -(5) THE&quot;MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEthought that the enemy might intend a simultaneousattack in Libya and Russia^, and drew attention t-rthe advantages of anticipating the enemy attack,1 (6) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR thought that thereal purpose behind the telegram of 6th May   wasthat General Auchinleck wanted to be sure whether he was taking the military responsibility of advising that an offensive should be undertaken on a given date, with good chances of success./- If the War Cabinet decided to take theresponsibility of saying that an attack ought tobe carried out before the date now suggested,he thought that General Auchinleck would be willing to fall in with this suggestion,(7) THE SECRETARY OF SME FOR AIR was in favour ofan attack being launched before- the June darkperiod, in order to give us a chance of obtainingpossession of vital aerodromes.     The choice ofthe actual date should, however, be left to theCommander-in-Chiefs. THE PRIME MINISTER said that battles were not won byarithmetical calculations of the strength of the opposingforces.     From this point of view, the telegram of 6thMay was somewhat disappointing and difficult to understand,more particularly since it included no mention of the veryserious consequences if we&apos; failed to relieve Malta.     the commanders-vin-Chief must, however, have had the Maltasituation in mind, and the. explanation might be that the telegram had been deliberately confined to an account ofthe strength of the opposing armoured forces, in order to concentrate attention on the. stark facts of the position,In conclusion, the Prime Minister said that he thought the dates discussed, namely   the 15th May and the 15th June,had no particular significance except in relation to the malta convoys.     He thought that a telegram should be taxix,to the effect that the War Cabinet were of opinion.that anattack ought to take place;in the latter half of May.    The

telegram should not give General Auchinleck a positiveorder, but should make it clear that the War Cabinet wereprepared to assume full responsibility for the consequencesif an attack took place and was not successful..     Theimportance of a successful .offensive from the point of viewof relieving Malta should be mentioned.-, .The War Cabinet agreed with the Prime Minister1 view of the action to be takenVTHE CHIEF OP TIG, IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF agreed, butsuggested that the telegram should also give general auchinleck the opportunity, if he so desired,    of taking advantage of a German offensive in oar?y June to launch a counterstrokeoThe War Cabinet agreed with these views, A telegram was thereupon drafted by the Prime Minister to give effectto the decision reached and was approvedo/See&apos; telegram No, OZ 175 from Prime Minister to Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, 805*42^--cUXo-gL^mGreat George Street, S.W.l0
