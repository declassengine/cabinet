Tho Committee believed that, ifthe co-operation and goodwill of both sides of theindustry could be secured,this scheme of re-organisation should arrest the decline in outputof coal per man-shift worked and, in addition,should give some net increase in outputoThe Lord President&apos;s Committee had reviewed the coal production programme for 1942/43 in thelight of these proposals for tho re-organisation, ofthe industry and of the progress made in securingthe release of ox^niner-s from the Fighting Services,Civil Defence and industry under the decisionsalready reached by the War Cabinet on the 10th April(W.M.(42) 46th Conclusions.

thought it would be unnecessary to introduce at thisstage the scheme for rationing domestic&quot;fuclQ   wc should^,however, be ready to introduce this scheme at short,notice, if it became necessary to do so, and alladministrative preparations should therefore bo made forthe introduction of the scheme outlined in&apos;W*P.(42) 225QThe forms should be issued, and the assessments made.?and a strong appeal should also be made for voluntaryeconomy in the domestic consumption of all forms of fuel0The position should be kept under review in the lightof the coal output actually securedcTHE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE agreed that,if the proposed scheme of re-organisation could be putinto operation quickly with the goodwill of tho industrybehind it, it was justifiable to accept the risks involvedin postponing the introduction of fuel rationing.   Ho had reached this conclusion with some reluctance, and he believed that the risks involved were substantial   Moroovo:he felt bound to inform the War Cabinet that it would bemuch more difficult to introduce fuel rationing at alater stage, when some householders would already have laid in stocks against the winter.As regards the form which rationing should take,he had held numerous consultations since the question hadbeen debated in Parliament and had come to the conclusionthat there would be very great difficulty in operatingany scheme which did not involve the surrender of couponsoProm,conferences which had been held with the Local FuelOverseers, it was clear that the alternative schemes whichhad been, suggested would be less fair to consumers,, wouldinvolve more administrative staff, and would be lesscertain to achieve the necessary economy of fuelo   Thepoints scheme originally proposed had been simplifiedPand modified in certain respects.    In particular,provision had been made for an overriding limit by which,if a householder satisfies the Local Fuel Overseer thathis previous fuel consumption has not been unduly high;,it will not be reduced by more than 33^%oThe details of the amended scheme were outli&quot;in w.p ,(42) 225.     The scheme had been brought beforethe Lord President&apos;s Committee, in accordance with therequest made by the War Cabinet at their meeting onthe 12th May (W,M.(42) 62nd Conclusions);   and theCommittee had agreed unanimously that, if domestic fuelhad to be rationed, this scheme was the best, and indeed the only practicable   scheme so far devised for that .purpose.In discussion, the following points wereraiseds-(a)   Every effort must be made to close the gap between intake into, and wastage from thecoal-mining industry.   The entry of boysinto the industry was being considered bythe Porster Committee, whose report was expected by the end of June.   Some reductionin the wastage of middle-aged men might besecured by the establishment of a MedicalConsultative Service for the industry, on

the, lines suggested in-paragraph 8, ofWoP;,(42) 224*   Apart from helping to retainmen in The mines, such a scheme would alsoho valuable from the point of view ofconserving the nation&apos;s man-power generally;for., even in cases where a man was not fit for continued work in the mine, earlyromedial treatment could often fit him forother industrial employment.The- scheme of re-organisation did not deal withthe question of wages,,    The men&apos;s representatives were at present discussing with the owners a claim for a national minimum wage of  4.5.0 aweek and an increase in rates per shift.   Theowners would no doubt invite the views of theGovernment on this application.   While it was undesirable to disturb   the ascertainmentprocedure, which was of long standing, it mustbo borne in mind that there was a new featurein the situation today, namely that the state had stepped in to prevent men leaving the pits for better paid work elsewhere.    This mightafford justification for some supplementaryallowance os* payment outside the ascertainmentprocedure, the cost of which would not fall onthe industry, but might have to be borne by theExchequer.There was something to be said for settlingquickly the question of a national minimum wage, and leaving the rest of the claim for detailed negotiation in the hope of relatingthis part of the a/rard to increased output,whether in the form of an output bonus orotherwise.The proposed White Paper would not deal withthe financial implications of the re-organisationsoixeme..-     m the statement in Parliament, howeverit could be said that these questions, includingwages questions, would be the subject of consultation with both sides of the industry.The Lord Presidents report contemplated that thenew scheme of,Government control would continueponding a final decision by Parliament on thefuture organisation of the industry.   It was important, from the point of view of restoringa good spirit in the industry,- that theGovernment should show their determination thatthe industry should not be let down after thewar.   This was merely a plan;, for the wartimecontrol of the industry;   the long-term futureof the industry would continue to be studiedas part of the problems of post-war reconstruction,.The War Cabinet gave general approval to therecommendations in the two Memoranda,submitted by the Lord President and inparticular(a) Approved the coal production programme for 1942/43 as outlined in W.P.(42) 226.

(b) Approved the proposals for the re-organisation of the coal-miningindustry set out in WaP0(42) 224,,(c) decided that it was unnecessary atthis stage to ration the domestic consumption of fuels   but agreedthat, if i-u subsequently became necessary go do so? domestic fuelshould be rationed by the pointsscheme outlined in W.P.(42) 225o(d) Agreed that all administrativepreparations should be made, includingthe issue of forms and the making ofassessments, so that the rationing scheme could be introduced at short notice c.(o)   decided that there should be an appealto the public to practice the maximumvoluntary e conomy in the domestic consumption of all forms of fueljand asked the President of the Board of&apos; Trade to discuss with the Minister ofInformation measures for securingsustained publicity for this purpose.Ho    The War Cabinet took the following decisions on procedures -(a) Invited the President of the Board ofTrade to circulate, for considerationby the War Cabinet at their meeting onMonday, June fact?&quot;&quot;the draft of aVilhite Paper containing a comprehensive statement of the Government1 s policy for increasing the production andrestricting the consumption of coal.(b) Agreed that the White Paper should be presented to Parliament on Wednesday,June Srdi that the governments proposals should be disclosed to representatives of both sides of theindustry at a meeting to be held earlierthat days    and that arrangements shouldbe made for the White paper to be debated in the House of Commons duringthe following week    The Lord Privy Sealwas invited to discuss with theMinisters concerned the arrangements forGovernment speakers in the debateftGreat George Street, s.Wal0
