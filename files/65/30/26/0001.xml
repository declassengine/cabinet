ftMOST secret to BE *FPT UNDER look AND KEY.It lawquwted that special care may ha taken toansufs the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.PRIME   &apos;MINISTER^1 his visit TOUNITEDSTATES..W.M.(42) 82ND CONCLUSION MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex(27th June, 1942 - 5.30 p.m. )THE PRIME MINISTER gave the War Cabinet a resume ofvisit to the United States.He gave details of the invaluable help which theywere sending to the Middle East.    This comprised 500Sherman tanks, which were an improvement on the general grant tanks, and 100 self-propelled 105 mm. guns.General Auchinleck had expressed his gratification at these reinforcements,which should reach Suez by the endof August.The Americans.had also promised generous help inthe air, and,all being well, we should have over100/Llb-eaaa-toira in the Middle East shortly.    The RANGERwould off-load 62 Kittyhawks of improved performance atTakoradi, and these would be in action within a month.General Auchinleck had accepted the proposal that an american General should be appointed to the Middle east to command the United States forces in that area.The Air agreement had been settled in a mannermore favourable to us than had been expected.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet amemorandum which he and the President had agreed about our strategy in the West for 1942-1943.THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF gave theWar Cabinet an account of his discussion with the combined Chiefs of Staff and his impressions of certainAmerican units   which he had visited.The first few days had been taken up in clearing up certain misunderstandings which had arisen.    general marshall was bent on concentrating on the BOLERO plan.Other very high quarters in Washington were, however,apprehensive that if we concentrated on BOLERO to the exclusion of any other projects, either in 1942 or 1943,there was a danger that,if BOLERO was&apos;not practicable^large bodies of American troops would be locked up inGreat Britain and remain indefinitely inactive.

All were agreed that much would depend on the outcome of the campaign in Russia.    The numbers of american troops which would have arrived in the UnitedKingdom by September would not exceed the strength ofthe forces originally intended for Northern Ireland,General Marshall had at first proposed thedespatch of an American Armoured Division to the middle east,    Later, he had changed his mind; partly on thegrounds that this could only be done at the expense jpfBOLERO shipping, partly because the Division was slotfully trained or completely equipped.The alternative proposal, which was ultimatelyadopted, was for 300 Sherman tanks and 100 self propelled105 m.m. guns which would be manned by our personnel,,-to be sent at once arrving in the Middle East by the endof August,    Their despatch would not upset the shippingprogramme,THE CHIEF   OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFdescribed his visit to certain units.    The turnout ofthe American troops was good and the organisation oftheir training excellent,   A parachute exercise by600 -parachutists, had beeh impressive.    Much attention was paid to physical training, efficiency tests and field firing exercises.In conclusion, Sir Alan Brooke said, that he had established most satisfactory relations with general marshall.Great George Street, S,W. 1*
