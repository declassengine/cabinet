Opinion here would demand actionon our part.Second, was it to our advantage that gas warfareshould start?     So far as the Western Front was concern^ed, it would certainly not be greatly to our disadvant-age, except if we were engaged in operations for landing on the Continent.     But the use of gas by Japanraised a different issue.     We had not the means to afford proper protection against gas to the vastpopulation of India.Third, would a prior declaration on our partthat we should use gas against the Germans,if theyused it against the Russians, prove an effectivedeterrent?     Clearly, if Germany was engaged in makinga heavy gas attack on Russia, we should be able toput a heavier weight of gas on Germany than germany could put on to this country.     But it must also beremembered that if we made a declaration, and gaswarfare ensued, we might be regarded as in somesense responsible for the start of gas warfare.Points made in discussion(1) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that if we made a declaration, theJapanese might say that it was clear we intended to use gas, and themselves use itagainst us.     At the moment there was no power (except Russia, who was not at war with japan) in a position to retaliate effectively with gas against Japan.

(2) It was felt that there was considerable forcein the argument that if we made a declarationthe Germans would try very hard to fix upon us the responsibility for initiating gas warfare,(3) THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFemphasised the serious disadvantages whichwe should suffer if gas warfare had been openedup at a time when we were trying to hold asmall bridgehead on the Continent or to land  ....forces on the beaches,,     While he agreed thata situation might arise in which we had no option but to use gas, he hoped that we., shouldnot be led into using it,, or put ourselves intoa position in which the Russians might be tempted to accuse the Germans of haying used gas againstthr.m;in order to bring our counter-measures intoplayo(4) General agreement was expressed with the viewthat tho disadvantage   of gas warfare to us,in the event of our being engaged in operations on the Continent, was a very potent argument.It might be desirable to put&apos; this to the Russians.But this should not be done until after the WarCabinet as a whole had had an opportunity of considering- the results of the discussions which had taken, place with General Marshalland Mra Hopkins on plans for a resumption ofland operations on the Continent.     A special meeting of the Cabinet should be held for thispurpose early in tne following week.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows(a) A communication should be made to theRussian Government on the lines that, if theywere the object of a heavy gas attack by theGermans? we should retaliate by using gasourselves against the Germans0     Having regard,however, to the position in the Far East, wewere doubtful of the wisdom of making adeclaration now to the effect that we shouldretaliate if the enemy used gas$(b) The Foreign Secretary? in making thiscommunicationP might mention thepoint of the disadvantages to this country of gas warfare if we were engaged in operations for landing on the Continent,,     It was therefore suggested that the proposed communication shouldbe deferred until after the proposals madeby the United States representatives hadbeen discussed by the War Cabinet early in thefollowing weekoireat George Street, S.Wolt-2-
