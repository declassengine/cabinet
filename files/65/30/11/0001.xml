The War Cabinet had before them telegram .No, CC 42 from the Middle East Defence Committeedated 9th May (W,P*(43) 196) replying to the telegram desptaehed after the Meeting of the WarCabinet held on the 8th May.THE PRIME MINISTER thought the telegram of9th May gravely under-estimated the importance of Malta.There were in Malta at the present time the followingtroops:-     Over 27,000 British Army personnel(including 8,900 Maltese) plus 4P500 R,A*F. , i,e, atotal of over 31,500.     In addition there were 112heavy and 139 light A.A. guns and 75 field guns.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF ,reported the views of the Chiefs of Staff,who had considered this telegram at a Meeting earlier in the afternoon.Paragraph 3.   The conclusion to be drawn from this paragraph was that the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East, did not realise the importance of Malta.Thus -(a)    It would be a disaster to sacrifice thegarrison in the fortress.(b) It was only lately, under the pressure of heavy air attack, that Malta had, as itwere, fallen into disrepair and been unableto exercise a strong influence on the enemy*scommunications to North Africa.     With an  .improvement in the situation, Malta mightregain its position.      THE CHIEF OF THE AIRSTAFF said that in the last two days, for theloss of six aircraft and five damaged, thefollowing casualties had been inflicted on theenemy: -18 destroyed.20 probably destroyed26 damaged^(c) Malta was of the utmost importance as areinforcement route.     ^HE CHIEF OF THE AIRSTAFF said that 300 ^aircraft had been flownthrough Malta this year, 163 of them in thelast month.7       *( d)    If Malta was captured, it would be ofconsiderable use to the enemy, both inenabling him to cut our route through theMediterranean, and as an air base to provideair cover for his reinforcements to north africa.It is&apos;requested that specin! care may betaken toensure the secrecy of this uouunont. copY N0-W.M. (43) 60TH CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex,(10th May, 1948 - 6 p.m,)

Paragraph, 4. &quot;   It was true that in the lastoffensive it had been:     weeks before we had reachedBenghazi,,     But if we started an offensive, this initself would provide a diversion which would be ofmaterial help to the June oonvoy to Malta,Paragraph^ 5.     It was true that in the early stages of Rommel&apos;s counter-stroke we had sustainedheavy losses in tanks, and this no doubt was in GeneralAuehinleck1s mind.     But it would seem that he ignoredthe value of our &quot;I&quot; tanks in meeting an enemy offensive,and also the value of the 10th Armoured Division,although this Division was not yet fully trained.     Therewas also the fact that further reinforcements of tanks were on their way out to Egypt.     Generally speaking,the danger to Egypt of unsuccessful attack was,in theChief of Stafffs view, overstressed in this paragraph,just as the value to us of Malta was -under-stressed.Paragraph 6.     The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that the indications of anenemy attack about the end of May, having the limitedobjective of the recapture of Tobruk, were fairly good.Summing up, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that the Chiefs of Staffs view was that,if the enemy were to launch an offensive, we shouldtake advantage of it to launch a counter-offensive.The security of Malta wasivital and&quot;thelatest date at whioh our attack should take place (unless it was launched earlier as a counter-offensive) shouldbe at whatever date was suitable to provide a diversionor distraction which would assjsb the passage of the convoy to Malta in&apos; the June dark period.     We shouldalso aim at capturing Benghazi before the followingconvoy was.passed into Malta.THE CHIEF.OP THE AIR STAFF said that hehad now received an Appreciation of the Air position from the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle East.The figures in this Appreciation were given on a slightly different basis from those which he had given to the War Cabinet on Friday.     It was, however, unnecessary for him to go into detail,as the telegramstated that the Air Officer Commanding*-in-ChiefTs view,taking all things into account, was that his AirForces should be sufficient to provide for an offensive.

mTHE PRIME &quot;MINISTER then invited ministers to express their views.General agreement was expressed by all ministers with the views of the Chiefs of Staff as outlined bythe Chief of the Imperial General. Staff.     Inparticular it was agreed that the supreme importanceof Malta had not been adequately appreciated in GeneralAuchinleck1s telegram, and that a battle should befought to save it.     In this connection, it waspointed out that, apart from the arguments alreadyadvanced, Malta was of great value as a oard of re-entry in the Mediterranean.Several Ministers expressed the view thaton the whole we were unlikely to gain by delayingour attack, and that an attack should be launchedas soon as possible.     /in this connection THE CHIEFOF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF pointed out that onefactor in favour of a further delay which had notbeen mentioned was to afford sufficient time fortraining troops in the new equipment, e.g., Amerioantanks and 6 pounder gunsJ9The conclusion reached by the War cabinet was that a telegram should be sent to general auchinleck, emphasising the vital importance of malta and making it clear that a battle should be  :fought to save the fortress, at a date not later than would provide a distraction, in time to help thepassage of the convoy to Malta in the June dark period.A telegram on these lines was then drafted andche Chiefs of Staff withdrew to consider it.The Chiefs of Staff proposed certain amendments.These were accepted.     The telegram, as so amended,was approved by the War Cabinet,who authorised, itsdespatch.     /Telegram No. OZ 19^6&amp;p^ c^tCo^La^Great George Street, S.W.I. *

Middle EastOZ 192 10/5/42.Following personal and most secret from Prime Ministerto General Auchinleck.Reference Middle East Defence Committee Telegram No. CC/42of 9/5.1. The Chiefs of Staff, the Defence Committee andthe War&quot;Cabinet, have again considered the whole position.We are determined that Malta shall not be allowed, to fallwithout a battle being fought by your whole army for itsretention.    The starving out of this fortress would in-volve the surrender of over 30,000 men, Army and AirForce, together with several hundred guns.     Its possessionwould give the enemy a clear and sure bridge to Africawith all the consequences flawing from that.    Its losswould sever the air route upon which both you and India must depend for a substantial part of your aircraft reinforce-mentSc    Besides this, it would compromise any offensive against Italy and future plans such as ACROBAT and GYMNAST.Compared with the certainty of these disasters, we considerthe risks you have set out to the safety of Egypt are definitely less, and we accept them.2. We. therefore reiterate the views expressed InParagraph 2 of,&apos;our OZ 175 with this qualification - thatthe very latest date for engaging, the enemy which we couldapprove is one which provides a distraction in time to help-the passage of the June dark-period convoy./3,   This
