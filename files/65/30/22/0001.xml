THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that the garrison, of Tobruk was believed to consistof five brigade groups - one Guards&apos; brigade, two SouthAfrican brigades, one Indian brigade and an Army Tankbrigade consisting of 60 tanks, mostly Valentines,     TheGerman claim to have captured 25,000 men in the course ofthe attack which had developed early on Saturday morningmight well be approximately correctsAn appreciation-1&apos; received from General Auchinleckthe previous day credited us with about 110 tanks (exclud-ing those in Tobruk) and the enemy with between 100 and130o     We had a further 174 tanks, most of which were withthe 10th Armoured Division in process of re-equipping, inthe Delta area.In this telegram General Auchinleck had given anestimate of the tank s trength at 1st July in which hecredited us with 381 (excluding the 8th Armoured Division)and the enemy with between 350 and 520 depending on theefficiency of his tank recovery service0     The ships carrying the tanks of the 8th Armoured Division were already beginning to arrive at Suez and it was hoped that^00     Valentines would have been unloaded by the end ofthe week.     The remaining 240 Valentines in this division should all have been unloaded by the 3rd week in July,General Nye then outlined oixr present defensivedispositions and read out General Auchinleck&apos;s report ofthe artillery estimated to be available to the 8th Army.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF than gave the Committeea brief appreciation of the relative air strength.     Theenemy were credited with about 700 serviceable aircraft inthe Eastern Mediterranean area whereas Air Marshal Tedderwas believed to have 550*     Reinforcements of about 380all types would be reaching the Middle East this month anda further 580 all types were due in July, including 60for Malta,The main point dealt v/ith in the discussion wasthe choice between the two courses set out in Paragraph 8of the telegram from the Middle East Defence Committee, namelybetween fighting the enemy on the frontier defences anddelaying the enemy on the frontier while withdrawing themain body of the Eighth Army to the Matruh defences^The following were the main points made in thediscussion on this point:(i) THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE drew attention to the defensive attitude ^shown in the telegrams from the Middle Easto     Wei should not tolerate the suggestion that Rommel and his troops were superior to our own*     The figures givento the Y/ar Cabinet:by General Nye did not confirm the impression that the enemy were in.overwhelmingstrength.     Nevertheless, we now seemed to bewitnessing the defeat of our forces in detail.4 No, .0C/6.5 of 20/6,

He asked whether changes in the higher commandshould not be made. &apos;   He also expressed surprisethat the Sidi Hamra defensive area had not been developed, and that no mention was made of thepossibility of airborne attack from Crete on theflank of our position,(ii) THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION reminded the Cabinetthat when General Auchinleck had been urged twomonths ago to stage an offensive in Cyrenaica,he had constantly affirmed that he was tooweak in armour to do so with any prospect ofsuccesso&apos;    Recent events might well confirm thecorrectness of this view0     The position on thefrontier would not be restored by changes in thehigher commando     Nevertheless, he doubted whether it was the right policy to leave thefrontier to be held by rear guards only,Rommel, fresh from his success at Tobruk, wouldprobably brush aside any weak detachments leftto cover our withdrawalo(iii) MR. BRUCE thought that,if the policy of abandoning the frontier defences was accepted,it was optimistic to imagine that we should beable to hold the Matruh defences.     He thoughtthat big risks should be taken in attempting to defend the frontier positions,(iv) THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff pointed out that orders had already been issued to give effect to the policy of delaying theenemy on the frontier while withdrawing themain body of the Eighth Army to the Matruhdef enccso     In his view this decision was correct, provided that sufficient emphasis was placed on the importance of holding the frontierposition as long as possible.     This decisionhad been taken by the Commanders-in-Chief, inconsultation with the Minister of State, and inpossession of all the relevant factors includingthe condition of their own troops *The country to the South.of our frontierdefensive position was well suited for operations by armoured forces and there was apparentlynothing, except administrative difficulties, to stop Romac^s armoured forces from by-passingour positions^     By withdrawing to Matruh weshould gain the advantage of fighting Rommel&apos;sarmour 125 miles further from their base and ofgaining time in which to assemble more armourfor ourselveso(v) THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY drew attentionto the importance of ensuring that, in the timethus gained for building up our armoured forces,the enemy was,not free to bring reinforcementsacross the Mediterranean^     We had beengrappling with this problem ever since we had lost the power of interrupting the supply routeby the operation of our surface forces, and we ought now to consider whether our long-rangebomber resources in the Mediterranean were adequate for the task or whether we should

divert some of our long-range bombers from their operations in Germany to assist the struggle inLibya0General agreement was expressed with the view thatthe decisions reached by the Commanders-in-Ohief and theMinister of State must bo acceptode     At the same time itwould be right for the War Cabinet to inform the Commanders-in-Chiet  of the importance which, in their view, shouldbe attached to a protracted defence of the frontierposition,&apos; A draft telegram was prepared by the Minister ofProduction and the Vice Chief of the Imperial General staff and was later approved by the War Cabinet with cortainamendments *TIE WAR CABINET then considered what reinforce-ments, now on their way to other overseas theatres, couldbe diverted to the Middle EastoTHE VICE C:.IEP OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that, if a decision were given at once, shipments of tanks consisting of 39 Valentines, 12 Stuarts and 76 grants or Lees, most of which were intended for India, co\ild be diverted to reach Suez between 1st - 15th July.     adecision regarding subsequent shipments could be deferred for a few days.     The ships containing those tanks alsocarried a number of vehicles, some tank transporters and alarge quantity of ammunition but no artillery of any kind.Experience had shown that it took some 3 weeks after un-loading for tank reinforcements to pass through workshop and reach the hands of the troops.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR ST.FF said that the shipscontaining the tanks carried some 24 Hurricanes which were intended for India but could be off-loaded in the middle east,     There wore a further 150 aircraft on their way out to India which could be diverted in due course, but adecision need not be taken at present.The possibility of getting more heavy bomber aircraft from America was being taken up with the UnitedStates authorities.     There were atpresent 170 Wellingtons(categories A and B) in the Middle East and by the middleof July there would be two Halifax Squadrons (32 aircraft)and 40 - 50 Liberators,,     A limit was imposed on the numberof Halifax aircraft which could operate in the Middle Eastby the rate at which these aircraft could be tropicalisedand by the fact that ground equipment and spares for only two sauadrons would be available in the Middle East,A steady flow of Wellingtons was being maintained from thiscountry and could only be increased at the expense of other types.     Priority at present was given to Beaufighters andBeauforts which were required for operations in connectionwith the next Malta convoy.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that hehad already sent a telegram to the commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, on the operation of submarines in theCentral Mediterranean, and a copy of this telegram had been repeated to G-emeral Ismay for the information of the PrimeMinister,     It was very doubtful whether we should be ableto get the use of American submarines in this area and theonly way of providing more of our own would be to take themoff the task of protecting the Russian convoys,THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE saidthat every effort ought to be concentrated on &quot;knockingout the German Army in Libya,     He would like the Chiefsof Staff to consider what could be done by way of a specialeffort to provide reinforcements for our forces in Egypt*The War Cabinet:-(a) Approved the terms of the directive tothe Minister of State and the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East, and instructed the Secretary to arrange for its despatch,and for it to be repeated to the PrimeMinister:(b)&apos; Agreed that the 127 tanks which could -roach Suez between 1st - 15th July and the24 Hurricanes carried in these ships, shouldbo diverted to the Middle East,     The Chiefsof Staff should arrange for this diversion tobe effected and should inform the Commanders-in-Chief concerned,(c) Invited the Vice Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to consider what reinforcements in anti-aircraft guns should be sent   ordiverted to the Middle EasWGreat George Street, S.W.1,

1. Enemy attacked S.E. face Tobruk perimeter early morning after air bombardment and penetrated defences With 60 to 70 tanks and infantry. Our infantry and tanks counter attacked and destroyed some enemy tanks but by evening all our tanks reported knocked out and half our guns lost while enemy was said to be shelling P.0.L. dump. At dusk 2 S.A.Div. H.Q. reported being encircled while infantry on perimeter were still fighting on.

2. Ritchie states Major General Klopper commanding troops in Tobruk last night asked authority fight his way out feeling apparently he could not (repeat not) hold out. Ritchie agreed and says he hopes to keep open corridor between El Adem and Harmat and enable garrison to escape via Medauuar and Knightsbridge to Maddalena.   Do not (repeat not) know how he proposes to do this and consider chances success doubtful though 7 Armd. Div. with Motorised Bdes. can probably help.

3. Enemy Coln. 30 tanks with Arty. and M.T. moved East on Sidi Azeiz in morning but did not (repeat not) pursue its advance apparently. Small parties enemy Capuzzo area in front of Salum  defended locality. 7 Motor Bde. moved north rapidly as possible to harass rear of enemy attacking Tobruk. No details but enemy bombers attacked our troops west of Bir El Gubi.

4. Ritchie has submitted appreciation gist being that owing lack armoured forces to act as mobile reserve on existence of which a scheme of defence is based he doubts his ability to hold Salum Hamra positions and urges withdrawal to Matruh while holding frontier as delaying position. His object is to gain time to rebuild our armoured force by putting more distance between him and enemy. Weakness of argument is that present weakness of our armoured force affects ability to hold Matruh position to even greater extent than it does Salum position as no defences exist to south of Matruh. Decision affects all three services and matter is being urgently examined. Defence Committee meets in hours time.

5. Realise that this sudden and unexpected enemy success at Tobruk looks like being a major defeat consequences of which will be most grave. Naturally I accept full responsibility for this lamentable occurrence.

MS/20 21.6.42

Following Personal and Most Secret for Prime Minister from Minister of State.

You will receive a telegram almost at once from the Middle East Defence Committee telling you the grave news that Tobruk has virtually fallen, and that it is proposed to fight as strong a delaying action as possible on the positions on the Egyptian border in the vicinity of Sollum, but that the Commanders-in-Chief believe that the main stand cannot be made elsewhere than at Matruh,125 miles east of the Egyptian-Libyan border, for reasons that are given in Defence Committee telegram.

On the assumption that you are still in Washington, I hasten to telegraph to suggest very strongly to you that the tragic events of this last week (in the Western Desert and as regards the attempts to reprovision Malta) emphasise the fact that the forces at our command in this theatre are inadequate to enable us to cope with the enemy.

In addition to land and air reinforcements that are on their way to us, there are only two directions in which we can be reinforced rapidly:-

(1) By the flight delivery of heavy bombing aircraft from the United States, and

(2) By the despatch of either British or American submarines to Gibraltar.

I need not go into details at this moment as to how these two types of reinforcement would be used, other than to say that I have discussed the matter with the C-in-C Mediterranean and with the A.O.C-in-C, and that such reinforcements would be very greatly welcomed as rapidly as possible and that they would return large dividends.

For Prime Minister. Most Secret and Personal for Minister of Defence and Defence Committee from Middle East Defence Committee.

Following is our apreciation and action taken consequent on impending fall of Tobruk.

Para. 1 Situation. Tobruk is still fighting but must fall soon. We have hopes that bulk of stores there have been destroyed. Enemy now stronger than we are in all types of troops essential for battle in open country and is well provided with transport. Strength of our troops in western Desert now equivalent to three and two thirds Inf. Divs. weak in Artillery. 3 Armoured Regiments of which 2 are only partially trained and the third is composition of 2 Motor Bdes and some Armoured Car Regiments. New Zealand Div. now beginning to arrive Matruh. Above force is not suitably composed for campaign of manoeuvre. This situation is offset to some extent by relatively favourable position we have established in the air.

Para. 2. Frontier Defences. Frontier position is designed for active defence, with infantry holding defended localities at Salum and at Hamra and a strong Armoured force in reserve to strike the enemy should he attempt to penetrate or outflank the position. Without this armoured reserve the infantry localities can be isolated and dealt with in detail. Hence with our present forces we cannot hope to hold this position for long if it is seriously attacked.

Para. 3. Rear Positions. East of the Frontier Defences no natural or artificial obstacles exist on which a satisfactory defensive position can be based, until the vicinity of Matruh. The Matruh Fortress is a small defended area lacking in depth and designed to be hold by an Inf. Div. To the south of this Fortress is the Sidi Hamra defensive area

which though planned has not yet been developed.      Betweenare extensive Minefields not covered by the defended local-itiesc      Here again the design was that the gap between these defended localities and also the southern flank atHam pa should be covered by an Armoured reserve.      Failingan adequate reserve for both these tasks the minefieldsbetween defended localities can be covered by Inf. if theseare available.      Work on defences being pushed forwardrapidly.Para. 4.    Water.      There is little water betweenBardia and Matruh and the Bardia pumps have been destroyed,This would be delaying factor for the enemy unless he hasample water carrying facilities. &apos;Para. 5,   Time and Space.    By 22nd June enemy mainforces may be in contact with Frontier defences.      FromtheFrontier to Matruh is 120 miles equivalent to distance hehad already covered to the Frontier.   This distanceshould increase his administrative difficulties and compeldelay particularly if petrol at Tobruk has been destroyed.It should enable our Air Forces to take effectivedelaying action, &apos;  Extent of such action will howeverdepend on the degree to which we are able to retain useof forward landing grounds,Para. 6.   Air.     If we fall back to Matruh enemy comesin single engine fighter range of parts of the deltaincluding fleet base at Alexandria.    Scale of air attackon Benghazi will be greatly reduced.     Hence we ought to stay forward as long &quot;as possible,,Para. 7.    Enemy is likely -to follow up his successrapidly encouraged by speedy capture of Tobruk.    Webelieve he thinks us weak which will further encouragehim.     He is therefore likely to attack Salum defences,at the same time pushing his armour and artillery round to secure escarpment in the gap between Harnra and Salum.This should have the effect of isolating Salum.Para. 8. . Courses open to us.- First? to fight the enemy on the frontierdefences. Without adequate armoured ibrcoc this entailsrisking the loss of all our infantry holding tho - r-onbiw-position. &apos; --   Second course to delay the enemy on&apos; . .- ..       &apos;   /the frontier

/enemy onthe frontier with-forces which are kept fully mobilewhile;withdrawing main body of Eighth Army to theMatriih defences.     This coupled with delaying action by our Air Forces gives us best chance of gaining timein which to reorganise and build up-a striking force with which to resume the offensive.P&amp;ra 9.     After a most thorough appreciation bythe Combined Staffs and the most careful considerationby the Defence Committee we have decided on the second course in para. 8 above- and orders as follows havealready been issued.(a) Rapid development of the Matruh positionincluding the southern portion of it with all available means.(b) Move of. all installations and storesto the east of Matruh.(c) Preparation of demolitions in thefrontier- area.(d) Holding of the frontier position aslong as possible by fully mobileforces strong in artillery.     orders to these forces will be to impose .maximum delay on tho enemy should hetry to advance eastwards, and to secureall forward landing grounds and aerodromes west of Matruh for as longas possible&quot;.(e) Maximum delaying action by our Air .Forces.(f) Occupation of Matruh defences byN.Z. Div, and 10 Armd. Div. asrallying point for Eighth Army fallingback.&apos; (g) Rapid organisation of strongest possiblestriking force with a view to destroying the enemy when he is fully extended and as soon as possible. . .Para 10*.   General implication-of withdrawal toMorsa Matruh position as follows.\ /Para 11.

/as follows.Para 11.     Scald of air attack on main base, indelta and on Suez a;nd canal zone considerably increased,Daylight bomber attacks with&apos; fighter escorts in^Alexandria area become a possibility.    Targets which enemy may attack and which will require&apos; increased scale of air defence are(a) Alexandria, Harbour in particular- &apos; IMS Queen Elizabeth which is in our only large dock.(b) Shipping in the Rod Sea, Suez and the canal and between Port Said and alexandria.(c) Ports and internal communications.Army and RAF base installation;aerodromes, etc.(d) Larger Egyptian towns.Para. 12.    Withdrawal of our air bases eastwardsrestricts ability of our air recce and striking forces to operate into Central Mediterranean or againstenemy1s North African ports and to give protection toour naval forces and shipping in the same area.Implications are as follows(a) Impossible now to run a convoy to malta from the East.(b) Enemy naval forces have greater&apos;freedom of action and can operatefurther into Eastern Mod.(c) Enemy can supply North Africa more easily.   .(d) Movement&apos;of single engine fightersbetween Malta and Egypt will be restricted and may.become impossible. ;. Para 13.     Political Effect.   Withdrawal may giverise to internal difficulties in Egypt and may changeTurkey*s attitude towards us.Para 14.     Proximity of. enemy forces to our mainbases will make.it difficult to release forces to any appreciable scale for Northern Front or -other pants of-Middle East if threatened.T.0.0. 1515Z/21
