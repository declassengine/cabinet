MINUTE kConfidential Annex(7th March, 19hh - 6,30 p0m5)WASHINGTON.- JOINT LIAISONPUBLICITYCOMMITTEE.The War Cabinet had a discussion aboutthe Joint Liaison Publicity Committee.     Theywere informed that about a year ago the then-Financial Secretary to the Treasury(Captain. Crookshank) had visited America toexamine the staffing of British government establishments, and to find ways and means of reducing them.     He had reported in favour of.the abolition of this Committee,The question Of the committee&apos;continuancehad then been the subject of discussion&quot;betweenthe Service Ministers and the Chancellor of theExchequer, and the latter had accepted the strongly expressed views of the Secretary of State for Warand the Secretary of State for Air that in their considered judgment the Committee should continue.The post of Chairman of the Committee hadbeen vacant throughout the greater part of 13k3?but had been filled, in December, I9U3? by theappointment of Air Vice Marshal MacNeece Foster.Early in February, 19kk, in the early stages of the Anzio landing, Air Vice MarshalMacNeece Foster had given an off-the-record talkto the Press.     Contrary to the terms on whichthe talk had been given, extracts from it hadbeen given wide publicity in the Press as madeon the authority of a &quot;high British source&quot;.     ThePrime Minister, whose attention had been drawn tothese statements, had taken, strong exception tothem, and had urged that statements of this kind should not be made without express Ministerialauthority.      He had asked that the Committee shouldbe suppressed.Theof State for War and Airhad urged that the Committee should continue, andthe matter had accordingly been brought before theWar Cabinet.In the ensuing discussion, THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR WAR and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIRgave their reasons for favouring the continuance

of the Committee.     In their view it was an advantage to have this Committee in Washington,the Minister of Information1s office heing mainlycentred in Hew York.     They maintained, moreover,that the Committee had done much valuable work,more particularly by establishing close relationswith the American Services and by getting themto pass information about the British Services tothe American Press.On the other hand, objection was seen toa Committee which handled publicity matter,operating under the aegis of the Joint StaffMission, independently of the Ministry ofInformation.The War Cabinet supported the PrimeMinister&apos;s view that it was undesirable that the Joint Liaison PublicityCommittee Washington should continueto operate under the aegis of theJoint Staff Mission, the Heaq, of whichwjas responsible to him as Minister ofDefence.The War Cabinet also took the view thatany organisation in the U.S.A. dealingwith Service publicity should besubject to&apos; the control of the Ministerof Information.The War Cabinet accordingly invited thethree Service Ministers to discuss withthe Minister of Information what arrangements should be made to carryon the -work, hitherto done by theJoint Liaison Publicity Committee&apos;,under the control of the Minister ofInformation.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.
