THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. * *It is issued for the personal use of..........^faaU&amp;VUj..........RiOST SECRET.Copy No....!.^.t.U.(lih) 2U.TR conclusions. minute confidential Annex(23rd February, 19kU - 6.0 p.m.)discussionsunderarticle vii(previous reference:W.M.(hk)l8thConclusions,Minute tf.)At their meeting on the 11th February, the WarCabinet had appointed a Committee to determine, in thelight of the discussion in the War Cabinet, the attitude tobe taken by U.K. officials in the forthcoming discussions with official representatives of the Dominions and India.The War Cabinet now had before them a report bythis Committee (W.P.(kk)l21)e     This document contained a report from the majority of the Committee, to which was appended draft instructions to the U.K. officials on particular issues, and a minority report signed by theLord Privy Seal.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theReport of the Committee, over which he had presided,raised throe major issues.     The first was the proposed international Monetary Fund:    the second was imperial preference, and the third Agricultural Policy.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER and THE lord privy SEAL gave their views on these three issues.     Ageneral discussion followed, which is recorded under thethree main heads referred to.lhtermtionalMonetaryFund.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thefirst question was whether we should go ahead with theproposed International Monetary Fund subject to&apos; modifications of the scheme on certain points, or whether we should takethe line recommended by the Bank of England, namely tobreak off the present discussions and make a fresh starton new lines.He had no doubt that the right course was to go ahead -with the plan which had emerged from the washington disscusions for an International Monetary Fund.     He would,however, make a continuance of the main features of the sterling area (so far as these were consistent with theproposed Fund) the main object of our policy in this field.He also attached importance to not committing ourselves toaccept tho International Monetary scheme, until we had sufficient assurances to satisfy us that we could see our way.through the Financial difficulties of the transition period.THE.LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he shared the viewsadvanced by the representatives of the Bank of England who*9 had attended the meeting of the Committee on external economic Policy.     Like those representatives, he objected to the.International Monetary Fund, because in his view itrestored the gold,!standard in the form of a &quot;gold fund&quot;.In his view, the sterling area was a part of our economic

Empire, and the sterling area would be endangered if wehad to -accept, the conditions of a gold fund.     Furthermore,if we joined the proposed fund, any of the Dominionsmight have to set up exchange control, in respect of transactions between that Dominion and this country.This would be fatal to the continuance of the sterling area,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had great sympathy with the views   expressed   to   theCommittee by the representatives of the Bank of England,Mr. Catterns   and Mr. Cobbold.     While they had greatexperience in currency and banking matters, they had, ofcourse, less experience of wider political considerations. &apos;The plan which they advocated was in essence based on thehope that it v/ould be possible for us to avoid any considerable dependence- in currency matters on &quot;the United Statesafter the war.      It was their intention that sterlingshould be made to stand on its own legs, without outsidehelp.     We should, of course, have to tell the countriesv/hich formed the sterling area   that   it   was   our intention that we should get on without help from outside.This could only mean a regime of great austerity andrestrictions.     He thought there was, in fact, no likelihood-hood of getting the other countries in. the sterling area to adopt this plan if we ourselves rejected the proposed international Monetary Fund   and., took the initiative of putting forward a plan on the lines contemplated,bythe Bank.      If, however, the U.S.  authorities were to turn down the proposed International Monetary Fund, andwe were thrown back on our o?m- resources, then theposition might be different.     Even so, however, it was clear that the Bank of England&apos;s plan to make sterlingself-sufficient would involve great austerity andrestrictions.     He thought that the Bank of England were,very naturally, anxious to postpone as long as possiblehaving to admit that the sterling area could not supportits own economy without help from the United States.Sooner or later, however, in the difficult years afterthe war, we should have to face up to this position and get accommodation from the United Stat.es.      This, moreover,would have to be on a scale far beyond that provided inthe rules of the proposed International Monetary Fund.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that under the proposed international Monetary Fund the maximum help which wecould get was  325 millions.     For this we were to be askedto sell out completely to the United States.      He was surean alternative plan could be devised on the basis of the sterling bloc.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he agreedthat  325 millions would not be enough- to get us throughthe transitional period.      The provision for the transitional period was, however, a matter to be dealt with as a .separate issue from the main scheme for the international monetary Fund&apos;. /The next point discussed was whether it was true to say that the International Monetary Fund was a goldfund, or that its effect would be to tie sterling to gold.THE LORD PRIVY SHiJj said that great importancemust be attached to the views of the representatives of theBant; of England that the &quot;Fund is basically a gold fund. &quot;As&quot;1 against this, it was pointed out that one of -the objections which the Bank of England representatives sawto the scheme was that &quot;the Fund would like dollars and

other gold-convertible currencies, but would look askanceat sterling&quot;.      It could not, therefore, be said that,under the Fund, sterling would be tied to gold.      On theother hand, the Bank, under their alternative scheme,contemplated that a   fixed Sterling dollar rate of fourdoll       to the   should be established.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that itwould be entirely untrue to say that the international monetary Fund contemplated a- restoration of the gold  . -standard.     On the contrary, the primary object of thescheme was to provide for the orderly variation of exchange rates. .   He referred to the various provisions of thescheme providing for variation, and giving power in thelast resort, to leave the Fund.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that,while he did not pretend to expert knowledge of theematters, he shared the views advanced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and by the majority of the Committee.He thought that the course recommended ^oy the Committeeprovided the best means of carrying out the Government&apos;general objective of working for an expansionist policy.In his view, it would be impossible to maintain the -sterling area exactly in the form in which it had existed before the war; and   that to ignore the attitude of theU. S.  in this matter, would lead to disaster.THE MINISTER-OF INFORMATION said that themanagement of currency matters in the sterling area hadbeen very successful.     Prices in the sterling area were much more stable than prices elsewhere, and he thoughtthat sterling would be able to maintain itself againstthe dollar after the war, bearing in mind the inflation and dollar prices.    . In his view, consideration should begiven to an alternative scheme based on the sterling block,THE PAYJ&amp;A3TER GENERAL pointed out some of thedifficulties of maintaining the sterling area after the &apos;war.     Canada, of course, was not a member of the sterling area.     South Africa&apos;s interests were largely concernedwith selling gold, while Australia and New Zealand wouldnot, he thought, be anxious to maintain the sterling area once we had made it clear to India that her sterling balances would have, to blocked.     He thought there wasno chance of maintaining the sterling area after the war,unless we went forward on the lines of the proposed international Monetary Fund.

*    *Imperial THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, on thepreference       issue Of Imperial Preference the members of his Committee,other than Athe Lord Privy Seal, had taken the view thatImperial Preference was an issue which we had recognised ascoming within the area of the discussions under Article VII.This he thought was quite clear from the communicationsexchanged between the Prime Minister and the President inm February, 1942.     There was of course, no commitment to- . whittle down or do&quot; away with Imperial Preference, but wowere committed to discuss the matter with the Americans.THE LORD PRIVY SSLiL said that he regarded theprovisions of the proposed clearing union as closing the.door on Imperial Preference.     \-&apos;o ought to reject theproposed clearing union now.     Imperial Preference, ifsubordinated to the proposed clearing union, would inevitably be abolished.     If any of the Dominions was to reject the proposed clearing union, then, if we had joined the scheme, we should have to impose duties in order toreduce the preference accorded to that Dominion.THE PRIME MINISTER commented that he had alwaysbeen fully conscious of the objections to Imperial,Preference.     In his view the empire was united byother bonds.     He was not himself satisfied that theDominions&apos; would make any great sacrifice to maintainImperial Preference.     3ut the system existed, and a sudden break away from it might impair Imperial solidarity.His own fooling was that there was an obligation cn theUnited States to reduce their own very high tariffs, beforecriticism could be levelled at us because of the existenceof Imperial Preference.     If the United States were tomove in the direction of free trado, or of a very substantial reduction in their tariffs, he did not foolhimself that difficulty w*mld ariso ovor Imperial Preference.But he thought that the wise line to take with the UnitedStates, if and when the time came, would be that it was for them in the first instance to re-assure this country as to their intentions in regard to tariffs.     Speaking for himself, he thought that world free trade would entirelyjustify the abandonment of Imperial Proforonce;    and thatthe loss involved to the Empire in the abandonment of the ottawa.Proferehcos. which were, after all, on a relatively low level, would bo far more than outweighed by thepossibility of the flow of United Kingdom and Empire goods-into the United States that would result from UnitedStates acceptance of world free trade.As regards tactics, the Prime Minister wasaverse from showing our hand until a United States offerhad been made, and he gravely doubted the wisdom of anymovo on our part to suggest that wo were prepared to contemplate a reduction in Imperial Preferences&apos;, so longas a substantial reduction in United States tariffs wasnot in view.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE observedthat tho policy behind the Report was an expansionistpolicy.     All that was now contemplated was.thatpreliminary consideration should be given to whatreductions it would be worth while to make, in return fortho removal of high tariffs and quota restrictions.     TheAustralian Government had recently been considering abi-lateral agreement with the United States -under whichjw wo would abandon   our existing preferences in favour of w Australia   .nC. they would abandon their existing preference for tho United Kingdom, in return for a lower tariff onAustralian goods imported into the United States,      Ithad boon very difficult to. dissuade them from going ahead

at once with this, proposal, &apos; and it had. boon possible to doso only by reminding them that discussions with theDominions had already boon arranged, and suggesting thatthe point ought to bo consider id as a general issue intho first instance,     Canada, too, ho believed^ gruatlyfavoured a general lowering of trado barriers all round,THE GffiiNCSLLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,already in the discussions that morning, the Canadianrepresentatives had made it clear that Canada would bevery ready to abandon Imperial Preference altogether,in return for a 50^ all-round reduction of tariffs,Our line, however, with the Canadian Government would both at in return for this reduction of tariffs, wo wouldbo ready to consider halving the preference.THE LORD PRIVY SK&apos;Ji repeated the very strong objection which he had recorded in his Minority Reportto any proposal that could-bo regarded as injurious to imperial Preference.    The recommendations of the majorityof the Committee suggested that the test of what reductions could be mado in Imperial Preference should bo &quot;worthwhile&quot;, whilo in his strong view that problem should boapproached from tho point of view of what reduction might be necessary.     The United States had, in his view,asked for the substantial elimination of imperial preference     The undertaking embodied in Article VIIthat thoro should bo discussions with a view to-eliminatingtrado barriers was, in his viowj. entirely without pro-judico to tho position of Imperial Preference,   It would,ho thought, bo most dangerous wore the Dominions.to feolthat His Majesty&apos;s Government wore prepared to throwover Imperial Preference.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITYsupported the general instructions on this subject to theUnited Kingdom officials (set out in paragraph 11 of W.P.(44) 121).     He thought, however, that tho word &quot;expedient&quot;might be substituted for the words &quot;worth whilo&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF THE DEP.\department OF OVERSEAS TRi.DEremarked that the tariffs and especially the restrictionsof other countries wore much more important than tho UnitedStates tariffs.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thought that,  ifwo made no move in the direction of considering a reductionof Imperial Proforence, there would be a tondoncy for theAinoricans to concentrate on our refusal to do so, in orderto divert attention from tho maintenance of their owntariffs.THE MINISTER OF STATE pointed out that thesituation was to some extent complicated by tho fact that,in Washington in September last, the possibility had beendiscussed informally with United States officials of aprovision that no tariffs should exceed 25% ad valorem(or the equivalent thoroof), or, alternatively, of anall-round*50;i reduction in tariffs.     Wo had now to consult the Dominions   on   these   suggestions.The United States tariff was, in other words,already in tho field of discussion, and the question was what reduction in tho Unitod States tariffs would justify a roduction in Imperial Preference.. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs thought there was great force in the argument that any suggestion of a reduction in Imperial Preference should beloft alone until a reduction of preferences was proposed bythe   United States, and that wo should then bargain for

tariff reductions.     It was clear, however, that theCanadian attitude was that they would like to take /.e theinitiative in using the possibility of reductions ofImperial Preference to secure a reduction of United Statestariffs.     This was a different proposition..     The .Canadians, he thought, now disliked Imperial Preference and thought it could best be used as a bargaining weapon withthe United States.TIED MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE thought that we ought not to take a definite    lino until - wo saw what theDominions representatives&apos; attitude -was.- THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as regards theformula in paragraph 11 of W.P. (44-) 121, he agreed thatthe word &quot;expedient&quot; was bettor than the words &quot;worthwhile&quot;.     He woixld still prefer, however, that so far aspracticable, we should leave the first move in thismatter to the United States.     He gravely doubted, in fact,whether there was any real likelihood of a substantial reduction in their tariffs.agricultural THE dLJSCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER so id that, in policy the viow of the majority of his Committee, the provisionsof the proposed commercial policy were not inconsistent with the Government1s declared policy of maintaining a healthy and well balanced agriculture after the war.     Thisview had been reached notwithstanding the fact that,under the provisions of the proposed commercial union,we could not maintain quantitative restrictions of importssave when tho balance of our payments was unfavourablo.THE LORD PRTVY 3E..L expressed the view that asatisfactory agricultural policy could not be based onsubsidies, unless a quota was also introduced.THE PRIME MINISTER said that as ho understoodtho matter, under the scheme for a Commercial Union inits present form, we wore fr..e to do the following:-(a) Buy our home agricultural products at fixed prices.?and pay unlimited subsidies thereon.(b) Buy food from abroad in bulk;(c) Impose a tariff of a limited amount on importedfood;     and(d) When the balance of payments was unfavourable,(but only then) impose quotas on food from abroad.He thought that this gave us a sound basis,  so far asagricultural policy was concerned.THE MINISTER CP AGRICULTURE said that he could- , not agree that there was nothing in the proposed schemewhich was inconsistent with our declared agricultural&apos;&apos;policy.     Subsidies provided no.long-term solution for theproblem.   - Our declarations about long-term post-waragracultuxGq policy had been designed to convey that we hoped for.greater stability in the future.     Ho&apos;would be apprehensive that the present scheme would result in a worse position than in the years before the war and that wc should find-        that we Were repeating the mistake of tho Corn Production^ct.     Unanimity among the political Parties on tho

requirements for a planned agricultural policy had been amarked feature of the last couple of years.     Ho felt sure that there could be no sound policy without some measure of quantitative control of imports and, he urged therefore,that alternative policies which would permit of this, &apos;should ho. examined.&apos;    Ho would be in a false positionin, his discussions with the representatives of the.agricultural industry if he was putting forward a policyinconsistent with the scheme which was under discussionwith the Dominions representativessTill; kIKI,..T;a OP LABOUR referred to the Wheat&quot;Ct, and asked whether a scheme of this- type would bobe permissible under the scheme proposed.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that anarrangement of this nature would bo permissible, subjectto the condition that under the clearing union schemewo should not bo allowed to raise the price to thoconsumer mor^ than a certain percentage over the worldprico.     He agreed that this point would nood to be more closely considered.At the end of the discussion the PRIME ministers aid that ho thought that It would bo desirable thatthe War Cabinet should have an opportunity for furtherconsideration of those matters before recording con-elusions,     x^t the&apos; same time, ho thought that thorowould bo no objection to the report of tho Committee,together with the instructions appended thereto, being given to tho U.K. officials who wore taking part in thediscussions with tho Dominion and Indian Representatives,which had now begun, as a general guido to the lines onwhich the discussions should be conducted, provided itwas clearly understood that the report did not carry with it the authority of tho War Cabinet, and thatthose matters would be further discuseod by the WarCabinet in the near future the War Cabinet endorsed this view.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1
