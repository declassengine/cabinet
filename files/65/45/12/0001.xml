Copy No.W.Ma(UU) 18th Conclusions, Minute It-Confidential Annex(11th February, 19kh - 11,1+5 a.m.)ANGLO-AMERICANDISCUSSIONSUNDER ARTICLE VII.(previous reference:W.M. (k3) 173rdConclusions,Minute 1)At their meeting on 21st December,the War Cabinet had invited the Minister ofState to prepare a note focussing for ministerial decision the points arising outof the recent Anglo-American discussionsunder Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement,and asked that the Minister of State shouldbe informed of any points which Ministerswished to raise on the subject.them -The Vifar Cabinet now had before(a) two memoranda by the Minister ofState (W.P.(Li4) 75 and W.P, (hk) 81) focussingissues arising out of the Washingtonconversations and dealing with the points raised by individual Ministers.(b) a memorandum (war.(uu) 82) by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs- re-commending that the Censorship should beasked to arrange with the Press for the avoidance of all reference to the forthcoming discussions with the Dominions and Indiawhether on the monetary or other aspects.^ /(c)^^^ memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal(W.P,(44;95j criticising the outcome of the Anglo-American discussions under ^rticle VII as representing m effect a return to tho gold standard.THE LORD PRESIDENT, who had to leave themooting at tho beginning of the discussion, e^praesedfemoral agreement with tho views of the Minister of state as set out in his two memoranda* -THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that thor^would be advantage in a general discussion of the outstanding issuosj, which might perhaps bo followedby a closor examination, by five or six Ministers,of tho subjact as a whole in tho light ofdiscussion.THE MINISTER OF STATE said that hethought that four main issues emerged, . Thefirst was whether these proposals represented a return to the gold standard.     In his viewthey emphatically did not.     Secondly, werewe being asked to abandon Imperial Preferencewith no compensating advantage?     On this., whilethe Washington proposals involved some modifi-.cation of Imperial preference, we should do this !only in return for very great advantage to our     texport trade.   Thirdly, as to Agricultural Policy;-1 -

he &quot;believed that a healthy and prosperous. agriculture couldbe ensured under these proposals,,     Fourthly, if at this &apos;&quot; &apos;Stage His Majesty&apos;s Government did not proceed with these discussions with the Americans, our action would beincomprehensible to them,,     We had entered into a commitment&quot;under the Mutual Aid Agreement, and the projects that hadbeen put forward for consideration had been put forward by  *His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves in their own interests,. ..&apos;    \   TEE. CHANCELLOR OF&quot;THE EXCHEQUER said that in the     ,currency field, we had&quot; to plan for an&quot; unpredictable future.Moreover,, there were serious differences of view among those best qualified to express an opinion,,     He was satisfied, however, that, so far as concerned plans for post-war normality, the v/ise course was that His Majesty&apos;s-Government, should proceed with discussions on the present proposals (including the currency seneme) and see how faragreement could be reached with the- United&apos; States in regard tothem-    although there were certain points on which he wouldhave comments to offer0   .-&apos;As regards the transitional period, however, we did not. know enough about the position immediately afterthe- war,, or what the attitude of. the United States Govern-ment would be after the election, to make any.firm commit-ment at this stagey     It-was, in&apos;-his view, essential thatswe should carefully, safeguard our position during-the transitional period-     Our whole financial future mightdepend&apos;on our handling of it,THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION agreed with the.Chancellor&apos;&apos; s view that we should continue the conversations with the United States and that we must protect our positionduring.the transitional period.     If in fact (as hethought very, likely) no. agreed solution-proved possible andwe had to fall back on Imperial Preference and the sterlingbloc, it was of great importance that it&apos;.should be clear, tothe United States of America that this was for no want of* willingness, on our &quot;part to reach agreement,.-&apos; ,   Had he&apos;regarded the proposals as involving a reversion to rigidityof exchange he would have been opposed to them     he regarded the provisions of the scheme on this point asdefinitely elastic. THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE thought theproposals would help to- clear the road for our exports evenin the transitional period, and regarded, them as representingthe most hopeful line of prqgressB     He was-prepared tosupport them on the currency side,  since he regarded them      ias the opposite of any reversion to the gold standard.     Thesafe-guards which thoy contained in his vie?/ overcame thedifficulties in this matter very satisfactorily,THE MINISTER OF RECONSTRUCTION thought that ifthe United States would accept the plan, we should welcome it.It gave.a great, deal of latitude;    it was the very oppositeof a rigid scheme     Ws must be in a position to export to pay for. our imports of food, and a currency war with theUnited States would be fatal.      In his view, broadly -speaking, the safeguards contained in the scheme were-adequate^ although the-;/ might require to bo supplementedin do tail o - - ,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it was not true to ^say that, the scheme, allowed  a 20 per cent., fluctuation incurrency.     The scheme gave a latitude for 10 per centfluctuation, but the.second 10 per cent could only be madewith the approval of an international bodyc     In the&quot;.yearspreceding 1925,&apos; sterling had fluctuated to the extent of1--2-

l\0 per cent.     As to the argument that we could withdraw fromthe scheme at any time, if this happened we would    have to facetho same disadvantages as attended our abandonment of thegold standard in 193&quot;1 *As regards    Imperial    preference, it was essentialnot to: throw away our economic Empire.     The abandonment of the sterling bloc would be disastrous.     So far as agriculture was concerned the present scheme was open to.strong objections.     Subsidies offered no answer to theviolent fluctuation of prices of imported agricultural pro*-ducts0     The right course to pursue . was discussion on thebasis of Clause k of the Atlantic Charter.     The phrase&quot;existing obligations&quot; in that clause safe-guarded ourposition in retaining Imperial Preference.     Article VII&quot;specifically referred to the economic objectives containedin the Charter.     An approach on the basis of Article VIIthus specifically related to the Atlantic Charter wouldenable us to deal with the matter on an. Empire basis, and tobring back Canada into closer relationship with the UnitedKingdom.     The choice in his judgment was between being a senior partner in the Empire or a.junior partner in an association with the U.S.A.THE PAYMASTER GENERAL said in his view the atlantic Charter had been superseded by our Mutual aid agreement and we were therefore not free agents in thematter.     The depreciation in the value of our currency in1931 had been countered by a still greater depreciation inthe value of the dollar by the United States.     The present plan had the advantage that it allowed us to depreciate upto 20$, and even further if necessary, subject to the consent(which we must assume would not be unreasonably withheld)of the International Fund, while a country with a favourable balance of trade, such as the United States, would not beable to do so.     As regards the transitional period, he wasin general agreement with the Chancellor, of the Exchequer.It would in his judgment be a fatal mistake not to go ahead with these conversations, given in particular the fact   ,that United States aid would be very necessary to us inthe first six months of the transitional period,THE MINISTER OF FOOD urged that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should avoid committing themselves irretrievably;if the conversations were to break down he thought itpreferable that the break should come from the United Statesrather than from our side. -THE&apos;MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE thought that there,were alternative courses of action to those set out in theMinister of State&apos;s paper which ought to have the sameexhaustive consideration.     What was needed was the abolitionof bad trade barriers and not of all trade barriers.     he expressed surprise that the negotiators at Washington had rejected a scheme -&apos;which had been put forward by the UnitedStates authorities themselves,and which permitted quantitative regulation&apos; of all articles in regard to which there was amarketing scheme in the home market.     This would have been of the greatest value to agriculture in this country.    &apos;THEMINISTER OF STATE pointed; out that the proposals in question had been rejected as contrary to the instructions received ,from the Cabinet;   that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be free to impose quantitative restrictions during the transitional period?   but that in gonoral quantitative restrictions constituted a most substantial obstaclo toour export tradc8

THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITYexpressed, himself as in general agreement with the proposalswhich had emerged from the Anglo-American discussions.     Onsentimental grounds we should all of us favour Empire trade.But this country could not live solely on it, nor could theDominions live on trade merely with the United Kingdom andthe other Dominions..THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saw no evidence that the Dominions were very anxious to maintainImperial preference,-&apos; and Canada least of all.     He believedthat they would prefer, other things being equal, a generalexpansionist policy,THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADEpointed out that, failing convert ability of currencies whichthis scheme was designed to produce, we could not hope tosell on a sufficient scale.      If   His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Governmentheld out for rights of regulation of their own trade,  so would other countries.     He favoured proceeding with the conversations on the basis proposed.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION thought&apos;that the point raised by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries in regard to the quantitative regulation deservedfurther consideration.     He also thought that attention should be paid to the effect on opinion, not only in theUnited States but also in this country, of the outcome ofthe discussions which were of the utmost importance tothe welfare of the countryside0THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION thought that theright course was to proceed with the discussions.     reversion to exchange restrictions and quotas would spell ruin for much of our. export trade.

1THE MINISTER OP STATE explained that the- clausewould disappears     In its place there would be set up&apos;aCommercial union and the members of the.union who observedits rules would get the benefit of membershipoThe second point raised by the Minister of Labourwas whether it could be provided that members were free to .H impoee import restrictions against a nation which did not agree to the enforcement of satisfactory working conditionsas laid down by the International Labour Office.THE MINISTER op STATE thought that this would be&apos;difficult to achieve in practice, and THE MINISTER OPI;    labour suggested that perhaps the difficulty was largelyone of drafting, and drew attention to the provisions of408 of the Treaty establishing the International LabourOffice,,THE PRIME MINISTER summed up by saying that thegeneral view of the War Cabinet was in favour of proceeding. with a policy generally on the lines discussed atWashington, and as set out in the Minister of State&apos;smemorandum, although no doubt there would be a number of specific points which would require further examination.The main point which had emerged from the morning&apos;discussion had been the importance of this country securingadequate safeguards in respect of the transitional period.He thought, too, that those handling these questions shouldnot neglect to consider the alternatives which we shouldhave to adopt if no agreement were reached with the UnitedStates on the lines of the Washington discussions.The Prime Minister added that it was, a matterof urgency to settle the lines which our officials shouldtake in the discussions with representatives of theDominions and India., which Were due to start&apos;on the 21stFebruarye     This immediate task should be entrusted to asmall committee of Ministers, though it might later befound desirable to turn this body into a standing Minister-ial Committee to consider our post-war financial, economicand commercial policy in the international field, includinggeneral problems likely to arise, in the transitional period.1 The War Cabinet agreed that a Committee ,   ,should be set up as follows -Chancellor of the Exchequer    (Chairman)Minister of ProductionLord Privy SealPresident of the Board, of trade minister of StateN &apos; Paymaster GeneralThe Committee&apos;s task was to determine, inthe light of the discussion in the War Cabinet- .( as summarised by the Prime Minister, theattitude to&apos;be taken by U*K, officials in theforthcoming discussions with official representatives of the Dominions and India&apos;   &quot; over the whole field of the WashingtonConversations under Article VIIeIt was, of course, open to the Committee tom invite other Ministers to assist them, as mightW be necessary,  in regard to any particularaspect of their enquiryoOffices of the War Cabinet, S,W,lo
