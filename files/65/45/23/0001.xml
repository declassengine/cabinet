(kk) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)lylThe War Cabinet resumed consideration of the reply to be sent to Marshal Stalin&apos;s telegram to thePrime Minister in which he complained that although his correspondence with the Prime Minister was personal and secret, the contents of one of his telegrams had begun to appear in the British Press.The War Cabinet considered whether the newspaper in question should be called upon to disclose the source of their information.      It-waspointed out that the accounts of Marshal Stalin&apos;reply had first appeared in a New York paper.      If thematter was to be dealt with by formal enquiry calling for a disclosure of the source of information, enquiry,therefore, should start with the U.S. paper.      Thiswas clearly impracticable.Furthermore,  the informal enquiries which hadalready been made, had established that the informo+iorabout Marshal Stalin&apos;s reply had been obtained fromthe Soviet Embassy.     There would seem, therefore, tobe nothing to be gained by invoking the powers underthe Official Secrets Act,or under Defence regulations to call on the British newspapers which had, at alater date, published accounts of Marshal Stalin&apos;reply, to disclose the source of their information.It was,  therefore, suggested that on the basis ofthe information already obtained, the Prime minister could send a fceply to Marshal Stalin to the effect thatwe had evidence that the information as to the tenorof Marshal&apos; Staling reply had been obtained by U.S.and British newspapers from the Soviet Embassy.Furthermore, we had not communicated the substance of Marshal Stalin&apos;s reply to the Polish Government,since we had still hoped., that the course of thenegotiations would take a more favourable form.The War Cabinet agreed. -(1) That the Prime Minister should send a replyto Marshal Stalin on the lines proposed at &apos;X&apos;.(2) Agreed that there was no need for any further enquiry to be made as to the source of theinformation of the newspapers in question;but invited the Minister of Information himself to see the correspondents .who had obtainedinformation from the Soviet Embassy, in orderto obtain personally from them confirmationthat the^ Soviet Embassy was the source oftheir information.-1-

&apos; THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he thought that the time had now come when weshould make a public statement as to our position inthe Russo^-Polish dispute.     He thought that thestatement should be on the lines that we had done all we could to bring about an agreement between Russiaand Poland, but that our efforts had failed.     We,therefore, adhered to the position that the questionof boundaries should be reserved for settlement atthe Peace Conference, and that in the meantime, weshould recognise no changes brought about by force.The Foreign Secretary undertook to submit to the Prime Minister a&apos; draft of a statement whichmight be made on the subject.- THE PRIME MINISTER.thought that before any statement was made, it would be wise to make sure that the President of the United States would takethe same line.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W. 1.
