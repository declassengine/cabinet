Copy No....at.W.Mi(Wi)31 ST, CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(10th March, 19kU at 11.30 a.m.)&quot;OVERLORD&quot;SECURITY.DiplomaticCommunicationsThe War Cabinet had before them a Paper by theMinister of Production (W.P. (1*4)153) covering a notedealing with two proposals connected with &quot;OVERLORD&quot;security, viz:-(i) The prohibition of uncensored diplomaticcommunications;     and(ii) The imposition of a ban on visitors to theEast and South coasts.The note circulated with W. P. (1+1*.) 153 explainedthat, as one of a number of measures for restrictingleakage of information about &quot;OVERLORD&quot; preparationsthe &quot;OVERLORD&quot; Security Sub-Committee of the Committee on&quot;OVERLORD&quot; Preparations had proposed that .a prohibitionshould be imposed on uncensored communications betweenneutral Governments and their diplomatic representatives in Great Britain.     The Sub-Committee had also considejn**8alternative proposals involving the imposition of shortdelays on such communications.While there was an undoubted possibility of.leakage of valuable information from this countrythrough diplomatic channels, much of the informationsent by foreign representatives was confusing to theenemy and of value to us in planning measures todeceive him.     The alternative procedure of imposingshort delays might add to the enemy&apos;s confusion andwould involve less risk of retaliation.     On the otherhand, it would not prevent the leakage of information about the general disposition of our forces for the assault.     Moreover, if foreign Governments retaliated -and it was not certain that they would - it would stillbe possible for our representatives in foreign countries to send uncensored messages through the representativesof the United States.If it was decided to impose a prohibition onuncensored diplomatic communications, it should applynot only to neutral Governments, including the Governmentof Eire, but also to all Allied Governments except theUnited States and the U.S.S.R.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the imposition of a ban on uncensored diplomaticcommunications would cause considerable inconvenience.In connection with past operations, we had gained by notimposing any restrictions on diplomatic communications and, although the ease of &quot;OVERLORD&quot; was perhapsexceptional, he felt that on balanee we should still gain by hot linposing the proposed ban.

fTHE HOME SECRETARY asked whether it would not bepossible to persuade the foreign Governments concerned to  .accept the proposed ban willingly.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the arguments for and against the proposal   were very evenly balanced, but that,9 on the whole, he had come to the conclusion that it wouldbe better not to impose a ban on uncensored diplomaticcommunications at the present time.     The proposal should,however, be brought before the War Cabinet again in timeto allow them to consider the imposition of a ban  ata later date.The War Cabinet agreed -(l) That for the present no ban should be imposed onthe sending of uncensored diplomaticcommunications and that the question of imposing a ban should be considered again bythe War Cabinet in time to admit of its beingimposed at a later dateeVisitors&apos; It was pointed out in the notecirculated withBan.. W.P. (ljh)l53    that, even if all the measures recommended bythe &quot;OVERLORD&quot; Security Sub-Committee to diminish the riskof leakage of information from the British Isles overseas and from Great Britain to Ireland were adopted, they wouldnot provide complete security.     Accordingly If thevisitors1 ban would add considerably to security itsimposition would be justified.     The ban would in fact add to security since it would make it easier to detect thepresence of enemy agents in the &quot;OVERLORD&quot; areas and would greatly reduce the number of persons who might give awayvaluable information in casual&apos; talk.The&apos;Sub-Committee had examined an alternative proposal that&apos; visitors should not be denied access to the wholecoastal belt but only to certain parts where the need forsecrecy was greatest.     An examination of a map of the&quot;OVERLORD&quot; area had, however, made it clear that &quot;this alternative was not practicable and the Sub-Committee had therefore recommended the imposition of the visitors&apos; banover the whole area.THE PRIME MINISTER said that while he still doubted whether the imposition of the proposed visitors&apos; banwould contribute materially to security, it was mostimportant to give the Forces who were to be engaged in&quot;OVERLORD&quot; the assurance that everything possible was being done for the success of the operation.     He was prepared,if the War Cabinet approved, to agree that the ban shouldbe imposed from 1st April.The War Cabinet agreed -(2) that from 1st April a visitors&apos; ban should be imposed throughout the coastal region from the/ Wash to Cornwall, with the addition of an area in Scotland adjacent to the-Firth of Forth.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,
