Copy No.mW.M, (44) 14TH CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTS company nf id e nt;&apos;,al.....Annex(1st February, 1944 - 5,30 p.m, )PARTY TRUCE IN THE PRIME MINISTER said that since he had formedBYE-ELECTIONS       his Government in May, 1940, there had been 98 bye-- , elections of which the Government had lost 6.     Thiscompared very favourably&quot; with the losses sustained by governments, - whether- Party Governments&apos; or CoalitionGovernments, over the last fifty or sixty years,     ThePrime Minister quoted statistics on the matter.While the number of bye-elections lost had been small, they had, nevertheless, had an unsettling effecton the structure of the Government and were liable to cause a general feeling of disturbance.The Prime Minister referred, with approval, to a recent speech by Lord Samuel in which he said that theParty Truce should either be kept or be torn-up, and inwhich he had severely rebuked those who left their Partyin order to stand against the Government,The Prime Minister said that he thought therewere several points TAiich might be considered in ordePto improve the position.      The first was that in 1940he had given a ruling that no Minister of Cabinet rankshould speak at bye-elections.     This had been done to.save the time of hardly pressed Ministers.      He&apos; thought this ban should now be withdrawn.The second point, which was, of course, a point for each Party to settle, concerned the selection of candidates.      He thought it was important to chooseyounger men, and, if possible, men who had served inthe war.The third point concerned the action which shouldbe taken by the Party organisations in the bye-elections.The agreement now in force, which had been made betweenthe Chief Whips in 1940, only enjoined on the Partyorganisation not to oppose the official candidate put up by the local organisation in the constituency of theParty to which the late Member, had belonged.     He wouldlike to see some more positive measure of support givento the Government candidate   at bye-elections by thelocal organisations of all the three Parties.    Unlessthe position could be improved, he feared that theGovernment would be subjected to a degree of annoyanceand disturbance which might have some effect onQ the stability of the Government,.The Prime Minister said that all three Partiescould look back with satisfaction on the achievements ofthe present Government, in which members of all theParties had won renown. --1-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT

THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER said that when bye-elections were pending it was the practice of theLabour Party to send an agent, down&quot;who tried to get therepresentatives of the Party in the constituency to vote for the Government candidate.     The position, however,varied from constituency to constituency;, and it ?/as necessary to take, account of the local temper and -feeling and to be guided in the action taken by advicegiven by those on the spot as to what would be theresult of a particular course of action,THE CHIEF LABOUR WHIP &quot;said that in criticalbye-elections the Labour Party could claim to. have donevery good work for the support of the Governmentcandidate. ;    He cited the case, of the Bristol bye-election in which Mr. Walkden had gone down and spokenfor the Government candidate, and in which the LabourParty had expelled from the Party seven councillors,   .thereby forfeiting the majority on the City Council.He was.sure it would be realised that Party Headquarters-were not in a position to dictate the action to betaken in the constituencies.THE HOME SECRETARY&apos; AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITYreferred to a practice which had been very, usefullyfollowed on one or two occasions, namely, where the   ,:Labour Party had opened their own Committee Room fromwhich they had carried oh support of the Governmentcandidate, although &apos;that candidate belonged to a     , :different Party.    He thought that there would be muchto be said for allowing the local Party organisation to issue a manifesto in which, after some declarationof their political faith, they stated that in presentcircumstances they agreed that the Government candidateshould be supported.General agreement was expressed with the viewthat this procedure should be encouraged.THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER said that this hadbeen done at Hartlepool, where the Labour Party had held their own meetings in support of the Governmentcandidate.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY shared the Prime Minister&apos;view that continuance of the present happenings atbye-elections would encourage the disruptive1 elementsand might affect the solidarity of the Government^     Hethought that the Home Secretary&apos;s suggestions were very helpful. ,THE. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed with theForeign Secretary that the present position was a difficult one.     The members of the Liberal Party were,&apos;he thought, affected by two points, *, The first ms theview, which&apos;-was much too commonly held, that the warcould be regarded as nearly over and that what nowmattered were the problems of &apos;the peace.     This viewseemed to be very widely held, and was used as support for the line that,^while the Government were to be supported in their conduct of the war, &quot;What was nowneeded was to support candidates who were concernedwith ensuring the proper handling of post-war questions.

The second point was that in the Liberal Party,more, perhaps, than in any^ other Party, the idea of acoupon election was most unpopular. .   This, no doubt,was due to the coupon election held, at the end of thelast war which had been so conducted as to spelldisaster for the Liberal Party.      He also drew,attention to the fact that two former members of theLiberal Party had come near to obtaining election atrecent bjre-elections (Dr.- Johnston at Chippenham andHiss Balfour at Darwen).      In both cases the narrowmajority Against them had been attributed to the factthat the Government candidate had the support of the leader of the Liberal Party, and it was being said thatbut for this action two young Liberals would have been returned to Parliament.      It would be seen that this increased the difficulties of his own personal position.The Secretary of State said that if he was in aposition to say that when the General Election came tobe foiight after the war, it would not be fought as acoupon election, that would relieve a great deal of the anxiety of his followers, many of whom Were keenlyinterested in.keeping the Party organisation alive intheir constituencies, and who would feel a sense offrustration if they were, not likely to be in a position .to fight an election for some years to come.THE PRUaB MINISTER, said that the discussion that afternoon was confined to the position in regard to bye-elections.     It was really not possible for anyone tosay what the position would be when the time came for aGeneral   Election.   -  Thus, when Hitler was defeated itmight be that the Parties would feel that the time had come when they should part honourably and amicably andhave an election.     On the other hand, they might wellfeel that they ought to hold together for, say, anothercouple of years,,      This , however, was not in issue that afternoon.  -THE HOME SECRETARY suggested that1his matter was perhaps within the decision of the Liberal Party,since it was for them to settle whether they wereprepared to stay in a post-war coalition,THE CHANCELLOR 0&quot;? THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat if the Government decided to stand together after &apos;the war and an election was necessary, he did not see  &apos;any means&apos; by which a coupon election could be. avoided.As regards the present position, he agreed that allthe Parties ought to bring the vnaximum effort to bearat bye-elect ions.      He thought it would be a good planthat Ministers-of Cabinet rank should be free to speakat bye-elections.      He favoured their speaking, however,not on the eve:.of the poll but about two daysbeforehand.      The Government could rely on the fullestsupport from his friends and supporters at futurebye-elections. &apos;&quot; The general conclusions of the War CabinetWore as&apos; follows:-(l) The. rule whereby Ministers of Cabinet rankdid not make speeches at bye-elections(and which had been formally endorsed bythe War Cabinet in October, 1941) is nowrevoked.      The rule should, however, be- maintained as regards&apos;War Cabinet Ministers.(previous reference:O, (41) lOOthinclusions ,Minute ?)

It. was : ders Arable that the organisati onsof all the political Parties should make every endeavour&apos;to give more positivesupport to Government candidates atbye-elections.   . The Chief whipsundertook to, arrange a meeting of theNational Party-organisers., to co nsider &apos;how this .&quot;could.best be achieved..     Onsuitable occasions this might takethe form of each of the local party organisations opening their ownCommittee Room, or holding their ownmeetings, in support of the Governmentcandidate.the War Cabinet,,S.&apos;W. 1.
