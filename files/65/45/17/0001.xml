Proposals arising out of the consideration of the future of the Italian fleet.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (44) 16th Conclusions, Minute 2).

THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the War Cabinet that we had agreed to lend to Russia a battleship - the "ROYAL SOVEREIGN" - and 20,000 tons of merchant shipping, together with 8 submarines and 4 destroyers.

The United States had agreed to lend one of cruiser and 20,000 tons of merchant shipping.

Tho Prime Minister said that he had now had a reply from Premier Stalin to tho telegram sent by President Roosevelt and himself making this offer.

Premier Stalin had thanked the President and himself for the information regarding this decision, but had drawn attention to the fact that as all the destroyers were old he had some misgiving as to their fighting qualities. He still hoped that the Prime Minister and the President would find it possible to see that among the destroyers to be handed over there should be at least 4 modern ones.

"The First Lord expressed the opinion that the Naval situation would preclude any transfer of modern Fleet destroyers."

(W.M.(44) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 3.)

Agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion that consideration of the answer to be sent to Premier Stalin on this matter should be deferred until we had a report of Sir A. Clark Kerr&apos;s interview with Premier Stalin, and also knew how the Russians responded to tho telegram which the Prime Minister had sent to Premier Stalin about tho Polish situation.
