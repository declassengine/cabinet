MINUTE confidential Annex(27th March, 19hh, at 5.30 p.m.)POLAND(previous reference:W.M.(hh) 37thConclusions,Minute 1)The War Cabinet discussed two telegrams from Premier Stalin dated 23rd and 25th Marchrespectively35 on the Russo-Polish dispute.In the first, Premier Stalin complained thatour messages were full of threats, suggestedthat there had been a clear agreement atTeheran (from which we were now departing)that the Cdrzon Line should be the Easternboundary of Poland, and hinted that the suggestionthat a Parliamentary statement might be madebased on non-recognition of territorialacquisitions carried out by force, would bean unfriendly act.    In the second telegramPremier Stalin stated that he was satisfiedafter enquiry that there had been no leakagefrom the Russian Embassy in London as regardsthe terms of his communications with the PrimeMinister, and that the leakage had occurred on the British side.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that allother considerations must be subordinated tothe winning of the war.    In dealing with the russo--Polish issue we had throughout been inclose touch with President Roosevelt and had had his support.   Premier Stalin&apos;s telegram wasin strong terms.    It was clear that he dislikedthe prospect of a public statement in parliament on the lines proposed.    It was not the case that there had been any such firm agreement at Teheran, as had been suggested, about theacceptance of the Curzon Line, but it was ofgreat importance that in this telegram for thefirst time the Russians categorically acceptedthe Curzon Line as their Eastern boundary.   Whiloin the present case we would welcome on agreed settlement, we had consistently maintainedthe position that we could not recognisetransfers of territory effected by force.The alternatives now open to us were tosend no reply to Premier Stalin&apos;s telegram of23rd March, or to send a brief and unprovocativereply as from the War Cabinet throughAmbassador Clark Kerr, to the effect that wehad said all we had to say and must holdourselves free.    In Parliament we might takex T. 656/U and 662/h-1-

the line that we regretted that we had not beenable to reach any solution of the Polish question and that our previous declaration that we couldnot recognise transfers of territory effected by force in these circumstances retained its full validity.    Consideration must be givento the position of the Polish UndergroundMovement.   And we must bear in mind that atsome stage the Polish Government in london would have to be informed of the position.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY observed that itwould be necessary for us to make our position clear, at some time.    The reason for our originaldeclaration that we could not recognise transfers of territory effected by force, had been thesituation created by the Russian invasion ofPoland in 1939.   He doubted if the words&quot;unfriendly act&quot; in Premier    Stalin&apos;telegram of 23rd March need be construed in their technical sense or as bearing more than theirliteral meaning.    It was, of course, entirelyuntrue to suggest that we had gone back on anagreement, reached at Teheran, about the curzon line.     At some stage we must rebut this charge.V/e were also bound to tell the Polish Governmenthow matters stood, but in considering our time-table the risk of leakage should not be overlooked.In view of the latest information as to thepresent attitude:of the Soviet Authorities towardsthe Polish Underground Movement,  too long an interval should not elapse before the PolishGovernment were made aware of the position.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR suggested thatthere would be advantage in postponing &quot;anyreply for a week or a fortnight. &quot;&quot;\A general discussion followed, as a resultof which the War Cabinet decided as follows:(a) The Foreign Office should giveimmediate consideration to the termsof a reply to be sent on behalfof the War Cabinet to premier stalin&apos;s telegram of 23rd March,Its despatch should however be postponed for, say, a fortnight.Meanwhile, Ambassador Clark Kerrshould be told of the positionforthwith for his own information and warned to keep off the subject with the Russians.(b) The draft reply, after considerationby the War Cabinet, would becommunicated by the Prime Ministerto President Roosevelt, who shouldbe told the time-table towhich we proposed to work.   his attention should be drawn to theRussian recognition of the curzon line, and to their obviousreluctance to face publicity on

this matter.    President Rooseveltshould he informed that we were bound to let the Polish Governmentknow the position in thefuture.   The risk of leakage once this had been done could not beoverlookedj    and as we might haveto make a public statement we were anxious to be certain, in advance,that, the President was in agreement.(a) The terms of a statement to thePolish Government should be preparedby the Foreign Office on thefollowing lines.   The PolishGovernment should be informedthat we had not been able to reach agreement with the Soviet Government,although that Government had nowdeclared themselves in favour ofthe Gurzon Line as defined in the correspondence, and that it was obvious that they were not preparedto deal with the present PolishGovernment.    They should also be warned that anything they might say publicly would be likely toaggravate the position.Our statement to the PolishGovernment should be in objective.and unprovocative terms so that acopy of it could, if necessary,be communicated to the SovietGovernment.(d) The terms of the draft statement,referred to in (e), should be brought before the War Cabinet later in theweek, when a decision should be.taken whether the time was ripe for its dispatch.(e) As regards the Polish UndergroundMovement, the War Cabinet thoughtit likely that the Leaders of theMovement would apprehend that matters were not going well, and would take their own precautions in advanceof any statement made by us to thePolish Government.Alleged Leakage by The War Cabinet then turned to PremierRussian Embassy in   Stalin&apos;s telegram of 25th March regarding theLondon. alleged leakage of information from the RussianEmbassy in London.   After discussion, they decided that nothing was to be gained bypursuing a correspondence which was bound to \be controversial, and that no reply shouldbe sent to this telegram.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.1.

(kh) hOTH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(27th March, 19hZj. - 5.30 p.m.)THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinetthat a request had now been received from the SovietGovernment that the naval units which we were making available to them should be sailed to Russian ports and handed over there by British crews.       This wasa wholly fresh proposal.     To give effect to it would&apos;take up some 3,000-5,000 sailors at a time when everyman available was badly needed in connection withforthcoming operations.     He did not feel that it wasone to which we could.accede and thought that the reply to the Russians should be that we were unableto send these ships with British crews but were readyto hand them over at British ports as had originally been arranged.The Prime Minister then read to the War Cabinetthe text of a draft telegram in this sense which hadbeen prepared by the Admiralty in consultation withthe Foreign Office, and the text of a modified version of that draft which he had himself prepared.After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed thata revised draft should be prepared by the Admiralty,in consultation with the Foreign Office, in the shortest and least argumentative form, to theeffect that it had never been contemplated thatBritish crews should be provided to sail these units to Russia, and that we regretted in the presentcircumstances that it was out of the question for usto provide such crews and that we must hold to theoriginal arrangement under which the ships were tobe taken over by the Soviet Government at British ports

THE PRIME MINISTER invited the attention of---                     the War Cabinet to the case of two British seamen whohaving got drunk at Archangel had been sentenced to cases of Seamen four and three years penal servitude, respectively,Prior and Loades and were now reported to be on their way to Siberia.He felt that these sentences were unjustifiablysevere and that everything must be done to secure a modification of them.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed out that he had made personal representations in this case- toM. Molotov some ten days ago, and suggested that we might wait a little longer to see his reaction.He undertook to send an immediate reminder throughAmbassador Clerk Kerr, and suggested that it mightbe on the lines that we were now faced by parliamentary questions, which we were holding offwith difficulty, and that we were therefore very anxious for-the earliest possible answer.The War Cabinet approved the foreign secretary&apos;s suggestion.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.1.
