(44) 12thConclusions,Minute l)THE PRIME MINISTER said that a series of telegrams had been received from Sir A. Clark Kerr(Nos.  281, 282 and 291) recording a long talk whichhe had had on the 2nd February with Premier Stalinand M. Molotov.      These telegrams were read to the%r Cabinet by the Prime Minister.     -While premier stalin had insisted that it would be necessary toreconstruct the Polish Government and get rid ofintransigents, he had raised no objection to thePolish President or Prime Minister.     Furthermore,the answers which Premier Stalin had given to thequestions from the Piles, which the Prime minister had included in his telegram to Premier Stalin(paragraph 4&quot; of Tel. No. 227 to Moscow of28th January), had been unexpectedly favourable.In particular, Premier Stalin had stated that whenPoland West of the Curzon Line was occupied by theRed Army, the Polish Government would be allowed togo back and establish the broad-based kind ofGovernment they had in mind.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY suggested that a balance sheet should now be prepared setting out the points which the Poles would secure under an arrangement ofthe kind contemplated, and what they would have to concede.      This balance sheet would provide the basis for a further approach to be made by the Prime Ministerto the Poles. .THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was inevitable that when the Polish Government returned to Poland, itwould have to be reconstructed in order to provideplaces for leading figures of the Resistance Movement,in Poland.      Such a development was inevitable inregard to all emigre Governments.It was also suggested in discussion that theprospects of a solution on the lines now offeredmight, in practice, lead naturally to a situationin which the irreconcilables left the Polish Government.THE PRIME MINISTER added that, even if anagreement should not be concluded between Russia and poland, there remained the possibility that GreatBritain and Russia might reach an understanding as towhat would be fair and reasonable boundaries for.

(43)(b)17th December150th ConclusionsRoosevelt&apos;s proposal to sendabout Presidenta communication to Mr.  de Valera regardingthe continued neutrality of Eire.A memorandum- by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs (W.P.&apos;(44) 59) regarding afarther, oral approach on this matter by theUnited States Ambassador in-London.     TheUnited States Ambassador had communicated aproposal, understood to emanate from the&quot;United States Minister in Dublin, that theUnited States Government should send anote to the Eire Government demanding that,in vie?/ of the danger to the security ofthe United States troops crossing the atlantic arising from the presonao &amp;nEire of Axis diplomatic missions, thosemissions should be cleared out.      If that demand, as anticipated by the United StatesMinister in Dublin, should receive a negativereply, the Eire Government would then&apos; be on record as having refused a request which hadthe object of safeguarding the lives of-American nationals in the fighting services at a vital period in the war.The Ambassador had outlined three alternative methods of approach on which his GovernmentWould be glad&quot; of the views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      These were -(i) a note from the United States government alone,(ii) a joint Anglo-American note.(iii) separate, but simultaneous, notes byH.M. G.  and United States Government,.

The United States Ambassador had inquired theattitude of H. 11,G.  in the United Kingdom andhad discussed the possible methods of &apos;, approaching the Sire Government with the-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs who,speaking entirely personally, had expressedthe view that the present proposal was not open to the same dangers as the earlierone put forward by the United StatesGovernment and had undertaken to obtain theviews - of his colleagues upon it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION&apos;affairs suggested for the consideration of the War Cabinet thatwe should reply to the U. 3. ambassador on the following lines :-(a) With regard to the proposed note from theUnited States Government to Eire on the linescommunicated to the Secretary of State byMr. Winaht, H.M.G-,; would be glad to havet.    an opportunity of commenting on the exacttext;(b) Subject to any views which the United StatesGovernment might have, H.M.G.  considered that&apos;the- question of publishing the reply shouldbe a matter for further consideration betweenthe United States Government and themselves;(c) In any case, H.M.G. would hope that theUnited States Government would consult withthem further when the Eire reply was received with regard   to any further steps;(d) As regards the question of U.K.  participation in the approach, H.M.G.  thought the best course would be that they should, at the sametime as the United States approach   was made,send in a further note to the Eire Governmentto the effect that H.M.G.  had been consulted by the U. S. Government before their approach was made, and that they warmly, welcomed theinitiative of the U.S. Government and supported the request which they had decidedto make to the Eire Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSadded that there was, of course, the risk thatMr. Do Valera might, in his reply, manage to widen the issue, while premature publicity in the UnitedStates might cause embarrassment.     On.these latterpoints he thought that we should protect our position on the lines he had suggested.     But he was definitelyof opinion that the course if action now proposed wasthe wise one, .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS&apos;,who had to leave the meeting at this point, expressed his entire agreement with the proposals of theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he felt the WarCabinet, in reaching their decision, ought to be aware that he had examined- the Security aspect of leaving the Axis Missions in Dublin, and that in the outcome,while there were admittedly loop-holes through which information of vital importance might escape, we shouldnot be. justified, on the advice tendered to him, onbasing the demand now proposed directly on Security.He himself was in favour of the course of actionrecommended by the /Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.     Admittedly if notes were presented by theUnited States and by H.M,. G.  as suggested, Mr. De Voleramight say yes or no, but in the event of his decidingon a negative reply he was most unlikely to deprive us of the existing advantages which we enjoyed in&quot;respectof Irish labour, etc. merely because this request hadbeen politely put. to him.      He might considerwithdrawing them were we. to start applying sanctions.But the Prime Minister himself expected that if Mr,  DcVnlern now refused, he would at the same.time argue that the eire Government&apos;&apos;s Security arrangements were so goodthat nothing was to be gained on security grounds by removing the German and Japanese Legations from Dublin.Mr.  De Valera might perhaps offer to tighten up his own&quot;Security arrangements.     Given the traditional relationsbetween Eire and the United States, it would be a gravedecision for him to return a flat negative to acourteously phrased approach on behalf of the United&quot;States Government such as was now in view,Points which were mode in the course ofdiscussion were as follows: -(a) It was of vital importance to safeguard thesecurity aspect of our proposed operations andno pains must be spared either in connection w.ith thepresent proposals or in connection with programmes ofwork, etc.(b) Gome regret was expressed, that, even to theextent now proposed, there should be any direct inter-ference by the United States Government in the affairs of a vaember of the British Commonwealth.      It waspoimted out, on the other hand, that it was important that the initiative should rest with the U, S. Government.There could be no certainty that the Eire Governmentwould not return a flat negative to an approach by theU.K. , given the hostility existing r,s a re&quot;sult of pastrelations between&apos;the two countries. But it would be verydifficult indeed for her to reply abruptly to the. United States Government.     Moreover that Government hada status in the matter, since they were contributingmanpower on a great scale to the prosecution of the war,and had a right to place theraselves in a positionto say to their public that they had taken every measure for the safety of their men.     And it was relevant thatthey were diplomatically represented in Dublin. ,   .   ,(c) It was urged that there was s serious risk that if -premature publication took place in Americaand Mr. De Valera started to develop, an. argument basedon partition or on the retaining of diplomatic relations between the United States Government and the finns,  in the result, particularly with an election,ahead, President Roosevelt might find himself manoeuvred

-into a position in which he might have to make some gsneralstatement of an embarrassing nature, for example, thathe would do his best to secure a unified Ireland afterthe war.      It was urged, on the other hand, that these were risks that must be faced;    that the short pointso far as the United. Stbt.es was concerned was. the safety of United States troops and that a negative reply onthat issue, if coupled with special pleading, or theintroduction of much matter not directly relevant toit, would be bound to do Mr.  De Volera harm in theUnited States.      The risk of publication was one that could best be protected under the proposals made bythe Secretary of State for Dominion -Affairs.THE PRIME MINISTER indicated in conclusion thathe would be prepared himself to handle this matter withthe President of the United States,  since it arosedirectly out of his earlier talks with Mr.  Gray andthe President at Hyde Park.The Prime Minister also suggested, and theWar Cabinet agreed, that in the light of GeneralMu3cahy&apos;s recent speech we should do well to consider what could be done to help Eire economically after thewar if she co-operated satisfactorily now-     It wassuggested that the possibility of economic assistanceduring the war might at the same time be investigated.The &apos;.ar Cabinet&apos;s conclisions were as follows:-.(l) Approval won given to the proposals.cot outin&quot; the concluding paragraph of, theMemorandum by the,Seeretory of State forDomini on Affairs (jvtP, (44) 69),as to thegeneral linos - on which we should reply tothis approach.As regards procedure, the Prime Ministerindicated that ho intended to send a communication on the matter to thePresident,(2) .It was agreed that the Chancellor of theExchequer should dis,cuss with the .Secretary of State for the Dominionswhat-, could be done to help Eireeconomically during And after the-war on the assumption of her satisfactory. co-operation.&apos;
