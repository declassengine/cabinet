(44) 1stConclusions,Minute 3)The War Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the Secretory of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P.(44) 19) together with an exchange of telegrams between the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary(Nos.  1184 and 1187 FROZEN and Nob. 1240 and 1241 GRAND).Brigadier Maclean had now left for GeneralTito&apos;s Headquarters bearing with him the message fromthe Prime Minister to General Tito which was set outin the Annex to W-.P. (44) 19.      The Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary were both anxious to bring about an understanding between the King and the partisans.The only question at issue was one of tactics,,      ThePrime Minister considered that the chances of bringing about an understanding would be greatly improved ifKing Peter were, on his own initiative, to dismissGeneral Mihailovicj      He had accordingly suggested thathe should at once send to King Peter the message, ofwhich the text was given in telegram No.  1184 FROZEN.The Foreign Secretary, on the other hand, felt that,for the reasons set out in the last paragraph of his memorandum, it would be better, before advising King &apos;Peter to dismiss General Mihailovic, to await the outcome of the Prime Minister&apos;s letter to General Tito.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he was also reluctant that we should take the drastic action suggested by the Prime Minister withoutthe sunoort of the United States or Soviet Governments.The attitude of the U. S.S.R. on this matter was reserved;and no indication had been received regarding that ofthe United States of America.LIEUTENANT-GENERAL ISMAY, asked to give theviews of the Chiefs of Staff, said that they considered it most important, especially at the presenttime,  to ensure that the maximum number of german divisions were contained by the partisans.      they therefore felt that the best course was to strengthenand reinforce in every&apos; possible way the one man who was making a    real contribution to this end, namely,General Tito.      They therefore recommended that weshould break with General Mihailovic, support GeneralTito and, if possible, bring King Peter and General Titotogether. -

In discussion it was pointed out that wewere already supporting General Tito, had ceased tosupport General Mihailovic, and &quot;.were endeavouringto &quot;bring the King ar^ General Tito together.      Theonly question at issue was whether or not we should advise King Peter to dismiss General Mihailovicbefore we had received any indication fromBrigadier Maclean as to the likelihood of GeneralTito being willing to become reconciled toKing Peter. ; ,The general view of the War Cabinet wasthat it would he preferable to await the receiptfrom Brigadier Maclean of a report on; GeneralTito&apos;s reactions to the Prime Minister&apos;s message.This report might be expected to arrive within aweek., The War Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to convey their viewson this matter to the Prime Minister.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W. 1. ;
