Copy No.W.M.(44)6TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(14th January, 1944   -   11a.m0)POLAND THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS informed the War Cabinet that he had had long discussions with thePolish Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, onthe text of the declaration which the Polish government intended to publish in answer to the Soviet declaration ofthe 10th Januaryo     The first statement drawn up by the Poleshad consisted almost entirely of a rebuttal of the&apos;contentious points made in the Soviet declaration, and hadeither stated*or clearly implied that no declarations aboutthe frontier could be made before the end of the war.The Foreign Secretary said that he had made it clear to the Poles, that if they took this line they would forfeitthe sympathy of British public opinion and that they would put themselves in a position in which we should not be able, tohelp themeThe Polish Government had now prepared a further vereionof their statements     This stated that they were willing toenter into discussions with the Soviet Government throughthe intermediary of the British and U.S. Governments.     Butthe statement still contained passages which were open to considerable objection.A draft of the statement in its latest form was read to the War Cabinets     The first point dealt.with was para-graph 3 which read as follows:-&quot;They cannot, however, recognize unilateraldecisions or accomplished facts, nor thestrength of arguments designed to justifyterritorial demands on Poland (which wouldmean the loss of about half of her territory and of more than 11 millions of her population)1-&apos;.General agreement was expressed with the foreign secretary&apos;s view that the reference to &quot;half her territory and more than 11 million of her people11 was very unfortunate,and if possible the latter half of this paragraph should be altered to read as follows:-&quot;M e the strength of arguments designed tojustify far-reaching territorial demands&quot;.Paragraph 4.     This began as follows:-&quot;The Soviet communique contains also a numberof statements, which are manifestly unfounded, inview of the ceaseless struggle against the Germansw waged at the heaviest cost by the Polish nationunder the direction of the Polish Government&quot;.It was suggested that it would be much better ifthe relevant words were amended to read: -&quot;... a number of statements, to which a completeanswer is afforded by the ceaseless struggle...&quot;.-1-

mParagraph 5.     it was agreed that the matters to bediscussed between the Polish and Soviet Governments, with the participation of the British and American Governments,should be &quot;all outstanding questions,,  a statement on which...would;lead to friendly and permanent co-operation between poland and the Soviet Union.&quot;   Unless the word 1 outstanding&apos;was   included, there was some risk that the Russians wouldnot read the statement as indicating willingness to discussboundary questions before the end of the war.It was also suggested &quot;that the contents of the document would be greatly improved by transposition ofcertain paragraphs.     Paragraph 5 should come beforeparagraph 2,  It would indeed be better if the order of the paragraphs was altered as follows1, 4, 3, 2, 5.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he would do his best to secure an amendment of tho statement on the lines proposed, but could not hold out any considerable hopes ofsuccess.     He asked whether he could inform the PolishCabinet that, if the statement were put out by thePolish Government in its present form, we could accept no responsibility for the reaction of British public opinion.The War Cabinet agreed to this vieweTHE FOREIGN SECRETLY added that, though, ofcourse, he would not say so to the Poles, even if theyissued the statement in something like its present form,we should not desist from our attempts to bring thePoles and Russians together.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,
