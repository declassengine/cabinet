MINUTE 3..Confidential Annex(7th February, 1944 -5*30 p0m.)POLAND(previous reference:W.M.(44)l5thConclusions,Minute l)THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Foreign secretary and he had had a long afternoon with the Polish Ministersover the week-end,,     The discussion had   ha en on the   -general lines approved by the War Cabinet,The first essential was to avoid armed conflict between the Poles and the Russians0     Unless some settle-ment was reached there was a grave danger that this would happen as the Russians advanced into Poland,     The Polessaid that they had sent instructions to the leaders of the underground movement in Poland that, when the Russiansentered Poland, they should disclose themselves to theRussian officers and should offer to co-operate with them.In any cases in which units of the Polish undergroundmovement had previously been engaged in hostilities withthe Russian partisans they had orders to withdrawsThe second point to secure was some settlement ofthe frontier questionD     THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had hoped that the Poles would be prepared to agree to a settle-ment on the basis of the Curzon Line, subject to certainethnographical considerations.     While he had not abandonedhope that they might do so, he thought that it. might well prove to be beyond the powers of the Polish Government toagree to such a settlement at the present time.     It might,therefore, be necessary to fall back on a temporary, provis-ional or war time settlement of the frontier on the basis ofthe. Curzon Line.     Under this arrangement what would happenwould be that the Russians, as they advanced into Poland,would take over the administration of territories to theeast of the line, and the Polish authorities would takeover administration of territories to the west of this line.The third point which he had in mind was that we might say to the Russians that we regarded a settlement onthe basis of the Curzon Line as reasonable, and would support their claims to such a frontier at the PeaceConference,Finally, there remained the question of restoringrelations between the Polish and Russian Governments,     THEPRIME MINISTER said that if a temporary accommodation couldbe secured on the lines of the first three points which hehad outlined, he was not sure that it was essential thatdiplomatic relations between the two Governments should be restored at the present time-     It might well be that thetime at which such a settlement should be secured would come when the Polish Government returned to their native 1  \land*     This would be an appropriate moment for certainfigures in the present Polish Government to. leave thatGovernment, in order to provide places for leading figures in the Polish Resistance Movemento-1-

 The Prime Minister said that at his meeting over the week-end, he had also told the Polish Ministers that the Russians wanted Konigsberg.

 The Prime Minister added that the Foreign Office were examining the results of the discussions over the week-end, and that he would report more fully to the War Cabinet at a later date.

 THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had little to add to what the Prime Minister had said. If, as had rather appeared to be the case at the meeting, the Polish Government were unable to agree to a settlement of the frontier at this juncture, on the basis of the curzon Line, then a settlement on the basis proposed by the Prime Minister was the best we could do, although it was perhaps a solution of which the main lines were rather blurred. He stressed the complete lack of confidence and trust between the Russian and Polish Governments.

 The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
