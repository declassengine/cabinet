MINUTE confidential Annex(6th March 1944 - 5.50 pom0)POLAND.(previous reference:W,M.(44) 26thConclusions,Minute l)THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet thathe had now received from Premier Stalin a reply(No, T,452/4) to the messages which he had sent about the russo--Polish issue on 20th February.     Sir A. Clark Kerrhad also reported a conversation between Premier Stalinand himself (Telegram No.557 of 28.2.44) . and also the gist of a conversation between Mr. Harriman and Premier Stalinon the same subject telegram No.610 of 4.3.44).  -     ThePrime Minister said that Premier Stalin1s attitude had beenvery uncompromising.     Premier Stalin based that attitudeessentially on a reference in the Prime Minister&apos;s message of 20th February to the Polish attitude towards Lwow andVilna.     The Prime Minister&apos;s message had made it clear infact that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not in any wayassociate themselves with the Polish attitude on thismatter, and that the reference to those places had merelysuggested a way in those areas by which the Poles thought they could help the common cause.     Premier Stalin had be:nequally uncompromising in his conversations withMr. Harriman,     The question now for consideration was what,if any, answer should be sent to Premier Stalin.&apos;    ThePrime Minister laid before the War Cabinet (a) a draftof a personal reply to Premier Stalin, and (b) a draft of atelegram of points which our Ambassador in Russia might athis discretion use by way of reinforcing the generalargument of His Majesty&apos;s Government and emphasising theimportance on general grounds of a friendly settlement ofthis issue.The Prime Minister added that he had informedPresident Roosevelt in me light of Premier Stalin&apos;s reply that there was now no reason why the Polish Prime minister should not visit the United States as he had earlier been invited to do.     He felt that the Polish Prime minister could rely on a very cordial   reception, even in face ofsigns that certain Polish elements in the U,S,A, wereRussian in sympathy.     And such a reception might well leadto U,S. pressure on Russia, while leaving His Majesty&apos;sGovernment   well   placed   to   keep   tho   balance   and exercise a moderating influence.The War Cabinet first considered the questionof the reply to Premier Stalin.     It was urged on the onehand that there was a strong case for sending no reply, or at most for sending merely an acknowledgment,.      Thislatest evidence of the attitude of Premier Stalin suggestedthat he was unlikely to be influenced by argument and that nothing but the pressure of events would produce any effect upon him.     When the tone of a correspondence such as thepresent showed signs of becoming acrimonious, the less said the better.

It was pointed out on th.9 other1 hand that therewere very strong arguments, in the interests of the Polesand of tho bringing about of some settlement, for keeping the door open, by sending a reply.     It was important thatthe attitude of His Majesty1s Government should be on record;    acquiescence by silence, or by the despatch of a mere acknowlodgras-r-Jitf   in the Russian attitude might be interpreted as meaning that we had washed our hands of thismatter.     Moreover,, His Majesty&apos;s Governments havingpersuaded the Pollen Government to go so fars and having taken the line that certain of the Russian demands werereasonable^ were now under an obligation to protect thePolish position against Russian intransigenceo     Further,we were not masters of events.     It would be necessary toinform the Polish Government sooner or later of the reply which had been received from Premier Stalin,     It would benecessary also if a real break developed to protect theposition of the undergroxxnd movement in Poland and to givethe Poles,tho opportunity to warn the members of thatmovement of the change in the position.The further point was made that the latestcommunications from Premier Stalin went to confirm the doubts that had originally been felt as to whether theRussians had really meant business when at an earlier stage they had&apos;indicated their readiness to negotiate on the basis of the Curzon Line, subject to certainethnographic adjustments.      It was quite true that theybased themselves at the present .time   largely on theunacceptable composition of the present Polish Governmentin London, and that th;ls was not a new point, but onewhich had cons is tent ly been urged by them.     On theother hand, assurances had been given in the course ofthe correspondence that had passed of a character wellcalculated fully to reassure them on that issue, and inthese circumstances their present attitude lent itselfto the construction that as the Poles had moved towards a compromise the Russians had stiffened.It was felt, finally, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had undertaken obligations in this matter, andin view of the degree of responsibility that they had assumed they were bound in justice to themselves, even ifthey now felt it impossible to presfi the Russians further,to make clear to Premier Stalin precisely where they them-selves stood, and in particular that they must continueto recognise the Polish Government in London as theGovernment of the Ally for whom they had declared war onHitler,After discussion it was the general sense of theWar Cabinet that it would be well to send Premier Stalina short but firm considered reply in the general termsof the draft which the Prime Minister had laid before theWar Cabinet, explaining that there was no foundation forthe construction he had placed on the references to Lwow andVilna in the Message of 20th February,    and asking him toexpunge those references;    urging the importance of a friendly and equitable settlement:- making clear the regretwith which any &quot;risk of a deadlock was viewed by the PrimeMinister and the Cabinet, but bringing out also that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would continue to recognise the PolishGovernment in London  as  the Government of Poland,     ThePrime Minister undertook to show the drart in its final form to the   Foreign Secretary before its issue0

nstructions The War Cabinet, after discussion of the draft to Sir Ao        list of points for communication to SiLv Ac Clark &apos;Clark Kerr.     Kerr, assented to tho Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion thatthey should be made the basis for a communication to the ambassador by the Foreign Secretary, in such form as hethought appropriate, as instructions: for his general guidance.     The Ambassador should also be informed that(j it was important to secure an early answer from theRussians.     This wan important because, if the reply wasunfavourable, the Poles would have to give immediatewarning to the underground movement.The War Cabinet discussed in conclusion thequestion of what, if anything, should be said to- thePolish Government at this stage.,     They decided thatno indication of the position should be given to thePoles at this stage, and that the reply to any enquiriesfrom them should be that discussions were still proceeding.The War Cabinet reached the following conclusions:(a) That a reply should be personally,sent from the Prime Minister to premier stalin in the general sense of thedraft which had been prepared by.the Prime Minister, subject to amendment in the light of the discussion0(b) that the list of points prepared by thePrime Minister for communication toSir   Ao Clark Kerr should be used asthe basis of a communication to besent to the Ambassador by the foreign secretary for his general guidance.(c) that pending the Russian reaction tothe Prime Minister&apos;s message and toany arguments that Sir A. ClarkKerr might use, the Polish Governmentshould not be informed of the latest developments and should merely be told,if. they raised the matter, that discussion was still going on.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W0lo

Inconsequence of this, we waive our objection totalks not being in London and will send a delegation to the United States0     We still feel, however,that this delegation should be official and expert,and once the ground is clear and facts established,that higher authorities should theninterveneAs the fact that we are sending a delegationwill now become public property, I suggest that a communique on the following lines be issued:-&quot;The Governments of the United Statesand the United Kingdom are undertakingpreliminary and exploratory discussions onpetroleum questions,.      These discussionswill be, in the first instance, at theofficial and expert, level, and. will takeplace in Washington&quot;.As I am likely to be questioned inParliament on the subject,..! must reserve the rightto make it clear that no question arises of any transfer of existing rights or properties in oil.
