(44) 3RD CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE company nf ide nt ial Annex(10th January, 1944 - 5.0 p.ra. )FUTUREOPERATIONSSIR my/iN BROOKE said that it hod originally been our intention to push forward in Italy to a line runningapproximately from Res oar a to Cassino, and then to launchan amphibious operation, employing a force of about one division, to turn the enemy&apos;s flank.      Owing to themountainous nature of the country and to the very bad weather recently experienced, our advance had been seriouslydelayed.      The Pontine Marshes, whioh had been flooded,limited the area in which an amphibious attack could be delivered and. the force originally contemplated was too small for.an attack so far ahead of our front line.     Theonly-alternative to abandoning the amphibious operation was,therefore, to increase its strength.There was already in the Mediterranean the lift forone division.      At Cairo it had been agreed to cancel a proposed operation to capture the Andaman Islands, and this had made available the lift for a second division.      However,other operations in the Mediterranean theatre, which necessitated the provision of additional airfields inCorsica, gave rise to considerable requirements for landing craft, which were the bottleneck in the provision of forces for a larger amphibious operation.The Prime Minister had recently held a conference which was attended by the majority of the Commandersconcerned.      Certain readjustments in the dispositions ofour resources had been agreed, and, as a result, sufficientlanding craft were now available for the contemplatedoperation in Italy and would remain available until the end   ,of February.      There had ct one time been a danger that,while we should be able to provide sufficient craft for the.assault,we should not be able to find those required tomaintain theovercome.forces once they were ashore:    this had now beenIt was planned to make a landing north of the PontineMarshes with a force comprising one-British and one ,:imerj.candivision, two British Commandos, a force of British, and perhaps some American, armoured forces and one Americanairborne group       The objective for this force would be thehigh ground some 20 miles inland and 16 miles south of Romewhich commanded comarunications southwards from Rome.      Itwas hoped that this attack would create a situation whichwould force the enemy&apos;s right wing to retire and would pinchconsiderable enemy forces between it and the advancing 5thArray,     The assaulting force would be commanded by an AmericanGeneral - General Lucas, who had commanded a Corps in theSalerno landing and had the full confidence of general alexander.      It would be supported by a determined attacklaunched some d.appeal beforehand by our forces advancing towardsCassino, and, in order to contain enemy troops in EasternItaly, the 8th Army would also launch an attack.-1-

It was estimated that the enemy&apos;s build, up to oppose the landing might be of the order of one division per24 hours for the first three days.      This estimate did not make any ^allowance for delays imposed by the action of our air force&apos;s.The present distance betv;een cur front line and the pointselected for the landing w.&quot;s some 60 miles.      It was hopedthat this would be reduced before the attack was launched, .but,  in any enso, the Pontine iviarshes -would protect theright flank of our attacking force.SIR CHARLES PORTAL said that, so far as the air was concerned, the conditions for the operation now contemplatedwere much more favourable than those at Salerno.      In thelatter case, there were no airfields nearer than 180 milesfrom the beaches and these were only landing strips.-    Forthe present operation there were 7 aerodromes within the range of Spitfires with no nan 1 tankage;   a further 22 withinthe range of Spitfires carrying a 30 gallon overload tankand a further 39 if a 90 gallon overload tank were carried.There was,  therefore, no lack of airfields.      An adequatenumber of aircraft was also available,      This comprised15 squadrons of Spitfires totalling some 240 to 250 aircraft and 18 American squadrons totalling 450 aircraft.At the time of Salerno, the enemy hod some 700 aircraftbased in Italy, Corsica and Southern Prance, of which 360were&apos;bomb er, bomb er reco nna is sance or f ighter bomber a ircrnft. -He had now only some 320 aircraft with which to oppose ourlanding.      There were only .70 long range bombers -in theMediterranean and 40 of these were at present in Greece,We shDuld have no difficulty in obtaining and maintaining air superiority and providing adequate cover for the landing.      In addition to our fighter aircraftthere were approximately 1000 heavy and medium bombers whichit should be possible to employ against enemy communications and thus retard his buildup of forces to oppose the landing.SIR ANDREW CUNNINGHAM said that though the. beacheswere not too good and were not extensive for so large a force as two divisions, he felt that from a naval point.ofview the operation was not so difficult as previous operations which had-been successfully carried out.     The weather was likely to be the chief enemy and it would be essentialt.) wait for a period of suitable weather conditions beforelaunching the first attack.      The American Admiral, who would command the Naval forces, had been given authority to sink anumber of ships to provide a breakwater if he considered this necessary^The War Cab inet -Took, note of the above statements? and expressed their approval of the operational plan outlined above.^Offices of the War Cabinet,S, W. 10
