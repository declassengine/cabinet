The Foreign Secretary thought thatthe resulting document had been satisfactory.     greatly to his disappointment, however, tho Russian reaction hadbeen unfavourable.     The Foreign Secretary read to the WarCabinet a copy of a telegram No. 108 from Moscow reportingan interview which Mr. Balfour had with M. Molotov at10 p*m. on 16th January,The.Foreign Secretary said that he had met theRussian Ambassador that day &apos;t luncheon and had told him that he (the Foreign Secretary) was disappointed that theonly result of having porsuaded the Polish Government tomake a moderate statement had been, what ho had regarded asa blow in the face from the Soviet Government.     At this rate, no progress would result.     He feared that tho reaction of tho British and American public to the Soviet declar-ation would be unfavourable,     M, Gousev had said that it seemed to the Russians that their offer of the Curzon Linehad not been accepted.     He (the Foreign Secretary) hadrejoined that the Polish Government had made it clear thatthey were willing to discuss all outstanding points.The Foreign Secretary said that he had seen thePolish Ambassador before coming to tho War Cabinet that evening and had asked that the Polish Government should refrain from making any further public statement at thepresent time.
