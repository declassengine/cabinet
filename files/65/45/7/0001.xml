MINUTE confidential Annex(25th January, 1944 - 5.30 p.ra.)POLAND.(previous reference;3f.k.(44) 7thConclusions,Minute 2)The War Cabinet had before them the note of a conversation between the Prime Minister and the PolishMinisters oh the 20th January (W. P. (44) 48), about thePolish-Soviet problem, and in particular the Polish-Soviet frontier question.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the extreme difficulty of the problem which the Cabinet had.toconsider.      As the record of the conversation showed,the Polish Ministers had not been prepared to go very,far.     ?\fe had to face the fact that, once we agreed toRussia   having the Baltic States, and to the transfer to other areas of large masses of German population in East Prussia and East of the Oder    to&apos; make room fordispossessed Poles, we should be challenged on theground that such action was contrary to the atlantic charter.      The ideal position would be to postpone any decision about frontiers until after the war, and then to consider all frontier questions together.     But wewere not free agents in the matter.      The Russian armieswere advancing into Poland,      If no settlement wasreached between Russia and Poland, we had to face thefact that   when the Russians reached Warsaw they wouldprobably set up a Polish Government, based on a plebisite,having every aspect of democratic and popular foundation,and in full accord with the Russian view.     Nor oughtwe to ignore the fact that only Russian sacrifices andvictories held out any prospect of the restoration of a free Poland.      He was certain that it would be in thebest interests of Poland to accept/the Curzon Line   asthe basis for the Polish-Soviet frontier.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY reported that he had now received a further communication from the PolishGovernment.   This was under examination, andsought clarification or guarantees on a number ofimportant and difficult points. -The following points were made in the courseof the discussion that followed: -(a) Did the Russians really -want an independentPoland?     Or had they in view a puppet Government underRussian control and a Soviet Republic?     THE foreign secretary said that there were increasing signs whichpointed in the latter direction.      If there was any risk of this, H.M.G.  should consider carefully how farthey could now press the Poles to go to meet the Russianviewpoint.      It&quot;was noticeable that the RussianGovernment appeared to continue to modify their attitudetowards the Polish Government and that that attitudeshowed a progressive stiffening.-1-

(b) A difficult situation would   arise were thePolish Government now to: show themselves moreaccommodating and were Russia subsequently to defaultas regards the territories to be assigned to the newPoland.(c) If no settlement were now reached between russia and Poland, and the present Polish Governmentwere in. consequence to break up, the result would bea certain strain, or even some degree of estrangement,between Russia and the Western Powers.      This would becalamitous, and might carry in it the seeds of futurewars.        It was therefore incumbent on us to make every endeavour to secure an arrangement  if possible.    Further,there was no ground for holding that Russia would notin fact adhere to an arrangement reached,  iv that chetook a light view of treaty obligations..     And she had&apos;   -much to gain by maintaining the good relationsestablished at the Moscow and Teheran Conferences.Generally, we hod reason to believe that Russia wanted to co-operate with the United States,&apos; and with thiscountry^      .... - -(d) Further, action to bridge the present gapshould be taken as early as possible.     Delay meantdeterioration in the situation, since the bargaining position of the Polish Government would worsen rapidly as the Russians advanced over Polish territory.(e) The position would be eased if as the resultof further. negotiations the Poles could secure frontierswhich would give them Lvov.      This city was important to poland, both industrially and by reason of tradition andhistory.      It was pointed, out on the other hand thatLvov, though unquestionably largely a Polish city,was situated in country predominantly Ukrainian.    Furtherif the Poles secured Danzig (quite apart from the otherconcessions contemplated in Pomerania and Silesia) and thus a great port, a historic city, and an opening to the sea,they would not do so badly.      Nor were there grounds onwhich decisive objection could be raised to the Russianabsorption of Konigsberg.(f) The long history of Russian association with poland,and the fact that at no stage had we been in aposition ourselves to do anything to restore either tL,pre-war frontiers of Poland ^r any other frontiers, andthe sacrifices which Russia had &quot;made, strengthened Russia&apos;claim to full consideration in this matter.(g) An approach by the Prime Minister to premier stalin was the one most likely to produce satisfactory results.      Premier Stalin&apos;s views might well be different from those of the Russian Foreign Office,&apos; The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows:-(l) An immediate approach should be made to premier Stalin &quot;by the Prime.Minister, on thefollowing lines.

, The Prime Minister would state that, withthe Foreign Secretary and with the full authority of the Cabinet, he had discussed the whole position with the PolishGovernment,,      The result jf these discussionsQ        .   - was that the Polish Government had notrefused a settlement of the frontier question on the basis of the Curzon Line, subject to. -      certain ethnographical considerations.     But-,as was natural, the Polish Governmentrequired farther information on a number of points.      If the Russian Government were willing to proceed with negotiations .on&apos;thesame basis as that adopted by the PrimeMinister in his discussions with the Poles,;and would afford the clarifications whichthe Poles desired, H.M0G., for their part,,undertook that at the Peace Conference theirattitude on the Russian-Polish frontierwould be that which the Prime Minister hadtaken in his conversation with the PolishGovernment,The message should continue that it seemeda great pity that Premier Stalin shouldattack the Polish Government in exile,,Clearly,, when Poland had been liberated,its government would once more be based on .the people of that country..     But, at thepresent time, the established PolishGovernment were the only persons with whom it was possible to have negotiations onthis matter.(2) The Prime Minister undertook^-k t.-i prepare and submit to the War Cabinet a message to Premier Stalin, on the above lines..(3) The Polish Government should be informedthat the Prime Minister was communicating with the Russian Government, in the lightof his conversation with the PolishMinisters, it being made clear that thePolish Ministers were in no way committed by the Prime Minister^ communication.(4) For the time being, no information should begiven to the Dominion Governments as to the upshot of the conversation which the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary had had with the Polish Ministers on the 20th JanuaryOffices of the War Cabinet,S.

(43) 563).(b) A supplementary Report by the same Committee(&apos;.;.P. (44 ) 50).(c) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committeeon British Strategic Needs in the LevantStates (W.P.. (44) 46).THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OP home security thanked his colleagues for their very helpfulattitude throughout the work of this Committee.     Hepassed in review the principal recommendationsembodied in the Report (as summarised in paragraph 3)and drew attention to the note of dissent by theMinister of State recorded in paragraphs 14 to 16.The Ministerial Committee had reached theconclusion that a policy of partition was the best andpossibly, the only solution of the Palestine problem,and that the basis recommended by Lord Peel&apos;commission in 1933 was generally sound, subject tocertain variations.      The Committee had also come tothe conclusion that the moribund port of Jaffa andalso the Huleh area should be included in the jewish state,      They hod recommended in area than that recommendedbut which would have a JewishCommittee&apos;s scheme would also of the better land in Palestine.a Jewish State smallerunder the Peel Scheme,majority.     Thegive the Jews the bulkThe proposals in the.Committee&apos;s Report forthe association of the areas to be assigned to theArabs with a Greater Syria would, in the Committee&apos;view, go a long way to conciliating Arab hostilityand   criticism.      The Committee also recommendedthat the position of the Negeb should remain unsettled,pending further examination of the economicpossibilities of that area. *The details of the scheme proposed by the ^j Committee would require to be considered in detail bythe Colonial Office and would take some time to workout.

The War, Cabinet first considered, the substance of the recommendations in the Report.      The general view of Ministers was that, while opposition might beexpected from Jews and Arabs alike, the solutionrecommended by the Committee,  including- the JerusalemMandatory area and the arrangements proposed for theHuleh Salient and the Negeb, was probably   as good as any that could be devised and was fair to all parties concerned.      The Jews might be expected to criticise the scheme on thegrounds that it gave themtoo small a territory;    the Arabs, on the grounds thatit attributed to the Jews areas with substantial Arabpopulations and interests.      It could be safelyassumed, however, that any scheme put forward would meet with strong criticism and protests;    indeed wemust be prepared for considerable trouble in connectionwith internal security, once our decisions in this/matter had been made known.      The -general view of theWar Cabinet was that, once H.M. Government had taken adecision in favour&apos; of a particular solution they shouldbe prepared to go forward with it, and should not allow themselves to be deflected by opposition.VTHB FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he wished to reservehis final view as regards the scheme as a whole, pendingthe result of the private reference which he had made, with.M. Ambassadors in Cairo and Baghdad.     In particular^ he felt doubt about the attribution to the Jewish State of theHuleh area (possibly less the small&apos;corridor suggested in-W.P.(hh) 50 to connect Galilee with Greater Syria) and thenon-attribution at this stage of the Negeb to either theJewish or the Arab areas.&quot;THE MINISTER OF STATE referred to his note.of dissent and said that his difference with his&quot;colleagues was one of degree and not of principle.He anticipated that we should have to face trouble,and he felt that it was important that the case whichwe submitted to Parliament and the public should beas strong as possible.      He was disposed to the viewthat the scheme, as it stood, was unfair to theArabs, so far, in-particular, as concerned the Huleharea.The War Cabinet next considered the strategicalconsiderations, referred to in the Re nor t by the Chiefsof Staff &quot;XW. P. (44) 46). &apos;THE PRIMS MINISTER thought that the Chiefsof Staff had taken the view that the scheme of partitionproposed by the Ministerial Coramit-tee would be opposed by the Jews by force of arms.      He certainly did not contemplate that we should find ourselves in theposition of forcing on Palestine .a&apos; scheme of partitionwhich the Jewish community and p:.3Slbly also the Arabs,would resist with violence.The gene rol view of the War Cabinet was that,while strategic consideration must of course be fully safaguarded, the considerations &quot;advanced by the Chiefs-)f Staff were not such&apos;as to necessitate the -reconsideration of their general attitude towards therecommendations in the Report of the ministerial committee as a whole.

Reference was made to the difficulty of employing Indian troops to deal with disorder inPalestine,      It- v/as agreed tha t if a situation arose in vhich such disorders had to he dealt with,consideration would have to &quot;be given to the questionwhether other troops would not have to be employed for the purpose, &apos;   &quot;The War Cabinot then considered the questionof the timing of any decision? and the possiblereaction of any public announcement on the UnitedStates and on the forthcoming Presidential elections.There was general agreement with the view,that we should not make any announcement on thismatter until Germany had been defeated.      On theother hand, once Germany had been defeated, the soonerwe dealt with the Palestine situation the better.On the other hand, it Would take some timeto work, out the -details of the scheme put forward bythe Ministerial Committee.      This work&apos;.should go forward steadily, so that we should be in a positionto put forward a fully worked&quot; out scheme at any time,if a situation should arise which made it necessaryfor us to do so0In this connection, THE DEPUTY MINISTER of state RESIDENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST said that thegreatest importance should be attached to the proposedcreation of Greater Syria, with a view to reducingArab &apos; opposition to the committee&apos;a scheme. --.  It wouldbe very unfortunate if, -owing to a delay in dealingwith matter, we missed an opportunity of transferring.the Arab areas in Palestine to Greater Syria as a concession., and waited till we were faced with ademand on the matter. : -The War Cabinet expressed complete agreementwith.the importance attached by the ministerial committee to maintaining absolute secrecy as to theexistence of the Committee&apos;s proposals for a settlement and, of course, as to the nature of those proposals.In this connection, the CouKittee considered whether, on balance, there would be advantage in giving some advance information to the President of&apos;the United States and, possibly, to Dr. Weizman, tothe effect that, while H.M. Government had reached no decision, it seemed that -the hope of a solution layupon the lines of a scheme such as..that contemplated by the Ministerial Committee.&apos; The War Cabinet agreed that we should haveto consult the United States Government on thismatter, before a final decision, was reached.It was felt,&apos; however, that both president roosevelt and Dr, Weizman would be placed in an embarrassing position if-the outline of our scheme were to be communicated to&apos; them at the present time.The matter could, however^ be further considered in,say, three or four months&apos;&apos; time.    -

&apos; -  THE PRIME MINISTER said that the ministerial committee&apos;s Report had be en of the greatest value inclarifying the whole position.s    We were now in aposition to indicate, at short&quot; notice, the lines onwhich we hoped to deal with ,the Palestine problem,Q When Germany had been defected, we should have adefinite plan which, by that time, would have been   1fully worked out in all its details.The war Cabinet;&apos;s conclusions were asfollows:- &apos;(l) The Report-of the Ministerial Committee was approved, in principle, on the understandingthat any particular details of the scheme could, if necessary, be further examined,before a final decision&apos;was reached,&apos;    ..(2) It was of-the utmost importance that the strictest secrecy should be observed asto the existence and nature of the schemewhich had been drawn-up,   . Subject to anyunforeseen development, the existence of ...the scheme should not be publicly disclosed. or acti n taken upon it until after the&apos;./ defeat .of Germany.(3). The Colonial Secretary should, however,ensure that action proceeded without delay in working out. the recommendations of theRep rt and other-necessary preliminary. action,(4) No action should be taken, for the present,in regard &quot;to ascertaining in confidence theviews on the scheme of President Rooseveltor of Dr. V/eizman.      The question whetherthis should be done could be further-considered in, say, three or four months&apos;time,(5) Note was taken that, if a situation arose in which troops vnuld have to be used todeal with disorder in Palestine, it wouldhave to be c -nsidered whether -indian troops could be. used for this purpose.l  uJ*  of Me- /jXlfa*     tk*JiAiis*s*- AtAJcA, A^tuxoLOffices of the War Cabinet,-     &apos;    -      i s.w.i.
