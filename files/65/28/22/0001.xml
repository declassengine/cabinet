FightingFrance.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 142ndConclusions.Minute 3.)1. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the text ofa telegranr which he had sent to President Roosevelt on the previous day, and of the Presidents replyt Both these telegrams emphasised the importance of fusing all anti-German French forces together tomake a united Government.The Prime Minister added that the Foreign Secretary wasdealing with the measures necessary to this end.The War Cabinet took note of this exchange of telegrams.India.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 135thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 519) as to the reply to begiven to a Parliamentary Question about a suggestion thatMr. Rajagopalachari should visit this country.In discussion, the Lord Privy Seal said that he thought it was important that the answer given should not create the impression that we were half-hearted in our efforts to promote a settlement ofthe Indian problem. It might, however, be that there was someother way by which we could show that we were neglecting no opportunity of reaching a settlement on this matter.The Secretary of State for India thought that any discussions on Indian Constitutional questions should take place in India andnot in this country. Further, there was very little which we could usefully do on this matter at the present time. He agreed, however,that the form of the draft reply proposed in the Memorandummight be somewhat amended.After discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that a reply should be given by the Secretary ofState on the following lines : His Majesty&apos;s Government warmly welcomed anyendeavour which Mr. Rajagopalachari and other leaders might make to promote an agreed settlementof the Indian problem; but any such agreement must come about in India between the Indian parties. HisMajesty&apos;s Government therefore saw no advantage in mr. Rajagopalachari visiting this country. It shouldbe added that the Viceroy had already seen mr. Rajagopalachari during the last few days.Great George Street, S.W. 1,November 12, 1942.4 W^k$
PRIME MINISTER&apos;^ 108PERSONAL/TELEGRAM.Mo, 210* Serial No. T. 1485/2. iVFOR THE PRIME MINISTER PROM PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.I am very happy with the latest news of yourspendid campaign in Egypt, and of the success that hasattended our joint landing in West and North Africa.This brings up the additional steps that shouldfee taken when and if the south shor6 of the Mediterraneanis cleared and under our control.It is hoped that you with your Chiefs of Staffin London and I with the Combined Staff here may make a survey of the possibilities including forward movementdirected against Sardinia. Sicily, Italy, Greece and otherBalkan areas and including the possibility of obtainingTurkish support for an attack through the Black Seaagainst Germany&apos;s flank.In regard to de Gaulle, I have hitherto enjoyeda guiet satisfaction in leaving him in your hands -apparently I have now acquired a similar problem inbrother Giraud.   I wholly agree that we must preventrivalry between the French Emigre factions and I have noobjection to a de Gaulle Emissary visiting Kingpin inAlgiers.   We must remember that there is also a catfight in progress between Kingpin and Darlan each claimingfull military command of French Forces in North and WestAfrica.The principal thought to be driven home to all three of these priraadonnas is that the situation is to-day solely in the military field and that any decision byany one of them, or by all of them, is subject to review and approval of Eisenhower.Also I think it would be well to find out beforede Gaulle&apos;s man leaves for Africa just what his instructions are0

CLEAR mm LINE.FORMER NAVAL PERSON TO PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.Perjsonal ana SecreteNo. 188.It is surely of the highest importance tounify in every possible way all Frenchmen who regardGermany as the foe.   The invasion of unoccupied france by Hitler should give the opportunity for this.You will I am sure realise that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are under quite definite and solemnobligations to de Gaulle and his Movement.   We mustsee they have a fai.r deal.   It seems to me that you and I ought to avoid at all costs the creation of rivalFrench emigre governments each favoured by one of us.We must try to fuze all anti-German French forcestogether, and make a united Government.   This may take some time and nothing must prejudice the militaryoperations^ but we ought to make it clear to all parties what we want and what we are going to work for.W.S.G.11.11.42.
