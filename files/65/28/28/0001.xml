The War Cabinet were informed that the Lord presidents committee had had this question under consideration at their meeting on the 20th November. They had then been informed thatMrs. Tate, M.P., had given notice that, in the course of the debate on the Address, she would move an amendment in the following terms : &apos;&apos; But humbly regret that no mention is made in thegracious Speech of an intention on the part of the Governmentto compensate civilian women equally with civilian men fortheir war injuries.&quot;The Committee had also been informed that about 130 Members(including a number of Conservative members) had put their namesto the amendment, and that Mrs. Tate proposed to press it to a division. The Labour Party were committed to the principle of equal compensation. A situation of some difficulty might thereforearise. .The Lord Presidents Committee had reached the conclusionthat it would be desirable to offer some kind of Inquiry, with termsof reference closely related to Mrs. Tate&apos;s amendment. They hadfavoured a &quot;Committee of Inquiry&quot; rather than a RoyalCommission, or a Select Committee. They had invited the deputy prime Minister, in consultation with the Chief Whip and theMinisters principally concerned, and in the light of the discussion in the Committee, to settle the terms of reference of the proposed committee of Inquiry, and to seek the Prime Ministers concurrence in the arrangements proposed for handling the Debate on this amendment.The War Cabinet now had before them a Note by the Secretary(W.P. (42) 540) setting out the terms of reference to the proposed*&apos; Committee of Inquiry,&quot; which had been suggested after consulta-tion between the Ministers concerned.  These were as follows&apos;&apos; To examine the proposal that civilian women should be compensated equally with civilian men for war injuries, and toreport after examination of all the issues involved.1&apos;The War Cabinet were informed that preliminary soundingsshowed that the proposal to appoint a &quot; Committee of Inquiry &quot;composed of, say, a group of several independent persons, wouldnot be acceptable to the Labour Party, who took the view that theissue was essentially one for discussion by the House of Commons,and would press strongly for a Select Committee.In discussion it was suggested that the objections to theappointment of a Select Committee would be greatly reduced if theterms of reference to the Committee were so framed as to call for aReport on the facts, without recommendations on the issue ofprinciple, which would be reserved for discussion and decision by theHouse itself.
The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should declare their intentionof appointing a Select Committee, with the following terms of reference : &quot; To report on the effect of the proposal thatcivilian women should be compensated equally withcivilian men for war injuries, on the general principlesof compensation for injuries and on levels of remuneration,&apos;&apos;it being made clear that it was not part of the duty ofthe Committee to make recommendations on the issueof principle involved.(2) Agreed that the Deputy Prime Minister should announce this decision immediately after Mrs. Tate&apos;s amendmenthad been moved and seconded. The Minister of pensions would, therefore, wind up on behalf of the Government.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,November 24, 1942.
