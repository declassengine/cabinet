Man-Power. The War Cabinet had under consideration (Previous (1) A Memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilEeference: (W.P. (42) 539) setting out the major issues arising from.M. (42) 146th the Man-Power Survey (W.P. (42) 534).Conclusions, (2) A Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister setting putMinute 2.) the result of a Committee appointed to examine the. establishments-of the three Services (W.P. (42) 496).The Lord President said that the stated demands of the Serviceand Supply Departments to meet the planned strengths and programmes up to the end of 1943 totalled 2-5 million men andwomen. Against this demand the total foreseeable supply was1-6 million, giving a prospective deficiency of at least 900,000. Itwas clear that substantial cuts would have to. be made in Servicestrengths and the related supply programmes, and it was for theWar Cabinet to decide, in the light of strategic considerations, how this man-power deficiency should be shared between the three arms of the Fighting Services.Supply of Points in discussion : Manpower. (j) The War Cabinet accepted the conclusion that on thefacts presented in the memoranda before them it was unreasonable to assume that more than 1 - 6 million menand women could be made available for the Services and munitions during the 18 months up to the end of 1943.The Minister of Labour should therefore proceed on theassumption that 1-6 million represented the target inthe supply of man-power during this period at which he^should aim; and he was invited to discuss with theMinisters primarily concerned the measures required toenable these numbers to be withdrawn from civil life.(ii) It was suggested that special care should be taken to avoidwithdrawing highly skilled men from the munition industries into the Services,The Minister of Labour said that if the supply departments would agree to the withdrawal of a relatively small number of highly skilled men, he wouldbe able to meet the Service needs with a smaller totalnumber of skilled men. If highly skilled men could beprovided for the Services, they could themselves trainup to a sufficient degree of proficiency some of the semi-skilled men already in the Services.(iii) The Minister .of Labour and National Service suggestedthat Parliament should be made aware of the stringencyof the man-power position. He would like to take anearly opportunity of including some of the salient figures in a statement to the House of Commons in secret session.It was generally ageed that, when the War cabinet had reached conclusions on these questions, parliament should be informed in Secret Session of the main features of the situation. ! -:(iv) A preliminary discussion ensued as to the factors to beborne in mind in determining how the reductions intheir demands should be apportioned between the three* Fighting Services and the munition industries.Supply. (v) Instances were cited in which stocks of certain items.of equipment were being accumulated at rates greatly inexcess of consumption. It was urged that there wasroom for much closer adjustment of production programmes to the current needs of the Services in thevarious theatres of war. It was explained that special steps were already being taken to subject Service scales of equipment to the closest scrutiny, This would leadto some reduction in requirements, but the results interms of man-power were not expected to be very, substantial.
Navy.Defence against air attack.Defence againstinvasion.Air.(vi) In the present phase of the war the gravest dangerconfronting. us was the U-boat menace. The highest priority must therefore be accorded to vessels and weapons for use against the U-bpat. The Admiraltymight, however, have to accept some slowing down inother parts of their programme, particularly in theconstruction of men of war of the larger categories(battleships and cruisers).(vii) It seemed unlikely that this country would have to faceas heavy a weight of air attack as that encountered inthe blitz two years ago. This should enable some reduc-tions to be made in the Air Defence of Great Britain,and in Civil Defence personnel. It also had a bearing on the amount of anti-aircraft ammunition which it wasnecessary to accumulate.(viii) The risks of invasion or of large-scale air-borne attackcould largely be discounted in the period up to, say, the30th June, 1943. Some reduction in the scale of ourprecautions against these risks could therefore beaccepted. Thus, consideration might be given to thepossibility of diverting some part of the R.A.F.Regiment to other duties. Again, the special measures now being taken to raise the Home Guard above the ceiling of If millions might be discontinued; and, inaddition, means might be found of releasing to theReserve a considerable number of men in the home guard who had undergone training, on the under-standing that they could be recalled as and when required.(ix) The man-power requirements of the R.A.F. were based inthe main on the assumption that the output of aircraft in this country would reach 100 per cent, of the authorised programme about the end of 1943. this assumption might not be realised, especially if M.A.P.could not obtain their full requirements of labour and machine tools. On present plans, it looked as though theexpansion of R.A.F. personnel would run ahead of theaircraft which, on a conservative estimate, they were likely to receive.Discussion followed regarding the proportions in which theman-power deficiency should be shared between the three branchesof the Armed Forces.The War Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would draw, up in t!helight of the discussion, proposals for distributing betweenthe three branches of the Armed Forces the prospectivedeficiency in man-power during 1943. These proposals would be. circulated to the Ministers concerned, and afurther meeting of the War Cabinet would be held earlyin the following week.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,November 27, 1942.
