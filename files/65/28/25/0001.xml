TheDominions.,Post WarMigration.A&quot;1. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W-P&quot;(42) 490) asking for authority to consult Dominion Governments now as to their probable attitude towards migration after the war.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had had some consultations on this question with Field-Marshal Smutsand with Ministers of other Dominion Governments, and he believed that discussions on this question would be generally welcomed by Dominion Governments. He proposed, in his approach to the Dominions, to deal not only with British migration, but also with the migration of other Europeans to the Dominions.Mr. Bruce supported the proposal put forward in theMemorandum. Before giving assurances about their post-warimmigration policy, Dominion Governments would, however, wishto know what assumptions they could make regarding the world economic order in the post-war period. The recent discussions with dominion representatives on the external economic problems of thepost-war period would provide a useful background against whichDominion Governments could consider.the question of migration.In the past one of the difficulties in promoting emigrationfrom this country had been the reluctance to forfeit rightsacquired to benefits under schemes of social insurance in thiscountry. It would be helpful if means could be found of over-coming this difficulty, e.g., by agreements between Governmentsunder which an emigrant could carry with him the rights whichhe had acquired, so that he could start with an equivalent creditunder the system of social insurance in force in the country towhich he emigrated. It was generally agreed that this problemmight profitably be considered in connection with the proposed discussions on the question of post-war migration.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (1) to make an early approach to Dominion governments on the lines indicated in W:P. (42) 490;(2) to consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequerregarding the possibility of devising a scheme forovercoming the difficulty referred to at &quot; A &quot; above.Reconstruction 2. Mr. Bruce said that, when the study of reconstruction problems. problems had been carried to a stage at which policy was beingInformation formulated, he would welcome a discussion with the Secretary offor Dominion State for Dominion Affairs. In most of the Dominions similarGovernments, problems would arise, and it would be a great advantage to DominionGovernments if they could be kept informed of the progress madehere in the preparation of plans for dealing with these questions.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toconsider what arrangements should be made to ensurethat Dominion Governments obtained such information about our reconstruction plans as would assist them indealing with similar problems likely to arise in theDominions.Reconstruction        3.   The Prime Minister thought that it would be a good planProblems^       if the War Cabinet were to have periodic meetings, say, once a procedure for   quarter, to take stock of the work being done on Reconstructionhandling        questions.   The War Cabinet would not necessarily give finalreconstruction, approval to the plans prepared, but they would have an opportunityof saying whether they thought that the work was being under-taken broadly on the right lines, or whether they would wish anyproblems to be examined on rather a different basis.[21651] . . &apos;.  &apos;   b 2    V
Problems.progress report by the paymaster-General.If full use was to be made, when the time came, of the pre-paratory work, it was essential that Ministers should be aware ofthe general lines of the work in hand.4. The War Cabinet had before them the First progress report by the Paymaster-General (W.P. (42) 347) describing themachinery for organising and co-ordinating the study of recon-struetibn problems, and setting out a comprehensive list of the memoranda which either had been or were being prepared by departments.The Eeport dealt in particular with the work of the Committeeon Internal Economic Problems, and submitted an Interim Reportof that Committee on the Post-War Transitional Period. This setout certain assumptions on which the Committee were proceeding,which were recommended by the Ministerial Committee on Recon-struction Problems for the approval of the War Cabinet.The Paymaster-General invited special attention to the summary of this. Report set out in paragraphs 6-9 of his memorandum.General discussion of these problems ensued, of which thefollowing were the main points ;:--*\(1) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that itwould take longer to re-tool the engineering industryafter this war than after the last war. It would there-fore be of the first importance, from the point of viewof employment, to get the building industry started as quickly as possible. For this purpose a long-term programme should be laid down, and arrangements should be made with the building industry for the absorption of the additional labour required. Hethought that arrangements could be made to absorb1Q0.00O new trainees each year.This suggestion met with approval, and it wasagreed that the necessary measures should be taken.-(2) In connection with the rehabilitation of our export trade,it was agreed that we should do all that we could toreach an understanding with the United States on post-war economic and financial policy. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that, he hoped that talks with theUnited States authorities would soon be started.Several Ministers also emphasised the importance,from the point of view of export trade, Of maintaining a stable price level and of ensuring a right relationship between the prices which producers of raw materialswere called upon to pay for manufactured articles,&quot;and vice versa.The War Cabinet-(1) Expressed general approval of the Paymaster-General&apos;sProgress Report (W.P. (42) 347), and in particular of paragraphs 6-9, as giving the general backgroundagainst which other reconstruction problems should beconsidered.(2) Asked the Paymaster-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to arrange   for a Com-mittee to be convened for the purpose of-       .(a) settling the demarcation of. duties between theMinister of Works and vPlahhihg said; theMinister, of /Health;ineregardqto the^post-war programme\df the building industry;(b) arranging -foiZ-sc .;jrepor.$; &apos;toyjfeV-.sAbm&apos;t^ed:: -the(- Reconstruction Problems Committee on the post-war programme of the building imdustey.The War Cabinet approved this procedure.
5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the paymaster-General (W.P. (42) 498) covering (i) The Second Interim Report of, the Official Committee on post-War Internal Economic Problems, on the Demobili-sation and Resettlement of Labour,(ii) The Interim and Einal Reports of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on the Machinery of Demobilisation.In his Memorandum, the Paymaster-General, as Chairman ofthe Committee on Reconstruction Problems, asked the War Cabinetto approve the line of action proposed in these Reports.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet-(a) Recorded their general agreement with the conclusions inthese Reports, as summarised in the Paymaster-General&apos;s Memorandum, as a basis for furtherpreparatory work.(b) Authorised the action during the war set out in para-graph 6 (a) of the Paymaster-General&apos;s Memorandum.(c) Agreed that the Paymaster-General should make a short statement during the Debate on the Address on the lines proposed in paragraph 12 of his Memorandum.(d) Agreed that the Departments concerned, without any detailed publicity, should proceed with any necessarypreparatory steps on the general lines of the Report.(e) Decided that it would be for them, and hot for the Chiefs ofStaff, to say at what date a preliminary warning shouldbe issued to Departments to complete their preparations for demobilisation (see paragraph 10 of the Paymaster-General&apos; s Memorandum).Reconstruction 6. The War Cabinet approved a Memorandum by theProblems. Paymaster-General (W;P. (42) 507 (Revise)) containing an outlineOutline of of the Statement which he proposed to make in fulfilment of anStatement by undertaking which he had given to the House of Commons on thethe Paymaster- 29th September.*General.7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Minister of Works and Planning and the paymaster-General (W.P. (42) 528) regarding the nature of theauthority which should be responsible for central planning andcontrol over the use of land.It was pointed out in the.Memorandum that, while there was strong support for a national and positive approach to the problemof planning the best use of land, there was a divergence of viewregarding the authority to which the powers of central planning should be entrusted. One view, endorsed by Lord Justice ScotfsCommittee on Land Utilisation in Rural Areas and Mr. JusticeUthwatfs Committee on Compensation and Betterment, was that responsibility for planning the best use of land should beentrusted to a permanent commission, answerable to the Chairmanof a Cabinet Committee responsible for surveying and planning thegeneral economic policy of the Government. The Opposite view,exemplified in a Report which Lord Samuel had presented to theMinister of Works and Planning in July, was that planning thebest use of land was a function which so vitally concerned theReconstructionProblems.demobilisation and Eesettle-ment.CentralPlanningAuthority.*Hansard, Cols. 672-3.(3) In: the light of (2) the Minister of Labour and NationalService was asked to conclude an agreement vv i th . the.   building industry in regard to post-War training andentry into the industry.
whole nation in all its interests that it could not properly beentrusted to a Commission, but must remain under the direct control of Parliament exercised through a Minister of Planning.The Reconstruction Problems Committee, after reviewing thearguments on both sides, recommended that the responsibility for control of the use of land should be assigned to a Minister of planning, who would be responsible to Parliament; but that, inaddition, there should be a Commission to assist the Minister inconnection with the ownership and management of developmentrights (if it were decided to accept the scheme for the acquisitionof development rights recommended by the Uthwatt Committee)-and with any other work which the Minister might refer to them from time to time, e.g., the management of National Parks or ofproperty requisitioned for war purposes and no longer required for those purposes.The Committee recommended that the Paymaster-general should announce, in his forthcoming Survey of reconstruction problems, that the Government favoured an arrangement by whichthe powers of tJhe central planning authority would be entrusted toa Minister of Planning, assisted by a Commission; but they thought it would be preferable at this stage not to define, tooclosely the allocation of functions as between the Commission andthe Minister of Planning.It was pointed out in the Memorandum that in Scotland thepowers of a Minister of Planning - would be exercised by theSecretary of State for Scotland, and that the question whether aCommission should operate in Scotland required further considera-tion in the light of the different Government machinery in thatcountry.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 of w.P. (42) 528.(2) Agreed that the Paymaster-General should make anannouncement on these lines in the House of Commons,- in the course of his forthcoming survey of reconstruction problems; and that the Minister of Works and planning should simultaneously make a similar statement in theHouse of Lords.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,November 19, 1942.
