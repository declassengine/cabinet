Minister of Information.Sir Edward Bridges, Secretary.Prisoners of The Foreign Secretary informed the War Cabinet that theWar- Germans were increasing the tension over the prisoners of war(Previous       issue.   He read several extracts from statements picked up by our reference:      monitoring service, in which the Germans alleged breaches on ourW.M. (42) 141st part of the Geneva Conventions.   Among the instances given was conclusions,     an alleged British air attack on a field hospital in North Africa.Minute 4.) Taken as a whole, these messages exhibited the typical actionwhich the Germans would be taking if they meant to denounce the geneva Conventions in the course of the next day or so. Fie thoughtit only right that his colleagues should be aware of the position andshould have an opportunity of considering whether any action was called for at this juncture.[24534]
The War Cabinet were also informed that M. Preiswerk, therepresentative of the Protecting Power in this country, had askedfor complete figures of the number of German prisoners whom wehad chained. The view taken was that, on the whole, it was undesirable to give these figures at this juncture.The War Cabinet were also informed that, although theGermans had made no definite statement that they had chained three times as many prisoners as we had chained in the first instance, theinference to be drawn from some of the figures which had beengiven rather seemed to show that they had taken this action. Theposition in this respect was, however, far from clear.The War Cabinet were reminded that the last paragraph ofthe telegram which we had sent to the Swiss Government on the13th October reads as follows : &quot; His Majesty?s government therefore invite the Protecting Power to lay before the GermanGovernment their solemn protest against this breach of the geneva convention and to urge them to desist from it, in which case the counter-measures of a similar character which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment felt themselves forced to take in order to protect theirprisoners of war in enemy hands would be immediately withdrawn.&quot;No answer had been received from the German Government.Field-Marshal Smuts suggested that the right course would bethat we should press the Protecting Government to obtain an answer from the German Government on this matter. In themeantime, we should take no action, but should await the next moveby the German Government.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with this view.It was also felt that, should the German Government denounce the Geneva Conventions, we should not take any hasty action. Itwould be necessary to see how public opinion in this country reactedto such a development, and there would have to be full consultationwith the Dominion Governments and with the United States.Discussion ensued as to the motives behind the enemy&apos;s action.It seemed likely that this was a deliberate attempt to increase the tension during the winter months and to stir up hatred among theGerman people against us. They probably also hoped to hamperthe effectiveness of our Commando raids and of our bombing attacks on Germany. Perhaps, also, they wished to get as much work aspossible out of the prisoners in their hands.It was pointed out that public opinion in this country had not so far been informed of the increase in tension over this issue andthat some public indication should be given of the way in which theposition seemed to be developing.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows : -(1) The Foreign Secretary should send a further telegram tothe Swiss Government, pointing out that we had received no reply to our telegram of the 13th October (No. 2799to Switzerland), and asking when we might expect toreceive one.(2) The Foreign Secretary and the Minister of information should consult together as to the guidance which shouldbe given to the Press on this matter.(3) The Lord Privy Seal was invited to prepare, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, a statement of theatrocities and breaches of the Conventions of which theenemy had been guilty.(4) Pending further developments of the situation, no furtherdecision should be taken. Should the German Govern-ment denounce the Geneva Conventions, there wouldhave to be the fullest consultation with the DominionGovernments and the United States of America before any action was decided upon.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 23, 1942.
W .M . (42)  144 thC ONCLUSIONS .Thursday , 22nd 0 etch er, 1942 .Fuller Note of certain Points raised in thePis cussion.After the Foreign Secretary had. explained therecent developments which led. him to think that theGermans were likely to denounce the Geneva convention in the near    future,    THE PRIME MINISTER said that whileit was right for the Cabinet to look at the position,he thought there was no reason to reach a decision that night.    It was clear that the Germans were working up an agitation on this matter.   This would be carried toa certain point, but    the German Army would not like this development.   He strongly favoured taking no action,and waiting for a few days to see how the situationdeveloped.FIELD-MARSHAL SMUTS thought that we should not be unduly worried by the reports received which suggestedimpending action by the Germans .   We should, however,press the Protecting Power to obtain an answer from theGerman Government on the matter.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that if we took no action we ran the risk of finding ourselves in a very difficult position if the Germans denounced the Geneva. Convention.Unless we were prepared to follow the Germans in furtherreprisals, we should, then have to choose betweencontinuing to keep 1,300 prisoners with their handstied, and withdrawing the order for tying the hands ofprisoners.   He thought that it would be wiser if wewere to say now that we had referred the matter to the protecting Power, and. that, in order to facilitate asettlement, we proposed to rescind, the order for tying

Great George Street, S.W.I.the   hands of German prisoners, without (waiting for theenemy to take similar action-.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was not preparedto rescind the order because of German threats.The Ministers present were invited to give theirviews.   With the exception of the Lord Privy Seal, all ministers present took the view that,    for the timebeing, we should take no further action (beyond pressing the Protecting Power to obtain an answer from   the GermanGovernment) and. await developments .   The Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, while agreeing with thisview,    thought    that we ought to look ahead.   opinion in this country was divided.,    and while   some were adopting a firm attitude, others thought    that we werein grave danger of being led, by a policy of retaliation,into barbarous practices.
