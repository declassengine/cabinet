North Africa.(previous preference-:W.M. (42) 154thConclusions,Minute 1.)The War Cabinet had before them the following documentscirculated as W.P. (42)537 :-(a) Telegram from Field-Marshal Smuts to the Prime Minister,dated the 20th November.(6) Draft text of the protocolto be signed between general eisenhower and Admiral Darlan.(c) Telegram from General Eisenhower to the Combined Chiefsof Staff, dated the 20th November, commenting on thedraft protocol.(d) Telegram,   dated  the   19th  November,   from   general eisenhower to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, emphasised-sising the need for speed in arriving at a decision on thedraft protocol.(e) Telegram from J.S.M., Washington, to the Chiefs of Staff,setting out the Presidents views in regard to the draftprotocol..The War Cabinet also had before them two telegrams aboutnegotiations with French West Africa, circulated as W.P. (42) 536.The Prime Minister thought it would be a pity that general eisenhower should be worried at this critical moment with detailedamendments to the draft protocol. He thought that we should send a telegram to Washington saying that we concurred in . the presidents views (as set out in the telegram at (e) above). He didnot regard the so-called draft protocol as a diplomatic document,but rather as a transaction in the field.It was true that in paragraph 2 of Part I of the draft protocolit was stated that by common agreement among leading french officials in North Africa a High Commissioner in French north africa had been established in the person of Admiral Darlan. Butthis did not mean that we were committed to Admiral Darlan beingHigh Commissioner for all time. This paragraph was a recital ofthe facts. While, of course, all undertakings given must behonourably adhered to, there would be nothing to prevent general eisenhower from pressing for some broadening of the basis ofgovernment in French North Africa at a later date, if circumstances should render this course desirable. This was, indeed, the view ofthe position taken by General Eisenhower in his comments on thedraft protocol (see (c) above).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hethought that General Eisenhower was wrong in stating that a clear distinction must be drawn between the preamble (i.e., Part I of the protocol) and the agreement itself. Such a distinction was notvalid and could not be sustained. If the draft protocol was signed by General Eisenhower and Admiral Darlan, it would hold the fielduntil it was revoked or some other document was substitutedtherefor. He thought that the document had been very cleverlydrafted from the point of view of Admiral Darlan, and gave thelatter far more than was necessary to secure his help in gettingco-operation with the French forces and population in North Africa.There was the further point that the protocol in its present form was not consistent with what President Roosevelt had publiclystated. The consequences of any such inconsistency would failmainly on the President, but we could not avoid all responsibility.The Foreign Secretary suggested that a telegram should be sentto Washington, welcoming the Presidents suggestion that, for anagreement signed by General Eisenhower and Admiral Darlan,there should be substituted a unilateral declaration, of whichAdmiral Darlan would signify his acceptance; and also suggestingcertain amendments to the document itself. Thus, he would like tosuggest that the whole of Part I should be dropped, subject to theretention from it of certain phrases which would be incorporated in&quot;the first article of Part II.In the course of further discussion, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that in the present military situation we ought&quot; not to take any risks. We were dependent upon French support for
communications by road and rail and port facilities, all of whichwere necessary if we were to concentrate our forces east of Algeriaas quickly as possible. Time was of the essence in the matter, as itwas important to avoid giving the enemy an opportunity toestablish himself strongly in Tunisia.- The Prime Minister said that, if we were to suggest the deletionof Part I of the draft protocol, he felt sure that General Eisenhowerwould say that we were seeking to remove an essential part of theagreement which had been reached. Moreover, since the french forces in Tunisia were now coming over to our side, we had already received the benefits of the bargain made. He was convinced thatit was wrong to treat this as a diplomatic document, and that theright course was to accept the President^ view of the matter. Atthe same time, if, we did so, we must recognise that.general eisenhower might say that he was committed to the existing formof the protocol and could not withdraw therefrom at this stage.The Foreign Secretary said that in the last resort he agreedthat, if General Eisenhower took this view, we should have to accept it. He would have greatly preferred to have made an attempt toobtain alterations in the substance as well as the form of the document. But he was reluctantly prepared to agree to adopt the presidents suggestion, if this was the general view of the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet-Decided that President Roosevelt should be informed thatwe entirely agreed with his views (as reported in the telegram at (e) above), and, in particular, agreed that everyeffort should be made to avoid the form of a protocol orother diplomatic document. Copies of this telegram shouldbe sent to General Eisenhower and to the Joint StaffMission for the information of the Combined Chiefs ofStaff.The War Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Wax-Transport had pointed out that the terms of the protocol should provide that all British and Allied ships (including Danish), whichhad been seized by the French and put on the French Register andrenamed, should be restored to us without condition. It was believed that there was a large amount of such shipping in french north African ports, but the point was not dealt with in Article 8of the draft protocol. The Admiralty had also suggested that thedraft protocol ought to be amended in order to provide that weshould receive prior notice of the movement of French ships.For the reasons indicated earlier in the discussion, the WarCabinet Decided that we could not ask at this stage for the draftprotocol to be amended to take account of these points.- Instructions could, of course, be sent to the appropriatelocal representatives to ask that steps should be taken tosecure the objects in view by other means,i The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that LordLords. Vansittart had put down a paper for the debate in the House ofLords in the following week, calling attention to the installation of admiral Darlan as High Commissioner in French North Africa,and asking whether any other Quislings besides Flandin and.Pucheu were being imported into North Africa.The War Cabinet-Agreed that it was undesirable that such a motion shouldbe debated at this juncture, more particularly in opensession.    Representations   should   be   made   to   LordVansittart to this effect.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,November 21, 1942.
