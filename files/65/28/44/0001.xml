India.&quot;Request byChamber of princes forStatement ofPolicy byHis Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(Previous        i.Reference:W.M. (42) 132ndConclusions,Minute 2.)&quot;A&quot;1.   At their meeting on the 6th October the War Cabinet had; agreed that the Viceroy should be given an opportunity of com-menting on the draft of the assurance which it was proposed to give to the Chamber of Princes.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 610) covering an exchangeof telegrams with the Viceroy. The latter still held the view that,in place of a short statement designed for publication, it would be preferable to send a longer explanation in the form of a private letter from his Political Secretary to the Pro-Chancellor of theChamber of Princes.The Secretary of State for India said that, since this question was last discussed by the War Cabinet, he had taken advantage ofa Parliamentary Question by Mr. W. W. Astor, M.P., on the3rd December to make a public declaration to the effect that theobligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government, by treaty or otherwise,towards the Indian States remained unaffected by the negotiationsconducted by Sir Stafford Cripps during the course of his mission to India. (The text of the Question and Answer were reproduced in Annexure &quot; C &quot; of his Memorandum.) The heed for a public declaration oil this point having thus been met, he saw no reason todissent from the view taken by the Viceroy; and he therefore recommended that the further explanations and assurances desired by the Chamber of Princes should be given in a private letter on thelines of the Viceroy&apos;s draft.It was agreed that, in the changed circumstances, the matter could appropriately be dealt with on these lines. It would, however,be necessary that the private letter should be linked up with thepublic statement made by the Secretary of State for India in theHouse of Commons; and, further, that the letter should be an expression of the Viceroy&apos;s views and should not purport to be an expression of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Thusparagraph 1 of the Viceroy&apos;s draft should include a reference to thestatement by the Secretary of State for India, and should omit the concluding words: &quot; and to make it clear at the outset that theterms of this letter have been expressly authorised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.&quot;The War Cabinet  v, . , Invited the Secretary of State for India to authorise theViceroy to arrange for a letter to be sent to the Pro-Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes on the lines of thedraft set out in his telegram No. 3500-P, dated the14th December, subject to amendments designed to meet thepoints mentioned at &quot;A &quot; above.U.S.S.R. 2.   The War Cabinet were informed that at a recent meetingParliamentary    of the Labour Party a resolution had been passed favouring the delegation.       despatch of a delegation to the U.S.S.R. for the discussion of problems of common interest.  This suggestion had been discussedinformally with M. Maisky, who had thought it would be well received by his Government. -... In discussion, it was pointed out that it would be difficult forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to facilitate a visit to Russia by a delegation representing only one political Party.   On the other&apos;. hand, there would be advantages in sending a small but strongParliamentary delegation, representing each of the main political parties and both Houses of Parliament.   It would be important.:. that the members of such a delegation should be carefully chosen. Itshould not, of course, include any-Ministers; and it should, ifpossible, be limited to about seven persons.
The War Cabinet-Invited the Dominions Secretary and the Foreign Secretaryto consider the possibility of arranging for a Parlia-mentary delegation on these lines and to report further tothe Prime Minister, after consulting, with the Speaker andthe Lord Chancellor.Prisoners of 3,   The War Cabinet were reminded that on the 18th DecemberWar. , we had informed Dominion Governments that we thought the best(Previous course was to defer any reply to the latest German Note, at leastReference: until we saw how the position developed in the near future.

The Prime Minister said that President Roosevelt had now agreed that Our representative in North Africa should have the title of &quot; Minister Resident at Allied Headquarters.&quot; It was hoped to announce this appointment on the following day.The Prime Minister asked the Foreign Secretary to submit tohim the draft of a short directive to the Minister-Resident, whowould report direct to him (the Prime Minister).The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this statement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
