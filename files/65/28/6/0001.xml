Russia.Supplies andMilitaryAssistance.(Previous.-Reference:W.M. (42) 135thConclusions,Minute 1.)Prisoners of .War.1. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram from president Roosevelt, in reply to the telegram despatched after theMeeting of the War Cabinet on the previous day.In the light of this reply, the War Cabinet agreed on the termsof a telegram to be sent to Premier Stalin, and authorised itsdespatch.2. The War Cabinet considered the situation resulting fromthe German Governments threat to put in chains British prisonersof war captured at Dieppe. .The War Cabinet were informed of the history of this matter.In the Dieppe raid the Germans had captured an order to the effectthat, whenever practicable, the hands of prisoners of war shouldbe tied so that they could not destroy their documents.There was nothing in the Geneva Convention about tying thehands of prisoners, although Article 2 stated that prisoners should at all times be humanely treated and protected, particularly againstacts of violence, from insults and from public curiosity. The WarOffice took the view that there was nothing in the Convention, either in the spirit or in the letter, which prevented the hands of prisonersbeing tied where this was done (as an alternative to shooting them)to prevent their escape. They had felt, however, that it was difficultto justify the order to tie the hands of prisoners in order to prevent them destroying their papers. A public statement had accordingly been issued that if any such order had been issued it would becountermanded.The German threat to chain the prisoners captured at Diepperesulted from a raid made on the Island of Sark on the night ofthe 3rd October. On this occasion a small British force which had landed in the Island had gone to the annex of an hotel and hadtaken prisoner five Germans who had been in bed, and had proceeded to take them to the shore. Their hands had been tied in front ofthem in order that their captors might link arms with them while taking them past some neighbouring barracks where German troops were quartered. At this point the Germans had endeavoured to escape. Four of them had been shot while escaping, but the fifthhad been brought off.It was pointed out to the War Cabinet that the geneva convention expressly prohibited measures of reprisal againstprisoners. The German Governments threatened action was, there-fore, an infringement of the Convention.While the Germans had more British prisoners than we hadGerman prisoners, if Italians were taken into account we hadsubstantially more Italian and German prisoners than the germans and Italians had British prisoners. It was suggested that theGerman Government could not afford to disregard the possibilityof retaliation against Italian prisoners.After discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the following statement should be issued bythe War Office&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government repeat the declaration that they do not and will not countenance any orders forthe tying of the hands of prisoners of war taken in thefield.The action of the German Government in takingreprisals against the British prisoners of war in their hands is expressly forbidden by Article 2 of the geneva convention.Nevertheless, should the German Government persistin their intention, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be compelled, in order to protect their Own prisoners of war,to take similar measures upon an equal number of enemyprisoners of war in their hands!&quot; &apos; ;
Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 8, 1942.Despatch of 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the ChiefsAdditional of Staff (W.P. (42) 449.) This Report pointed out that from theChinese Troops military point of view there was no great objection to the proposalto India. and no great advantage in it, and that the issue should, be decided(Previous       on political grounds. On these grounds it was thought that GeneralEeference:      Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s offer should be warmly accepted, although thew.M. (42) 130th difficulties of the project should be pointed out.Conclusions, The view of the War Cabinet was that, on balance, the minute 1.) advantage lay in accepting General Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s offer. Thedraft telegram, to the Commander-in-Chief, India (Annex II of w.P. (42) 449), however, laid, somewhat too much emphasis on thepractical difficulties.The War Cabinet accordingly (1) Agreed that General Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s offer should beaccepted.(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with the ForeignOffice and the India Office, to arrange for the telegram to be amended in the light of the discussion, and despatched, without further reference to the WarCabinet.
