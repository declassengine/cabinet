The Colonies. 1,   The War-Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumFuture Colonial by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for ForeignPolicy. Affairs, the Lord Privy Seal, and the Secretary of State for the(Previous        Colonies (W.P. (42) 544) about future colonial policy.  The colonialReference;      question had been raised in America in an acute form, and someW.M.(42)l54th statement on the subject by His Majesty&apos;s Government was necessaryConclusions,     to enlighten American public opinion. A unilateral declaration had minute 3.)      been contemplated, but His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had reported thatMr. Cordell Hull had in mind a Joint Statement by; say, the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom, the Dutch and perhaps the Chinese,which would stress the conception of the responsibility of the&quot; parent States.&quot;Annexed to the Memorandum were draft instructions to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington -(i) setting out the points which it was suggested should beincluded in the declaration, and proposing that Mr. Hullshould be sounded on the,matter (Annex II (A));(ii) asking him to explain privately to Mr. Hull that we hadin mind Regional Commissions composed of representa-tives of the &quot; parent States&quot; which had interests in colonial territories in each of the main regions concerned.Such regions might be the Far East, Africa and theWestern Atlantic (Annex II (B) j.General agreement was expressed with the course proposed inthe Memorandum.Discussion turned mainly on the four points, which it wassuggested should be embodied in the declaration (Annex II (A)).The following amendments were agreed to : Point (3) should read as follows :- &quot; The parent States &quot;must aim to promote the social,economic and political well-being of peoples who are unable,without danger to themselves and to others, to assume full responsibility for their affairs. Defence having been assured,the parent States, with their special qualifications for the task,must accept the duty of guiding and developing the social andpolitical institutions of the territories with which they areconcerned, that their peoples may in due course be able todischarge the other responsibilities of Government.&quot;The first sentence of paragraph 4 should read as follows : *&quot; By this combination of defence and orderly development,the parent States will fulfil their responsibilities to thosepeoples and enable them to enjoy rising standards of life andto continue their advance along the path of progress.&quot;In the second sentence of paragraph 4, for &quot;the promotion of purely commercial ends&quot; read &quot;forthe promotion merely of commercial ends.&quot;The text of the draft telegram shown as Annex II (B) was-agreed to without alteration.The question was raised whether anything should be said aboutthe responsibility of the Regional Commissions, referred to in this draft telegram. It was thought better to say nothing about thispoint. The Regional Commissions would be composed of advisersof the parent States, to whom they would be responsible.The Minister of Information referred to the need for, say, aweek&apos;s time to prepare public opinion in the United States before there was any publicity on this subject. rThe Secretary of State for the Colonies said that president roosevelt&apos;s Personal Representative to the Caribbean had just
arrived in this country. Ijt might be difficult to avoid sayinganything to him about the proposed declaration during the courseof his visit. He proposed that he should discuss this point laterwith the Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and ForeignAffairs, and act in consultation with them.  This was agreed to.The War Cabinet-Approved the despatch of the two telegrams in Annex II,as amended, after the necessary consultations had takenplace with the Dominions.Ceylon. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theConstitutional  Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 564).Eeform. jn September 1941 the Governor of Ceylon had given Ministers(Previous in Ceylon an assurance that the urgency and importance of theEeferenee: reform of the Constitution was fully recognised by His Majesty&apos;sW.M. (41) 87th Government, but that the position would have to be made the subjectConclusions, of further consultation by means of a Commission or Conference,Minute 10.)     which would be arranged with the least possible delay after the war.This assurance had given satisfaction neither to the Board ofMinisters nor to the principal Minorities in the Island. following the decision that Sir Stafford Cripps, in connection with his mission to India, should not visit Ceylon, the Board of Ministers sent a message to the Colonial Secretary expressing disappointment anddissatisfaction. Subsequently a message had been received fromsix leading political members of the Minority groups in the state council drawing attention to the position of the Minorities.The Secretary of State for the Colonies now proposed that a message should be sent through the Governor to the Board ofMinisters to the effect that the re-examination of the reform of ceylon&apos;s constitution after the war, to which his Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment was committed, would be directed towards the fullest possible development of self-governing institutions in the Island. A message should at the same time be sent to the six Minority members to theeffect that it would not be right for His Majesty&apos;s Government to prejudice their decisions as to the manner in which the Constitu-tion could more satisfactorily be developed in respect of the interestsof any particular section of the people.The War Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should instruct the Governor of Ceylon tomake statements as proposed in paragraph 5 of his memorandum to the Board of Ministers, and to the minority Members.North Africa. 3.   Reference was made, in discussion, to recent telegrams from(Previous       our representative at Tangier about the position in North Africa,Reference:      particularly in Morocco.   It seemed that no control was beingW.M.(42)l65th exercised to prevent undesirable characters and persons definitelyConclusions,    hostile to the Allies from crossing the frontier of Spanish Morocco.Minute 3.)      This was only one of a number of disturbing features in thesituation.  Thus, there was reason to think that no proper measuresof censorship control had been enforced, and that inadequateattention   had   been   paid   to   the   necessary   administrative arrangements.The view was expressed that, should the military situationdevelop at all unfavourably, we might find ourselves involved ingrave difficulties, for which Parliament would hold the Governmentresponsible.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was proposing to suggest to the Prime Minister that he should send aPrivate and Personal telegram to the President on these matters.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to suggest to the PrimeMinister that he should include in the proposed telegram*to the President a reference to the need for immediatepolitical and administrative help to the United states military authorities, and a statement that we were, ofcourse, ready to give all help in our power.* Sent as telegram No. 227 to the President dated 9th December, 1942 (Prime MinistersPersonal Telegram T. 1693/2)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.December 9, 1942.
I have been disturbed by reports received during thelast few days from North Africa about conditions in FrenchMorocco and Algeria.     These reports, which come fromindependent and reliable sources, all paint the samepicture of the results which follow from our inability in existing circumstances to exercise a proper control overthe local French authorities in internal administrativematterSo     You are, I am sure, fully aware of this state ofaffairs, but I think it my duty to let you know the positionas it appears in the light of our own reports.2.        These reports show that the S.O.L. and kindredFascist organisations continue their activities andvictimize our former French sympathisers some of whom havenot yet been released from prison.     The first reaction ofthese organisations to the Allied landing was rightly oneof fear but it seems that they have now taken courage toregroup themselves and continue their activities.     Well-known German sympathisers who had been ousted have been-instated.     Not only have our enemies been thusencouraged but our friends have been correspondinglyconfused and cast down.     There have beencaB.es of Frenchsoldiers being punished for desertion because they tried tosupport the Allied forces during their landing.3.        There is an almost complete absence of control on the Franco-Spanish frontier.     The result of this is thatundesirables of all sorts, including Axis agents, cross thefrontier in both directions, carrying information to theenemy and preparing trouble for us through North Africa.Unless proper control is instituted soon our militaryoperations may be endangered and we may witness sabotage in north Africa on a large scale and other incidents of aserious nature which may culminate in risings in various parts of N. Africa.     There is no Allied control of postal and telegraph censorship and therefore nothing to stopenemy agents from writing and telegraphing information to europe.     One informant, for example, states that certainGermanophile Spanish consuls in the French Zone send fullreports about the military situation by telephone and telegraph to the Spanish High Commissioner at Tetuan.4.        Veiled anti-Allied propaganda continues in thepress and on the radio and positive enemy propagandaincreases daily.5.        In short elements hostile to the United nations are being consolidated within the administration andconditions are being created which will make North Africa afavourable resort for Axis trouble-makers.     If we were to suffer serious setbacks in Tunisia the Axis may be relied upon to exploit the situation to the full and there is noknowing what difficulties we may not then ernounter even atthe hands of those Frenchmen who now appear to be co-operating with us.FORMER NAVAL PERSON TO PRESIDENTNo. 287 1 04PERSONAL AND SECRET. 9 December. 1942.

So        It occurs to me that there is one step that we might usefully take and that is to see that such good friends of ours as General Bethouard and Mast are appointed to highmilitary commands in Morocco.     Mast is at present servingas Giraud8 s liaison officer at   Allied Headquarters whileBethouard has been sent to Gibraltar to perform non-existentliaison duties.     It is a pity that men like theses who tooksuch grave risks on our behalf, should not be in activeemployment.     Bethouard, who commanded a division at casablanca, would be particularly useful in Morocco wherea man of his stamp seems to be badly needed.7e        All of this reinforces the need for immediatepolitical and administrative help for Eisenhower.     As you know we are very ready to give any assistance in our power.DistributionThe KingForeign Secretary (2)Sir E. BridgesGeneral Ismay (12)War Cabinet and Service Ministers for information,
