This announced that, as theGerman High Command were not satisfied with the statementW.M. (42) 136th originally issued by the War Office, they had proceeded at noon on conclusions, fl^ 8th October to put in chains 107 British Officers and 1,269 other ranks. (Chaplains, hospital personnel, wounded and sick prisoners had not been manacled.) The communique went on to refer to theannouncement made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government theprevious evening, stating that, if the German Government persisted in their intention, similar measures would be taken in respect ofan equal number of enemy prisoners of war in our hands; and continued that, if this measure came into force, the Germans would at noon on the 10th October put in chains three times that numberof British prisoners.[24477] ;:;&apos;: &apos; &apos; ,
The Deputy Prime Minister said that he had held conversations with Dominion representatives now in London, and found that theywere disturbed about the position. They felt that the statementoriginally issued by the War Office had been somewhat disingenuous,and thought that some reference should have been made to the protecting Power before our decision was taken. They feared theresults if a series of competitive reprisals were started. Forexample, was there a risk of reprisals by the Japanese against our prisoners? Substantial numbers of Dominion troops were prisoners in enemy hands, and they took the view that Dominion governments should be consulted before any further action was taken.Points made in discussion were : (a) While we must give effect to our declared intention to putin chains on the following day a number of german prisoners equal to the number of British prisoners sotreated by the Germans, we should not, at this stage take any decision to put further prisoners in chains. Therewould, however, be no objection to the War Office takingthe preparatory steps (e.g., to obtain the necessarymanacles).(b) The view was expressed that the German military authori-ties would be glad to find some pretext for putting an end to these competitive reprisals; but the statements so farissued would not afford any opportunity for them toThe War Cabinet reached the following Conclusions: (1) The action already decided upon should proceed: i.e., onthe following day we should manacle the same numberof prisoners as the Germans had put in chains on the8th October.(2) A telegram should be despatched to the Dominion Govern-ments on the following lines : (a) It should contain a full narrative of what- had happened at Dieppe and at Sark.(6) It should set out our views as to what was and wasnot allowable in this matter. In particular, itshould emphasise the distinction between thetreatment accorded to prisoners in custody and action taken in the heat of conflict in the courseof capturing prisoners.(c) It should propose that, if the Germans gave effect tothe threat contained in the communique issuedthat day, and manacled a further batch of british prisoners three times as numerous as the enemyprisoners whom we had ordered to be manacledon the following day, we should manacle the same number of German prisoners; and should invitethe earliest possible expression of the views of theDominion Government as to this course.(d) It should indicate that, in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, it would be desirable to issue apublic statement; on the above lines as soon aspossible.(e) It should be added that the German action wasprompted by fear of our Commando raids andaimed at making them less effective.(3) Meanwhile, no further official statement should be issued.Great George,Street, S.W. 1,withdrawtaken up.October 9, 1942.
