The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.During the previous week Bomber Command had twiceattacked Turin. The first attack had been very successful but thesecond had been hampered by bad weather.In the Home Theatre, the enemy had lost 7 aircraft destroyed,1 probably destroyed and 7 damaged. Our losses had been 9 fighters,5 Army Co-operational aircraft, 6 bombers and 5 Coastal command aircraft.United States aircraft had attacked the submarine base at st.. Nazaire and claimed to have shot down 16 enemy fighters for theloss of 4.Enemy losses in this theatre had been 64 machines, destroyed(including some 40 on the ground) and 47 damaged. Allied losses had been 34 machines destroyed (including a number on the ground)and 36 damaged.Aircraft based on Malta had attacked aerodromes in sicily and Bizerta and airborne supply lines to Tunisia. Enemy losses had been 13 aircraft destroyed.   We had lost 7 machines.In Cyrenaica, air activity had been on a greatly reduced scale.In the Pacific enemy losses had been 26 aircraft destroyed to3 of ours.Merchant shipping losses for the previous week amounted to115,000 tons.Out of the 30 ships in the recent convoy from Russia 26 had reached home and 2 further vessels might make port.The Japanese were now using submarines in. their efforts to reinforce Guadalcanal. A German blockade runner of 8,000 tonshad been intercepted south of Cocos Island and had scuttled herself.A Norwegian destroyer flotilla had sunk two ships of 5,000 tonssouth of Trondheim.It appeared that all the French ships at Toulon had been sunkexcept about 5, including 2 destroyers. It was thought that anumber of submarines had escaped.The Allied forces were closing in on Bizerta and Tunis.Tebourba had been taken, but the position at Djedeida was obscure.Enemy forces in Tunisia amounted to some 12-13,000 Germans and,500 Italians.German forces were now back at El Agheila. The administra-tive situation of the 8th Army was satisfactory and the Navy hadopened several ports ahead of schedule,The Japanese lodgment at Buna was some 12 miles long by miles deep. At Guadalcanal the Japanese had suffered heavilyand their morale was low.The Russian offensives to the north and south of Veliki Lukinow threatened the Leningrad-Kiev railway. The offensive west of Rzhev had practically isolated German forces in that area.Further south near Stalingrad the Russians had made a very bigadvance-and the 6th German Army, estimated at some 50,000 men,was encircled. The Germans were preparing a second line ofdefence some 80 miles in the rear of the present fighting.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.France.French Fleet at alexandria.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 112thConclusions,Minute 3.). i 2&apos; T!t%First,rea Lord reAd t0 the War Cabinet threeSK^h?! Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean! Xuttbe attitude of the French Fleet at Alexandria. These telegramsshowed that while some of Admiral Godfreys officers wished to resume the fight, others thought this would mean breaking thei?oath to the Chief of State.   Faced with this situation Admiral* Nos. 484, 486 and 498.[24709.]b 2
The War Cabinet decided-(1) That this request of Admiral Godfroy should be refused.(2) That for the moment no&apos;further action should be taken, inregard to the French Fleet at Alexandria, but that after. an interval Of, say, a fortnight, we should exercise strong pressure to clear up the position.Jibuti.^PreviousMei erence:W.M. (42) 4th&quot;Conclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet were informed that part of the garrison of French Somaliland had already crossed over to Zeila, in british somali land.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought that there was every chance that French Somaliland would now rally to the allied cause. He would greatly prefer that it should do so under the aegis of the Fighting French, rather than of Admiral Darlan, and.suggested that instructions to this end should be sent to GeneralPlatt.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War to submit to thePrime Minister a draft telegram to General Platt pointing out that the time was opportune to clear up the position atJibuti; and instructing him to do his best to induce thecolony to rally to the Fighting French. This course was greatly to be preferred. But if it could not be done without serious fighting His Majesty&apos;s Government would accept the colony declaring for Admiral Darlan.North Africa.^French shipping in North AfricanPorts., (previous reference:W.M. (42) 156thConclusions.)4. The War Cabinet were informed that French shipping,either intact or repairable, in the French North African ports(excluding Dakar) amounted to some 230,000 tons. The arrange-ments made between the Americans and the French in regard to this tonnage did not provide for it to be put into a common pool, andseemed very unfavourable to us.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in con-sultation with the Minister of War Transport, to take thismatter up through our Ambassador in Washington.North Africa.Statement inParliament.. (previous reference:W.M. (42) 161st&apos; Conclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Foreign Secretary raised the question of what shouldbe said to Parliament as to the position of Admiral Darlan in north africa.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, while tensionon this matter had eased considerably in the last few days, it wouldbe better to take action which would avoid the matter being raised in public Debate in the immediate future.The War Cabinet accordingly agreed that the foreign secretary should make a statement to the effect that,before Parliament adjourned for the Recess, an oppor-turiity would be found for discussion in Secret Session ofthis matter and one or two other delicate matters better not dealt with in public. This opportunity would be giveneither in the following week or in the week after.6.   The War Cabinet were informed that on the 20th Novembera telegram had been received from the Canadian Government(No. 225) in which it was suggested that the Swiss Minister forForeign Affairs should be asked to revive his suggestion that m TisfM Slat shackling should cease at an agreed hour and day on both sides.w.m. (it) io Foreign secretary had sent a telegram to Berne asking our minister to ascertain how matters stood.   (As long ago as the prisoners of&quot;War.(previous reference:Conclusions,Minute 7.)
13th October we had asked the Protecting Power to lay before theGerman Government a solemn protest against, this breach ofthe Geneva Convention and to urge them to desist from it, in which case our counter-measures would be immediately withdrawn.)- The War Cabinet were informed that the reply from theGerman Government had.been handed to the SwissMinister on the24th November, and a summary of it had just been received (seetelegrams Nos. 4315 and 4323 from Berne, which were read to theWar Cabinet). The concluding paragraphs of the summary read asfollows: &quot;In these circumstances the German Government cannotconsider further the question of removal of counter-measuresit has ordered before it has received through Swiss government an official intimation that British Government has issued to itstroops an entire confession and general order forbidding undersevere penalties any binding (&quot; Fesselung &quot;) of prisoners andalso the possession of bonds (&quot; Fesseln &quot;) for this purpose.&apos;&apos; Should it be proved that the British Government is stillunwilling to desist from the methods it has hitherto adopted inits treatment of prisoners and that British troops continue tobe guilty of abuses of the nature described, the German Govern-ment will for its part also be constrained to regard thecorresponding provisions of the Hague and Geneva Conven-tions as no longer binding.&quot;In the discussions which followed, the view was expressed thatthe continued shackling of prisoners was increasingly disliked by public opinion in Canada and in certain quarters in this country.Reference was made to the Canadian Governments suggestionthat we should indicate to the Swiss Government that, if they would propose publicly and simultaneously to ourselves and the Germansthat shaclding should cease from a near hour and day, such an invitation would be agreeable to our Governments, and that wewould be prepared to act on it immediately and unconditionally.It was urged, however, that this course was most unlikely to do anything to alleviate the lot of our own prisoners, which must be our main objective in handling this question. Moreover, no suchaction could possibly be taken in the face of the bitterly contro-versial and uncompromising reply from the German Government,which consisted mainly of wholly unjustified charges against Britishtreatment of German prisoners.After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should prepare and submit to the War Cabinet a reply to the german note. This reply should make a strong point of ourhumane treatment of German prisoners. It should rebutthe charges made, and should end with repeating our offer to unshackle the German prisoners in our hands assoon as we knew that the German Government wereprepared to do likewise.(2) This draft telegram would be considered by the WarCabinet, and would be sent to the JJominion Govern-ments for their observations before being despatched, tothe Protecting Power.(3) The answer to two Parliamentary Questions on thefollowing day should be that we had received an interimcommunication from the Protecting Power and were in further communication with them about the matter.China.Extra- -Territoriality.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 132ndConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet had before.them a Memorandum by theSecretary.of State for Foreign.Affairs (W.P. (42) 557) as to theinstructions to be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Chungkingabout the draft treaty for the abrogation of extra-territorial rights.A major point at issue was the inclusion in the treaty of a provision whereby British subjects would be granted in China, on a reciprocalbasis, national treatment in the carrying on of commerce.   The
Chinese mmmAohmim tp this, and the JJniMStates Govern-mm^m. &amp;m$me&amp;&apos; * fvmmmm^m in their draft treaty the togn; SfiQre^fy as.fed the ^biftet to approve instructtipns beiftg sent to^His.

(42) 104thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum bythe Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for theColonies (W:P; (42) 549)/ ,  f&quot;The memorandum explained that, in spite of the announcementof the formation of a Palestine Regiment, an impression that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were hot giving the Jews the opportunityto light against Hitler was current especially in the United Statesand was reacting unfavourably on Anglo-American relations.The Jewish Agency professed to he unable to reconcile the description of the role of the Regiment given tp its representativesby the General Officer Commanding, Palestine, on the 3rd Septem-ber, 1942, with the announcement made by the Secretary of Statefor War at the time of its formation. Recruiting for the regimentwas steadily declining.The Ministers recognised that no announcement about the regiment, short of agreeing to its transformation into the nucleus of a purely Jewish force, would entirely satisfy Jewish aspirations,but they recommended that the Secretary, of State fpr War should,at a suitable opportunity, make a statement in the House ofCommons on the regiments present role and future prospects, inorder to clarify the position.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft announcement set out in paragraph of the memorandum, subject to the following altera-tions : -(a) The third sentence of the third paragraph should read as follows: &quot; The Commanderrin-Chief, middle east, is in the best position to judge, from amilitary point pi view, what this task should be.&quot;(6) The last sentence pf the fourth paragraph should read as follows : &quot; In matters of this sort, involving thebqst disposition of troops, the Commander-in-Chiefs judgment and&apos; decision naturally receivedue weight frpm His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;CentralPlanningAuthority,Minister of town and country planning.(previous reference:W.M.

Stalin, dated28th November, in reply to a telegram from himself dated24th November..In this telegram M. Stalin expressed gratitudefor the decision to   send a new big convoy to archangel;    agreement with the policy towardsTurkey;    and understanding of the use made by the americans of Darlan in order to facilitate theoccupation of Northern and Western Africa.M. Stalin   had referred to the paragraph inthe Prime Minister&apos;s telegram in which he had stated that by building up a strong American Armyand Air Force in Great Britain and making continuouspreparations along our South-Eastern and Southerncoasts we kept the Germans pinned in the Pas deCalais.   M. Stalin hoped that this   did not mean that the Prime Minister had changed his mind withregard to his promise, given in Moscow, to establish a Second Front in Europe in the Spring of 1943.The Prime Minister said that the changed situationmade it all the more incumbent upon us to start a second front in Europe in 1943.
