The GermanGovernment were seeking a confession on our part that certainactions had been wrongfully taken by our troops in the field of battleand that we would desist from such actions in future.There was general agreement that, if the Canadian Govern-ment were to take action independently of this country, the results would be most unfortunate. It was essential that we should act instep. It was felt that, in the circumstances, the best course wouldbe that we should tell the Protecting Power that, if they wouldappeal to both parties to unshackle their prisoners from a givenhour and day, we for our part would do so.The Foreign Secretary* read to the War Cabinet a draft letter. to our Minister at Berne to give effect to this suggestion.  Variousamendments were proposed.The War Cabinefs decisions were as follows(1) The Foreign Secretary would submit to the Prime minister that afternoon a draft telegram to our Minister at Berne(on the lines of the draft read to the Meeting, asamended in discussion) instructing him to tell the swiss government that if they would appeal publicly to our-selves and the Germans to unshackle their prisoners from a given hour and day, we would act on thissuggestion.     .(2) Our Minister at Berne should also be instructed to ask the swiss Government to make this appeal in the nearfuture, and to. ascertain the date for unshackling to be proposed by the Swiss Government in their communica-tions tp ourselves and to the German Government.1. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 545) and thePrime Minister (W-P- (42) 546) regarding the possibility ofexploiting the effect which recent military events had produced onItalian morale.The War Cabinet agreed that political warfare against italy should be conducted on the lines indicated in paragraph 15 of w.P. (42) 545.The discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.

(42) 538) to which was attached a draft White Paper, which it was suggested should belaid before Parliament, summarising the proposals for the reform ofthe Foreign Service which had been worked out on the basis of theplan approved in principle by the War Cabinet in June 1941.The War Cabinet also had before them a number of Memorandaraising points in regard to the draft White Paper, viz.: Memorandum by.the Home Secretary (W.P. (42) 554).Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (42) 560).Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(W.P. (42) 542).Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster(W.P.

W. 1,December 3, 1942.(3) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was invited to telegraph urgently to the Canadian Government tellingthem of the action -proposed under (1) and (2), andsaying that we assumed that they would desist fromaction on the lines proposed in the communication of the2nd December, summarised in the opening paragraphof this Minute.(4) A public announcement on the matter (including publicity for the terms of the reply of the German Governmentto the Protecting Power) must await the Swiss Govern-ment&apos;s appeal to ourselves and to the Germans. It was hoped, however, that an announcement on the matter could be made in a few days&apos; time.[These conclusions over-ride W.M. (42) 162ndConclusions, Minute 6, conclusions (1) and (2).]
