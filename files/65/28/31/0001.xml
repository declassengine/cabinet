North Africa. 1.   THE War Cabinet were informed that the following Notice(Previous of Motion had been put down, to which five Members had appendedReference:      their names: -W.M. (42) 157th &quot; That this House is of the opinion that our relations with conclusions, Admiral Darlan and his kind are inconsistent with the idealsMinute 2.) for which we entered and are&apos;fighting this war. . . .&quot;While it was thought unlikely that this Notice of Motion would attract much support, it was stated that there was an under-current; of anxiety among a number of persons well-disposed to the govern -ment but who were not in possession of the full facts, and whofeared that the action taken in North Africa presaged agreements with Quislings in other countries.The War Cabinet discussed whether action should be taken togive the House information on the matter, followed, perhaps, by anan opportunity for debate.The War Cabinet decided as follows : The Leader of the House should state, on Tuesday, the1st December, that the Government considered that a state-ment should be made on their behalf on this matter, whichcould be debated by the House if the House so desired.Since, however, the affairs of other countries besides ourown were concerned, the matter could only be dealt with in secret Session. A day would be found in the week beginning Monday, the 7th December.Foreign Affairs. 2. The War Cabinet had before them the following&quot; The Four- Memoranda about the structure of international relations- afterPower Plan.&quot;   the war : -(Previous Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsReference: (W.P. (42) 516).W.M. (42) 149th Memorandum- by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  IndiaConclusions, (W.P. (42) 524).Minute 3.) Note    by    the    Minister    of    Aircraft    Production(W.P. (42) 532).The Foreign Secretary, in his Memorandum, explained that,while he had no specific proposals to put before his colleagues at thepresent time, he asked their approval of the general line of policydeveloped in his Paper.The central point in his Memorandum was that it was uponthe conception of the United Nations (a conception at once lessambitious and more practical than the League) that we must nowbuild the machinery of international co-operation. Furthermore,the leadership of the United Nations would have to come from three great Powers (ourselves, the United States and U.S.S.R.), and itwas upon these Great Powers, working together within the frame-- work of the United Nations, that we should base our foreign policy.The desire of the United States to associate China with the other. Great Powers might lead to a group of four Great Powers.The Minister of Aircraft Production, in his Memorandum,developed a number of the points dealt with in the foreign secretary&apos;s Paper, and, in particular, sketched out a scheme for five separate World Councils, each dealing with different parts ofthe world, a number of the Great Powers being members of morethan one of these Councils.The Secretary of State for India stressed the importance ofsome kind of organic unity within Europe, but doubted whether anyof the Great Powers could or should be members of it.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with the lineof policy sketched out in the Memoranda by the Foreign secretary and the Minister of Aircraft Production.
183 WJVL 161 (42).The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to try andcombine the ideas in his Paper and in the Minister of aircraft production^ Note into a single document.While the views set out in these two Papers met with general approval, it was thought that the next stage would be that theseproposals should be further examined, and that it would be undesirable to make any very specific public pronouncements onthese matters at the present time. The Governments of theDominions would have to be consulted before this was done.Moreover, at the recent conference on economic matters of repre-sentatives of the Dominions and India there had been some signs that Canada, for example, might be. restive if an impression werecreated that the United States was dictating economic policy.The Minister of Labour and National Service drew attentionto the fact that no reference was made in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper to Article V of the Atlantic Charter, and also to the positionof the International Labour Office. He hoped that the emphasis on regional Councils would not lead to the International Labour Officeplaying a less important part in world affairs.The Prime Minister said that it was important not to make any public statement underrating the conception or the achievements oftihe League of Nations until we were in a position to make positivesuggestions for something to put in its place.The War Cabinet. :-Expressed general approval of the line of policy indicatedin the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum and in the Noteby the Minister of Aircraft Production, and asked the&apos; Foreign Secretary to arrange for a Memorandum to beprepared, after these questions had been further examined,embodying the points in both these Papers.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,November 27, 1942.
