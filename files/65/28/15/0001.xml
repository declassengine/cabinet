The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week. &apos;Bomber Command had carried out two night raids againstGenoa and one day and one night&apos;raid against Milan. The weather conditions for the first raid against Genoa had been good and satis-factory results had been obtained. The second raid had been spoiltby cloud and some of our bombers had bombed the alternative targets at Turin and Savona. A number of German towns had also been bombed by small numbers of aircraft. Two U-boats had beenclaimed to have been sunk by mines and one damaged.Coastal Command had made eleven attacks on U-boats, seven of which had had possible results. One merchant ship off Norwayhad been sunk.Fighter Command had carried out a number of sorties againstground targets. In the Home Theatre the enemy had lost 3 aircraft destroyed, 4 probably destroyed and 11 damaged. Our losses hadbeen 2 fighters, 17 bombers and 5 Coastal Command aircraft.United States Fortresses had carried out a most successful raidon the submarine base at Lorient. They had lost 3 aircraft, binclaimed to have shot down 9 enemy machines for certain and probable.The scale of enemy attacks had been reduced. The enemy lossesfor the previous 7 days had been 16 destroyed, 4 probably destroyed and 17 damaged. Our losses had been 4 aircraft destroyed (1 onthe ground). Fleet Air Arm and R.A.F. machines had also destroyed3 enemy tankers and 1 6,000-ton vessel off Malta.On the 24th October, the first day of the battle, our aircraft had flown over 1,000 sorties. During the previous seven days theenemy had lost 36 aircraft destroyed, 18 probably destroyed and23 damaged. Our losses had been 33 aircraft (mostly fighters) and5 damaged.Our merchant shipping losses for the previous week, includingbelated reports, amounted to 44,000 tons.A Fighting French submarine on patrol off Narvik had sunktwo enemy merchant ships.The First Lord of the Admiralty was invited to convey thecongratulations of the War Cabinet to the Fighting Frenchon this achievement.Details were given of the progress of the present battle inEgypt.   The situation could be considered satisfactory.General Alexander had said that he would not be able to givea reliable appreciation of the way operations would develop for another week. 1,000 Italian and 500 German prisoners had beentaken. &apos;In New Guinea our forces were now within 7 or 8 miles ofKakoda.After a pause in the German offensive, the Germans hadresumed attacks in Stalingrad, but had only succeeded in capturinga few streets and buildings. In the south the Germans had made very little progress. The higher passes of the Caucasus were now clear of Germans.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.&quot;*s,s&apos;r&apos; rj    2-   T.he Wai; Cabinet had a discussion on our relations w(Previous Russia.

Hess- In the course of discussion it was stated that the Russians were(Previous still very suspicious over the Hess affair, and thought that they had reference: not been given the full facts.   It was urged that we might make an.M. (42) 143rd effort to dispel their suspicions.Conclusions,The War Cabinet-Minute 2.)Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for a full dossierof the Papers in regard to the Hess affair to be prepared and circulated to the War Cabinet, and asked that heshould prefix thereto a report bringing out the salientpoints. In the light of these papers, the War cabinet would consider what communication on the matter could usefully be made to the Soviet Government.u.s.s.r.Empress HallCelebration ofthe SovietAnnual Day.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 131stConclusions,Minute 12.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that requests had been made that contingents of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces should attend the celebration of the Soviet AnnualDay to be held in the Empress Hall on the 7th November. this invitation had been accepted by the War Office and the AirMinistry. Later, after consultation between Ministers, it had beendecided that the contingents of His Majesty&apos;s Forces should notattend the demonstration, and those responsible for organising the demonstration had been so informed. In the meantime, however,contingents of troops from some of the Allies had been invited andhad agreed to attend. It had also been publicly announced thatBritish troops would be present at the demonstration. A difficult situation had therefore arisen.The view was expressed that, since the invitations had beenaccepted in the first instance, withdrawal at this stage would bevery difficult. There was much, therefore, to be said for allowingcontingents of troops to attend on this occasion.On the other hand, it was suggested that the situation mightbe dealt with in other ways, e.g., we might take the line that it wouldbe more suitable that our contingents and those of the Allies should all attend a military parade.The importance of an early settlement of this matter was stressed.The War Cabinet deferred a decision, on the under-standing that this matter would be considered at a meeting to be held in the course of the next two days.Prisoners of 4.   The War Cabinet considered a telegram from the CanadianWar- Government (No. 231, dated the 24th October) making suggestions(Previous for dealing with the situation which had arisen.  In particular, the reference:        Canadian Government proposed that the Governments of the BritishW.M. (42) 144th Commonwealth should jointly communicate to the Protecting PowerConclusions.)     and the International Red Cross Committee, and should simul-taneously make public, a statement condemning the policy of treating prisoners of war as hostages and declaring against thepolicy of reprisals.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was against making any further approach at this stage on the lines suggested by theCanadian Government. It would be better to see how the positiondeveloped and whether any reply would be forthcoming to the repre-sentations we had made through the Protecting Power.The Foreign Secretary said that a further offer of mediationhad been received from the International Red Cross Committee.. ,, I He suggested that a reply should be sent referring to the protestwhich we had already lodged through the Swiss Government and indicating that we were proposing to use the Protecting Power asan intermediary in this matter.
Honours andAwards.Posthumous. Honours andAwards.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 256thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the PrimeMinister (W.P. (42) 475) covering a Memorandum prepared in theTreasury on the question of posthumous awards for acts ofgallantry.In discussion, it was&apos;pointed out that posthumous awards weremade in the case of the Victoria Cross and certain other awards forgallantry, and it would be in accord with public sentiment if thesame principles could be applied in the case of other gallantryawards. It might be desirable to impose some limit on the numberof posthumous awards; and there were some difficulties whichwould have to be considered. For example, a decision taken now toextend the classes of decoration which may be awarded posthumouslycould not be made retrospective to the beginning of the war.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was desirable in principle that the presentrules restricting posthumous awards for gallantryshould be relaxed, if means could be found of overcoming the administrative difficulties involved.(2) Invited the Committee on the Grant of Honours, decorated-tions and Medals in Time of War to report whether ascheme could be devised for permitting and regulating the posthumous award of decorations for gallantryother than those already awarded posthumously.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 26, 1942.It was pointed out that the telegram froim the canadian government had been despatched before receipt of a telegram fromthe Dominions Office (No. 433 of the 24th October) which indicated that, before considering what further action might be taken, wewere proposing to allow a reasonable time in which to obtain a replyto the protest we had lodged through the Swiss Government.Nevertheless, it might be desirable to restate our position, so as tomake it quite clear to Dominion Governments that we thought itwise not to take any further step while there was still some prospectof obtaining a reply from the Swiss Government.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) In present circumstances the best course, for some days atany rate, was to await the result of the protest lodgedthrough the Protecting Power.    *(2) The Dominions Office should telegraph to the canadian government, referring to telegram No. 433 of the24th October from the Dominions Office, and explaining that we thought it wiser not to take any further decisionwhile there was still some prospect of a reply from the swiss Government. Copies of this telegram should besent to other Dominion Governments.(3) The Foreign Secretary should reply to the internation red Cross Committee on the lines indicated at &quot;A&quot;above.
