(42) 583) regarding&apos;the possibility of invasion of the United(Previous Kingdom during 1943.reference: jn discussion, the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeW.M. (42) 167th Security asked whether the Chiefs of Staff would also assess theConclusions, possibility of raids, either on targets near the coast or on key-pointsMinute 3.) inland&quot;.   It was explained that this question was already underreview by a Committee of Vice-Chiefs of Staff.1    The War Cabinet-Endorsed the conclusions set out in these Papers.French North 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theand West Home Secretary (W.P. (42) 594) drawing attention to the con-Africa, tinuing unsatisfactory situation in French North and West AfricaCivilian from the point of view of the civil administration and security.Administration The Home Secretary, while welcoming the appointment of anand Security. American, and the proposed appointment of a British civilian of(Previous high authority, to relieve the Commander-in-Chief of civilian andEeferences- political responsibilities, urged the speedy adoption of the followingW.M. (42) 156th, measures :and 171st (a) The institution of adequate security arrangements.   this conclusions, might take the form of the establishment in these minute 4.) territories of a Security Executive, subordinate to theCommander-in-Chief and presided over by a Britishofficial of suitable experience.(b) The infiltration into the civil administration and theFrench Armed Forces of reliable and competent persons and the elimination of unreliable elements.(c) The organisation of a reasonably efficient civil administra-tion, including the management of transport.The following were the main points made in discussion :-(1) The Foreign Secretary said that the position was difficult.The Americans had, however, agreed to accept Britishhelp in censorship, and officers were now on their wayout.   A good deal of the political warfare activity wasalso carried out by British staff,  under Americandirection.    He  was   willing,   however,   to  instructMr. Mack to tell General Eisenhower that, if he wished the help of further British officials, we should, of course,be ready to make some available.-  (2) So far as concerned security, several Ministers thought thatthe setting up of a body on the lines of the SecurityExecutive would not be effective unless and until reliancecould be-placed on the, security arrangements in the; French Government Departments.   This, of course, was- linked up with doubts as to the reliability of some ofthe Frenchmen who were now occupying controlling-positions.(3) The Prime Minister, -while agreeing that the position was far from satisfactory, doubted the wisdom of makingcontinued representations on this matter to the UnitedStates authorities, with whom the responsibility lay. Hethought that the most important- and the most helpful,line was to proceed as quickly as possible with theappointment of a British political representative in.North Africa..- (4) The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet of the steps which hadPbeen taken since this issue had first been........     . raised   by   the   President   in   a   telegram   of   the1 20th November.   Further consideration had been given.   [24814] &apos;. b 2   .
to the status of the proposed British political represen-tative since the last Meeting of the War Cabinet, and,after consultation with some of his colleagues, he had sent a telegram to the President explaining that the differences between our systems of government made itimpossible to achieve exact similarity, and adding thatwe proposed to send out a Junior Minister, with the title of &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Governments Political Repre-sentative at General Eisenhower &apos;s Headquarters,&quot;reporting direct to him (the Prime. Minister) andenjoying exact equality of rank with Mr. Murphy.(5) The Prime/Minister said that he attached importance toour representative retaining his Ministerial statois, and suggested that he might be seconded from his existingoffice. The essential point was that, while working inclosest consultation with the United States authoritiesand relieving General Eisenhower of part of his politicalburdens, our political representative should be free tomake reports to his own Government. No further action could be taken on this appointment pending president roosevelt&apos;s reply. It was hoped, however, that theappointment might be made in the course of the nextfew days.The War Cabinet- :^Expressed general agreement with the Prime Ministersviews, and agreed that the best means of following up thepoints raised in the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum was by the appointment of a British Political representative at General Eisenhower&apos;s Headquarters.West Africa.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 156th-Conclusions.)3. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 601) covering recentcorrespondence with the Resident Minister about Americaninfluence in West Africa.   -Lord Swinton was concerned at the apparent subordination ofBritish interests to American control in French West Africa, whichwe had hoped to make a British sphere of influence during the war.He was also anxious lest the African population of the british west African colonies should get the impression that- americans were in a position of dominance, not only in French West Africa,but also in our own territories.It had been suggested that the position might be eased if an american representative were posted to Accra&apos; to co-ordinate allAmerican interests and activities in West Africa. The Secretaryof State for the Colonies supported this suggestion, and also pro-posed that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington should beinvited to consider whether he &quot;should take up through the state department, or. leave it to Lord Swinton to pursue with the proposedAmerican representative when he had been appointed, the following suggestions: , (i) Any United States Office of War Information outpostsmaintained in British colonies should not engage in internal propaganda except at the request of theColonial Governments; and on external propaganda. should work in association with, and under the directionof, British propaganda authorities.(ii) To avoid misunderstanding and false rumours, UnitedStates officers should confine their enquiries to mattersrelevant to their military duties.(iii) American troops coming to West Africa should be given a pamphlet on beh&amp;riour in an Allied country, like thatissued to United States troops in this country and to-&apos; British airmen in the United States.
Uorth Africa. 4.   The Financial Secretary to the War Office, who had spenttwo days in Algiers on his return from the Middle East, gave theWar Cabinet an account of his impressions. A record of his state-ment is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The Jews. 5.   The Foreign Secretary said, he had received that day aRefugees from deputation from the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who hadenemy and urged that we should do our utmost to provide &quot;for the reception of enemy-occupied such Jews as were able to escape from enemy-occupied territory,territory. either through Bulgaria or through Portugal.  He had referred to(Previous the grave practical difficulties of arranging for the reception of such reference: refugees, and had. entered into no commitment.   At the same time,W.M. (42) 168th ne thought we should consider very &quot;carefully whether there was conclusions, anything we could do to assist these people.Minute 9.)       -&apos;-    -Points raised in discussion were : :(a) The Minister of Production said that, as regards theallocation of raw materials and supplies from these:. territories, we had received equitable treatment up todate. So long as the present arrangements stood, weshould have no grounds for complaint on this score.(6) The United States authorities had now invited us to attach a naval and an air officer to Admiral Glassford&apos;mission to Dakar. Since British co-operation in this area had hitherto been discouraged, this was reassuring.(c) Reference was made to the anti-Darlan propaganda whichwas relayed by radio stations under the control of theFighting French at Brazzaville and in Syria: If thiscontinued, there was a risk that the United states authorities would complain of its disturbing influence in North Africa.(d) The Minister of State endorsed Lord Swinton&apos;s viewsregarding the impression created by the behaviour ofirresponsible Americans in African territories. Hethought that this was particularly noticeable in the caseof employees of Pan-American Airways. Now that thisfirm had been militarised, the United States authorities might be pressed to exercise greater discipline over it.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary-(1) To instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at washington to press for the early appointment of an Americanrepresentative at Accra.(2) To communicate to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington the facts stated in Lord Swinton&apos;telegram No. 574 of the 18th December, and to enquire whether the suggestions set out at (i)-(iii)above could more appropriately be put forward byhim through the State Department or through theproposed American representative at Accra whenhe had been appointed.(3) To consider what representations he could make witha view to restraining the propagandist activities which were being carried on by the Fighting Frenchthrough the radio stations at Brazzaville and in syria.
The War Cabinet-Appointed, a Cabinet Committee consisting of the foreign secretary (Chairman), the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for the Colonies to consider and reportwhat arrangements could be made for the reception and accommodation of such Jewish refugees as might be ableto find their way out of enemy-occupied territory throughBulgaria or Portugal.Air Policy.Bombing ofFrance.6. The War Cabinet discussed a proposal for the bombing ofa specific target in France.The discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Russia.Supplies andMilitaryAssistance.(previous kef erence:W.M. (42) 169thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet were informed that, in accordance withthe decisions reached by the War Cabinet on the 15th December, aReport had now been prepared by the Allied Supplies Executiveabout future convoy arrangements to North Russia (W.P. (42) 602).The War Cabinet deferred full discussion of this Report until after Christmas, subject to an interim decision on one matter whichcalled for immediate action.The discussion and conclusions are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,December 23, 1942.
