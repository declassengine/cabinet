Parliament.Debate on india.(previous reference :^W.M. (42) 129thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the debate in the House of Commons on Thursday, the 8th October, and decided as follows : (1) The Government spokesmen should be the Secretary ofState for India and the Deputy Prime Minister, whowould wind up the Debate. &apos;(2) It was desirable to avoid a controversial Debate on theIndian position at the present juncture.(3) The Government spokesmen would, no doubt, emphasise the.magnitude of the offer embodied in the draft Declara-tion. Stress should be laid on the fact that, althoughthe offer was still open, the Congress Party had thought fit to embark on a course of open defiance and hostility;and that so long as the Congress Resolution stoodnegotiations could not be resumed. It should also bemade clear that there was no possible Government inIndia, other than the existing Government, which couldpress forward the war effort. In this connectionreference might be made to the importance of the defenceof India from the point of view of China.India.Request byChamber of princes forStatement ofPolicy byHis Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(previous reference:W.M.

(B) An alternative draft assurance, circulated by direction ofthe Prime Minister.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the alternative draft assurance (draft (B)),subject to the first paragraph being amended to read asfollows : ^(a) &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to their obliga-tions, by Treaty or otherwise, towards the States.They see no reason to define their conception ofthose obligations. The statement by the lord privy Seal in the House of Commons on the28th April, 1942, is in no way inconsistent withthem.&quot;(2) Authorised the despatch to the Crown Representative of atelegram in the terms proposed in W.P. (42) 446, inorder to give him an opportunity of commenting on the assurance before it was issued.china.Extra-territoriality.(previous reference:W.M.

(42) 448) covering -(1) A letter from the American Ambassador.(2) The  draft  of  a  Treaty between  theGovernment and China relating tojurisdiction.(3) The instructions from the State Department, relating to1   the Treaty, which the Ambassador had received from theState Department.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theimmediate proposal was that the British and American Govern-ments should inform the respective Chinese Ambassadors, on the
Russia.Supplies andMilitary-Assistance. .4. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a telegram which he had received from President Roosevelt.A preliminary discussion took place, and it was agreed to meetlater in the day to consider the matter further.S-nSferaild  -    ,5-   A short Preliminary discussion took place on certain pointsauction.      J? the Memorandum by the Minister of Production on the 1943Production Programme (W.P. (42) 424).The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Production to submit to the PrimeMinister proposals which could be embodied in a Directiveto the Service Departments in regard to reconsideration of their scales of equipment, establishment and reserves.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 6, 1942.    .&quot;9th October, that their Governments expected to present to theChinese Government in the near future, for its consideration, draftTreaties the conclusion of which would relinquish extra-territorial rights in China. The American Government proposed that thisintimation should be given privately. 1The Foreign Secretary thought that, on the whole, it would bebetter that this statement should be made publicly, since it was, inany case, likely to become known.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.The Foreign Secretary said that the abandonment of extra-territoriality meant a greater sacrifice on our part than on the partof the Americans. But he thought that the scheme proposed was generally sound and should be accepted in principle.The War Cabinet were informed of the position as regards theDominions.The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia wanted to make a separate agreement with the Chinese Government. Theobject of this procedure was not altogether clear, since Australiahad few rights to surrender, but we need raise no objection to thisproposal.The Government of the Union of South Africa agreed inprinciple, but wished to see the text of the proposed Treaty before any approach was made to the Chinese Government. If need be,the Union Government would have to be informed that we regard it as of the first importance that we should act at the same time asthe United States Government.The Canadian Government had not yet answered, but theywould be asked to expedite their reply.The Foreign Secretary added that he would endeavour to obtain a unilateral statement from the Chinese Government in regard tothe future position of Shanghai. If, however, they were unwilling to make such a statement, he did not feel that he could press themvery strongly in the matter.The War Cabinet-Expressed general approval of the course proposed by theForeign Secretary, and invited him to proceed accordingly.
