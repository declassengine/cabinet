In the Stalingrad area, the germans had made slight progress. They had. also advanced a few miles in the Georgian Pass.Australian Forces had now reached the top of the Owen StanleyRange, and were continuing to move forward.Antsirabe had been occupied. Our troops which had advancedfrom Majunga, had now Covered 460 miles in 23 days.Our forces had attacked the northern and southern lips ofthe depression in the Munassib area.

The War Cabinet had a discussion of which a record is(Previous contained in  the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet reference: Conclusions.W.M. (42) 130thConclusions, &apos;   , _.Minute 2.) &apos;Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(Previous   -Reference:W.M. (42) 126thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave particulars of the damage done during the past week by daylightraids, which were showing some tendency to increase. The mostserious attack had been at Petworth, where a school had been hit and a;number of children had lost their lives. There had also been some damage at Betteshanger, at Colchester, and at various places in Sussex and Kent.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Supplies to 4.   The Prime ministers aid that he had received a letter fromRussia. the Russian Ambassador (whom he had just seeii) asking whether(Previous the supplies of aircraft from this country and from the united reference: States to Russia could be-increased, at the cost of supplies of otherW.M. (42) 124th war material.   He had undertaken that this request would be conclusions, examined.   M. Maisky had also expressed gratitude for the offerMinute 5.) which had been made to supply them with Albemarle aircraft, and[24450] &apos; &apos; b 2  -
hoped that further aircraft of this type could,be made awa&amp;lahle- z&amp;them over and above the number which we had already undertaken^tosend.The War Cabinet-Asked that these requests should be examined5 in the firstinstance by the Chief of the Air Staff, who would tionsultthe Chiefs of Staff Committee as necessary.Production.Working of theCombinedJBoards.5. The Prime Minister referred to the Memorandum by theMinister of Production on the working of the Combined Boards(W\P. (42) 434), and informed the War Cabinet that he had sent a telegram to President Roosevelt on the lines proposed in Annex IIIto the Memorandum.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of the action taken.The fighting french.Syria andMadagascar.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 126thConclusions,Minute 4:)6, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the Prime Minister and he, had had a somewhatdifficult interview with General de Gaulle on the 30th September.Subsequent to that meeting, discussions had been started withM. Dejean, and were proceeding not unsatisfactorily. It was desirable that the issues under discussion (which related to Syriaand Madagascar) should be dealt with through a single channel.He asked, therefore, that, if any approaches were made to hiscolleagues on these matters by members of the Fighting Frenchorganisation, the reply given should be that any communication should be made through M. Dejean to the Foreign Office.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.War Criminals.. 7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the(Previous War Cabinet that this matter had been examined by the. CommitteeReference: appointed by the War Cabinet in July last. It was now proposedW.M. (42) 86th that a public statement should be made by the Lord Chancellor on conclusions, the 7th October which would cover two main points. It would minute 4.)        declare- -:(1) That His Majesty&apos;s Government thought it desirable to setup a United Nations Fact-finding Commission.(2) That His Majesty&apos;s Government favoured including in any.eventual; Armistice terms provision for. the immediatecapture and surrender of wanted criminals,, rather thanallow such measures to wait until the: conclusion of thePeace. Treaties.A detailed Note on this matter was being circulated (see.P. (42) 445).. The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of this statement.
U.S.S.R.Russian   .Warships and merchant ships in the black Sea.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 112thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (W.P. (42) 435) setting out the policy which it was proposed to adopt in the event of the fall of the Soviet Black Seaports raising the question of the disposal of the Soviet Fleet in the black Sea. .The War Cabinet-.Agreed that, while this matter should not be raisedofficially with the Turkish or Soviet Governments at thepresent time, if the issue arose we should act on the basisof the four suggestions set out at the end of the joint memorandum.In connection with (c), the further suggestion was madein discussion that, if any Soviet warships were interned,there would be some advantage if, after internment, they.could be moved to iEgean ports.Refugees.jewish refugees from france.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 130thConclusions,Minute 4.)9. At their previous meeting the War Cabinet had decidedthat the admission to this country of refugees from unoccupied france should be limited to children who had a parent or parentsalready in this country, subject to the Home Secretary havingdiscretion also to admit orphan children who had a near relationin this country.The War Cabinet now had before them a further Memorandumby the Home Secretary (W.P. (42) 444) explaining that the numberof children who would be eligible to be admitted under the above decision was extremely limited, and that the children whoseposition was most pitiable were those who became in effect orphansas the result of the deportation of their parents. He therefore recommended that the previous decision should be amended so as toallow the admission to this country of any refugee children fromUnoccupied France in the case of whom there was already in thiscountry either a parent or a near relation (&quot; near relation &quot; beingdefined as meaning a grandparent, an uncle or aunt or a brotheror a sister).The War Cabinet approved this suggestion.Foreign Affairs.China.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 121stConclusions,Minute 2.)10. At their meeting on the 7th September, the War cabinet had approved in principle a proposal that we should join withthe United States Government in .a combined approach to theChinese Government regarding the future of our extra-territorial rights in China.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet that he had now received from the United States authorities the draft of a treaty with the Chinese Government. The matter was urgent, because it was desired to make a communication tothe Chinese Government on the 9th October. He would circulate the text forthwith,* and it might be necessary for it to beconsidered at a very early meeting of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Parliament.Debate on theadministrationof the Army.11. The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to a parliamentary question by Mr. R. Bernays, M.P., for answer the following day,asking whether the Prime Minister could state when a day wouldbe given for the discussion of a Motion on the Order Paperrelating to the organisation and training of the Army. He had ascertained that the Committee of Service Members would be* Circulated as W.P. (42) 448.
content if facilities were given for discussion of this question;during the debate on the Address at the opening of the new Session;but they would prefer the discussion to be held in Secret Sessionas many of them, being junior officers in the Army, would find it embarrassing to speak on these questions in public.The Secretary of State for^War said he would have preferred that the whole debate should be held in public, and he urged thathe should in any event be enabled to give in open Session his replyto the criticisms which were being made of the administration ofthe Army.The War Cabinet&apos; agreed that the reply to Mr. Bernays&apos;s.Question should be on the following lines.In the course of the debate on the Address there wouldbe a general discussion on the Army and a statement would be made by the Secretary of State for War. It.would be open to any members wishing to discussparticular aspects of this subject to put down an amendment to the Address. The Members concerned could, if they wished, propose that discussion on this amendment should be taken in Secret Session. But, ifthe amendment was discussed, in Secret Session, thegeneral debate on the Address would thereafter be revived, in order that the Secretary of State for war might have an opportunity of making in open Sessionhis answer to any general criticisms of the&apos;Army and ofWar Office administration.U.S.S.R.Celebration ofthe SovietAnnual Day.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 74thConclusions,Minute 7.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad been invited to speak at a demonstration to be held in theEmpress Hall on the 7th November in celebration of the SovietAnnual Day. On referring to the Home Secretary, he had learntthat this demonstration was being arranged by organisations whichwere under the influence of the Communist Party of Great Britain,and he had therefore declined the invitation. He thought it rightto mention this in case other Ministers should receive a similar-invitation.While it was agreed that no Government support should begiven to this meeting, it was suggested that some otherdemonstration might be officially organised during November(though it would be inappropriate to hold it on the Soviet AnnualDay) in celebration of Russia&apos;s successful resistance to german aggression.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider this suggestion in consultation with the Minister of Information.Great George Street, S.W.1,October 5, 1942.
