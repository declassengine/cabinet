The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Bomber Command had carried out a successful raid onStuttgart. Turin had been attacked twice. Coastal Command had attacked one U-boat and a number of enemy vessels, including a blockade-runner. Fighter Command had flown 700 offensive sortiesbesides sorties on shipping protection. In the Home Theatre theenemy had lost 8 aircraft destroyed and 4 probably destroyed. our losses had been 6 fighters (1 pilot safe), 18 bombers and 4 coastal command aircraft.United States aircraft had attacked the Biscay submarine bases and caused disorganisation.Aircraft based on Gibraltar had made 7 promising attacks onU-boats. In North-West Africa 41 enemy aircraft had been destroyed, 7 probably destroyed and 24 damaged. Our losses hadbeen 16 aircraft destroyed and 7 damaged.Aircraft based on Malta had attacked aerodromes in Sicily andTunis, and air-borne supply lines to Tunisia.In Cyrenaica, despite bad weather, our aircraft had continuedto harass the enemy retreat. Forty-two enemy aircraft had been destroyed, 3 probably destroyed and 43 damaged. We had lost24 aircraft.Merchant shipping losses for the previous week amounted to129,000 tons.Of the 10 ships, independently routed, 5 had now arrived in north Russia.  The others had been lost.An Indian Naval minesweeper escorting a tanker from australia to India had been attacked by 2 Japanese raiders. after a gallant action on the part of both our ships, one of the raiders hadbeen sunk and the other had turned away. Both the minesweeperand the tanker (the latter having been torpedoed) had reached port.Suitable rewards for this action were under consideration.A west-bound convoy had reached Malta. The merchant vesselsarrived safely. One escorting cruiser had been torpedoed but had reached port.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook toascertain whether any orders had been given for anincrease in the rations for troops at Malta.In the recent naval battle fought by night between UnitedStates and Japanese forces the Japanese had probably lost 2 battle-ships, 6 heavy cruisers and a number of destroyers. Of 12 Japanesetransports, 8 had been sunk and 4 beached and later destroyed. TheJapanese thereby might well have lost some 20,000 men. UnitedStates losses included 2 light cruisers.A case had occurred in which the new net protection had successfully detonated an enemy torpedo without damage to the ship.The First Sea Lord was asked to make proposals to the anti-U-Boat Warfare Committee as to acceleration of the programmes for manufacturing and fitting these nets.The enemy was endeavouring to spread southwards from his main lodgment in Bizerta and Tunis, and much depended on the speed with which we could bring up our forces to counter this move.Attention was drawn to a report that Bizerta Harbour was full of enemy transports, and the importance of attacking them, was stressed.     .The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to inform the PrimeMinister of the action which aircraft, based on Malta, were taking to this end.In Cyrenaica operations had been impeded by bad weather,which had limited our pursuit mainly to the roads, where progress had been relatively slow because, of craters and enemy mines. TheWar Cabinet were informed of the present disposition of the eighth Army, and Of the enemy forces likely to be available. Ourproblem was now primarily one of overcoming the administrative difficulties of maintaining a force so far ahead of its base.
Russia. The Russians had launched two counter-attacks to the northand south of Stalingrad; and there were indications that the one from the south was making good progress and had reached the Don.This pincer movement had great possibilities.In the south, Russian counter-attacks seemed to have secured the Georgian Pass.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.2. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a telegram which he had-sent to General Eisenhower congratulating him on thesuccess of the operations in North Africa, and a reply which he hadreceived from the General.The Prime Minister also stated that a copy of a telegram fromGeneral Eisenhower to the Combined Chiefs of Staff had just beenreceived. This stated that, in accordance with instructions receivedfrom the President, the draft protocol, as amended, had been signed on the 21st November.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.United States of 3. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to the recent speechAmerica. by Mr. Sumner Welles, which seemed to show that the United states administration was becoming more favourably disposed towardsearly conversations on our common post-war problems, particularlyin the political sphere.The War Cabinet noted with approval the foreign secretary&apos;s intention to follow up this indication ofwillingness on the .part of the United States Governmentto open discussions on these questions.Royal Marines. 4.

MOST secret.M.(42) 157TH CONCLUSIONS,confidential Record - No circulation.UNITED STATES * THE PRIME MINISTER referred to recent speeches by------ Mr. Wendell Willkie.     Apart from his apparent willingnessIfr. Wendell.        to say anything which might win him political support,IViELkie. Mr. Willlcie seemed to be unduly influenced &quot;by anything whichhe could interpret as a personal slight.-   At the moment,he seemed to be nursing two grievances - (a) resentment ata recent article in Colliers Magazine;   and (b) a feeling that the Prime Minister had declined to see him at theWhite House on the occasion of his last visit to theUnited States.    On both these points it would be possibleto give reassuring explanations.    The magazine article hadbeen written by an American journalist and passed by theU.S. censorship.    And there was no foundation for the belief that the Prime Minister had avoided a meeting withMr. Willlcie in the United States:    on the contrary, he had tried to get into touch with him but had been unable toarrange a meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was quite prepared to try to remove Mr. Willlcie1 s misapprehensionson these two points;    and, further, was ready to extend to him an invitation to make a further visit to thiscountry.   He proposed that, in the first instance, heshould try, through H.M. Ambassador in Washington, toremove the sense of grievance from which Mr. Willkieappeared to be suffering on the two points mentioned, above.If this approach evoked a satisfactory response, he wouldtake some opportunity of including in a speech someconciliatory reference to Mr. Vi/illkie - to the effect that,while he could not help regarding some of his recentutterances as ill-judged, he would not readily forget thespirit in which Mr. Vtfillkie had in the past subordinatedhis personal and political interests to the cause of theUnited Nations.   He would then be willing to enquiry whetherthe President would object to our inviting Mr. Willlcie topay a further visit to this country;   and, subject to anyviews which the President might have, would send him such an invitation.THE PRIME MINISTER also said that Madame chiang kai-shek -shek was visiting America.    The question had been raised whether she should be invited to come to thiscountry.   He (the Prime Minister) thought that there was every advantage in this course, and he had so informed theForeign Secretary.a&amp;ame Chiangai-Shek.
