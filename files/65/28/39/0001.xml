North Africa. 1.   The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet an advance(Previous copy, received by telegram, of a letter addressed to him by AdmiralReference: Darlan.W.M. (42) 168th        The Prime Minister said that the question whether any replyConclusions, should be sent to this letter would require consideration.Minute 6.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Ministerof Production (W.P. (42) 574) regarding the functions of theMinister-Resident in Washington for Supply, whose appointmenthad been announced on the 23rd November.Broadly speaking, it was proposed that the Resident minister should act as the Minister of Production&apos;s Deputy in Washington.He would be responsible for co-ordinating the work of the BritishCivilian Missions and the British Civilian Members of the combined Boards, within the Terms of Reference previouslyapproved for the British Supply Council, of which he would become the Chairman. But, in order that he should not be burdened withdetailed work in connection with any of the Missions or combined boards, it was proposed that he should not serve as the Ministerof Production^ representative upon either the Combined Produc-tion and Resources Board or upon the Combined Raw MaterialsBoard.Draft detailed Terms of Reference for the Minister-Residentwere annexed to the Note.The following points were made in discussion : (1). The Minister of Production said that the Minister-Residentwould not intervene in regard to the work of theMissions of the Ministers of Food and War Transportexcept on the request of the Head of the Mission, whoseresponsibility to his Minister was, of course, unimpaired.(2) There was, however, a tendency in Washington to deal asa whole with the problems affecting such areas as, say,North Africa. Since both military, shipping, supplyand food questions were involved, it was clear that theMinister-Resident could play a very useful role asco-coordinator.(3) It was explained that the reference in paragraph 5 of theTerms of Reference to information on general economicand supply policy would not include matters within thejurisdiction of the Treasury and the Foreign Office.(4) The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that theMinister-Resident&apos;s position would be strengthened ifhe was the representative of each of the Supply ministers as well as of the Minister of Production.The general view was against the adoption of thisproposal. While the Minister-Resident would exercise a general oversight over the work of the three SupplyMissions to Washington, this was subject to the right ofthe Heads of any of the Supply Missions to refer to. their ministers in this country on any occasion when they thought this necessary.The War Cabinet Approved the Terms of Reference to the Minister-Residentas set out in Appendix; I to the Minister of Production^Memorandum.The minister resident InWashingtonfor Supply.(previous reference :W.M.
