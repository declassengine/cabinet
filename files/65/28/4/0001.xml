PRIME MINISTER&apos;personal TELEGRAM.Serial No. T. 1300/2,PRIME MINISTER TO PRESIDENT. - ^.9.PERSONAL AND SECRET, wuNOo 159*Your 189.     There is no possibility of letting?.Q, 19 sail in successive groups with reduced escorts as you suggest.    I append a note &quot;by the Admiralty on thissubject.   Neither can the fact that the convoy is not sailingbe concealed from the Russians any longer.   Maisky isalready aware of the position, though not officially informed and I expect he has let Stalin know the general prospect.We are preparing ten ships to. sail individually during the october dark.    They are all British ships for which the crewswill have&apos; to volunteer, the dangers being terrible andtheir sole hope if sunk far from help being arctic clothing and such heating arrangements as can be placed in thelifeboats.    Absolutely nothing else is possible unless youare able to help by providing some American ships for independent sailing after November 9 should experience have proved that the chances are sufficiently good.2.      I believe that the blunt truth is best with Stalinbut that there has been advantage in the delay of a fort-night in telling him, which you proposed.    I feel stronglyhe should be told now,5.     With regard to VELVET nothing can move before the battle in Egypt.   There is the danger that the germans will pull their Air force off Russia, and turn it on to EgyptThere&quot;is also the probability that they will be forcedanyway to turn a large proportion on to TORCH.But although we cannot be definite about an earlydate is seems to me that we could be more definite as tothe composition of the force than in the wording which you suggest for paragraph 9.    V/e have for weeks had the exactcomposition of the 20 squadrons planned out subject to yourconcurrence and help,    I should like to state the actualdetail of the force and the time required for it to moveand come into action^   The wording I should suggest we usej to Stalin is in my immediately following telegram.

4*     I am puzzled to know what message Admiral Standleyis &quot;bringing home to you, but I cannot believe it threatensa separate peace.    So far the Russian campaign has been veryadverse to Hitler, and though they are angry with us boththey are by no means in despair.5.     If therefore we offer VELVET as now defined, plusincreased aircraft deliveries and the individual ships onthe P.Of. route I trust this will be sufficient to bridge the gap before TOSCH opens.W.S.C.7.10.

APPENDIX.NOTE BY ADMIRALTY.Arrangements already made to sail about 10 ships from Iceland (G) during dark period 28th October to 8thNovember.    These would sail singly at about 200 mile intervalswith occasional larger gaps and rely on evasion anddispersion.2.     We had already considered sailing small groups withweak escort but in our view there is no half way betweenindependent sailings and fighting through with full escortingforces.3.     Our reasons are:-(a) Possibilities of evasion are slight as german air reconnaissance for North Russian convoysis very intensive and anything in the natureof a group of ships would be continuallyshadowed.(b) A group is more likely to draw attack by enemy surface vessels which are still waitingin their northern anchorages.(c) Anything short of full covering supportinvites disaster both to the group and naval forces*(d) To send a total of 40 ships in groups of 2 or3   whips with 2 or 3 escorts would employ as many escorts as were required for P.Q.18.TORCH is absorbing every available craft.4.     The voyage in anything but a full escorted convoyis so hazardous that it should only be undertaken by volunteerswho clearly understand the risk.    The chance of crews ofstricken ships surviving when they take to their boats isremote*W. 3. 0.6.10.42.
