The Chiefs pf Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Bomber Command had attacked Frankfurt and Mannheim, butbad weather had prevented these attacks from being very successful.On the previous day the Fives-Lille Steel and Engineering works and the Philips Electro-Chemical Works at Eindhoven had been bombed successfully, the former by United States aircraft. coastal command had made four attacks on U-boats with one possible hit.Enemy losses in the home theatre had been 9 aircraft destroyed,2 probably destroyed and 14 damaged. Our losses had been13 fighters destroyed (1 pilot safe), 29 bombers and 6 coastal command aircraft.Anti-U-boat patrols off North Africa had probably sunk2 U-boats and possibly damaged 4.The War Cabinet were informed of the air situation in Tunisia,which, at the moment, was unsatisfactory owing to insufficiency ofairfields, mechanical transport and labour. Great efforts were beingmade to overcome these difficulties. During the previous weekenemy losses had been 85 aircraft destroyed, 29 probably destroyed and 36 damaged. American and British losses had been 70 aircraft destroyed and 24 damaged.Aircraft based on Malta had continued to attack the enemy&apos;ssea and air supply lines to Tunisia.Including belated reports, shipping losses for the previous week amounted to 81,500 tons.As a result of the air attack on Naples, 3 Italian battleshipshad left the harbour.An Italian blockade-runner had been sunk in the Bay of biscay.A further convoy had arrived at Malta and was unloadingwithout interference.The Japanese had made two attempts to get reinforcements intoGuadalcanal.  Both were believed to have failed.Information was given about the positions now held by our forces in Tunisia, where our advanced troops had suffered a severecheck. The work of bringing up our forces, and concentrating thembehind the line now held, was making good progress; but it was ofthe utmost importance to interrupt the flow of enemy reinforce-ments.During the previous week our forces had been closing up on theenemy positions at El Agheila.Australian reinforcements had reached New Guinea. TheJapanese were still holding out in Buna.The Russians had made little progress either at Veliki Luki or at Rzhev. Near Stalingrad, however, important progress had beenmade and the Russians had succeeded in holding all their gains andshortening the ring round Stalingrad. The Russians were nowwithin 170 miles of Rostov.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.german atrocities.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 3rdConclusions,Minute .5.)2. The Secretary of State fo&apos;r Foreign Affairs said there werereports of further atrocities against Jews in Poland, and theGovernments of some of our European Allies were pressing for afurther declaration condemning these outrages. Subject&apos;to the WarCabinefs approval, he proposed to explore the possibility of a joint declaration on this subject by His MajestyV Government and theGovernments of the United States and the U.S.S.R.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.
North Africa.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 162ndConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Mack, British CivilLiaison Officer with General Eisenhower, who had recently returnedto this country from North Africa, had reported to him a conversation which he had had with General Bethouard, who hadcommanded a French Division in Morocco and was now at Gibraltar.The Foreign Secretary gave the War Cabinet an account ofGeneral Bethouard&apos;s views on the political situation in north africa. The general conclusion which emerged from this and other information available was that, if we exercised patience andallowed the situation to develop, there was some prospect of bringing to the head of the French administration leaders welldisposed towards the Allied cause who would be prepared to work together. If we were able gradually to introduce into the adminis-tration people who were favourably disposed towards us, they wouldbe able themselves to get rid of the unreliable elements now includedin the administration.In this connection it was suggested that it would be--ad*an:tageous if General Catroux could b&apos;e- persuaded to abandon-,-hijintention to return to, Syria in the immediate future. - &quot;Preference was also made to the importance of relieving general eisenhower of his political responsibilities at the earliest possible moment. Proposals for providing him with political assistance hadalready been made to President Roosevelt.The War Cabinet took note of these statements, and invited the Foreign Secretary to see what could be done to dissuade General fV. :oux from returning to Syria in theimmediate future.Production.Mission of minister ofProduction to washington.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 147thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Prime Minister welcomed the Minister of production on his return from his Mission to Washington. He had receivedfrom President Roosevelt a letter outlining the assistance we might expect to receive in shipping and referring to the agreementsreached in respect of aircraft and tanks.The Minister of Production said that he would circulate shortlya memorandum supplementing the information contained in the presidents letter, and he asked that until then his colleagues wouldsuspend judgment regarding the results achieved by his Mission.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Prisoners ofWar.(Previous. Reference:W.M. (42) 164thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegramfrom His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne (No. 4408, dated the4th December), stating that the International Committee had informed His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Geneva that the Germans had told the Committee officially that all prisoners would be unshackledduring Christmas week. The International Committee intended to propose to both sides that this concession should be continued for an indefinite period after Christmas.The War Cabinet took the view that this statement provided an opportunity for ending what might otherwise become a deadlock.It was possible that the Germans had made the statement with theidea of bringing this procedure to an end, and that, if the shacklingwere suspended during Christmas week, they would be glad of an excuse for not resuming it thereafter. It was felt that, without waiting for the Swiss Government to make their appeal to both sidesto unshackle their prisoners from a given day, we should at oncemake a public statement to the general effect that, on hearing of theGerman proposal to unshackle our men during Christmas week, wehad given instructions that German prisoners in our hands shouldbe unshackled forthwith.The Prime Minister said that Mr. R. R. Stokes, M.P., had aQuestion down, for answer the following day, asking whether theCanadian Government had been consulted before His Majesty&apos;s
Government in this country decided that German prisoners shouldbe shackled. He proposed to reply that there had been no time forprevious consultation with Dominion Governments before thisdecision was taken. The decision to unshackle these prisonersmight now be announced in a statement to be made in the House ofCommons after Questions on the following day, and the reply toMr. Stokes&apos;s Question could be given as part of that statement.The Foreign Secretary said that he would telegraph to Bernethat night in order that the Swiss Government might be informed of the action which we were intending to take before the statement was made.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : &apos;(1) The Prime Minister should make a statement in the Houseof Commons on the following day on the lines indicated at &quot; A &quot; above.(2) The Foreign Secretary should at once inform the swiss government of the statement which the Prime minister was to make, and should indicate that, if meanwhile the swiss Government made the public appeal which had previously been suggested to them, the Prime minister would say that our decision was taken in response to thatappeal.(3) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should informDominion Governments of the decision.(4) The Secretary of State for War should thereupon issue instructions for the shackling of German prisoners inthis country to be discontinued forthwith.[Note. During the night following this meeting of the WarCabinet two telegrams were received from Berne (Nos. 4468and 4469) stating that on the following day the swiss government would issue a communique calling on theBritish, Canadian and German Governments to unshackleall,prisoners on the 15th December. The Swiss Govern-ment requested that prisoners in British hands should notbe released before the 12th December, in order that theGerman Government might not suspect previous consulta-tion between the British and Swiss Governments. It wasdecided that we must comply with this request, and action was taken accordingly, the War Cabinet Conclusions beingregarded as overtaken by events. The Prime Minister didnot make his proposed statement in the House of Commons,and the Dominion Governments were informed of the new developments.]Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
