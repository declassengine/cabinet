1 Man-Powes;(previous reference:W.M. (42) 163rdConclusions.)1.   The War Cabinet resumed consideration of the man-power position, having before them W.P. (42) 556.-A Note by the Prime Minister, outliningcertain strategical considerations which should govern the revision of existing programmes and setting out his proposalsfor distributing the present deficiency in man-power.W.P. (42) 570. A Note by the Prime Minister, covering reports from the Service and Supply Ministers and theMinister of Home Security, showing how they would meet the cuts proposed in their requirements of man-power.W.P. (42) 572.- A Memorandum by the Minister of.Production, expressing general agreement with the lay-out ofman-power proposed by the Prime Minister, and suggestingcertain points to be borne in mind in giving effect to it.W.P. (42) 567. A Note by the Prime Minister on service requirements, proposing that the Minister of production should investigate in broad general terms the effect of an over-allcut of one-third in the rate of production in all items of theMinistry of Supply, save certain items of outstandingimportance.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows : I. Man-Power for the Services.(i) Navy. Note was taken that the revised intakes into theNavy and R.A.F. might involve an alteration in the authorised total numbers of Sea Cadets and A.T.C. Itwas suggested that it might be necessary to call on boysin the A.T.C. to serve in the Navy elsewhere than in theFleet Air Arm.It was agreed that these matters should be examined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister ofLabour and National Service, the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary of State for Air, or theirrepresentatives, in consultation,(ii) Army. Note was taken that in the Secretary of State forWar&apos;s view a reduction of four Divisions might, in the worse case, have to be faced as a result of the reducedallocation of man-power now authorised. No reductionin.the number of Divisions in the Army on this account should, however, be made without the prior consent of theWar Cabinet.(iii) In order to reduce the impact of the reduction on theArmy, and to enable this contingent reduction to be postponed as long as possible, the Minister of Labour and national Service undertook to find 25,000 men a month for the Army for the first five months of 1943.(iv) Royal Air Force. Note was taken that the reducedallocation of man-power now authorised would, in theSecretary of State for Air&apos;s view, prevent the formationof 57 average squadrons out of the present programme during 1943, the loss rising to 89 average squadrons in.June 1944. In addition, the loss of production estimated to result from the man-power cut to be imposed on theMinistry of Aircraft Production would result in a lossof 14 heavy bomber squadrons by the end of 1943 and19 by June 1944.II. Service Requirements.(v) Note was taken of the Prime Minister&apos;s Memorandum on service Requirements (W.P! (42) 567). While- an over-all cut of 33 per cent., might not be practicable, it wasagreed that enquiry should be made by the Service and supply Ministers, in consultation with representativesof the Ministry of Production and the Treasury, with aview to effecting substantial cuts. This enquiry wouldlink up with the review of Army requirements nowbeing carried out by the War Office and Ministry of[24753] b 2
Supply from the point of view of those items of equipment in regard to which (i) the Army could best afford a reduction; and(ii) a reduction would be of most assistance from thepoint of view of the stringency of man-power.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to considerwhether a reduction could be made in the output of shell,particularly of the higher calibres.Attention would also be paid to the scale ofancillary equipment, e.g., bombs, for the R.A.F.III. Man-Power for Munitions.(vi) The Minister of Labour and National Service, said that hecould not accept the proposal that no men should becalled up from the shipbuilding or aircraft industries for the Services. A certain number of highly skilled men must be called up to meet the requirements of theServices for skilled men.Note was taken that the points at issue were being discussed between the Departments concerned.(vii) Note was taken that the Minister of Aircraft production was proposing to submit a new programme of a realistic type by the beginning of 1943, and that his acceptance of a cut of 100,000 in his requirements was based on the assumption of a steady intake of labour ofall classes for his Department in Great Britain at therate of 30,000 a month(viii) This intake could not be achieved without carefuladjustment in the release and redistribution of labour.These matters would receive the particular attention ofthe Minister of Labour and National Service, in consulta-tion with the Minister of Production.IV. Civil Defence.(ix) The reduction of 75,000 proposed in W.P. (42) 570 was accepted. After taking into account the existingwithdrawal into industry, this meant an increase of64,000 in the net withdrawal. This was 36,000 less thanthe cut proposed by the Prime Minister. This balance would be met, as to 25,000 by the increased cut imposed on the Ministry of Aircraft Production, and as to 11,000by a further cut on the Ministry of Supply. It was placed on record that this was a heavy reduction,responsibility for which would, of course, be accepted bythe War Cabinet as a whole.(x) Every endeavour should be made to secure that a proportion, at any rate, of the Civil Defence personnel to be released under this reduction should be madeavailable for Civil Defence duties in the event of seriousemergencies.V. General.(xi) In the light of the foregoing, approval was given to theallocation of man-power set out in the Annex to these minutes, on the understanding that every possible step would be taken to avoid a reduction in the striking powerof the Services.(xii) This allocation covered the period 1st July, 1942, to31st December, 1943, and Departments should proceed onthe basis that this allocation would hold until the latterdate. The position would, however, be reviewed inMay 1943.
(xiii) To ensure balance between related Services and SupplyProgrammes, adjustments should be made as requiredbetween the Army and the Ministry of Supply, and between the R.A.F. and the Ministry of aircraft production, in the same manner as between the Navy andthe Shipbuilding programme. In particular the division between the R.A.F: and M.A.P. would be based on theNew M.A.P. programme (see (vii) above).2. The War Cabinet took note of a Report by the Minister ofProduction on his recent visit to the United States of America(W.P. (42) 568).America.(previous reference: &apos; ,&quot; _.W.M. (42) 165thConclusions,Minute 4.)Production.Mission of minister ofProduction to home Defence.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 78thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. In connection with the discussion recorded in Minute 1, thePrime Minister referred to a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the likelihood of invasion in 1943. The Chiefs of Staff had reached theconclusion that airborne and seaborne invasion was unlikely in 1943and that our forces should be organised on this assumption. Whilethe War Cabinet should, of course, have a further opportunity of considering this report, it had a considerable bearing on the man-power situation, and its adoption would enable considerable savings to.be made in static defences.The War Cabinet took note with approval of this statement.The Aircraft 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by Sir StaffordProgramme. Cripps covering a Report arising from an investigation by the(Previous Minister of Production and other Ministers into the policy for the reference: replacement of the Wellington and the Warwick (W.P. (42) 526).W.M. (42) 133rd   . , ,        ,   - .   ,Conclusions       Proposal to introduce the Vickers B. 3/42-Minute 1.) Discussion turned upon whether the  introduction of this aircraft was justified in view of the fact (a) That certain improved figures for the performance of theLancaster had been put forward since the Report was written. These indicated that the performance of theB. 3/42 might not be materially superior to the performance of the improved Lancaster.(&amp;) That the Lancaster might be introduced rather earlier thanthe B. 3/42: hence, to introduce the latter would meannot only a loss of Wellingtons, but also of potentialLancasters.It was stated that the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Production, together with the Air Staff and thetechnical experts, were unanimously in favour of introducing the B. 3/42. In their view, it was by no means certain that theLancaster could be improved to the point suggested, nor could theearlier introduction of the improved Lancaster be confidentlypredicted.The Minister of Production said that although he had originally been in favour of introducing the Lancaster into the vickersorganisation,  his  investigation  had  convinced  him  that  the&apos;     introduction of the B. 3/42 would be a more profitable undertaking.The Prime Minister said, that he was not entirely convincedby the case put forward in the Report.   In the Lancaster, we had a
proved success, the performance of which might well be improved as suggested by the new figures. There was always a great risk ingoing to a new type which would certainly have teething troubles,and might even prove a failure. He would like further time toexamine the position.Changie-over of Short&apos;s  (except Short-Harland) and  Austin&apos;sfactories from Stirling to Lancaster.It was generally agreed that this change was highly desirable.The Minister of Production explained that in the course of his negotiations in Washington, he had secured 398 Liberators, of which111 were for the replacement of wastage in existing squadrons.The remaining 287 had been allocated to us with the idea of making good the loss of 300 which the change-over from Stirlings toLancasters was estimated to involve.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that the change-overwould start probably next September, and would be complete by thefollowing Spring. Certain very large special machine-tools, which took nine months to build, would be required. He was bound topoint out that if the change-over were authorised, the supply of thesetools would not be sufficient to enable the Lancaster to be introduced in the Vickers organisation. A decision on the change fromStirlings to Lancasters, therefore, governed the decision on theintroduction of the B. 3/42. The two problems must be considered together.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed to give further consideration to the Report on-Monday, 14th December, 1942.(2) Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production to furnish thebest possible estimate that he could make to enable a comparison to be made of the effect of replacing theWarwick and the Wellington at Weybridge andChester by (a) Lancasters.(b) The B. 3/42.The Minister ofState in theMiddle East.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 47thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Prime Minister welcomed the Minister of State on his return for a short visit to the United Kingdom.The Minister of State gave the War Cabinet a brief account ofthe present situation in the Middle East theatre of war, and of theproblems confronting the Commanders-in-Chief.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,December 11, 1942.
