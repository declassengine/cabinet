The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.The Weather had been unfavourable for the night bombing ofGermany, but on Monday, the 9th November, Hamburg had been attacked.  Two successful attacks had been made on Genoa.Coastal Command had made one promising and three probableattacks on U-boats in the Atlantic and had destroyed 1 and perhaps2 off Gibraltar. United States aircraft had made two successful attacks on St. Nazaire. In the Home Theatre, the enemy had lost4 aircraft destroyed, 2 probably destroyed and 4 damaged. our losses had been 3 fighters, 22 bombers and 4 Coastal command aircraft.Aircraft from Malta had shot down at least 12 enemy troop-carriers en route between Sicily and North Africa. In operations in French North Africa, including operations of the Malta,squadrons, during the previous seven days the enemy had lost80 aircraft destroyed, 9 probably destroyed and 35 damaged. our losses had been 36 machines destroyed. *Our aircraft continued to attack the enemy&apos;s retreatingmechanical transport and had met with little air opposition. enemy losses in this theatre had been 40 destroyed, 4 probably destroyed and 10 damaged. Our losses had been 26 aircraft destroyed (mainly in attacking ground troops) and 3 damaged.In the Pacific the Japanese had lost 22 aircraft destroyed and7 damaged.  The Allies had lost 4 aircraft destroyed.Our merchant shipping losses for the previous week, includingships sunk during the operations off the North African coast,amounted to 184,700 tons.Details were given of the progress of operations in french north Africa. The German strength in Tunisia might now be about,000-8,000. Reinforcements were continually arriving. our forces had just crossed into Tunisia from Algeria.As a result of our operations in French North Africa, theGermans had moved 7-9 divisions from Occupied to unoccupied france and the Italians had moved in between 2-3 divisions.Our forces in Libya had reached Martuba and occupied the airfield. The pursuit of the defeated enemy continued. It was thought that the strength of Rommel&apos;s force amounted to some20,000* Germans and 30,000* Italians. The Prime Minister read tothe War Cabinet a cordial message of - congratulation which he had just received from M. Stalin, expressing his pleasure at the successof the operations in Libya and French North Africa.Australian forces had now reached Wairopi and had estab-lished touch with United States forces on their flank. The japanese were being driven back in the Buna area. -There had been little change in the Russian situation.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.* These figures include L. of C. troops.French north africa.(previous reference:W.M.(42)152ndConclusions,Minute 1.)2. Discussion took place about the arrangements which general Eisenhower had made with the various French leaders in north Africa. A number of conferences had taken place, as theresult of which General Eisenhower had made an agreement witha French group who had undertaken - to do what they could in helping us to take Tunisia. The group was headed by admiral darlan, and included Nogues, Juin and Esteva, with Giraud as military chief. The group had undertaken to organise french north Africa for effective co-operation with us.Telegram No. 527&apos;*from General Eisenhower to the combined chiefs of Staff at Washington was read to the War Cabinet. this telegram made it clear that the conclusion of this agreement was regarded as essential on military grounds, more particularly if wewere to have any hope of getting Tunisia quickly.[246S6] fBPlswti.
The Prime Minister said that he had sent a personal telegram to the President, after consultation with the Foreign Secretary and field-Marshal Smuts, in which he had said that our doubts andanxieties were not removed. But, in view of the dominatingimportance of speed, we felt that we had no choice but to acceptGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s arrangements for maintaining local andinterim equilibrium, and for securing the vital positions in Tunis.The Prime Minster had added that he was sure we would be consulted on long-term steps, pursuing the aim of uniting allFrenchmen who would fight Hitler.The War Cabinet were also informed that the Prime minister had that day seen General de Gaulle, with the Foreign Secretary.The Prime Minister had told General de Gaulle that his own position was unassailable, that he need not be alarmed at the courseevents were taking, and that he would be well advised not to makeany strong public protest against what had been done. In the end,General de Gaulle had, however, decided to issue a communique, theeffect of which was that he dissociated himself from negotiations in north Africa. No objection could be raised to the terms of the communique.The Foreign Secretary thought that it was important that weshould put it on record officially with the President that we thoughtit would be disastrous if we were to make any permanent arrange-ments with Admiral Darlan.  A draft telegram had been prepared .with this end in view.Field-Marshal Smuts thought that it might be as well to makeit clear to the United States Government that, while we recognised the need in the military situation for coming to some temporary arrangements with Admiral Darlan, we should look to some stabilisation-sation of the political situation as soon as the military situationpermitted.The Prime Minister said that he would like time to considerwhether it would be appropriate to put this point officially to theUnited States authorities immediately. A decision was thereforedeferred.It was thought that the question of the conclusion of anagreement with1 Admiral Darlan was likely to be raised in the Houseof Commons. It was felt that it would be difficult to deal with thematter adequately without reference to the military needs whichhad led to the conclusion of the agreement. This could not be done at present, and it was generally felt that it might be wise thatthe Prime Minister should answer a Question to the effect that itwas not practicable to discuss this matter at the present juncture.His Highness 3.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet  thatthe Maharaja Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar was leaving this country in about aJam Saheb of week&apos;s time on a visit to North America. He was going first toNawanagar, and Ottawa, as Leader of the Indian Delegation to the Institute ofSir Ramaswami Pacific Relations Conference, and later to the United States, andMudaliar. would return in January.    The Prime Minister referred toSir R. Mudaliar&apos;s work since he arrived in this country, and said,..       . that he would have the cordial good wishes of the War Cabinet inhis visit to Canada and to the United States. The War cabinet would be sorry not to have him at their meetings during the next twomonths, but they were glad that the Jam Saheb would still be withthem. He knew that the Jam Saheb&apos;s visits to Naval, Military andAir establishments in this country had been most warmly welcomed!The War Cabinet associated themselves with what thePrime Minister had said.
Ceylon. 4.   The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by thePood Supplies. Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42)522) regarding the(Previous .       supply of rice to Ceylon;Reference: It was pointed out in the Memorandum that, in spite of theW.M. (42) 124th efforts made to obtain increased&apos; supplies from India since this conclusions, question was discussed by the War Cabinet on the 14th September,Minute. 6.) the position remained unsatisfactory and a grave situation was nowdeveloping. Ceylon&apos;s minimum needs were 30,000 tons a month;and during October the Island had received only 1,250 tons from india, the only practicable source of supply. On the 20th Octoberrice stocks in the Island amounted only to 23,000 tons, about afortnights supply. vIt was therefore recommended (a) That the Government of India should take exceptional measures to ensure Ceylon&apos;s essential rice supplies, tothe extent of 30,000 tons a month.(&amp;) That, to supplement this supply of rice, shipments of wheat and flour from Australia should be assured at the rateof 15,000 tons a month.(c) That, if rice supplies could not be maintained at the rateof 30,000 tons a month, the shipments of other cerealsfrom Australia should be proportionately increased.(cl) That, if possible, additional quantities of Vice, wheat and flour should be shipped to Ceylon for the purpose ofbuilding up a reserve stock of essential food.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was grateful to Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar for the efforts which he had made to increase the supplies of rice sent from India to Ceylon.Since his memorandum was circulated, he had had a further letterfrom Sir Ramaswami indicating that the Government of India howhoped to send to Ceylon a total of 36,500 tons of rice during november and December. While this would be helpful, it wouldnot avert the risk of grave shortage, for, even if actual shipmentsequalled the estimates as they had not hitherto the Island would. . be left at the end of December with no reserve stocks at all. Thiswas most dangerous, not only from the standpoint of defence, butalso from the point of view of maintaining Ceylon&apos;s production of rubber and other essential raw materials. There were indications that the morale and efficiency of workers in the Island were alreadybeginning to suffer from the food shortage. He therefore suggestedthat the Government of India should be pressed to ship anadditional 20,000 tons of rice during the next two months. Failingthat, he asked for increased shipments of wheat from Australia though it should be realised that the possibilities of substitutionwere limited, since the rice-eating population of the Island wouldnot accept other cereals in place of rice.  :Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar said that the Government of india were finding real difficulty in increasing these supplies. Thoughthe total Indian crop was large, some of the small cultivators werewithholding supplies, and Provincial Governments were findinggreat difficulty in getting supplies on to the market. There were also difficulties of internal.transport, for the areas nearest to Ceylonwere those in which there was a deficiency. The Government ofIndia had already exploited to the full the capacity of ordinary commercial agents to acquire supplies; it was only when these had failed that Provincial Governments had been asked to take excep-tional measures to bring increased supplies forward.The offer to ship 36,500 tons in November and December was without prejudice to the possibility of making fresh allotmentsduring those months; and the Government of India were alreadyconsidering what further supplies could be obtained. They were fully alive to the urgency of Ceylon&apos;s need, and he thought it undesirable that any pressure should be brought to bear on them bythe War Cabinet.
The position should improve shortly, when the new crop wouldbe available. Moreover, the Government of India had decided toestablish a Central Secretariat to exercise co-ordinating powers overFood Supplies. This would enable the Central Government toexercise direct powers in this matter in the future.In discussion, it was pointed out that the supplies required byCeylon represented less than \\ per cent, of the total Indian crop.In view of the strategic importance of Ceylon in connection with thedefence of India, and the extent to which the Empire&apos;s war effortnow depended on Ceylon&apos;s rubber production, it was felt that india should make strong efforts to provide the rice required to meet the island&apos;s minimum needs.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for India and Sir Rama-swami Mudaliar to ensure that the Government of india were aware of the urgency of meeting Ceylon&apos;s minimum requirements for rice and the importance of building upreasonable reserve stocks. The Government of india should be urged to assure the delivery of 36,500 tons office during the months of November and December, andto make every possible effort to send increased quantitiesduring that period. They should be asked, further, toarrange for larger shipments to be made after thebeginning of the New Year.Social Services. 5.   The Minister of Information asked for the guidance of the sir William War Cabinet in dealing with a request that he should provide.Beverid&quot;e&apos;s facilities for Sir William Beveridge to expound to a PressReport. Conference at the Ministry of Information the recommendations inhis forthcoming Report on the Social Services. He understood that sir William Beveridge also proposed to address Lobby corres-coorespondents on the subject some time before the publication of theReport. It appeared that he intended to disclose not only therecommendations made in the Report, but his own views on those recommendations; and there were indications that he was already working up a political campaign on this question.The Minister proposed, subject to the views of the WarCabinet, to decline to offer Sir William Beveridge any facilities forsuch a purpose.In discussion, it was pointed out that Sir William Beveridge&apos;sReport was presented to the Government, and it was for the Govern-ment to decide how and when it should be published. Furthermore,the responsibility for expounding a report presented to theGovernment lay with the Government, and not with the author orauthors of the report. Moreover, Sir William had been paid from public funds while conducting the enquiry.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Information to inform Sir william beveridge that he should not be given any facilities, byway of Press Conferences or otherwise, for explaining to the public the recommendations, made in his Report.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General to make it clear toSir William Beveridge that it would be improper for.   . : him to disclose any part of his Report before its publica-tion; and that, as the Report was. to be presented toParliament as a Command Paper, any such disclosuremight raise questions of Privilege; that the date of publication was a matter for decision by the Govern-ment; and that it was also for the Government to explain to Parliament and to the public the implications of therecommendations made in the Report.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,November 16, 1942.
Ref * No. 527Dispatched: Nova 14th 1640ZReceived  : Nov. 14tfr 1745ZMOST   SECRETINCOMING MESSAGEHEADQUARTERSFrom:- EisenhowerTo:Combined Chiefs of StaffRef* Noe 52714th November 1942EDITED LITERAL TEXTCan well understand some bewilderment in Londonand Washington with the turn that negotiations with french North Africans have taken.  The actual stateof existing sentiment here does not agree evenremotely with some of prior calculations,,  Thefollowing salient facts are pertinent and it is extremely important that no precipitate action athome upset such equilibrium as we have been ableto establish.Foremost is the fact that the name of marshal petain is something to conjure with here.   Everyonefrom highest to lowest attempts to create theimpression that he lives and acts under the shadowof the Marshal&apos;s figure.   The civil governors,military leaders and naval commanders will agree on only one man as having an obvious right to assume the Marshal&apos;s mantle in North Africa^   That man isDarlan.   Even (Siraud^ who has been our most trustedadviser and staunchest friend since early conferencessucceeded in bringing him down to earth, clearlyrecognizes this overpowering consideration and hasdrastically modified his own ambitions and intentionsaccordingly.The resistance we met initially was offeredbecause all ranks believed this to be the Marshal&apos;swish and for this reason Giraud is deemed to havebeen guilty of at least a touch of treachery in urgingnon-resistance to our landing.   Giraud himselfunderstands and appears to have some sympathy for this/universal attitude.

universal attitude.   All concerned profess themselvesto be ready to go along with us provided Darlan tellsthem to do so, but they are absolutely not willing tofollow anyone else.   For example, AomraXTjIsteva inTunis says he will obey Darlan, while Nogues stoppedfighting in Morocco by Darlan&apos;s order.  Recognition ofDarlan&apos;s position in this respect cannot be escaped.The gist of the current agreement is that theFrench group will do what it can immediately to assist us in taking Tunisia.   The group- will organize french north Africa for effective cooperation and will beginreorganization, under Giraud, of selected militaryforces for active participation in the ware   It willexhaust every expedient in an effort to get theToulon Fleet.  We will support government in controllingand pacifying country and in helping equip1, selectedelite units0   Many details still under discussion.Our hope of early conquest of Tunisia and ofgaining here a supporting and organized populationcan not possibly be realized unless there is accepted a general agreement along the lines which we have just concluded with Darlan and his admirals, withGiraud, with Nogues, who controls the tribes in Morocco,with Juin and others.   Giraud is now so fully aware ofhis inability to do anything by himself, even withAllied moral and military support, that he hascheerfully  accepted the post of Military Chief in theDarlan group.  He fully agrees also that his ownname should not be mentioned in connection with this movement for a period of several days.  Without astrong French government of some kind here we wouldbe forced to undertake complete military occupation.The cost -in time and resources would be tremendous.In Morocco alone General Patton calculates that itwould require 60,000 Allied troops to hold the tribesquiet, and in view of the effect that any tribaldisturbance would have on Spain, you can see what a problem we are up against.Giraud is honest and will watch Darlan.   Moreover,Murphy, who has done a grand job, will as head ofNY Civil Affairs Section, practically live inDarlan&apos;s pocket.  Mack and other capable men willcooperate with him.   I realize that there may be a feeling at home that we have been sold a bill of/goods,

goods, but I assure you that these agreements havebeen arrived at only after incessant examination, ofthe important factors and with the determination to get on with military objectives against the Axis and to advance the interests of the Allies in winning thiswar0While Giraud&apos;s name must not be associated withthis movement publicly for the moment, you may assureany of the Free French to whom it is necessary toimpart this information that Giraud is an enthusiasticparticipant in this arrangement.   At my final conference with the group Giraud expressed himself to me as pleasedwith the turn of events.  This should nullify theDe Gaullists.   We clearly realize that our governments have committments to certain elements of the french people throughout the world and we are not attempting to extend the agreement here beyond the areas in whichit is necessary to do so.   However, in thisconnection, these French leaders firmly believe thatif they are permitted to send an emissary to Dakarthey can draw French West Africa into this organrizational arrangement very quick and make sure thatthat area is secure to the Allies.   Since this group)is committed to going along with us for the defeat of Germany and staying in the war until the end, itappears that I should be authorized at once to assistthe group in sending an emissary to the Governor ofDakatvAt the final conference with this group, I was accompanied by Admiral Cunningham who had a personalconversation with Darlan.  They agreed upon a finalappeal to the French fleet at Toulon in an effort toget it to move.   In any event we are convinced thatDarlan is making a determined effort to get thatfleet and even if he fails there should be realizedthat Darlan -is. not empty handed so far as affairs in north Africa are concerned.It must be remembered that hostilities inMorocco ceased by order of Darlan and not by fullmilitary conquest..   French military posTEiom inthat area is still such as to be capable of causingus additional trouble particularly if Nogues, who willobey no one but Darlan, chooses to influence tribes.The certain and deleterious results on Spanish Moroccansituation are obvious./Finally,

Finally, it must be clearly appreciated thatif Darlan. is repudiated and we attempt from the outside to dictate the personnel of the coalitionto run this section of the world, the following willbe the consequences:a. Our hope of securing organized cooperationin this region will be gone, at great cost -to us in additional troops and in stagnationof operations.b. All French armed forces in this region willresist us passively and in certain instancesactive ly.Co   Our hope of getting Tunisia quickly will notbe attainable because Esteva will notcooperate.   He may already be helpless todo so but there is still a good chance.dB   The opportunity for gaining some military assistance froim remaining French naval, air and military units in North Africa will disappear .e.   The last glimmer of hope with respect to theToulon fleet will be gone.Assisted by General Clark and Admiral! Cunninghamand our full staff, I have made what we consider tobe the only possible workable arrangement forsecuring advantages and avoiding disadvantages Ihave outlined in this telegram,,   I am certain that anyone who is not on the ground can have no clearappreciation oTVae complex currents of feeling andof prejudice that influence the situation.   Also itshould be clear that Giraud&apos;s earnest participation in this arrangement gives indication of the necessityfor the agreements we have made.Finally I suggest that if the two Governments afteranalysis of this radio are still dissatisfied withnature of agreement made that a mission of selectedBritish and United States representatives, and including Free French if deemed advisable, be immediately 1 dispatched to this headquarters where,in ten minutes, they can be convinced of the soundness of trie moves we have made./Colonel Stirling

colonel Stirling, special British militaryassistant on my staff, is returning to London tonightto provide more background on this whole subject,with which he is thoroughly familiar.  He is badly needed here and has been instructed to return as quickly as he has performed this mission.Relayed to AGWAR.Circulation rig. JacobForeign SecretaryC.
