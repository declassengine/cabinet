Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 141stConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.Egypt.naval operations.MilitaryOperations.Pacific.Madagascar.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week. .During the previous seven days Bomber Command had dropped 1,320 tons of bombs and 172 mines. The attack onCologne had been hampered by weather conditions, but the raidon the Creusot Works had been very successful. The attackingbombers had flown some 1,700 miles, making a big detour via the bay of Biscay.The War Cabinet Requested the Chief of the Air Staff to convey theircongratulations on the success of this operation to theAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command.Details were given of the operations of Coastal and FighterCommands. In the home theatre, the enemy had lost 9 destroyed,2 probably destroyed and 2 damaged. Our losses had been fighters, 35 bombers and 6 Coastal Command aircraft.Enemy attacks at the beginning of the previous week hadbeen heavy but their bomber sorties were now getting fewer. Theenemy losses for the previous seven days had been 102 destroyed,45 probably destroyed and 111 damaged. Our losses had been 34fighters destroyed, but a number of pilots had been saved.There had been a slight reduction in air activity owing to the weather. Enemy losses had been 16 aircraft destroyed, 3 probably destroyed and 8 damaged. Our losses had been 13 aircraft destroyed and 4 damaged.Our merchant shipping losses for the previous week amountedto 152,300 tons.In New Guinea our forces were advancing towards Kakoda.The position in the Solomon Islands was rather obscure.The War Cabinet Invited the Chiefs of Staff to ask the Joint Staff mission in Washington for fuller information about theoperations in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, andfor an expression of their opinion as to why there were such relatively weak American forces in those areas.Our forces had advanced some 110 miles south of Tananarive.In heavy attacks at Stalingrad the Russians had lost thenorthern portion of the city, and the situation there had deteriorated since last week. But the stout defence put up by theRussians at Stalingrad had probably prevented the Germans fromattacking Leningrad, and had slowed up their advance in theCaucasus. The Germans had made no progress either towardsGrozny or in the direction of the Georgian Pass.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 131stConclusions,Minute 3.)France.Vichy France.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 61stConclusions,Minute 4.)[245222. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave particulars of a daylight raid that morning over East Anglia.Twenty-four German bombers had taken part, but never more than four at a time. Sixteen persons had been killed, 64 seriously injured and 119 slightly injured. Some industrial damage hadbeen done.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.3. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat there were some indications of a revival of a spirit of resistance to Germany among the French people. There had beenreports of disturbances in certain areas in connection with theGerman demands for labour.-1]b 2
Fighting Apparently as the result of a telegram from General CatrouxFrance. condemning  the agreement  reached  over  the  Syrian position,(Previous General de Gaulle had replaced M. Dejean, who had been the reference: negotiator on the Fighting French side, by M. Pleven. GeneralW.M. (42) 131st de Gaulle  had  announced  that he was planning to appointConclusions, M. Dejean to a post abroad.Minute 0.) The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Field-Marshal 4.   The War Cabinet were informed of the arrangementsSmuts, made   for   Field-Marshal   Smuts   to   address   the   Houses   ofAddress to       Parliament.Houses of In view of the shortage of accommodation for visitors, itParliament. would be impossible to issue invitations to members of the(Previous Diplomatic Corps.    It was agreed that the admission of visitorsReference: should be dealt with on the basis that this was primarily a BritishW.M. (42) 140th Commonwealth occasion.Conclusions, lne speech was to be relayed hj wireless to countries overseas,Minute 3.) and the question was raised whether it would be safe for theB.B.C. to announce on the previous day the hour at which the speech would be made, so that it might secure a wider audienceof listeners overseas. It was agreed that no announcement could safely be made on the wireless, before the speech was deliveredgiving the hour of its delivery. The right course was therefore,that a record of the speech should be made and relayed later, atthe peak listening hour.The War Cabinet took note of these arrangements.commonwealth  /ealth 5    The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that trade Union he had been asked by Sir Walter Citrine whether the GovernmentConference.       saw objection to a proposal to hold in this country in April of next year a small Conference of representatives of Trade Unionsfrom all parts of the Empire.Field-Marshal Smuts said that the Government of the Unionfavoured this proposal.The War Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should inform Sir Walter Citrine thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government welcomed this proposal.Man-power. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFighting Minister  of  Labour   and   National  Service   (W.P.   (42)   472)Services: recommending that the minimum calling-up age for men shouldreduction of      be reduced from 18-J to 18.calling-up age. In the absence of the Minister of Labour, The Lord President(Previous explained that, while men become liable to military service under reference:        the National Service Acts on reaching the age of 18, hitherto theyW.M. (41) 110th had not in practice been called up until they were 18^.   TheConclusions,      stringency of the man-power situation was now such that it would minute 1.)        be necessary in future to call men up at age 18. ! It   --proposedto meet this situation in two stages.   First, a Royal jf reclamationwould be issued to authorise the call-up of men who read, jd theage of 18 between the 1st July and the 30th September.   this could be done without legislation.   Secondly, it was proposed toamend the National Service Acts so as to enable men to be registered and medically examined during their 18th year so thatthey could be called up without delay on reaching the age of 18.In discussion:, the following points were raised,: (a) In the drafting of the proposed legislation, and in announcing its introduction, care should be taken tomake it clear that men would not in fact be called upfor military service until they had reached the age of 18.
(&amp;) It had been the practice hitherto to allow young men to volunteer for the Armed Forces six months before they became liable to compulsory military service. Thechange now proposed would mean that in future theServices would accept volunteers at the age of 17-ijj.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that the minimum calling-up age for men shouldbe reduced from 18+ to 18.(2) Approved the proposal to arrange, by administrative measures, for the immediate registration for militaryservice of men who reached the age of 18 between the1st July and the 30th September; agreed the arrange-ments should be made for the issue of a further RoyalProclamation to this effect; and invited the Ministerof Labour and National Service to make an early statement in Parliament on the lines of the draft annexed to W.P. (42) 472.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toarrange for the preparation of a Bill to amend theNational Service Acts so as to enable men to be registered and medically examined before reaching theage of 18.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 461), enclosing the Reportof the American Technical Mission which had visited India inApril 1942 to examine the possibilities of American assistance inthe development of the industrial resources of India as a supplybase for the armed forces of the United Nations in the middle and Far East.The Secretary of State, in his Memorandum, recommended the attitude which we should take to the report at this stage. Itshould be explained that our policy had always been to give everyassistance to the expansion of India&apos;s war industry, and that anyfurther expansion would largely depend upon the help Americacould give in providing skilled supervision. There were also otherlimiting factors, e.g.y power, facilities and communications. It-should also be emphasised that care must be taken to avoid over-loading the Indian expansion programme to the prejudice of projects already in hand.Sir Ramaswami Mudalicir said that there was reason to doubt whether the American Technical Mission had taken sufficientlyinto account what had already been done to expand. India&apos;s war industry. He read an extract from a letter from the Secretaryof the Supply Department, indicating the line which theGovernment of India proposed to adopt in regard to therecommendations of this Mission. He urged that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should for the present leave the matter to be handled by the Government of India, and that they should not put pressureVMljhthe Government of India to take steps urged on them by theUnited- States authorities, if the Government of India thoughtthat these measures would overload the Indian expansion programme and would be detrimental to the best development ofIndia&apos;s war effort.The War Cabinet expressed general agreement with theviews set out in the Secretary of State for India&apos;sMemorandum, and with those stated by Sir RamaswamiMudaliar.
Strike in 8.   The War Cabinet had under consideration the position inNorthern regard to the strike in Belfast, which was particularly affectingIreland. the Short-Harland Works.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a letter datedthe 16th October, which he had received from the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland, reporting that the Northern ireland government had decided to set up a Court of Inquiry under theIndustrial Courts Act, 1919, to inquire into the causes and circumstances of the dispute.The War Cabinet were informed that this Court of Inquiryhad been set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Davidson,and had started work that day.When the matter had been considered by Ministers on Friday,the 16th October, the view taken had been that it was somewhatdoubtful policy to set up a Court of Inquirj^ to enquire into thecircumstances of this unofficial strike, and that it was important that the Northern Ireland Government should adhere to the position which it was then understood they were proposing to take up,namely, that the men should return to work before the Court of inquiry was set up. Later the Northern Ireland Government hadreceded from this point of view. The reason for this had been that,on Friday, the 16th October, there had been reason to fear aconsiderable extension of the strike.Sir Frederick Leggett explained that the policy adopted inthis matter had not always been uniform, and that there wereinstances in this country in which a Court of Inquiry had beenappointed, even in unofficial strikes, before the men had returnedto work.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Great George Street, S.W. 1.October 19, 1942.
