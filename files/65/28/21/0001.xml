The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thelast weekDuring the previous seven days the weather had been unfavour-able for night bombing, but Genoa had been raided on two nights,the second raid being particularly satisfactory. In the home theatrethe enemy had lost 12 aircraft destroyed, 3 probably destroyed and damaged. Our losses had been 13 fighters, 22 bombers and Coastal Command aircraft.United States Fortresses had bombed Brest and Lille.Enemy activity against Malta had been on a reduced scale.Our aircraft had torpedoed one merchant ship and one tanker.During the previous week our Middle East Air Forces had carried out 5,500 sorties; on one day alone 1,243 sorties had beenflown. Their targets had been the retreating enemy columns.United States aircraft had bombed Benghazi, Tobruk and Crete.The enemy losses had been 78 destroyed, 29 probably destroyed and 50 damaged. We had lost 72 aircraft (including 16 bombers),while 16 had been damaged.The Chief of the Air Staff was requested to study thepossibilities of bombing Italy, making use of bases in north Africa, and to report to the War Cabinet.Our merchant shipping losses for the previous week, includingbelated reports and ships overdue, amounted to 279,000 tons.Three supply ships, independently routed, had arrived in north russia.Details were given of the progress of operations in Egypt. Ithad been estimated that nine-tenths of the enemy tanks and three-quarters of their guns had been either captured or destroyed.40,000 prisoners had so far been captured, together with between900 and 1,000 guns and 500 tanks.The Prime Minister said that this was one of the greatestvictories ever won by the British Empire in the field, and, on behalfof the War Cabinet, he congratulated the Secretary of State forWar and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, together with therepresentatives of the Dominions and India present, on the brilliantpart played by their forces.General MacArthur was now in Port Moresby.Heavy fighting had taken place in Guadalcanal. A furtherJapanese landing had been held and heavy casualties inflicted on them.The War Cabinet were given a detailed account of the convoyarrangements involved by this great operation, and of the assaultson the North African Coast which had taken place on the night ofthe 7th-8th November.At Oran a good deal of opposition had been, and was still being,encountered. Although three successful landings had been made,,the town had not yet been captured, and it had been bombarded that morning from the sea, At Algiers there bad been less opposition,,and an armistice had been signed putting the town and the port inour hands. On the Moroccan coast landings had taken place at Safi,Fedala and Port Lyautey. It was not yet known how far inlandthese landings had progressed. French warships from Casablancahad engaged American naval forces and had suffered heavy casualties.   Particulars were given of the measures taken to fly[24607]b 2
aircraft to the airfields which had been seized near Algiers andOran.The War Cabinet had some discussion as to the strategicpossibilities open to us once French North Africa was firmly in our hands. It was stated that the Spanish reaction to the operation hadbeen very satisfactory.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The King&apos;s 2.   The War Cabinet were informed that the draft of the speeches. King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament had been amended(Previous to take account of events in North Africa since the Cabinet had reference: last met.W.M. (42) 150th        The War Cabinet agreed that a new paragraph should be addedConclusions,      to The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament, dealing with minute 3.)        the victory in the Western Desert and the steps taken to forestallthe enemy in the occupation of French North Africa.Celebration of 3.   The Prime Minister thought that arrangements should bethe Victory in made for the Church bells to be rung on the morning of Sunday, theNorth Africa.     15th November, in celebration of the victory in North Africa.The War Cabinet agreed in principle that, provided operationscontinued to be successful, this should be done, but decided that no announcement should be made on the matter until later in the week.Armistice Day.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 140thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The question was raised whether the Two Minutes&apos; Silenceshould be observed on Armistice Day this year.The Home Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that the TwoMinutes&apos; Silence had not been observed on each of the last threeanniversaries of Armistice Day; moreover, with the authority ofthe War Cabinet, he had already announced that the procedure thisyear would be on similar lines to that followed in 1941.The War Cabinet agreed that the procedure announcedshould be adhered to.U.S.S.R.Supplies andMilitaryAssistance.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 136thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that ithad been agreed that he should answer a passage in his speech inParliament later in the week as to the extent of the supplies whichwe had furnished to Russia. He thought that the figures givenshould cover supplies sent by this country and by the United states by the northern route. The question arose whether it would bebetter to give the figures of supplies despatched, or those which hadsafely arrived in Russia.The War Cabinet decided that the information should begiven on the basis of Anglo-American supplies despatched,it being added that, of course, the great bulk of the suppliessent had arrived safely.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the termsof atelegramrwhich he had sent to M. Stalin on the 5th November/ andof the replyTianded to him that morning by M. Maisky. The termsof this reply were very satisfactory.Persia. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to recent telegrams from Persia, which showed evidence of enemyintrigues. No decision could be taken until a reply had beenreceived from our Minister at Tehran. But his present view wasthat we should do our best to avoid being saddled with direct responsibility for the administration of th^ country.
141W.M. 151 (42),Prisoners of 7.   The War Cabinet considered whether any further actionWar. should be taken at this stage about the manacling of prisoners(Previous of War.Reference: The Prime Minister read an exchange of telegrams betweenW.M. (42) 148th ^mself Mr. Mackenzie King (No. 227, dated the 4th November,Conclusions, an(i No. 242, dated the 7th November, respectively), from which itMinute-2.) appeared that the Canadian Government were prepared to allow thematter to stand over for the present. The Prime Minister suggestedthat he might tell Parliament that we were still in negotiation onthis matter through the Swiss Government, but that he hoped to beable to make a further statement, say, during the following week.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that when Parliament reassembled a statement should be made on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for War would arrange for some relaxation of the measures applied to prisoners in our hands, e.g., by reducing the hoursduring which prisoners were kept manacled.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ask the Swiss government whether they had had any reply to their approach to theGerman Government; and to suggest that the&quot;represen-tative of the Protecting Power might inform himselfof the conditions now obtaining in the camps in which german prisoners were manacled.German 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theBreaches of the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (42) 508) giving examples of GermanRules of breaches of the rules of warfare.Warfare.

(42) 114thConclusions,Minute 2;)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 518) proposing that arrangements should be made forthwith to hand over the civil administration of Madagascar to the French National Committee.The Prime Minister said that he and the Foreign secretary had seen General de Gaulle the previous day in regard to theoperations in North Africa. General de Gaulle had been mostco-operative, and the broadcast which he had made the previous evening had been very helpful. On this account it was the moredesirable that an early announcement should be made of a decisionto hand over to the French National Committee the civil adminis-tration of Madagascar.In discussion, it was suggested that the draft communique inthe Annex to W.P. (42) 518 should be amended by omitting thestatement that General Legentilhomme would be &quot;entrusted withall civil powers and the command of French forces in Madagascar,&quot;and by adding at the end &quot; under&apos; the terms of the arrangement made with the French National Committee.&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that no arrangements had yet been concluded with the Committee; and, on this account, he was not sure whether it would be possible to secure their agreement to the
formula suggested in time to permit early releaseyof the announce-ment. He would, however, do his best to secure the Committee&apos;s.assent to the changes proposed.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the, Horeign Secretary to press the French national committee to accept the amendments suggested in thecourse of the discussion.(2) Agreed that a communique embodying these amendmentsmight be issued as soon as the assent of the french national Committee had been secured.Parliament. 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLiability of Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (42) 511)Members for regarding the liability of Members of Parliament for compulsory-compulsory fire-prevention duties. The Home Secretary recommended thatfire-prevention Members of the House of Commons should be required to register,duties. Dut that, if a Member felt unable to reconcile the liability to fire-watch with the performance of his Parliamentary duties, he should apply for exemption from enrolment to the Minister of home security (or, in the case of Scottish Members, to the Secretary ofState for Scotland). Such an application would normally begranted. A similar policy would be adopted with regard to members of the House of Lords.In discussion, the Minister of Labour and National Serviceexplained the procedure which he followed when a Member ofParliament was registered for service under the National service acts, with a view to ascertaining whether he preferred to devotehis whole time to his Parliamentary duties rather than.serve withthe Armed Forces.The War Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals outlined in w.P. (42)511.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour, whether the procedure tobe followed when a Member of Parliament wasregistered for fire-watching duties could be assimilatedto that already followed when a Member was registered under the National Service Acts.british nationality.Naturalisationof Frenchmenserving in HisMajesty&apos;forces.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 88thConclusions,Minute 11.)11. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum on thissubject by the Home Secretary (W.P. (42) 512).On the 4th July, 1940, the Prime Minister had given a pledgethat special facilities for acquiring British nationality would be accorded to French sailors who joined the British Navy at thattime. In the autumn of 1941 the War Cabinet had decided not toproceed with the Conferment of British Nationality (War Powers)Bill, on the ground that there was then no strong pressure forspecial facilities for the naturalisation of aliens serving with HisMaiesty&apos;s Forces. At the present time, however, Frenchmen serving with our Forces were pressing strongly for the Prime Ministerspledge to be honoured. It was therefore proposed to include in theBill which was to be introduced during the forthcoming Session toamend the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, a clause empowering the Secretary of State to grant a certificate ofnaturalisation to a Frenchman serving with His Majesty&apos;s Forceseven though he could not fulfil the statutory requirements as toresidence in His Majesty&apos;s dominions. It was proposed to resist any suggestion that these facilities should be extended to otheraliens serving with His Majesty&apos;s Forces.The War Cabinet approved the proposals outlined in&apos;..   W:P. (42) 512. .
Great George Street, S. W. 1,November 9, 1942.Parliament. 12.   The Home Secretary said that a Member of the House ofM.P &apos;s proposed Commons had applied for an exit permit to visit the United Statesvisit to United of America for the purposes of consulting with his publisherStates of regarding the publication of a book and making himself familiarAmerica. with the extent of the United States war effort.It could not be said that it was to the national advantage thatthis Member should go to the United States for these purposes; and,if he had not been a Member of Parliament, his application wouldhave been refused in accordance with the rules governing the issueof these permits.The War Cabinet agreed that this application should be^ refused.

Apart from the troops inthe main battle, there are six Italian and two German divisions inthe desert to the south of our advance along the coast.     these have very little mechanical transport or supplies, and it ispossible that a very heavy toll will be taken in the next fewdays.     Besides this, Rommel&apos;s only line of retreat is along the coastal road, which is now crammed with troops and transport andunder the continuous attack of our greatly superior Air Force.2.   Most Secret - for yourself alone.      &quot;TORCH&quot; is imminenton a very great scale.     I believe the political difficulties about which you expressed concern have been satisfactorily solved.     Themilitary movement is proceeding with precision.3.    I am most anxious to proceed with the placing of the 20British and American.;squadrons on your southern flank as early aspossible.     President Roosevelt is in full accord and there is no danger now of a disaster in Egypt.     Before anything can be donehowever it is necessary that detailed arrangements should be made about landing grounds, etc. , between your Officers and ours.Kindly let me know as soon as possible how you would like thisconsultation to be arranged.     The squadrons it is proposed to sendwere stated in my telegram of 8th October (Foreign Office No. 268)in accordance with which we have been making such preparations assere possible pending arrangements with you.4.   Let me further express to you, Premier Stalin, and toM. Molotov our congratulations on the ever-glorious defence of stalingrad and on the decisive defeat of Hitler&apos;s second campaign against Russia.     I should be glad to know from you how yoxi standin the Caucasus.5.   All good wishes for your anniversary.COPY(CYPHER)O.T.P.PRISEC. PRIME MINISTER1SPERSONAL TELEGRAMSerial No, T* 1434/2
