Anglo-AmericanCombinedBoards.(previous reference:. ,W.M. (42) 133rdConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister said that he had received a reply tothe telegram which he had sent to the President of the UnitedStates &quot;(in accordance with the suggestion made in W.P. (42) 434)regarding the need for further scrutiny of the production pro-grammes of this country and the United States with a view torelating them more directly to strategic needs. He had also heard from our Ambassador at Washington that it was unlikely thatMr. Harry Hopkins would find it possible to visit this country inthe near ^future. These telegrams were read out to the WarCabinet. 7The War Cabinet agreed that in the circumstances it would be advantageous if the Minister of Production, together with a seniorrepresentative of the Air Staff, could arrange to pay an early visit to the United States, with a view to opening discussions at thehighest level on these major questions of production policy.Prisoners ofWar.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 139thConclusions.)2. The Secretary of State for War informed the War cabinet of the steps taken in this country to give effect to the decision thata number of German prisoners of war should be put in chains.At 9 a.m. on the 10th October 240 German prisoners, includingGeneral Cruwell, had been warned that they would be put in chainsat noon the same day, in consequence of similar measures taken bythe German authorities against British prisoners captured atDieppe. General Cruwell protested against the order being appliedto him and asked to see M. Preiswerk, the representative of the protecting Power. Later in the morning he said that he was willing to submit to the same treatment as his men. The order wasduly carried out; but General Cruwell was found to be sufferingfrom eczema of the wrists, and on medical advice he was not put inchains. . -Handcuffs, with a 1-foot chain, were being used. There wasno manacling of the ankles. The prisoners were being kept in chainsbetween the hours of 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.General Cruwell saw M. Preiswerk during the afternoon ofthe 10th October, and during the course of that interview expressedthe opinion that the order for the manacling of British prisoners in Germany must have been given by Hitler personally.The Secretary of State referred to a telegram from Ottawa(No. 1868 of the 12th October) indicating that some resistance wasbeing encountered in enforcing the order for the manacling ofGerman prisoners in Canada. About a score of prisoners andguards had already been injured. Up to yesterday only 400prisoners had been put in chains. If the Canadian authorities wereto manacle the full numbers whom they had been asked to put inchains, they would have to apply the order to prisoners in the OzadaCamp; and, in view of the temper of prisoners in that camp, it seemed certain that the order bould not be enforced there without serious risk of rioting and shooting. It was therefore suggested inthe telegram that the Swiss Government should be asked to ascertain whether Canadian prisoners in German hands had offered resistance to the order and whether the Germans had used force in applying it.It was pointed out that, if such an enquiry were made by the swiss Government, it might provoke the Germans to make a similarenquiry about the enforcement of the order in this country and inCanada. If the Germans continued to keep any British prisoners in chains, we might wish, after an interval, &quot;to ask for information about the conditions under which this order was being applied; but, for the moment it was agreed that it would be better not to makeany such enquiry.The War Cabinet were reminded that no reply had yet beensent to the offer of the International Red Cross Committee to act asmediators in this matter. It was agreed that this enquiry might now be answered ori the basis that we were dealing with the matterthrough the Swiss Government in their capacity as protecting power under the Geneva Convention.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had beenable to persuade the Bishop of Truro to postpone the motion onthis subject which he had previously put down for discussion inthe House of Lords on the 15th October. It was, however, under-stood that the matter was to be raised the following day inConvocation. The War Cabinet agreed that the Archbishop of canterbury should be informed that, in the Governments view, itwas inexpedient that there should be any public debate on thisquestion at the present stage. If the Archbishop thought itimpossible to avoid having the matter debated in Convocation, itwould be desirable that the discussion should not take place in public.The War Cabinet took note of these statements, and invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange for1a reply to be sent to the International Red Cross Committeeasat&quot;X.&quot;Field-marshal smuts.Visit to thiscountry.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration the questionwhether arrangements should be made for Field-Marshal Smuts,who was very shortly arriving in this country, to address bothHouses of Parliament.It was recalled that in March 1939 the President of the french republic, M. Lebrun, had received tributes from both Houses in westminster Hall. Owing to steel scaffolding, Westminster Hallwas not now available. Arrangements could, however, probably bemade for a joint Meeting of both Houses to be held in the RoyalGallery, which would seat 700 persons. A. suitable time would be4-30 p.m., the House adjourning earlier than usual on the day inquestion.The question was raised whether an arrangement on these lines would raise difficulties with other visiting representatives of theDominions. It was thought that, owing to his special position(e.g., the fact that he had attended the Meetings of the War Cabinetin the last war), Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;s case could be differentiatedfrom those of other visiting Ministers.The War Cabinet accordingly approved in principle thesuggestion outlined.The Prime Minister undertook to consult Field-marshal smuts on this suggestion as soon as he arrived, and theChief Whip was instructed to proceed with the necessary arrangements, in consultation with the Ministers and authorities concerned, reporting as necessary to the lord president of the Council.United states forces.coloured troops.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 119thConclusions,Minute 6.)4.   The War Cabinet had before them (a) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (42) 441) suggesting that Army personnel shouldbe educated to adopt towards coloured troops theattitude adopted by the United States Army authorities,and enclosing a document entitled &quot; Notes on Relationswith Coloured Troops,&quot; which had been issued to certainOfficers for guidance by the Major-General in Charge ofAdministration, Southern Command.(b) Memoranda bv the Secretary of State: for the Colonies(W.P. (42) 442), the Lord Chancellor (W.P. (42) 455), theHome Secretary (W.P. (42)456), and the Minister ofInformation (W.P. (42)459), commenting on the policy. outlined in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State&apos;for War.(c) A suggested revision by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (42) 460)of the &apos;&apos; Notes on Relations with Coloured Troops&apos;&apos;appended to the Secretary of State for War&apos;s Memo-randum.
The following were the main points in the discussion which tookce:     r .  - , , &apos; &quot;       ]&apos;&apos;\ &apos; .(1) There was general agreement that the attitude of theUnited States Army to this question was a factor ofgreat importance, which must be given due weight in determining, the British attitude to coloured american troops. .(2) In particular, it was generally agreed that it was desirablethat the people of this country should avoid becomingtoo friendly with coloured American troops.(3) On the other hand, the recommendation made&apos; at theconclusion of the Secretary of State for War&apos;s Memo-randum that the personnel of the Army, including a.T.S., should be educated to adopt towards the UnitedStates coloured troops the attitude of the United states army authorities as at present worded went too far.(The Secretary of State for War agreed that someamendment of\his paper was called for in this respect.)While it was \right that our troops and our people should be educated to know what the American attitude was, it was equally&apos;important that the americans should recognise that we had a different problem asregards our coloured people and that a modus vivendibetween the two points of view should be found.(4) Turning to the practical issues involved, it was agreed thatwe need not, and should not, object to the Americansmaking full use of administrative.arrangements for thesegregation of their coloured troops.  But they must not expect oUr authorities, civil or military, to assist them in enforcing a policy of segregation,(5) It was clear that, so far as concerned admission to canteens,public houses, theatres, cinemas, and so forth, therewould, and must, be no restriction of the facilitieshitherto extended to coloured persons as a result of the&quot;arrival of United States troops in this country.(6) A certain number of instances had arisen in whichwell-intentioned persons had extended invitations to american white and coloured troops at the same timeThese occurrences could be avoided if those who wishedto   extend   hospitality   to   American   troops   wereencouraged to ask for guidance or to consult theauthorities before making arrangements.(7) The Secretary of State for the&apos; Colonies expressed someuneasiness at the point made under (2) above, namely,that the people of this country should avoid becomingtoo  friendly  with  coloured  American  troops.    Hethought that this involved some departure from theattitude hitherto adopted towards coloured Britishsubjects who came to this country, and that there wasa risk of creating an atmosphere which would giveoffence to the coloured people now in this country andlead to their becoming a focus of discontent when theyreturned to their homes in the Colonies.(8) The suggestion was made that it would be desirable to refer in future to &quot;American negroes&quot;  rather than to&quot; United States coloured troops.&quot;(9) It was generally agreed that the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s reviseof the Annex to the Secretary of State for War&apos;sMemorandum (W.P. (42) 460) corresponded very nearlyto the general view of the War Cabinet and should be,taken as the basis for further consideration of thisquestion.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for&apos; War, toprepare/ in the. light of the discussion, a revised
Memorandum which could be issued as a confidential,instruction to Army Officers of the rank of; say, Coloneland above as to the guidance in.ihis. matter which, mightbe given orally to the troops under their command.(6) These Ministers should also consider &quot;the draft of an article,for publication in A.B.C.A., giving information as tothe history of the Colour question in the United Statesand in the United States Army.-(e) The revised draft referred to under (ft) above should be circulated to the War Cabinet for their approval beforeissue.Armistice Day. 5.   The Home Secretary suggested that the arrangements for(Previous the celebration of Armistice Day should this year be similar to thoseEeferenee: adopted in 1941.W.M.

4th October. 1942-1-PROM THE FORMER NAVAL PERSON TO THE PRESIDENT.Most Secret and Personal.... . .No. 156*I have been furnished with a copy of the Progress report which the Combined Production and Resources Board have submittedto you in response to your letter of 19th August.     I have followed with interest the work of the Board since its inceptionin June, and I fully appreciate the importance to the success oftheir task of integrating the production programmes of the twocountries, of a statement of requirements directly related tostrategic needs.     I also realise the formidable difficultieswhich stand in the way of the preparation of such a statement for a date so far ahead as 1st April, 1944.     The progress towards the ideal at which the Board is aiming may well be slow.2.     In the meanwhile, it seems to me that there are certain features of our combined programmes which, if they are allowed to stand unmodified, must lead to a misdirection in 1943 of resourcesof materials and industrial capacity which we can ill afford.I think I can best illustrate my meaning by taking as examplesthe combined production programmes of Tanks and of BallAmmunition.3.     Our combined Tank Programme for 1943 allows for theproduction in the&quot;United States of some 31,000 Light Tanks and45,000 Medium and Heavy Tanks..     In the United Kingdom, theproduction will be 11,000 of all types.     The total amounts tosome 87,000 tanks, which I am advised would be sufficient to equip some 200 Armoured Divisions of 225 tanks each with 100 percent reserves.     This appears to me to be a provision on a scaleout of all proportion to anything that might be brought to bear onthe enemy in 1943.     It was, of course, necessary for us to fixhigh targets in the early days, so as to get production movingon a great scale.     Have we not now reached the time when wecould, with advantage, scrutinise our targets more closely?In our efforts to reach to too great a height, we may wellexhaust an undue quantity of our resources.4.        A further effect of setting the targets of the main items of equipment too high is that everything else is then calculated in proportion.     For example, the United States production in1943 of Ball ammunition will be about 20,000 million rounds of allcalibres.     That of the United Kingdom will be about 2,000million rounds.     Observing that the entire expenditure of Ballammunition by our army in the Middle East, from the beginning ofthe war to the present date, is little more than 200 millionrounds, and remembering that the total expenditure of the AmericanExpeditionary Force in the last war was around 1,000 millionrounds, it would appear that we are making provision on a scale which is altogether too lavish.5.     I bring these matters to your attention because of rayanxiety that, if   inflated demands are given full rein, weshall create for ourselves unnecessary difficulties in theprovision of raw materials and industrial capacity, and shall beunnecessarily curtailing our power to expand the production ofsuch vital requirements as escort vessels, ships, and aircraft,of which it is almost Impossible to have too many.6.     I am ready to co-operate in any way 3K5u ney think desirable ,in scrutinising our programmes, so as to rectify thoseanomalies which may exist, and so as to ensure that our combinedresources will be used to the best advantage.

ffWith respect to the Tank Programme, the figures in yourcablegram are cumulative for 1942 and for 1943.     They were established as production objectives to encourage maximumoutput.     However, realising the acute shortages of materials,we have reduced our objectives for the medium and heavy tanksfor 1943 to a total of 38,527 of which 4,500 are to be furnished to Russia and 23,108 are carried as the requirements of theUnites! Kingdom as fixed by the Joint Tank Committee which methere during the past summer.     If the requirements of theUnited Kingdom are now in excess of operational needs, it will permit a reduction in our tank programme.     Our own requirements have been reduced to approximately 11,000 medium tanks for1943, including maintenance and reserve.Our light tank programme requires the production ofapproximately 16,501 tanks during 1945, of which 6,250 arerequired for the United Kingdom and for Russia.Our production programme for small calibre ammunition for1943 includes calibres .22, .30, .45, and .50 and aggregatesapproximately 20o-3 billion rounds, including ball, tracer, APand incendiary.     Our own requirements for the ball type ofammunition aggregates approximately 9 billion rounds.     I agreewithyou that the expenditure of ball ammunition in the middle east to date indicates the desirability of a re-examination of requirements for this type of ammunition.     However, we are seriously deficient in all types of small calibre ammunition for the present.     We still have an insufficient amount ofsmall ammunition for our own training purposes.I agree with you that the necessity for the directionof our raw materials into end products which will contributemost directly to the successful prosecution of the war compelsa careful study of our combined requirements.     I believe thatthe most effective procedure to secure the careful examinationof these requirements is for periodic review by the CombinedMunitions Assignment Board and by the Combined Chiefs of Staff.I suggest that your representatives on these agencies presentthe question for both tank and small calibre ammunition with your revised requirements so that there may be a promptjoint review with such corrective action as this reviewindicates to be warranted.I believe the Combined Production and Resources Boardrather than questioning specific requirements items shouldanalyse the total U.S. and U.K. requirements which have been presented to them and then advise the Combined Chiefs of Staffif it is found that the realities of production make itnecessary to revise them.(Sd.)
