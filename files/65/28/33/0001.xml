Man-Power. After the preliminary review of the man-power position held.(Previous by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 26th November, the reference: Prime Minister had undertaken to draw up, in the light of theW.M. (42) 160th discussion, proposals for distributing between the three branchesConclusions.) of the Armed Forces the prospective deficiency in man-power during1943.The War Cabinet now had before them : W.P. (42) 556-a Note by the Prime Minister outliningcertain strategical considerations which should govern the revision of existing programmes, and. setting out his proposalsfor distributing the prospective deficiency in man-power.W.P. (42) 561 a Memorandum by the Minister of Labourand National Service commenting on the Prime Minister&apos;s Noteand suggesting an alternative distribution.W.P. (42) 559 a Memorandum by the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security commenting on the PrimeMinister&apos;s proposed reduction in the strength of the civil defence Services.Royal Navy and      The Prime Minister had proposed that the Admiralty require-Shipbuilding. &apos; ments, for the Navy and for shipbuilding, should be reduced by75,000.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that, while he could makeout a strong strategical case for his original demand, he recognised the difficulties of the man-power situation and was prepared to do his best to meet essential requirements with the reduced allocationsuggested by the Prime Minister. The requirements submitted forthe Navy provided for the manning of new construction butcontained no margin whatever for contingencies and these might be heavy, especially in the shape of further demands for combined operations. In these circumstances it would not be possible tomake any reduction on the numbers asked for for the Navy, and thewhole of the reduction of 75,000 would have to fall on theAdmiralty&apos;s demands for industry. It must, however,. be under-stood that - (a) this would involve some retardation of the whole of theAdmiralty programme with the exception of theexpansion directly related to anti-U-boat warfare; and(6) as no allowance was made for contingencies, the admiralty would not be able to undertake any fresh commitmentsnot at present foreseen unless further man-power wasmade available to them for the purpose.The Minister of Labour and National Service doubted whetherthe Admiralty would be able in practice to achieve the maximumexpansion assumed by the demand for an additional 186,000 for ship building. He thought that the figure for shipbuilding shouldnot be put higher than 150,000. ..The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that his figure of186,000 was related to the full period of eighteen months; and alsotook account of plans to transfer capacity employing about 54,000operatives which were now working for other Supply Departments.If allowance were made for these factors, the rate of expansionassumed in shipbuilding proper was no greater than that whichhad already been achieved in the past year.In discussion it was suggested that the scale of production of heavy shell for the Admiralty might be in excess of actualrequirements.Army and The Prime Minister had proposed, that the Army demandsMinistry of should be reduced by 380,000. The Minister of Labour and NationalSupply. Service had suggested a reduction of 290,000 .The Secretary of State for War said that under the PrimeMinister&apos;s proposal the total strength of the Army would, on the
most favourable view, be reduced by the end of 1943 by about 100,000(on the basis of present assumptions regarding normal wastage andbattle casualties). This assumed that labour could be released fromthe Ministry of Supply for the Army, to an even greater extent than was contemplated: in the Prime Minister&apos;s Note. On the basis ofthe cut.proposed by the Prime Minister there was in his view no prospect of forming and maintaining during 1943 the Armyorganisation set out in W.P; (42) 504.Under the less drastic proposal of the Minister of Labour theArmy would, on the same assumptions, remain at its present strengthduring 1943; and on that basis there was some chance of maintainingits effective fighting strength if off-setting advantages could, beobtained by cutting down the scale of precautions against invasion,and by reducing requirements for miscellaneous stores and equip-ment, on the lines indicated in paragraphs 3-6 of W.P. (42) 556.As regards the Ministry of Supply, the Prime Minister had. proposed a reduction of 215,000 i.e., instead of a proposedexpansion of 148,000, the labour force employed on the 1st July,1942, would be reduced by 67,000 by the end of 1943.The Minister of Supply said that he would try to achieve thereduction proposed, in consultation with the Secretary of State for&quot;War and the Minister of Labour, on three conditions : (a) that there was a corresponding cut in the War Officerequirements which he was expected to meet;(b) that the main bulk of the withdrawals would take place after June 1943. by which time he expected that thereduction in War Office demands for equipment wouldhave been fully planned; and(c) that local offices of the Ministry of Labour were notinstructed to decline to meet any demands for labour in factories working for the Ministry of Supply.These conditions were accepted by the War Cabinet.Royal Air Force The Secretary of State for Air said that he was willing to workand Ministry of on the basis of the cut proposed, in paragraph 9 of the PrimeAircraft Minister&apos;s Note, but it was only right that the War Cabinet shouldProduction.     be aware that serious consequences would flow from it.In the time available it was impossible to do more than guessat the effect of the man-power cut, but the following was an indication of the kind of measures which were under examina-tion : (i) Reduction of intake of personnel corres-ponding to the reduction in output of aircraft resulting from the proposed, cut of 75,000 in man-power for MAP. (esti-mated at 2,500 heavy bombers, or their equivalent)......      ...      ...      ...     30,000(ii) Further cut in establishments     ...      ...     30,000(iii) Reduction in Training Establishments  ...     20,000(iv) Reductions in Works Squadrons......       5,000(v) Reduction of 25 per cent, in the R.A.F.Regiment    ................     20,000     &apos;(vi) Cut in Balloon Command   .........     15,000(vii) Cut of 15 per cent, in Fighter Command ...     15,000(viii) Reduction of 34,000 in the target for theMiddle East Command. (This wouldmean stabilising the Middle East AirForce at about the present number of squadrons)......      ...      ...      ...     25,000(ix) Cut of 48 Squadrons in the target, for theR.A.F. in India   ...      ...      ...      ...     50,000(x) Reduction in West Africa :..      ...      ...       5,000The position would, of course, be altered if the Minister ofProduction had been able&quot; to secure a larger allocation of aircraft&apos;       . &quot;   &apos; : m ,       &apos;   b 2[24710]
from the United States. In this event, a larger reduction in theman-power assigned to M.A.P. could perhaps be effected.He pointed out that in view of the time involved in training,personnel entered in 1943 for aircrew duties would not be availablefor service in the squadrons until 1944, and that a smaller but none the less considerable lapse of time was involved in the trainingof skilled mechanics.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that, according tocalculations prepared by his Department, a reduction in the labour force of 75,000 would mean a loss of 2,500 heavy bombers, or their equivalent, in 1943/44. He did not feel that a calculation of thiskind could, in the circumstances, he relied upon very exactly. he hoped that it would be possible to bring about a sufficient improve-ment in the economical use of labour in the aircraft industry, sothat a cut of 75,000 would not present very serious difficulties. Hewould, however, be apprehensive if a cut of 153,000 was made, asproposed, in the Note by the Minister of Labour and NationalService.Discussion ensued as to the rate at which the aircraft industry could absorb and effectively use labour.The Minister of Aircraft Production thought that, havingregard to past experience and also to the present size of the industry,the labour force could be increased at the rate of 30,000 a month.In further discussion, The Minister of Aircraft Productionsaid that he was prepared to work on the basis of a cut of 100,000,in lieu of the figure of 75,000 in the Prime Minister&apos;s Memorandum.Civil Defence. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security referredto the risks involved in a substantial cut of the whole-time personnelemployed on Civil Defence Services. While the German Air force was, no doubt, weaker than two years ago, and was heavily engagedin other operations, there seemed to be nothing to prevent them from sending over a force of, say, 100 bombers on any night, and against any target they chose to select. A reasonable degree of readiness of the Civil Defence Services throughout the country was therefore essential. In particular, incendiary attacks must be promptlytackled by a sufficient force if serious conflagrations were to be avoided.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave particulars of the reductions already effected on his own initiative.While he thought that some further reductions could be made inthe number of whole-time personnel in the Civil Defence services in certain areas, notably London and the industrial Midlands and north, he thought that such reductions could only be on a modest scale.The Prime Minister said that although clearly no -assurance could be given that the enemy would not retaliate upon us for theheavy air attacks which we had made on Germany and Italy,nevertheless it was necessary to make some reductions in our defensive services in order to increase our offensive strength.-Miscellaneous. The Minister of Labour and National Service referred to thevery large programme of aerodrome construction which was beingcarried out, and also to the large &quot; Bolero &quot; building programme.He asked whether, in the light of recent developments, somereductions could not be effected in these programmes.The War Cabinet were informed that the Principal Adminis-trative Officers Committee had asked that new target figures anddates should be fixed for the &quot; Bolero &quot; programme. These might enable some reductions to be, made in the building force employedon these programmes.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows :  (1) The Service and Supply Ministers were asked to consider further how they would meet the cuts proposed in theirstated requirements of man-power.
(2) For this purpose it should be assumed that the cuts would be as stated in paragraph 9 of the PrimeMinister^ Memorandum W.P. (42) 556, save that theMinister of Aircraft Production should assume a cut of100,000 in the requirements of the aircraft industry.(3) Statements showing what modifications in programmes would be necessary and what consequences would be involved should be forwarded to the Prime Ministerand Minister of Defence by the end of the week.(4) In preparing these statements the Secretary of State forWar and the Minister of .Supply, and likewise thethe Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Air-craft Production, should work in close consultation, inorder to ensure the best balance between the relatedService and Supply requirements.(5) The Minister of Home Security should submit a similar statement regarding the reductions proposed in the civil defence Services, after consultation with the lord president of the Council.(6) A further Meeting would be held at 5-50 p.m. on Tuesday,the 8th December, at which it was hoped to recorddecisions which would govern the allocation of man-power up to the 31st December, 1943, subject to reviewbefore the end of June, 1943.(7) The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to provide thePrime Minister with a return showing, for naval shellof 6-inch calibre and above, the rates of consumption and production in the first three years of war, the stocks held, and the production programme for 1943.The War Cabinet next considered a Memorandum by the lord president of the Council (W.P. 42) 541) regarding the contribution which might be made towards the man-power problem by reducingstaffs engaged in National Government service.It was suggested in the Memorandum that the only way in whichsubstantial staff reductions could be made quickly was throughcurtailment of some of the services rendered by Departments.This method could not be applied to the Service and supply departments; and in that group staff economy must be soughtmainly through pruning establishments and reorganising methodsof work. Ministers in charge of those Departments were invitedto initiate a thorough overhaul of staffing arrangements and to give their personal attention and support to an intensified drive for economy in the use of man-power.As regards the other Departments, it was suggested that asmall Cabinet Committee should be appointed to consider whatreduction in services could be accepted and what numbers of staffcould be released in consequence. The Committee should submit the results of their review to the War Cabinet; but, where noimportant political considerations were involved, they should beempowered to authorise the immediate suspension or curtailment of the services in anticipation of the War Cabinefs approval pftheir general scheme.In order to ensure that future recruitment was kept to the bare minimum it was recommended that (a) all Ministers should be reminded of the need for the moststringent economy in the use of man-power in administration;(b) every legislative or administrative proposal should infuture be accompanied by a statement showing what additional man-power, if any, would be required to operate it; and(c) at the end of each month any Department whose staff had increased during the month should be required to submitan explanation of the increase to the Treasury.
It was also recommended that periodical progress reports should be made to the Lord Presidents Committee on the increases and reductions in staff in the various branches of National Govern-mont service.The War Cabinet-(8) Approved the recommendations made in W.P. (42) 541.(9) Appointed a War Cabinet Committee consisting of theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (Chair-man), the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof the Department of Overseas Trade to carry out the review proposed in paragraph 4 of the Lord presidents memorandum.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,December 2, 1942.
