The question was raised whether any further action was called for on this matter at the present time.The Secretary of State for. Dominion Affairs said that a great^   T deal of public interest was being shown in the matter, more particu-W.M. (42) 145th jarjy in Canada.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet that no reply had yet been received to the protest which wehad lodged through the Protecting Power. Moreover, we must recognise that we might never receive one. Monitoring of theGerman wireless showed few recent references to the manacling ofprisoners; but the treatment of prisoners generally was mentionedfairly often. He had been informed that the British Red cross society wished to communicate with the International Red Cross inSwitzerland on the matter; but Field-Marshal Sir Philip Chetwode(Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British&apos;Red Cross)had agreed to make no such representation for the present.The Prime Minister thought that for the moment we shouldcontinue for the present our policy of playing for time, and shouldtake no further decision unless and until there-was a new develop-ment in the position. He thought that we were more likely to reach
a favourable outcome if we continued to take this line.for somewhile longer, and allowed the interest shown in the matter to diedown.The War Cabinet took note Of these statements.Middle East.Supply of books and Magazinesfor british forces.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 118thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (42) 468) outlining his proposalsfor improving the supply of books and periodicals for the troops inthe Middle East.Points raised in discussion were : (a) The Prime Minister suggested that, besides the proposalssummarised in the Memorandum, arrangements be madewith the proprietors of two English newspapers alreadyproduced in Egypt by which, in return for some financialassistance, they would increase the circulation of thesenewspapers and include a supplement containing infor-mation of particular interest to members of the british forces.The Minister of Information said that hithertoquestions affecting the local Press in Egypt had, by thedesire of the Foreign Office, been handled through HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo. If, however, it were now desired that his Department should interest itself in this matter, he would be glad to consider how effect could be given to a scheme on the lines suggested by thePrime Minister. Additional supplies of newsprintwould be necessary, probably from the United States;and some extra plant might also be required. TheTreasury would have to consider the financial implications-tions of the scheme.(b) The Secretary of State for War drew special attention tothe suggestion, mentioned in paragraph 5 of his memorandum, that, in order to save shipping anddistributive agencies, literature for all troops in theUnited Kingdom should be provided from british sources, while America should furnish literature for allEnglish-speaking troops in overseas theatres. on further consideration, he was inclined to the view thatthere were objections in principle to an arrangement bywhich all recreative literature for British troops in theMiddle East would be provided from American sources.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the arrangements and proposals summarised in paragraphs 2-4 of theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for War.(2) Agreed that the War Office should not at this stage pursuefurther the suggestion mentioned in paragraph 5 of that memorandum.(3) Invited the Minister of Information, after consultation,with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other ministers concerned, to submit proposals for securing a wider circulation among British Forces in the middle east of the two English newspapers already produced in Egypt.Great George Street, S.W-1,November 2, 1942.
