1.   The War Cabinet had before them the, following papers : (1) Survey by the Minister of Production of munitions production for the period January to June, 1942(W.P. (42) 393).(2) Progress Report for August, 1942, by the Minister of aircraft Production (D.C. (S.) (42) 80).(3) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air asking that steps should be taken to enable the approved aircraft programme to be carried out and arrears overtaken, andfor the development of additional capacity in theAircraft Industry to allow for the progressive intro-duction of new types without loss of overall output(DC. (S.) (42) 82).(4) Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air andthe Minister of Aircraft Production proposing that anew general purpose four-engined bomber should beintroduced as a replacement for the Wellington andWarwick (D.C. (S.) (42) 89).(5) Memorandum by the Minister of Production on the 1943Production Programme (W.P. (42) 424).The following were the main points made in discussion: (i) On the proposal to introduce a new four-engined bomberto replace the Wellington and Warwick, it was argued that it was highly desirable to introduce a type of aircraft which, in years to come, would be able, onaccount of its high speed and heavy armament, to penetrate the enemy &apos;s defences at night, and possibly by day, without incurring the prohibitive losses which theWellington and Warwick would almost certainly suffer.The loss in numbers caused by the change-over would be compensated by the greater weight of bombs dropped peraircraft lost.(ii) On the other hand, it was suggested that there was notthe same need for developing new&apos; types of bombers as there was in the case of fighters. The main desideratumin bombers, both to-day and as far ahead as the position could be foreseen, was for numbers. If a change were tobe made, there was much to be said for arranging for production on a wider scale of the Lancaster, a provedtype of great merit.(iii) The needs of the Admiralty for bomber aircraft having the range of the Wellington were stressed.(iv) As regards the A aircraft Programme generally the Ministerof Aircraft Production said that, in cases where hehad reported the existence of bottle-necks (whether in regard to machine tools or labour), he had receivedgenerous and prompt assistance. What troubled himmost was the delay in building up a sufficient overalllabour force to enable the heavy bomber programme tobe carried out according to schedule.(v) The Minister of Labour and National Service thought that,so far as labour was concerned, it would be better to concentrate attention on particular works while theprogramme was lagging, rather than to deal with thematter by global figures applicable to the aircraft programme as a whole. He thought that the Ministerof Production, the Minister of Aircraft Production andhe should have a short meeting each week to deal withthe position.(vi) The Minister of Production thought that at the presentmoment we were attempting to carry out production programmes which called for an amount of labour inexcess of the supply. It was therefore essential that each service Department should reconsider its scales of equipment, establishment and reserves.
(vii) Discussion followed on the methods which should beadopted for effecting the necessary pruning of. the-production programmes generally. Among the mattersmentioned were scrutiny of items of Army equipment,measures to ensure that the production of obsolescent *weapons was promptly stopped and certain pointsaffecting the glider programme.(viii) The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to a comprehensive Memorandum on Needs of the Navy(D.C. (S.) (42) 88), which had just been circulated. he asked that no final decision should be taken in regard tothe allocation of man-power and . capacity until theAdmiralty needs, as stated in this Paper, had beenconsidered.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : -On the aircraft programme.(I) The Minister of Production, in consultation with theLord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft Production, was invited to investigate the proposal in D.C. (S.) (42) 89, for theintroduction of a new four-engined bomber to replace theWellington and Warwick. These Ministers would, ofcourse, take into consideration the Admiralty need forWellingtons.The Ministers were authorised, if they thought fit,to extend their enquiry to cover other points in regardto the aircraft programme.(II) It was agreed that the fulfilment of the aircraft programme could best be facilitated by concentratingattention on specific shortages of labour rather than by attempting to satisfy large demands for labour couched in global figures; and the Minister of Aircraft Produc-tion was accordingly invited to furnish a short list ofsuch cases to the Minister of Production and theMinister of Labour.(III) The Minister of Production, in consultation with theMinister of Aircraft Production, was authorised to take all practicable measures to increase the output of aircraft, and particularly of Lancasters, in Canada and elsewhere overseas.On the production programme generally, thefollowing Conclusions were reached as to steps whichcould usefully be taken in advance of the generaldecisions covering the whole field, which would have tobe taken when the man-power survey had been consideredby the War Cabinet.(IV) Approval in principle was given to the recommendations in the Memorandum by the Minister of Production onthe 1943 Production Programme (W.P. (42) 424).(V) The Secretary of State for War was invited to report as *soon as possible, in respect of,, say, 30 principal items of Army equipment, what reductions could be made inthe scales of equipment and reserves, and hence whatscaling down of requirements would result.(VI) The Secretary of State for War was invited to report whether the production of obsolescent weapons, which under present arrangements was allowed to tail offgradually, could not be ended forthwith, so as.to allow of the immediate diversion of capacity to other andmore pressing needs.(VII) The Chiefs of Staff were asked to examine the present planned provision of gliders and to report whether any reduction could be made.
