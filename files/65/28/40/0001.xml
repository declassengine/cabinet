building programmes.(previous reference:W.M.(41)86thConclusions,Minute 9.)1. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda on this-subject by the Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P.:(42) 584) and the Minister of Production (W.P. (42) 592).The Minister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum pointed out that therecent decisions of the War Cabinet on man-power assumed thatthe labour force in the building industry would be reduced by225,000 by the end of 1943 (W.M. (42) 163rd Conclusions); and hesuggested that the existing programme of airfield construction-should be reviewed as a matter of urgency in the light of the cutrecently made in the programme of R.A.F. expansion.The Minister of Production^ Memorandum stated that the prospective shortage of building labour could not be met merely bycuts in the airfield programme. There would in the immediatefuture be a deficiency of 115,000 men for the existing building programmes for airfields, &quot; Bolero.&quot; and other approved works ofsuper-preference or &apos;&quot;&apos; A. &quot; priority. This position could only be metif programmes were immediately cut, or postponed, to the extentof 15 per cent, of the value of the works now in hand; and, if therate of starting new works on behalf of all Departments were alsoreduced to a total weekly amount of  1-5 million for a period of four months, this would involve an overall reduction of 30 per cent,in the labour demand. Each part of the programme should notsuffer a uniform cut, and he suggested that he should be authorisedto arrange for the examination of the Government building pro-gramme with a view to reductions which, over the whole field, would produce the overall reduction required.Air Fields. The Secretary of State for Air said that there were in thiscountry 510 airfields already in use, 106 under construction, 3 forwhich contracts had been let but on which work had not yet been started, and 51 projected. (These 51 were sub-divided as follows : 11 sites requisitioned but contracts not let.19 sites not yet requisitioned, though warning notices issued.3 sites -agreed with Departments concerned, but warningnotices not issued.18 under consideration.) .Of these 51 airfields, only 10 would now have to be constructedby civilian labour provided out of the labour force with which theMinister of Labour was concerned.   For 30 could now be abandoned (subject to continuance of theagreements made with the Departments, in case it shouldsubsequently become necessary to bring these sites into use).6 would be constructed by labour provided by the B.A.F.3 were in Northern Ireland.2 would be constructed by United States military labour.This offer would provide substantial relief. The details could,he suggested, be discussed with the Departments concerned.In discussion, it was suggested that, in present circumstances,it was unjustifiable to embark upon any of the airfields projectedbut not yet under construction. Available resources should be concentrated on completing the 106 airfields already under construction.In reply, the Secretary of State for Air said that some of the airfields projected were required for purposes more urgent and important than those which would be served by some of the airfieldsalready under construction. For example, three of the projects notyet started were for the construction of airfields with specially longrunways, designed to facilitate the landing of heavy bombersreturning from sorties under difficulties. The. provision of these new airfields would materially reduce the incidence of losses of heavy bombers. Other examples were quoted in which there werespecial grounds for proceeding with new projects, even at the costof delaying airfields already under construction.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, until theposition had been clarified (say, for the next two months), no new[24785]&apos; , .     b 2
projects for the construction of an airfield should be started (exceptin cases where the contract had already been let) unless theSecretary of State for Air was able to make out to the satisfaction of the Minister of Defence a special case for proceeding with a newproject of exceptional urgency or importance. Further, with a viewto meeting the prospective shortage of building labour, it would benecessary to concentrate on to a lesser number of airfields the workalready proceeding on the 106 airfields now under construction.The number of United States Divisions which, it was now expected, would reach this country by the Spring of 1943 was only about 50 per cent, of those in the original &quot; Bolero &quot; programme.But under existing instructions the War Office were obliged toassume that the full numbers would arrive later; and consequently,though work on the building programme could be postponed, it couldnot be cancelled. As regards living accommodation for UnitedStates troops, account had been taken of the accommodation vacatedby the additional Divisions sent overseas, and it was thought thatfor living accommodation the existing requirements were probably not excessive. It was still being assumed, however, that the wholeprogramme of storage and hospital accommodation would berequired.The Prime Minister said that it was not possible to reach final decisions at this moment as to the numbers of United States troopslikely to arrive in this country in 1943. Present indications pointed to arrivals in 1943 not exceeding, say, 65 per cent, of the totalsoriginally assumed. It would be reasonable, therefore, to give priority to the completion of 65 per cent, of the original &apos;&apos; Bolero &apos;&apos;Programme, while assuming that the whole programme would berequired later. In working out the problem it might be helpful ifstatements could be prepared showing the total number of troopsoriginally expected to arrive by, say,. the 1st April and the30th September, 1943, and the numbers now expected by those dates,and the new building of each kind required to accommodate these numbers. The statement might also show what buildings had beencompleted and were expected to be completed by these dates.A statement should also be prepared showing the cost, in termsof man-power, of proceeding with the &apos;&apos; Bolero&apos;&apos; building pro-gramme on the assumptions -(a) That the full numbers originally assumed would arriveduring 1942 and 1943; and(b) That only 65 per cent, of these numbers would arrive during1942 and 1943.Housing. The War Cabinet were informed that in certain parts of thecountry the shortage of living accommodation was becoming acute.The Minister of Health said that, in housing, first priority should be given to rendering habitable houses damaged by air attack.Apart from those which could be made habitable by first-aid repairs,there were considerable numbers more substantially damaged whichcould still be made habitable with a relatively small expenditure oflabour and materials. Work had been proceeding satisfactorily onthis group until the labour had been diverted for the purposes of the&quot; Bolero &quot;programme. There were now some 97,000 houses in this class awaiting repair.Second in priority was the need for new houses, particularly in rural areas. There were also some special cases where a limited number of small new houses were urgently needed in urban areas,e.g., for dock workers in Bootle.It was understood that the housing situation was even moredifficult in Scotland.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that withouta small number of new cottages for agricultural workers he would. find it difficult to carry through the expanded programme of foodproduction.   Land which had been newly brought into cultivationWar Office&quot; Bolero &quot;Programme.
in the remoter parts of the country could not be successfully workedunless more living accommodation were provided. Similarly,recruitment for the Women&apos;s Land Army had had to be suspended,largely because of difficulty in finding living accommodation for thewomen already recruited. It would be a very material advantage to agriculture if a total of 3,000 new cottages could be built in rural areas during 1943.. The view of the War Cabinet was that special efforts should bemade to provide the labour required for completing the repair ofthe 97,000 damaged houses to which the Minister of Health had referred, and for carrying through a small programme of new construction to meet essential needs, particularly in rural areas.In this connection reference was made to the extent to whichliving accommodation in rural areas was still taken up by personsevacuated from the towns.The view of the War Cabinet was that the return of evacuatedpersons should continue&apos; to be encouraged. Further, consideration should now be given to the possibility of arranging for commercialfirms to bring back to London and other large towns staffs which hadbeen evacuated into country districts.The conclusions of the War Cabinet were as follows : (1) The Minister of Production should arrange for animmediate review of all Departmental building pro-grammes, with a view to adjusting the requirements to* the reduced labour force which would be available if (as already decided) 225,000 men were withdrawn from thebuilding industry during 1943.(2) In making this review the Minister of Production shouldhave regard to the following principles : (a) Except in so far as new projects might beindividually authorised by the Minister ofDefence, airfield construction would for the timebeing be limited to the completion of the 106airfields already under construction.(&amp;) The &quot; Bolero &quot; programme (other than Air Ministryrequirements) would be treated on the basis thatpriority was to be given to the completion of65 per cent, of the original programme before theend of 1943. )(c) Available labour should be concentrated as far aspossible on the early completion of a proportionof the works in each programme.(d) If possible, means should be found of proceeding with the repair of the 97,000 damaged houses towhich the Minister of Health had referred andof carrying out a small programme of new con-struction of cottages, particularly in rural areas.(3) The Minister of Production should submit to the WarCabinet soon after Christmas proposals for a revisedbuilding programme on this basis.(4) The Minister of Home Security should arrange for the civil defence Committee to consider what further steps couldbe taken to promote the return of evacuated persons tothe towns from rural areas where there was a shortageof living accommodation. This enquiry should cover thereturn to London and other towns of staffs of businessfirms which had been evacuated to rural areas.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary(W.P. (42) 590) covering an exchange of Minutes between the PrimeMinister and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, dealing withcertain measures which General Alexander had in mind for a
compression of the forces under his command. It was proposed thatall units of the 8th Armoured Division and the 44th infantry division should be absorbed against deficiencies elsewhere, with theexception of the Divisional and Brigade Headquarters and the fourArmoured Regiments, which would be disbanded.After hearing an explanation of the position, the WarCabinet Took note, with approval, of the course proposed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,December 17, 1942.
