1. The Prime Minister said that all those present would wishto extend the most cordial welcome to that illustrious soldier andstatesman, Field-Marshal Smuts. He had been with Field-marshal smuts in all weathers and knew him to be one of the wisest ofcounsellors. His advice had been of the greatest assistance in acritical time at Cairo some months earlier., His presence would reinforce their counsels with a fresh source of wisdom, a wisdom,moreover, which had never lacked audacity. The Field-Marshal&apos;visit would also give the greatest satisfaction to the people of thiscountry.Field-Marshal Smuts thanked the Prime Minister warmly forhis words of welcome. He would have liked to have come to thiscountry earlier, but circumstances had prevented him from doing so.Since September 1939 he had taken the view that South Africaoccupied an unique position in the war, and that the Cape route wasa vital link in our communications. He had done his best to make sure that this post of vantage was firmly held. He had also been greatly influenced by the appeal to come to London which the PrimeMinister had made to him in Cairo. He was glad to be here at this moment, when, at the beginning of the fourth year of war, newsituations were developing the world over. By his presence. inLondon he would at least show the sympathy of South Africa, whosegoodwill and support to the end were beyond all doubt.Mr. Bruce said that, on behalf of the Commonwealth ofAustralia, it was a great pleasure to welcome Field-Marshal Smuts,whose presence at the War Cabinet would be greatly appreciated inAustralia. His contribution to the War Cabinet&apos;s discussions atthis critical point of the war would be most timely and valuable.The duration of the war might largely turn on the decisions to betaken in the next few months.The Jam Saheb of Nawanagar said that India would wish tojoin in giving a whole-hearted welcome to Field-Marshal Smuts.His presence at the War Cabinet would be warmly applauded inIndia, where he was greatly esteemed.Sir Ramasivami Mudaliar asked to be associated with whatthe Jam Saheb had said. He knew that the Field-Marshal hadkeenly followed the fortunes of India. The work of the EasternSupply Group had shown that South Africa was using all herresources to further the war effort. He would like to add that,notwithstanding her difficulties, India was determined to play herfull part in the war.The War Cabinet warmly endorsed the welcome extendedto Field-Marshal Smuts. &apos;Naval, Military        2.   The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theand Air past three days.Operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 138thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations. Bomber Command had carried out a successful attack on Kiel,Home Theatre,   dropping 535 tons of bombs.Malta. Malta  had  again  been  heavily  attacked.    These   attacksindicated the importance which the enemy attached to our attacks on their supplies to North Africa. Since Sunday last the-enemy had lost 60 aircraft destroyed, 26 probably destroyed and75 damaged. Our losses had been 10 fighters destroyed and damaged and a few damaged on the ground.[24509] b 2Field-marshal smuts.
Naval During the previous three days our merchant shipping lossesOperations. amounted to 79,000 tons, including belated reports and also theShipping Losses. Oronsay, which was now known to have been sunk.On the previous evening a heavily escorted enemy ship had beenintercepted and sunk by our forces east of the Cherbourg peninsulatogether with 2 torpedo boats and an E-boat.Details were given of certain arrangements in regard toconvoys in the South Atlantic.We had received no confirmation of the report, published in thePress, that the Americans had sunk one Japanese cruiser and onedestroyer in the area of the Solomon Islands on the night of thellth-12th October.Australian troops continued to push on from the OwenStanley gap.Home Waters.Pacific.MilitaryOperations.Pacific.Russia.Egypt.The situation could be considered as satisfactory, and noGerman progress had been made except towards Tuapse, where theyhad advanced a few miles. The anticipated German attack onLeningrad seemed to have been abandoned.Active patrolling had been carried out. At the request of thePrime Minister, Field-Marshal Smuts gave the War Cabinet his impression of the British Forces in the Western Desert.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.U.S.S.R.Exchange ofTechnicalInformation.Prisoners ofWar.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 140thConclusions,Minute .2.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 453) covering the text of an agreement concluded with the Soviet Government bywhich the two Governments would exchange technical information regarding warlike inventions. The Ministers concerned were askedto see that this agreement, was borne in mind in their Departments,both from the point of view of communicating our technical know-ledge to the Russians and of asking the Russians to communicateany technical information which might be of value to us.The Prime Minister said that this matter had been raised byM. Stalin on the occasion of his visit to Moscow. He (the PrimeMinister) had agreed to the request for an exchange of technical information, but had pointed out that there were certain types of equipment, e.g., equipment used in connection with the defence ofthis country against enemy aircraft, the disclosure of which to theenemy would be of great assistance to them. For this reason we did not allow these items of equipment to be used in aircraft whichflew over enemy-occupied territory. There must therefore be a saving clause in respect of items of this nature which could not be disclosed. This point had been at once appreciated and acceptedby the Soviet Government, and was covered by the second paragraphof the Agreement, which provided that, if either government considered that in the common interest there would be disadvantage in giving technical, information on a particular case, they shouldbe entitled to withhold the information, but should indicate thereasons which had led them to take this view.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the Agreement, and asked Ministers to make sure that its terms were.made known to the officers concernedin their Departments.4. The Prime Minister rehearsed the sequence of events inthis matter. He thought that the German action had its origin ina desire to hamper the action of our raiding forces which landed on enemy-occupied coasts and seized and took back German prisoners.The proper answer on the enemy&apos;s part was that they should themselves carry out raids on this country. In raids of this character there was, of course desperate fighting, and it was in thenature of things that rough actions were done in the heat of battle.
When the Germans had first announced their decision to tiethe hands of 1,370 British prisoners, it had been necessary to reach an immediate decision as to what action we should take. Thequestion had been brought up unexpectedly at the War Cabinet, andhe offered an apology to Mr. Bruce that he had not been present when the matter had been considered on that occasion.The decision to order the manacling of an equivalent numberof German prisoners had given rise to a sharp division of opinion.The present position was a delicate one. We had asked the protecting Power to lay a protest before the German government against their breach of the Geneva Convention by attempting to.use prisoners of war as hostages against whom reprisals could betaken. It was most undesirable that the matter should be thesubject of public discussion at this juncture. The House ofCommons on the previous day had assented to this view. If thematter could be kept quiet for a few days longer, a- new situation might well arise, in which some new step might be possible. he believed that the German threat that, if we tied up 1,370 german prisoners, they would tie up three times as many had been, from theenemy&apos;s point of view, a mistake. It was surely significant that,although three days had now elapsed, there had been no announce-ment that this threat had been carried out. Such a step presentedvery serious administrative difficulties, and he expected that theGerman Government were now being faced with remonstrancesfrom those who would have to carry it out.The Prime Minister therefore hoped that the matter could beleft as it stood for a day or so, no further decision being taken inthe meantime. If the German Government were to say that, if wewould take the initiative and would cancel the orders given fortying the hands of 1,370 prisoners, they would do likewise, he wouldbe ready to take this course. If, on the other hand, the GermanGovernment&apos; announced that they were proceeding with their intention of tying up three times as many prisoners as we had tiedup, the whole matter would have to be fully considered, in consul-tation with the representatives of the Dominions, before any furtherdecision was reached.Mr. Bruce st.id that he agreed that the matter should be leftas it was for the present. He thought that the commonwealth governments view was that, in the first instance, we might havetaken a stronger line about tying up prisoners on the field of battlein order to prevent them escaping. He ought, however, to make it&quot;clear that, if the German Government were now to announce thatthey had taken or were taking steps to tie up three times as manyprisoners as we had tied up, the Commonwealth Government would almost certainly take the view that it would be wrong for us to take any action which would mean that we were starting on a corn-petition of brutality with the enemy. He hoped, therefore, that hisGovernment would be fully consulted before any decision wasreached if this contingency arose.  This was agreed to.The War Cabinet-Took note of the above statements and agreed that nofurther decision was called for at the present juncture.Great George Street, S.W. 1,&quot; October 14, 1942.

ft fMOST SECRET - WO C TR OUT AT TOW. 4W.M.  (42).  141st- CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.14th October, 1942, 5.5 0 p.m.FIELD-MARSHAL SMUTS said that he had had severaltalks with General Alexander and the other Commanders .He had not, however, seen General Montgomery, who hadbeen up at the front, visiting every unit.The change in the Eighth Army since general alexander&apos;s appointment was almost unbelievable .   Theofficers and men were all in good heart and. looking forward keenly to the coming clash.Our tank position was very strong.    The trainingof the troops had been well  carried out.   He thought thatwe could, look    forward to    the results of the battle withsome confidence.   At the&quot;same time, when talking toGeneral Alexander he had sounded a note of warning.    Onthis occasion there was no chance of out-flanking theenemy-   As we were attacking on so narrow a front (only 0 miles) we would   almost  certainly have to fight our way through heavily defended positions.   He had thereforewarned. General Alexander that he must be prepared not tomeet with immediate success.He had strongly advised him,however, to keep on attacking the enemy and to fight his way through.   We might have to sustain heavy casualties in order to attain success.   But our losses were unlikely to be greater than the heavy losses which we had suffer ed.in recent retreats .   We might have to keep up the pressure of the attack for a week.     General Alexander had indicated, that this was also his view of the situation.The Field-Marshal,  continuing, said it was important that we should, bring the enemy to book in the area in whic]the ba.tt.le took place.    Tt would, not be to our advantage

if we had to carry on a battle against&apos; a retreating enemy.We were not very well found in transport, having sustainedheavy losses in the retreat.    General Alexander had said,that he was quite certain that he could, capture or destroy the enemy army where it. stood, but he was not sure ofcapturing the enemy armour.The Field-Marshal said that he had also advisedGeneral Alexander to use his Commandoes behind the enemylines for the purpose of rupturing his  communications.Confusion in the enemy bach areas -would, hove a most serious effect on his morale.General Alexander intended, to rely very much onstrong artillery preparation, and to blast his way throughthe enemy position with this arm.   He was stronglyprovided with artillery.   His tanks would, be in closereserve and. would be kept for-the final blow.   The plans for the battle had &quot;been most carefully worked out.Field-Marshal Smuts said, that he had also talkedto Air-Marshal Tedder, in whom he had great confidence;The Air-Marshal had said that although we were not verymuch superior to the enemy in the air, yet he was sure that our Air Force would perform its task most effectively in previous battles, although the Army had been in good form and well equipped, there had been inadequatepreparation, and no proper use had been made of thedifferent arms in combination.   On this occasion, air,artillery, tanks and. infantry would all work together.If we won the impending battle, it might well prove theturning-point in the war, and transform the militaryoutlook.    Success would, enable us to open the Mediterranearoute again, and to establish bases which would open a newfront.   Attacks on Sardinia and Sicily should be possible at an early date.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was greatly-indebted to Field-Marshal Smuts for his account ofthe situation, and. felt greatly heartened by what hehad heard.    Our Commanders knew that they would havethe full support of the Government, who were preparedto face heavy losses.Great George Street, S.W.I.
