An outward-bound convoy had been attacked in mid-Atlantic and more attacks on it were expected.An outward-bound convoy had arrived at North Russian portswithout loss.The First Sea Lord undertook to furnish the PrimeMinister with information regarding the amount of american shipping losses suffered during the north african operations.The War Cabinet were informed that, of the French shipping in North African ports, 210,000 tons had been earmarked for theuse of the French and 260,000 tons assigned to the AlliedCommahder-in-Chief. The apportionment of the latter figure wasbeing considered by the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board.Our naval forces had sunk 2 XT-boats, 3 enemy merchant ships,2 schooners and a small tanker in the Mediterranean. Two furtherships had arrived at Malta. . :6,000 enemy mines had been destroyed since the beginning ofthe war up to Christmas Eve.The First Lord of the Admiralty was invited to submit tothe Prime Minister a. draft message of congratulationfrom the War Cabinet to our minesweeping force.From further information received it now appeared that in thetwo naval actions against the Japanese in the Southern Pacific onthe 12th and 15th November last the Japanese had lost one battle-ship and three cruisers sunk. United States losses had been one8-inch and three 6-inch cruisers sunk and three 8-inch cruisersdisabled.There had been little activity in Tunisia. The main fightinghad been for a hill north-east of Mejez-el-Bab. This had been taken and retaken three times and was believed to be now in our possession.The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the militarysituation in,Tunisia.One of our armoured brigades had now occupied Sirte and our patrols were beyond the town.The news from: the Middle Don area continued to be good.Russian forces had advanced.between 50 and 75 miles during thelast ten days. The German thrust from the south to relieve their forces surrounded near Stalingrad had at one time made some progress, but the Russians had succeeded in driving the enemy backto their original positions. The beleaguered German troops werein a bad plight. The Russians had also had a success in theCaucasus, where they had driven the Germans back.The War Cabinet-took note of these statements.[24824]
Jibuti.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 171stConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that the negotiations withthe French authorities at Jibuti had broken down. Accordingly,Fighting French forces were now advancing on the town.Communications had passed with the State Department atWashington, who had felt some doubts as to the&apos; wisdom of thisdemonstration in force. It had been decided, however, that in allthe circumstances the right course was to proceed with action on thelines approved by the War Cabinet a week earlier.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of the action taken.   -Russia.Supplies andMilitaryAssistance.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 172ndConclusions,   -Minute 7.)3. The War Cabinet had some discussion about future convoyarrangements to North Russia, a record of which is contained inthe Secretary^ Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.,French North 4    The Prime Minister said that on the previous day he hadAfrica. discussed with General de Gaulle the situation in North Africa(Previous resulting from the assassination of Admiral Darlan.   De GaulleReference:        thought it of first importance to create a strong, united, nationalW.M. (42) 172nd French authority.   He was quite ready to work with general conclusions,      Giraud, but regarded him as qualified for a military rather thanMinute 2.)        a political role.  He was also willing to work with Nogues, but lessready to co-operate with Boisson, though in the last resort he could probably be persuaded to do so. He had suggested an early meeting.    with General Giraud.  The latter, while agreeing in principle, had replied that the moment was not opportune.President Roosevelt had suggested that de Gaulle should postpone his proposed visit to the United States until the situationin North Africa had clarified.The President had also suggested that, for the same reason, theappointment of a British Political Representative to general eisenhower&apos;s headquarters in North Africa should be postponed.The Prime Minister had telegraphed to the President urging thatthis appointment should not be further delayed.It was the general view of the War Cabinet that the politicalsituation in North Africa should not be allowed to drift. ThePrime Minister read out the terms of a telegram which he proposedto send to President Roosevelt, giving him an account of his conversations with de Gaulle, and adding that he strongly favoured an early meeting between de Gaulle and Giraud.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement and approved the terms-of the telegram which the Prime Minister proposed to send to president Roosevelt.China.Fxtra-territoriality,(previous reference:W.M. (42) 171stConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, inconformity with the Conclusion reached by the War Cabinet a weekago, the Chinese Government had been informed that, if they desired that the terms of the Lease of the Kowloon Leased territory should be reconsidered, this was a matter which; in His Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s opinion, should be discussed at the Peace Conference.Dr. Wellington Koo had now told Sir H. Seymour that he thoughtthat the Chinese Government would take the view that, unless weclearly indicated that we; intended to return the leased territory to china, they would not sign the proposed Treatty on Extra-territoriality oh the, 1st January, 1943. This would be veryawkward, since we should have abandoned our extra-territorial
The Minister ofState in theMiddle East.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 167thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Prime Minister said that this was the last occasion on which the Minister of State would attend a meeting of the WarCabinet before returning to Cairo. His colleagues would wish himto extend to Mr. Casey, on their behalf, their good wishes for his return journey and for his continued success in his work in theMiddle East.The Minister of State thanked the Prime Minister for thesegood wishes. His visit to this country had enabled him to holdprofitable discussions with Ministers on many problems whichconfronted him in the Middle East. He would be able to take backwith him a first-hand impression of the wider background against which the problems of the Middle East were viewed by the WarCabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,December 28, 1942.privileges and no Treaty would have been signed to put anything in their place. The Foreign Secretary said that, nevertheless, his advice was that we should stand on the answer which we had given,subject to making it clear that the reply which we had given coverednot merely the terms of the lease, but the lease itself. The leasedterritories and extra-territoriality were, of course, entirely separatematters.The Foreign Secretary added that, in the negotiations aboutthe Treaty on Extra-territoriality, we had conceded a number of points in deference to the American point of view. He thought,therefore, that we were entitled to ask that the United StatesGovernment should on this occasion urge the Chinese government not to press their point of view. He proposed to ask for the good offices Of the United States Government in this matter.The War Cabinet-Agreed with the views put forward by the foreign secretary, and invited him to arrange for communications to be sent on the lines proposed.

In the meantime the enemy was continuing to reinforce his forces in Tunisia, whichmight also be reinforced by the bulk of Rommel&apos;.s forces fromTripolitania,The Prime Minister also said that there were indications in General Eisenhower&apos;s telegram that matters were not running too smoothly between ourselves and the americans in North Africa.   Furthermore, units were beingsplit up, and the situation seemed not unlike that in the8th Army at the time when he had visited Egypt in the summereThe Prime Minister said that he proposed to take an opportunity in the course of the next few days of discussing the situation with some of his colleagues, and thereafter   he might find it necessary to address a communication on the subject to President Roosevelt.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1*
