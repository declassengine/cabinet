french north Africa.(previous reference.:W.M. (42) 153rdConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister referred to the personal message whichhe had sent to the President on the previous night, emphasising the deep currents stirred up in this country by the arrangement with admiral Darlan and urging that it could only be a temporary expedient. He had had a reply that morning from the President,who said that he, too, had encountered strong feelings about Darlan,and for this reason had issued a statement on the matter at his press conference.The Minister of Labour and National Service thought that itwould be of advantage if arrangements could be made to annul any legislation extending to French North Africa a law which had been passed by the Vichy Government, the effect of which had been to abolish the trades unions in French territory, as they had existed,and to recast them in a Fascist mould.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service totake this matter up in consultation with the foreign secretary.Future Strategy. 2. Some discussion took place on the size of the Anglo-The size of the American bomber&apos; force which it was proposed should be buiit upBomber Force, in the United Kingdom from the beginning of 1943. It was pointedout that the size of the force which could be built up in this country must be affected by the demands which such a force would make on shipping (including tanker tonnage), man-power and other resources.The War Cabinet were informed that this matter was being investigated by the Chiefs of Staff.The Secretary of State for Air was invited to submit to thePrime Minister a statement showing the intended build-upof the Anglo-American bomber force in this country fromthe beginning of 1943, quarter by quarter, and the resulting demands on shipping (including tanker tonnage),man-power and other resources.The Colonies. 3.   The War Cabinet had some discussion in connection with british Colonial *ne criticisms of British Colonial Policy now current in the UnitedPolicy. States.The Prime Minister thought that it might be a good plan thata full statement should be drawn up for publication on the develop-ment of the British Colonial Empire, vindicating our past and present policy, %d indicating the probable trends of future policy.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that an oppor-tunity might soon occur, as he understood that a motion on thissubject was to be put on the Paper in the House of Lords. Hewould like to make a full statement in answer to this motion.The War Cabinet expressed itself in favour of his proposal.Field-Marshal Smuts said that he had been informed that theproposal for constructing a north-south road through central africa, which had been authorised, had since been cancelled. The: United States authorities were building a road from Lagos toKhartum, through British Territory. He thought it was undesirable that we should lag behind the Americans in large projects of this character.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was asked toexamine this matter and to report on the position to theWar Cabinet.
House ofCommons.Plans for rebuilding.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Paper dealing withthe rebuilding of the House of Commons (W.P. (42) 523).After a short &apos; discussion, the War Cabinet agreed asfollows :- (1) A Resolution should be put down on the Order Paperaffirming the principle that plans should be prepared forthe reconstruction of the Chamber, preserving all its essential features.(2) When the Resolution had been passed, the House should beasked to assent to the appointment of a Select Committeeto consider the most appropriate way in which effect could be given to this Resolution, and to report upon such minor alterations as might be thought desirablewithout altering the appearance of the Chamber.(3) Thereafter, plans and drawings should be prepared.(4) The question of when work should be started was deferred for the present.The Prime Minister indicated that he would speak in supportof the Resolution when it came before the House.Disclosure of 5.   On the 9th July, 1942, the War Cabinet had decided thatConfidential permission should be withheld from Lord Londonderry to include inProceedings. his memoirs a number of passages, publication of which would beLord contrary to the generally accepted rules governing the disclosure of londonderry&apos;s   confidential information.Memoirs. The War Cabinet had now before them a Memorandum by the(Previous        Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (42) 527) proposing that Lord LondonderryReference:       should be informed that his book, as revised to meet the objectionsW.M. (42) 90th put forward by the War Cabinet in July, might be published.Conclusions, The question was raised whether authority to publish this bookMinute 4.) would be inconsistent with other cases in which persons who had occupied official positions had asked permission to publish theirmemoirs. It was explained that publication of Lord Londonderry&apos;sbook, as amended, would not conflict in any way with the generally accepted rules governing confidential communications betweenServants of the Crown. Although there were certain passageswhich might excite comment, these were not based on Statedocuments, and there, was no ground which would justify with-holding consent to publication of the book as revised.The War Cabinet-Instructed the Secretary to inform Lord Londonderry thathis book, as revised, met the objections put forward by theWar Cabinet, and could now be published.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,November 18, 1942.Field-Marshal Smuts also stressed the importance which he attached to the preparation of a scheme whereby British airmenserving in South Africa could be-demobilised in that country afterthe end of the war, and opportunities given to them to settle in theUnion.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for Air were asked to examine this project.

TO THE PRIME MINISTER FROM PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT-   URGENT&apos; PERSONAL IND SECRET&apos;I too have encountered the deep currents offastfeeling about Darlan.    I felt I should act/ so Ihave, just given out a statement at my press conference which I hope you will like and I trustit will be accepted at face value.    It follows in my number 214.No. 215\(Signed)Roosevelt.18. Ho 42.

Ithoroughly understand and approve the feeling in the UnitedStates and Great Britain and among all the other United nations that in view of the history of the past two years no permanentarrangement should be made with Admiral Darlan.    People inthe United Nations likewise would never understand the recognition of a reconstituting of the Vichy Government inFrance or in any French territory.     We are opposed to Frenchmenwho support Hitler and the Axis.No one in our Army has any authority to discuss thefuture Government of France and the French Empire.   The futureFrench Government will be established - not by any individualin Metropolitan France or overseas - but by thethemselves after they have been set free by thethe United Nations.     The present temporary arrangement in north and West Africa is only a temporary expedient, justifiedsolely by the stress of battle.French peoplevictory ofThe present temporary arrangement has accomplished twomilitary objectives.   The first was to save American andBritish lives on the one hand, and French lives on the otherhand.   The second was the vital factor of time.   The temporary arrangements has made it possible to avoid a 1mopping up&apos; period in Algiers and Morocco which might have taken a monfeh or two to consummate.   Such a period would have delayed the concentra-tion for the attack from the west on Tunis, and we hope on Tripoli!Every day of delay in the current operation would have enabled the Germans and Italians to build up a strong resistance to dig in and make a huge operation on our part essential before we could win.   Here again, many more lives will be saved underthe present speedy offensive, than if we had had to delay it for a month or more.     It will also be noted that French troops,under the command of General Giraucl, have already been in actionagainst the enemy in Tunisia, fighting by the side of american and British soldiers for the liberation of their country.Admiral Darlan1s proclamation assisted in making a 1 mopping up&apos;period unnecessary.   Temporary arrangements made with admiral darlan apply, without exception, to the current local situationonly.     i have requested the liberation of all persons in Northerr.Africa who had been imprisoned because they opposed the efforts of the Nazis to dominate the world, and I have asked for the abrogation of all laws and decrees inspired by Nazi governments or Nazi ideologists.   Reports indicate that the French of north africa are subordinating all political questions to the forma-tion of a common front against the common enemy.Received 0015 hrs. 18.11.42.(SIGNED) ROOSEVELT.
