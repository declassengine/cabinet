Prisoners of The War Cabinet had before them the following PapersWar. regarding the action of the German Government in putting in(Previous       chains British prisoners of war captured at Dieppe :--WM^NSY 137th W*.P. (42) 457. Note-by the Secretary covering copies of conclusions) telegrams to and from Dominion Governments, and the draftof a proposed public statement (which had since been issued).W.P. (42) 458. Memorandum by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs covering a copy of a letter from the High- Commissioner for Canada.Further telegrams indicating the views of DominionGovernments on this question.It was clear from the telegrams that the Governments of theDominions, while prepared reluctantly to support the action already taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, weredoubtful about the expediency of proceeding further in a course of reprisals against German prisoners in our hands. The War cabinet were informed that there was as yet no official indication that theGermans had implemented their threat to put in chains a furthernumber of British prisoners, three times as large as that manacledby us; and it was generally agreed that, until we had official information that this threat had been implemented, we should not take any further step or, indeed, give any public indication of the steps which we might take in such an event.The War Cabinet considered whether advantage should betaken of the suggestion, made in a personal letter from M. PiletGolaz to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne, that if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment considered it opportune for the Swiss Government to intervene with a view to preventing the development of a series of reprisals and counter-reprisals, they would be ready to place them-selves at our disposal. The War Cabinet took the view that there could be no question of encouraging the Swiss Government, asProtecting Power, to concern themselves with the action taken byBritish troops in the course of fighting at Dieppe and in Sark. Itwas important to&apos; preserve the position that the Protecting power was concerned only with the treatment of prisoners of war after they had been securely captured and were in the effective controlof the hostile Government. It would also be inexpedient to do anything which might imply that this issue was a &quot; dispute betweenbelligerents,&quot; within the meaning of the Geneva Convention, andas such a matter on which the Protecting Power might be invitedto arbitrate. All suggestions of arbitration or mediation in thismatter, whether by the Protecting Power or by the internation red Cross Committee, were based on a misconception of the positionand should be discouraged. There would, however, be advantage in asking.the Swiss Government, as Protecting Power, to registerwith the German Government our solemn protest against theirbreach of the Geneva Convention and to urge, them to desist from it, in which event the counter-measures which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had felt themselves forced to take would immediately be withdrawn.The War Cabinet considered whether it was desirable that anyfurther public statement should be made at this stage. It was feltthat Parliament would expect some statement to be made on thefollowing day; but, after discussion, it was agreed that this shouldbe limited to- \(a) a repetition of the distinction between the treatment ofprisoners in prison camps and action taken on the field of battle; and -(b) a statement of the protest which was being made throughthe Swiss Government. ,The War Cabinet- .      \ -(1) Approved the terms of the following statement, and invited the Prime Minister to make it in the House of commons on the following day : 
&apos;&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government have never counten-anced any general order for the tying up ofprisoners on the field of battle. Such a process,however, may be necessary fEom time to time understress of circumstances, and may indeed ber. in thebest interest of the safety of the prisonersthemselves. -The Geneva Convention upon the treatment ofprisoners of war does not attempt to regulate what happens in the actual fighting. It is confined solely to the treatment of prisoners who have beem securelycaptured and are in the responsible charge of thehostile Government. Both His MajestyV Govern-ment and the German Government are bound by thisConvention. The German Government, by throwinginto chains 1,370 British prisoners of war for whoseproper treatment they are responsible, have violatedArticle 2 of the aforesaid Convention. They are thus attempting to use prisoners of war as if theywere hostages upon whom reprisals can be taken foroccurrences on the field of battle with which thesaid prisoners can have had nothing to do. this action of the German Government affronts thesanctity of the Geneva Convention which HisMajesty&apos;s Government have always been anxious to observe punctiliously.His Majesty&apos;s Government have thereforeapproached the Protecting Power and invited that power to lay&apos; before the German Government oursolemn protest against this breach of the geneva convention, and to urge them to desist from it, inwhich case the counter-measures of a similarcharacter which His Majesty&apos;s Government feltthemselves forced to take in order to protect theirprisoners of war in&apos; enemy hands will immediately be withdrawn.Until we learn from the Protecting Power theresult of this protest I have no further statement tomake upon the subject and I should stronglydeprecate any discussion which might be prejudicial to the action of the Protecting Power and conse-quently to the interests of the prisoners of war ofboth belligerent countries. As soon as a reply is received, a further statement will be made to theHouse.&quot;(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to telegraph forthwith to the swiss Government in the sense indicated in (1) above.(3) Asked that copies of the statement in (1) should be tele-graphed forthwith to the Dominion Governments.(4) Asked the Secretary of State for War to report orally tothe War Cabinet on the action taken in this country to implement the decision that a number of german prisoners should be put in chains e.g., the numbersmanacled, and the hours during which the prisonersremained in ehains, &amp;c.(5) Asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies to representto the Bishop of Truro (who had put down a Motion for debate in the House, of Lords on Wednesday, the14th October) that public discussion on this matter atthe present juncture would be undesirable; and to ask him to withdraw the Motion.Great George Street^ S.W.1,October 13, 1942..,.
