Russia.Supplies andMilitaryAssistance.(Previous   /Reference:W.M. (42) 134thConclusions.)1.. The War Cabinet considered the terms of a further draft telegram to President Roosevelt on supplies and military assistanceto Russia.,: &quot; . ........ The terms of the draft telegram were amended in discussion,and the War Cabinet authorised its despatch.[This was later despatched as Prime Ministers personal telegram to the President No: 160, serial No. T. 1303/2.]Labour. 2.   The Minister of Labour and National Service referred to strike on a stoppage of work in a number of shipbuilding yards on the Tyne.Tyneside. This arose out of certain changes which were being made inaccordance with an agreement between the Confederation of Ship-building and Engineering Unions, on behalf of its constituentmembers, and the Tyne Shipbuilders&apos; Association.   Under thisagreement wages would be paid on.Friday up to midnight on theprevious Sunday, mstead of being paid up to the previous Tuesday,The Minister of Labour said that he was satisfied that thisstoppage represented an attempt on the part of the shop stewards, to undermine the Union Executives and get direct control of theOj.   : work-people.   He thought it important that his colleagues should realise the position and that-a firm stand should be made.Reference was made to the fact that the Lord Mayor ofNewcastle had proposed intervention.   This would be undesirable.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Minister of Labour&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to send an, immediate telegram to the Flag Officer at Tyneside,instructing him to represent to the Lord Mayor ofNewcastle the undesirability of his intervention in. this dispute.India. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the ministerial Secretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 440) on a Ministerial crisisCrisis in Sind. which had been precipitated by the action of the Prime Ministerof Sind, who had sent the Viceroy a letter declaring his disappoint-ment with the policy of Great Britain, which evidently &quot;had no desire to give up her imperialistic hold on India,&quot; and hadrenounced his O.B.E. and the title of Khan Bahadur, which he&quot;could not but regard as tokens of British imperialism.&quot; (this letter had subsequently been published.)The continuance in office of Allah Bakhsh, the present PrimeMinister of Sind, was agreed to be out of the question. It wouldnot, however, be altogether appropriate that Allah Bakhsh shouldbe dismissed by the Governor of Sind from the office of member ofhis Council of Ministers. The right course would be that AllahBakhsh should resign his office. Should he show any reluctance to.resign, his letter to the Viceroy might well be treated as constitutingrelinquishment of office.The Secretary of State for India undertook to convey these views to the Viceroy., Great George Street, S.
