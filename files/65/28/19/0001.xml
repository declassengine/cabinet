1. The War Cabinet were given the latest information asto the progress of operations in the Western Desert.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade(W.P. (42) 478) covering a draft Agreement for the creation ofa United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.This draft had been worked out by the United States Departmentsconcerned and communicated informally to the Soviet and ChineseGovernments, as well as to His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a:request for their views.The Ministers had endorsed the recommendation of an OfficialInter-departmental Committee which had examined the draft agreement, namely, that, after consultation with the Dominionsand India and with the Soviet Government, His Majesty sGovernment should inform the United States Government that,subject to certain minor points and to any observations which theSoviet Government might wish to make, they agreed with the broad lines of the scheme and were prepared to co-operate incarrying it into effect.The only definite modification to the draft Agreement whichit was proposed should be put forward by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, was the expansion of the Policy Committee of theRelief Administration to include representatives of three countriesin addition to the four great Powers (United States, Great Britain,U.S.S.R. and China) and that Canada, as one of these three countries, should be accorded full membership of the Committee.In discussion, some exception was taken to the statement, inparagraph 5 of the Joint Memorandum, that before a reply couldbe sent to the United States Government, consultation wasnecessary with the Soviet Government in view of the terms of theAnglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance. While it was agreed that such consultation was appropriate, it was proposed, and the WarCabinet agreed, that the words &quot; in virtue of the Anglo-soviet treaty of Alliance &quot; should be deleted from this paragraph.Subject to this point, the War Cabinet Agreed that action should proceed on the lines proposedby the Official Committee and summarised at &quot;X&quot; and&quot; Y&quot; above.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 480) covering draft instructions which it was proposed to send to His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Washington, on the subject of post-war Atlanticbases. It was explained in the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum that the Norwegian, Belgian and Netherland Governments were considering submitting to His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of the United States joint proposals for Anglo-American bases in their respective countries. Mr. Lie intendedto take this matter up with the United States Government in thecourse of a forthcoming visit to Washington. The Secretary of states considered that Lord Halifax should be instructed to supportMr. Lie&apos;s proposals on a political basis; the military aspects ofthe matter might await further examination.The discussion on this paper showed that, in the view of theWar Cabinet, paragraph 6 of the draft despatch (in which it wassuggested that we should tell the United States Government thatas a political proposition the proposals had our support) went too
far. We ought not to go further at this stage than to agree totake part in the examination of these proposals. &apos;The view was also expressed that before our representativesentered into any detailed examination of this suggestion, the WarCabinet should reach certain general conclusions as to? the broadlines on which we hoped to see international security re-establishedafter the war. -The War Cabinet accordingly postponed a decision on theForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum (W.P. (42) 480), and invited theForeign Secretary to submit a further Memorandum, for discussion by the War Cabinet, dealing with these wider issues.Malta.Evacuation of civilians.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 83rdConclusions,Minute. 7.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 495) together withan exchange of telegrams with the Governor, of Malta as towhether the previous Cabinet ruling against the evacuation of civilians from Malta should be relaxed.The War Cabinet-Decided that the present was not a suitable moment toraise this issue, and that the existing Cabinet rulingshould continue in force for the present.Great George Street, S.W. 1.November 3, 1942.
