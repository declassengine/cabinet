U.S.S.R.Empress HallCelebration ofthe SovietAnnual Day.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 145thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Home Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that theGovernments attitude towards this celebration of the Soviet AnnualDay had been discussed by the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the5th October (W.M. (42) 131st Conclusions, Minute 12). The foreign secretary had then said that he had declined an invitation to speakat the demonstration, and it had been agreed that no government support should be given to the meeting. The War Office and theAir Ministry, however, had already accepted invitations to sendcertain contingents to the demonstration; and, in view of the WarCabinets decision, officials of all the Departments concerned(including the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Information) had met to consider the position and decided to recommend that thesecontingents should not attend the demonstration. Those responsiblefor organising the demonstration were so informed.The Home Secretary said that he himself had thought at thisstage that, once the invitations had been accepted, withdrawal would be inexpedient; and he understood that the foreign secretary was now disposed to take the same view. He still thoughtthat, if the Service Departments could extricate themselves fromtheir present position without embarrassment, it would be prefer-able to adhere to the original arrangements, which had been publiclyadvertised and had led Allied Governments to accept similarinvitations.In discussion, it was pointed out that no promise had been madeto send contingents of fighting troops. The Air Ministry had undertaken to send a small detachment of A.T.C. cadets; the WarOffice had agreed to send a band of the Brigade of Guards; theAdmiralty had not yet sent any reply to the invitation.It was pointed out that similar difficulties should not arise infuture if Departments followed the new procedure approved by theLord Presidents Committee at their meeting on the 23rd October(L.P. (42) 64th Meeting, Minute 1*).The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the balance of advantage lay on the side ofadhering to the arrangements originally made. TheWar Office and the Air Ministry should therefore informthose responsible for organising the demonstration thatthe contingents which they had originally undertaken to send would be present. No arrangements should bemade, however, to send any additional contingents, andthe invitation sent to the Admiralty might continue tobe left unanswered.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make sure that AlliedGovernments, to whom similar invitations had been sent,were informed of the position.Production andMan-Power.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 132ndConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Prime Minister said that he had been giving pre-liminary consideration to a number of factors affecting Servicestrengths and the munitions programmes in the light of the strategical requirements in 1943. During the next week or so anumber of major issues in this field would become ripe for decision by the War Cabinet. When the needs of the Services and the munitions programmes had been assessed, it would be necessary to* It was agreed ui this meeting that requests for representatives of theServices to attend public demonstrations should not be granted unless theyfell within one of the following three categories : (a) civic functions, organised to celebrate some  occasion of civicimportance :(b) functions organised by charities from which the Services receivedirect or indirect benefit ; and(c) functions sponsored by Government Departments.Functions organised by, or in honour of, foreign Governments would fall within category (c); and it would be for the Foreign Office to recommendwhether Service representatives should attend at such functions.
consider how far they could all be met, in the light of the review ofour man-power resources which was now proceeding&quot;. If cuts hadto be made, it would be for the War Cabinet to decide where theymust fall.Although material was not yet available for final decisions onall these points, it was desirable that some of the major issuesshould be focussed before the Minister of Production left on his mission to the United States. He proposed, and the War cabinet agreed, that certain of these matters should be considered at ameeting to be held later in the week.Coal.PrimeMinister&apos;sAddress toConference of mine workers and Managers.3. The Prime Minister said that he had undertaken to speakat a meeting, to be held in the Central Hall, Westminster, on saturday, the 31st October, at 10-30 a.m., which was to be attended by representatives of miners and mine managers drawn from everypit in the country.The Prime Minister said that it would be a very great advantage if Field-Marshal Smuts were willing to accompany himto that meeting and make a short speech. The proceedings at themeeting would not be reported in the Press and he intended to speakmainly about the progress of the war, though he Avould, of course,make it clear that increased coal output was necessary if our military plans were to go forward without interruption.Field-Marshal Smuts said that he would be very pleased toattend the meeting.The Prime Minister said that, if other members of the WarCabinet were free to attend, he would be glad of their support onthis occasion.The War Cabinet took note of the arrangements made forthis meeting.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 27, 1942.
