Hess.(previous reference:W.M.(42)145thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The WarCabinet had before them a Note by theLordPrivySeal summarising the facts about Rudolf Hess (W.P.) (42) 502).The War Cabinet- .(1) Agreed that the Memorandum should not be published, butauthorised, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tocommunicate it to the Soviet Government..(2) Asked the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the memorandum to be supplemented by a further Note containing parti-circulars of Hess&apos;s medical condition, which should also becommunicated to the Soviet Government.. Parliament.GovernmentPledge aboutcontroversialLegislation.X&quot;2. The War Cabinet had before them an extract from theMinutes of the First Meeting of the Committee on the King&apos;speeches, held on the 29th October, in which it was recommendedthat the language to be used, about the Government Pledge as tocontroversial Legislation should be modified so as to permit of theintroduction of certain Bills dealing with Reconstruction Problems.It was suggested that the Prime Minister might use some suchwords as the following : &apos;&apos; While, as a first consideration, our deliberations must be concentrated upon those matters and measures which are vitallyconnected with the prosecution of the war, we have now reached a stage at which it may be necessary for Parliament to considerlegislation arising from or out of conditions created by the warand such other legislative measures as the Government may deem to be essential in the general national interest.&quot;The view generally expressed was that the last words of theproposed formula (&quot; .... and such other legislative measures as theGovernment may deem to be essential in the general national interest &quot;) went rather too far. The Government might take theview that certain matters were essential in .the national interest which would nevertheless give rise to controversy.The Prime Minister suggested that the following should besubstituted for the last words of the formula : &quot; .... on which there is a general measure of agreement.&quot;In discussion, it was explained that this formula would, not be interpreted as meaning that some small group or sectional interestcould hold up legislation to which they were opposed. It must be forthe Government to determine in each case whether a particular proposal commanded &quot;a general measure of agreement.&quot; Theessential point was that the Government must avoid proceeding with legislation to which a substantial body of opinion in one of the main political Parties was strongly opposed.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to deal with the matter in. the debate on the Address on the lines of the formula proposed bythe Committee on the King&apos;s Speeches, subject to amendment-   as at &quot; X.&quot; &apos;       &quot;     .The King&apos;speeches.(Previous  /reference:W.M.(42)143rdConclusions,&apos;.Minute 4;)&apos;. 3. The War Cabinet had before them drafts of the King&apos;speeches, in the form adopted by the Ministerial Committee set upby the War Cabinet on the 20th October (W.P. (42) 500).The War Cabinet went through the drafts and made a numberof amendments. These dealt with minor matters, or questions ofwording, with the exception of the three- following points, which arose on the draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament:  -(1) Education. .The President of the Bpard of Education explained the stage reached in his negotiations.[24594] B 2 &apos;
Satisfaction was expressed, with the progress made. Never-theless, it was felt that it would be better, and more in accord\   with normal practice, not to include any reference to legislation at the present stage. ,\ The President of the Board of Education undertook to lay before the War Cabinet, as soon as practicable, a Paper setting out the scheme proposed.(2) Scott and UthwaftReports.. -Here, too, it was felt that it would, be better not to include a reference to &quot; proposals for legislation,&quot; seeing that theGovernment had not yet reached the stage of settling the headsof a Bill to give effect to any of the recommendations in these-Reports. Some of the proposals in the Reports seemed likelyto give rise to controversy. But there would be no harm in astatement being made, in the course of the Debate on the address, that His Majesty&apos;s Government were pledged to put the machinery for central planning on a sound basis,(3) Beveridge Report on the Social Services.It was agreed that it would be preferable not to include any reference to this Report, which had not yet been received.(4) The Catering Trades,Discussion ensued as to the desirability of introducing legislation for the regulation of wages and conditions in the catering trades.The War Cabinet agreed in principle that the- introduc-tion of legislation to this end was desirable. It was also agreed that a statement could properly be made, in the courseof the Debate on the Address, that it was proposed to introduce legislation to deal with this matter. It was, however, decidedthat the balance of advantage lay in not referring to this Billin the King&apos;s Speech,The War Cabinet-(JL). Took note of the position, summarised above, as to future legislation on Education, the recommendations containedin the Scott and Uthwatt Reports, and the regulation ofwages and conditions in the Catering Trades :(2) Approved the drafts of the King&apos;s Speeches, subject tothe amendments made in the course of discussion, and tosuch further alterations as might be necessary inrelation to operations in the Western Desert in the nextfew days.(The drafts as amended are being circulated to theWar Cabinet at W,P. ,(42) 509.)Parliament. 4.   The Prime Minister said that at the Guildhall on Tuesday,Procedure as the 10th November, he. proposed to say very little about the progress to the Debate of the war. On Wednesday, the 11th November, he proposed toon the Address, make&apos;a speech dealing mainly with the progress of the war and explaining the purposes which had inspired the Governmentsaction in their plans during the last few months, leading up to therecent events in the Western Desert. He thought that it wouldbeof advantage that a considerable time, say three weeks of Parlia-mentary time, should be allowed for the Debate on the Address.&apos;. Tb&amp;\ War..$ahiwt--Took note of the Prime Ministers statement, and i-avifedthe Lord Privy Seal to arrange for a programme of Goy.er&amp;&apos;ment speakers during the Debate on the Address.    .
135W.M. 150 (42),98Malta. 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this matter hadWar Damage, been discussed with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and(Previous that he proposed that a statement should be made on the followingreference:lines: W.M.(42)129thConclusions,Minute 5.)&quot; In view of the unique position of the Colony and ofthe extraordinary sufferings which it has so gallantly under-gone, His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to seek the approvalof Parliament for a free gift of  10 million to the Govern-ment of Malta to be used for the purposes of restoration ofwar damage and the rebuilding of Malta after the war.. they propose that this sum should be paid in the first place toTrustees to be nominated, who will make the money availableto the Government of Malta as and when required. The gift,will be available for meeting liabilities under legislation which,with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Govern-ment of Malta are proposing to enact providing for schemes-of compensation for war damage of property on lines generallysimilar to those in this country, as well as^a^ny other expensesincidental to post-war rebuilding. If the actual expenditure under those heads falls short of the total voted, the balancewill be applied to other purposes beneficial to Malta after the-war.If, on the other hand, the total liability of the malta government for compensation and rebuilding, after allowing for contributions from property owners, exceeds the sum of 10 million, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared tomake available such further sums as may be required to meetliabilities which are found, in the circumstances as existingafter the war, to be beyond the capacity of the Governmentof Malta to meet from its own resources, having regard to allother calls upon these resources at that time.A Vote will be submitted to Parliament for this purpose as soon as possible.&quot;The War Cabinet-Approved the above statement, and agreed that itshould be made simultaneously by means of Questions andAnswers, in the House of Lords by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, and in the House of Commons by theChancellor of the Exchequer.Great George Street, S. W. 1,November 4, 1942.
