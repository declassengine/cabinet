The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of the past week. &apos;During the previous week Bomber Command had made threeattacks on Turin. Two had been successful but the third had failedowing to bad weather. 700 tons of bombs had been dropped and 442mines laid. Coastal Command had carried out the successfulprotection of two convoys and made 15 attacks on U-boats. fighter command had carried out harassing operations in Northern france in co-operation with United States forces.Enemy losses in the Home Theatre had been 13 aircraft destroyed, 2 probably destroyed and 12 damaged. Our losses hadbeen 11 fighters, 15 bombers, 4 army co-operation aircraft and5 Coastal Command aircraft destroyed.United States bombers had flown to Paris (where they had foundtheir target obscured), and on their return had bombed theirsecondary target the railway yards at Rouen. On this flight, partof which had been carried out beyond the range of the escortingfighters, they claimed to have shot down 19 enemy aircraft for theloss of 2.It was clear that this force had been engaged in very heavy-fighting, although the number of aircraft destroyed was thought to have been over-estimated. The Prime Minister emphasised thatthe task of the Air Ministry in this matter was to present a statementof the technical facts, so far as they could be ascertained.Aircraft based on Gibraltar and Algiers had carried out onepromising attack on a U-boat with 4 others possibly damaged.Enemy losses had been 37 aircraft destroyed, 6 probably destroyed and 14 damaged.   Our losses had been 22 destroyed and 4 damaged.Bad weather had limited the activity of the aircraft based on Malta to attacks on airfields in Sicily and the air supply lines toTunisia. 15 enemy air transports had been destroyed and17 damaged. The. total figures for the week in this area had been,enemy : 23 aircraft destroyed, 5 probably destroyed and 17 damagedto 5 of our own aircraft destroyed.In Cyrenaica air activity had increased towards the end of theweek. Enemy losses had been 21 aircraft destroyed, 5 probably destroyed and 22 damaged. Our losses had been 13 aircraft destroyed and 3 damaged. Naples had been bombed by night andby day.Including belated reports, shipping losses for the previous week amounted to 109,000 tons. Included in this figure was the linerCeramic which had 656 persons on board, including some 244-Government personnel stated to be from the Colonial Office and other government Departments.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in consulta-tion with the Minister of War Transport, to submit a shortreport giving details of the Colonial Service and other government personnel on board the Ceramic.During a sharp engagement in the Channel on the night of the-11th-12th December, a large enemy supply ship, heavily escorted,had been sunk, a second supply ship damaged and 2 trawlers sunk.5 of our destroyers had been damaged.Three ships with supplies for Field-Marshal Rommel&apos;s forces had been sunk by our air and surface forces.The Japanese had made attempts on the 3rd and 11th december to get reinforcements into Guadalcanal. Both attempts were believed to have failed, American Forces sinking two JapaneseDestroyers and damaging a number of others.Information was given about the positions now held by our forces in Tunisia where the bulk of the fighting had taken place atJedeida and Mejez-el-Bab. Some discussion took place regarding-the composition of reinforcements, for this area. &apos;&apos;[24762]  . . B 2Cyrenaica.naval operations.Shipping Losses.
iCyrenaiea.New Guinea.Bussia.- Field-Marshal Rommel&apos;s Forces were now in retreat from ElAgheila. No big battle had taken place, but there had been somefighting on the southern flank. The maintenance situationcontinued to improve. . i :.The War Cabinet were given the latest information regardingthe disposition of Australian and United States troops in new guinea. A further attempt by the Japanese to land reinforcementsnear Buna had failed. The Japanese might now seek to make a landing further north; but the position gave no cause for immediateanxiety.During the last week the efforts of the Russian armies had been directed towards resisting German counter-attacks. These effortshad been generally successful until the end of the week, whenGerman forces had apparently penetrated the Russian defencessouth-east of Stalingrad.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The IBlack-Out.Modification ofLightingRestrictions.(previous references:W.M. (41) 91stConclusions,Minute 9, andW.M. (41) 101stConclusions,Minute 10.)2. In discussion, it was suggested that, in view of our longimmunity from air attack, consideration should again be given to thepossibility of making some relaxation in the restrictions at presentin force on such matters as street lighting, lamps on vehicles, andtrain lighting. The effect of such proposals on fuel consumption would have to be borne in mind.The War Cabinet-Decided that the Committee under the Chairmanship of theSecretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, which had considered this question in September 1941, should bere-convened to carry out the proposed inquiry.Foreign Affairs.Switzerland.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 100thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Swiss Government were seriously disturbed at the extent to which R.A.F. bombers wereflying over Switzerland en route for Italy. On the 9th December asubstantial number of bombs had been dropped on Swiss territory.The Secretary of State for Air said that on this occasion the weather had been particularly bad, with the result that many of our bombers had flown far off their course.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Air to remind theCommander-in-Chief, Bomber Command, of the impor-tance of reducing to a minimum the occasions on whichbombers flew over Switzerland en route for Italy.France. 4.   The War Cabinet were given the latest information aboutFrench Fleet at the position of the French Fleet at Alexandria, a record of which,Alexandria. together with the conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s(Previous Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Reference:W.M.

The Foreign Secretary said that agreement had now beenreached with the Fighting French regarding the arrangements forthe civil administration of Madagascar.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.
Horth Africa.(Previous3tef erence:MVM. (42) 166thConclusions, .-Minute 3.).6. The question was raised whether there would be any demand for a further statement about Admiral Darlan&apos;s positionin French North Africa before Parliament adjourned for the christmas recess. -The Foreign Secretary said that, if any public statement hadto be made, he would take the line that there was nothing more to besaid at the moment: but that, if the Government had any further statement to make at a later stage, one could be issued even thoughthe House was not then in Session.The view of the War Cabinet was that this issue was not likelyto be pressed at this juncture. Some Members of the House ofCommons might seek to raise it on the Adjournment; but, as it hadbeen so recently discussed in Secret Session, these Members were unlikely to be given an opportunity to raise a further debate. Ifsuch a debate were opened, the right course would be to move theHouse into Secret Session, in order to avoid public discussion of the issues involved.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Prisoners of 7.   On the 10th December a statement had been issued by theWar. Foreign Office summarising the communique received from the(Previous Swiss Government calling on the British, Canadian and GermanReference:        Governments to unshackle all prisoners of war in their hands atW.M. (42) 165th 10 a.m. on the 15th December.   The statement added that his conclusions,      Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom welcomed this minute 5.)        initiative; and, as evidence of their desire to respond fully to thespirit in which the Swiss Governments approach was made, had given instructions for the German prisoners to be unshackled on the12th December.    A similar statement had been issued by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Canada.The Foreign Secretary drew attention to a telegram fromBerne (No. 4583 dated the 13th December) summarising the Germanreply to this approach by the Swiss Government. The Germans were taking the line that they would cancel their reprisals as soon as theylearnt, through the Swiss Government, that the British Governmenthad &quot; forbidden by a categorical and general order, and underpenalty, the tying of prisoners and the carrying of manacles for thispurpose.&quot; The reply added that this was a necessary basis for settling the matter on the lines of the switzerland^s suggestion.After a short discussion the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) A formal reply should now be sent to the Swiss Government,on the lines of the public statement issued on the- 10th December, stating that instructions had been givenfor German prisoners in our hands to be unshackled onthe 12th December.(2) We should not, pending further consideration, offer anycomment on the condition suggested by the Germanv   - Government.   [It was to be noted that the Germans hadnot withdrawn their previous offer to unshackle our menduring Christmas week.](3) Dominion Governments should be informed that a formalreply was being sent to the Swiss Government in theterms of the statements issued in London and Ottawa onthe 10th December. They should at,the same time be told that we were not at this stage offering any comment on the German reply and that they would be consulted on this point in due course.
german atrocities.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 165thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. Reference was made to newspaper reports regarding the?mass execution of Jews in Poland.The - Foreign Secretary said that, while there was no directconfirmation of these reports so far as concerned the methods used,there were indications that large-scale massacres of Jews were takingplace in Poland. It was known that Jews were being transferredto Poland from enemy-occupied countries; for example, Norway; andit might well be that these transfers were being made with a viewto wholesale extermination of Jews.The Foreign Secretary added that agreement had been reached on the terms of a joint declaration on this subject by His Majesty&apos;s.Government, and the Governments of the United States and theU.S.S.R. This declaration would commit the three governments to a policy of punishing those responsible for these outrages. It was hoped that the declaration would be published on the 17th December.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Palestine.Immigation dfJewish children from Bulgaria.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 64thConclusions,Minute .6.)9. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that a month,ago representations had been made to the High Commissioner forPalestine by the Jewish Agency Executive in Jerusalem, to permit the immigration into Palestine of Jews from Bulgaria under the immigration quota. This proposal had been refused, on security grounds. This decision had been in accordance with a decision reached in 1939, that we could not assist in any way the exodus ofnationals from a country with which we were at war.On the 4th December a deputation from the Jewish Agency inLondon had come to see him. They had said that there were indications of an intensification of the anti-Semitic regime in bulgaria, and had urged very strongly that an attempt should bemade to save the remnants of the Jewish community in that country from destruction. They had recognised the difficulties involved, but had asked that, at any rate, something should be done to save thechildren.The High Commissioner for Palestine agreed in principle to the admission into Palestine, during the first immigration quota of 1943,of a number of children from Bulgaria, with a proportion of adultsto look after them. It was suggested that 5,000 persons might beadmitted, of whom 4,500 would be children and 500 adults. The;exact numbers to be admitted must depend on local conditions.This was being investigated.The War Cabinet-Approved of the course of action proposed, and authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to take thenecessary steps to give effect to it.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W, 1,December 14, 1942.
