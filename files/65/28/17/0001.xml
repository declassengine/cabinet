(42) 146thConclusions,Minute 2.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them (a) A Note by the Minister of Production (W.P. (42) 486)setting forth the matters which he proposed to discussduring his forthcoming visit to Washington, and askingapproval for the line which he proposed to take on each.(b) A further Note by the Minister of Production (W.P. (42)494) amplifying certain of the points contained in theabove.The War Cabinet went through the Note paragraph by para-graph and agreed upon certain additions and amendments. In thediscussion, the following were the main points : (a) Proposal to Assemble Mustangs in the United Kingdom.It was explained that this proposal was limited to the assemblyor erection of Mustangs with Merlin 68 engines. The loss in our bomber production would only be 25 to 30 Albemarles a month. Theoriginal proposal, which had allowed for the eventual completemanufacture of Mustangs in the United Kingdom, would have caused the loss of 80 to 100 bombers a month, but this had been abandoned. The intention of the Minister of Production was to try and get an assignment of American heavy bombers to compensate for the loss of the Albemarles.(b) Switch of Stirling and other Capacity to the Manufacture ofLancasters.It was pointed out that this proposal, which was still underinvestigation, had not yet been approved. It would only be carriedout if compensation in the form of United States bombers ofsuitable type could be secured so that our bomb-dropping capacitywould be increased during 1943 on a steadily rising curve.(c) Escort Vessels and Merchant Shipping.It was observed that there were three problems involved : (i) To secure the maximum increases in merchant ship con-struction and in escort &quot;vessel construction, withoutdiminishing the output of merchant ships in the first half of 1943 for the benefit of escort vessels which would come in later.(ii) To secure the assignment to our use of an adequate shareof the merchant ship output in the United States,(iii) To try and arrange that our share should be transferred tothe British flag.The Prime Minister referred to his Memorandum of the21st July, 1942 (W.P. (42) 311), in which he had pointed to thenecessity of coming to a solemn compact, almost a treaty, with theUnited States about the share of their new building which we should get ih&apos;1943 and 1944.
The Minister of War Transport said that he was satisfied thatthe United States capacity would allow of 22 million tons ofmerchant shipping being constructed in 1943. We required as our share 2  million tons over and above anything already coming to us.Moreover, it would be necessary for this tonnage to be sustainedthroughout the year, i.e., the Americans should replace losses. Asfar as could be foreseen, such a share would enable us to approachvery near the total of 27 million tons for our imports in 1943. he recommonded that no special approach should be made on the tankerquestion in view of the extremely helpful attitude which theUnited States authorities had adopted throughout. We should, ofcourse, require assistance of theorder of magnitude of 1 million tonsin 1943.(d) A rmy Requirements.The War Cabinet were informed that considerable reductions would be proposed in the British Army requirements from America.Nevertheless, it would be necessary to resist the American tendency to overcome their bottlenecks by cutting down our demands.(e) Man-Power.It was pointed out that the deficit of 750,000 men and womenfor the forces and the munition industries, which was foreshadowed in the Ministers Note, was a tentative figure, but probably repre-sented the minimum. It might well be found that the deficit wouldbe as much as a million.The Prime Minister referred to the need for securing abuild-up of American forces in this country, about which he had telegraphed to the President on the 22nd September, 1942. he expressed the wish that the Minister of Production should take thisquestion up with the President during his visit to Washington.(f) Synthetic Rubber.The Lord President of the Council drew particular attentionto the necessity for increasing to the maximum the American outputof synthetic rubber in 1943 so as to avoid the exhaustion of our stocks of natural rubber.At the conclusion of the discussion, the War Cabinet decidedthat the alterations and amendments which had been approvedshould be incorporated in a revised edition of the Minister ofProduction^ Note (W.P. (42) 486), which should then constitute thegeneral guide for the Minister in his discussions.naval construction programme.(previous reference erence:&quot;W.M. (42) 128thConclusions,Minute 1.)Submarines.Corvettes.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (42) 479) on the construction of submarines. The number for which provision had been made in the1942 New Construction Programme (W.P. (42) 173) had been themaximum for which it had been expected that orders could beplaced during the year. But, owing to the rapid progress made,further orders must now be placed if continuity of production wasto be assured. The First Lord accordingly proposed that 8 U-class and 4 S-Class Submarines should be added to the 1942 programme.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (42) 484) proposing the con-struction of 83 twin-screw and 45 single-screw Corvettes beyond thenumbers already approved. The Admiralty proposals contemplated the adoption of pre-fabrication for Corvettes on a substantial scale and should result not only in a considerable expansion of output,but also in a reduction of the building time. As at present planned,this programme would not affect any merchant shipbuilding slips.But it would affect engineering works at its inception, and this might react on the construction of merchant ship engines until these
works could be expanded to cope with both requirements. It was expected that this would result in a loss of up to 100,000 tons ofmerchant shipbuilding during the expansion period.The Minister of War Transport said that he was reluctant toagree to any reduction in our merchant shipbuilding programme,but he realised the very strong case for an increase in the productionof escort vessels. He hoped that the present proposal would not result in bringing our annual output of merchant ships below,100,000 tons.In reply to a question by the Secretary of State for Air, thePrime Minister said that all the production programmes, in common with service requirements, would be subject to review in the light ofthe results of the man-power survey now being undertaken.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals set out in this Memorandum.Merchant Ship The War Cabinet also had before them a Joint Memorandum by aircraft- the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of War Transportcarriers. (W.P. (42) 485) on merchant ship aircraft-carriers.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet *(a) Agreed that the United States should be urged to undertakeat once the construction of 30 merchant ship aircraft-carriers, to be completed during the first half of 1943.(b) Asked that the question whether these ships should sailunder the White Ensign or the Red Ensign should befurther examined by the Foreign Office, the admiralty and the Ministry of War Transport, and a report madeto the War Cabinet.U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 145thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The War Cabinet had before them draft instructions toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow and a draft Memorandum(copies of which had been circulated by the Foreign Office to WarCabinet Ministers).The Foreign Secretary explained that he thought it was desirable to make clear our attitude to recent articles in the RussianPress about Hess, before M. Stalin made his ;speech on the7th November. fVarious amendments to the drafts were suggested in discussion.The War Cabinet- IAuthorised the Foreign Secretary to despatch the drafts,subject to such amendments as were called for in the lightof the discussion.Great George Street, S. W. 1,October 29, 1942.
