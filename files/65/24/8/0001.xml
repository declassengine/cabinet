Stalin&apos;s mind, and dealt with thepoints to be covered on the political sidefAttached was a draft Memorandvim for communication to the Soviet Government, in order that M. Stalinmight know beforehand the matters to be discussed.As the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Paper had only been in the hands of Ministers for a short time,the discussion was of a preliminary nature.       Themain points touched on were as follows(l)    The general view expressed was that?while it was, of course, necessary thatthe Foreign Secretary should receive clearauthority from the War Cabinet as to thegeneral lines which he should pursue in discussions with Mo   Stalin, on the whole the balance of advantage was againstarranging for a political Memorandum to becommunicated to the Soviet Government inadvance of the visit,(2)   The second suspicion which the foreign secretary thought we must exercise fromM. Stalin&apos;s mind was &quot;....o That we shouldbe prepared to make peace with a Germanycontrolled by the Army, if they were tooverthrow the Party.&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had madea public statement that we would notnegotiate with Hitler or with the nazi regime;   but he thought it would be goingtoo far to say that we should not negotiate with a Germany controlled by the Army.    Itwas impossible to forecast what form ofGovernment there might be in Germany at atime when their resistance weakened andthey wished to negotiate*
