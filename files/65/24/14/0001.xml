(41)22ndConclusionsMinute 5.)The War Cabinet had before them telegrams nos. 22*and 24*HECTIC from the Foreign Secretary, at moscow, to the Foreign Office-.The main point in these telegrams was M.Stalin&apos;request that the Foreign Secretary should agree to a. formula which involved recognition of the Russian 1941frontiers in Finland, the Baltic States and Roumania.The Foreign Secretary had offered to discuss theproblem with his colleagues and the United StatesGovernment on his return to London, but this had not satisfied the Russians, who had indicated that unless &apos;we recognised these frontiers they would not signany agreement.      The Foreign Secretary wished toreceive, as a matter of urgency, the views of the WarCabinet and,  if possible, of the Prime Minister.In discussion, all members of the War cabinet agreed that we could not sign an agreement on thelines proposed by the U.S.S.R.     At the time of the atlantic Qharter we had given an assurance to theUnited States that we had made no secret commitments which tied our hands in regard to the post-warterritorial settlement.    . Even apart from this,  itwas clear that if we entered into commitments with oneof our Allies in regard to territorial boundaries, weshould inevitably be forced to enter into similarcommitments in other cases.      So far we had enteredinto no such commitment, although we had told the.Yugo-Slav Government, shortly before the war spread to the Balkans,  that we should be prepared to reconsider her Istrian frontier.The War Cabinet agreed as follows:-(l) A telegram should be sent to the foreign secretary on the lines of &quot;X,f. T(2)(3)The telegram referred to under ( l)  shouldbe repeated to the Prime Minister, andthe Foreign Secretary should beinformed that this action was beingtaken.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs was authorised to communicate to the Dominion prime Ministers, in confidence, the gist of the following telegrams from the Foreign Secretary^-HECTIC 13^ 14,f 22 and 24somitting reference to the proposed offer(which it was not now proposed should bemade) to send ten squadrons to fight onthe Russian front.reat George Street, S.W. 1.

He would agree that the Polishfrontier might be left an open question but he wanted our immediate endorsement of his territorial claims in FinlandBaltic States and Roumania.In vain I argued that I had not come for this, that I had hadno warning that this.was what he wanted and that in any case Iwas not in a position to give him satisfaction.     He hintedmore than once that if he was not satisfied it might be better to have no agreement.     I told him that this was for him todecide.     The furthest he got was to admit that I could not personally give him what he wanted and that we should have aurther discussion this evening.I have seen Maiski again during the course of to-day butregret that I cannot at this [grp. undec. ? moment] report anysubstantial progress.I propose to try to convince Stalin of the value of theagreements in general terms between His Majesty&apos;s Government and soviet Government corresponding to the Atlantic Charter, and to persuade him that there can be no settlement of his more concretequestions here and now.Please repeat to [grp,, undec. ?

M, Stalin agreed.I again explained that I was not in a position to bindHis Majesty&apos;s Government to any particular post-warfrontiers and that they were asking the impossible of me.I offered to discuss this problem with my colleagues and united States Government on my return to London, but this did not satisfy them. Molotov was particularly unhelpful.Their present attitude is that unless they get ourrecognition of 1941 frontiers in Finland, Baltic States and roumania they will not sign any agreement.   This, of course,is deplorable but I do not see how His Majesty&apos;s government can here and now by treaty, agree to the post-war Sovietfrontiers without American agreement.I should be glad of immediate views of War cabinet and-if possible of the Prime Minister to whom pleaserepeat this telegram.   My present intention is to leaveSaturday evening.Please inform His Majesty^ Ambassador, Washington.[Repeated to Washington under Foreign office no. 7067   and advance copy sent to f.C.0,](individual)

On the other hand, a secretengagement Is, as you have already told Stalin, out of theque stion.3.   Moreover, as you will remember, Sir A. Cadogan assuredMr. Sumner Welles at the Atlantic Meeting that His majesty&apos;s government had undertaken no secret commitments which would tietheir hands in the post-war settlements   This in itself makes itimpossible for you to agree to Stalin&apos;s demands without consulting the United States Government.2^   Further we presume that the draft treaty you have been discussing would endorse the Atlantic Gharter, but Stalin&apos;present demand might well be held by the United States Governmentto infringe the 2nd and 3rd clauses of the Charter, or at anyrate to constitute a doubtful interpretation which they would not accept.   In this connexion it must be borne in mind that in recentcorrespondence with the representatives of the Baltic States bythe United States Government, who have publicly refused torecognise the annexation of these States, have clearly implied that they consider that the Atlantic Charter applies to their case.5*   A refusal on our part to pledge ourselves at this stageas regards these Russian territorial claims does not, of course,mean that we are necessarily opposed to the Soviet Union re-annexing the Baltic States and Bessarabia and re-establishing the19^0 frontier with Finland at the Peace, but we do not see thatat the present stage you can go further than you have already done in offering to discuss this problem with your colleagues andthe United States Government on your return to London,,(individual)

Sargent.-PERSONAL.Please repeat..to Prime ivilnister.1..    I had&apos;my first conversation with k. Stalin this    &quot;.&quot;evening.     It lasted four hours. . &apos; it began with a full survey of the political situation., when Kv- Stalin &quot;handed: me. draft.&apos; vprojects of two&apos;treaties, one to cover mutual military;  ;&apos;assistance irrespective of war and other political collaborationnow and after the war.   - The&apos; terms do not greatly differ fromthose I had myself foreshadowed as the basis of,an&apos; agreement in my Cabinet paper.     I gave M. Stalin-draft which 1 had prepared to-day on this basis and a-, further meeting, will take .place to-morrow to evolve an agreed text.    This,should not present any insuperable difficulty.     - ;, ....-   2.    &amp;. Stalin then suggested we should., also sign a1 secret,protocol which would embody our joint views xoir. a settlementof &quot;oost-war frontiers........... He cutlined in detail his conception&quot;&quot;&apos;of such a settlement for Europe as :a whole which was drasticand severe upon Germany.     I told him.that while there was muchin his proposal with which I personally agreed, it was impossiblfor me tp enter into a secret agreement.   . For. this there&apos;were several reasons.     Moreover I was pledged to United-States    .Government not to do so,&quot;:   Our own discussion of-.a peace&quot;settlement had not-advanced to/this point and I should have; to-..-;consult my colleagues on his detailed proposals.     I said thatI would take back a,full account to London where his proposals would be studied and we could then.take-matters up through diplomatic channels..    -I. Stalin agreed&apos;-to this and also to myicommunicating his proposals, to United States Government.   -He&quot;would be glad if United States Government would.join in agreeing to his proposals but if not, he hoped.that cur two Governments ...could agree on our essential war aims.     He emphasised thathis desire was to establish that our war aims were identical asthen our alliance would be stronger.     If our war aims were,different then there&apos; was no true alliance.
3.    We then discussed the war situation.-    M, Stalintold me that his military observers believed G^fflany^^ha^given Japan about,1.500aircraft.     He was not absolutelyoeptalii of &apos;%l^s&apos;^MnyW&apos;W^&apos;&apos;y^^ good, reasons for believing it.He also thought that. German pilots were already .in the far east.     I urged the difficulties of transit but M. Stalin wasnot much shaken.    He said that -Russians had had experienceof fighting with Japanese and had observers in China,,     He had^ come to believe that this was not a Japanese war in the Par\East.     He thought that some of the Japanese pilots had been trained in Germany and that others were Germans.4,      I gave M. Stalin some accounts of oxar military objectives in Africa and he fully endorsed these,,     He saidthat hitherto the war policy of the Union of Soviet socialist republics had been to fight rearguard actions.    Every placehad been defended in order gradually to wear down the - German   &apos;forces.    Now the moment had arrived when those forces.were,beginning to feel the tension.     German soldiers were tired,,German Commanders had hoped to finish the fight in Russiabefore the winter.    They had not prepared for a winter-campaign.     In December the German army was found badly cladand at this time new Soviet army formations had reached thefront.    These reinforcements had made possible the change whichwe had seen in the last two weeks.     The Germans had tried todig in but they had not made very strong fortifications.     The&apos;Soviet troops had been able [grp. undec, ] own and now they were able to attack.     Counter attacks were being gradually developedinto counter offensives,     &quot;We shall carry on like this&quot; said &apos;M. Stalin &quot;all the winter&quot;.    When the new German formations-- ,would come to the front he did hot know..    He was aware that.;the Germans were reorganising theirJforces, and creating newformations.    He did not think these would be ready before twomonths, therefore he had two months in hand;   in any case Ms&quot;army would continue to keep up the offensive all the winter.It was difficult to say how far they would be able to advance.M. Stalin reckoned that Russia had now a slight superiorityjin the air but emphasised that the Germans had a great/superiority in tanks.     Tanks were still very necessary ./ especially Valentines^.which were better for winter work thanMat i ldsHTw-Xii replyto a question he said the position in the.So^ttTWas satisfactory and the arrival of fresh Russianreinforcements had resulted in the recent successes.    Hethought that our Libyan offensive was developing well and thatthe German army was after all not so strong despite its enormousreputation. see my immediately following telegram.7 ,        ; INDIty.

Stalin seemed to be reasonably satisfied with the position at present in thesecountries.     In respect of Persia he said that we had obtainedour objective at a very low cost in life.(:6)   I told Stalin that I bad hoped to be able to proposeto him that when operations in Libya were concluded we should send10 squadrons, to work with him in any operations he might havesubsequently in southern Russia.     Now the situation had been completely changed by the events in Far East and squadrons were.I feareds not now available.     Stalin replied that he. fully understood that the situation had&quot;changed.     Russians had also had their difficult period.     We spoke of Far East.     Stalin said he was sorry that in the present conditions he was not now in aposition to help us there,     In the spring he would be.our Militarythev should come(7)   I explained to Stalin the troubles of mission.     He admitted these and suggested thatto Moscow where contact could more easily be kept with RussianCommanders. &apos;  I. at once accepted this suggestion.(8)   As regards, the question of rocket bomb (see yourtelegram No.2 to-Moscow) Stalin stated that this had not turned out to be very useful against tanks though it was useful againsttroops and that Russians had found that aeroplanes fitted with,cannon bettor as against tanks than those fitted with rocket bombs,(9)   Towards the end of the interview, Stalin informed methat he had had a message from President Roosevelt asking him tobe represented at a Conference at Chungking tomorrow at whichthe Soviet was to be an observer and asked me whether I kne;anything about object of this Conference.     I told him of the contents of telegram No.57 Haughty which I had received thismorning and said that I imagined Conference was concerned withthe Japanese.war to which he replied the Soviet Government wereprepared to.attend any number of Conferences if it would be helpful, but obviously they could not do anything about theConference ....
