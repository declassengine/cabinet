These proposals, whichwere unacceptable in their present form, includedwithdrawal by the Japanese of their forces from Southernto Northern Indo-China.    In return for this concessionthey proposed that we should call off the embargoagainst Japan and should cease to help China.Mr Hull had informed us of his appreciation of .the position. While he would reject out of hand theproposal to stop, sending help to China, he was disposed to favour a partial Japanese withdrawal fromin return for a partial lifting of ourIndo-Chinablockade.The Foreign Secretary said that he doubted whethera     partial withdrawal from Southern Indo-China wouldhave any real meaning.    In general, he thought that our attitude should be that, the Japanese were putting forward the maximum de: rands upon the A.B.C.D. Powers, and proposing the minj.rm.im concessions to them, and that weshould, now put forward our counter reply, which shouldcomprise   our maximum demands, with minimum concessions.The Foreign Secretary then read out the terms of thedraft reply which he had prepared broadly on the abovebasis.This reply met with general approval.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we could rely upon theUnited. States not. to abandon the cause of China.   Hethought, that any measures of relaxation of our blockadeshould be done on the basis of giving the Japaneseenough to live on from hand to mouth.    If we could maintain the present position in the Far East for another three months, it would be greatly to our advantage.SIR EARLE PAGE, while agreeing with the draft reply proposed by the Foreign Secretary, said that hethought that the tevms proposed in it. should be -regardedas the kind of terms on which we should be disposed to*res.ch agreement, rather than a counter offer wfeLeh weshould be ready to abate in negotiation.

The War Cabinet:-(l) Approved the draft reply, and invited the Foreign Secretary to despatch itand to conanuni cat e a .copy to theNetherlands Government:(2) Invited the Dominions Secretary to sendcopies of the reply to the DominionGovernments .Thailand. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he was worried about the position in Thailand,tevious The Thai Prime Minister was clearly in a somewhatleference:      over-wrought state.   He had.sent a telegram to Washington,[.M.(41) 112th but the attitude of the United States over Thailand hadion elusions, not been very helpful.   He thought that unless we couldInute 1.)     make some further offer of help, there was a considerable-risk that the Thai Prime Minister might give way to japanese pressure.In discussion, particular importance was attachedto the despatch of even a small number of aircraft toThailand, which would have a very considerable psycholog-ical effect.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Chiefs of Staff to examine,as a matter of ursenev,  the possibilityof offering assistance to Thailand,particularly in the form of aircraft,,
