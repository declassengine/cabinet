The main lines of the proposals hadbeen that the Japanese should evacuate the southern half of Indo-China, retaining the right to keep25,000 troops,  in the Northern part of the country.In return, there should be some relaxation of theeconomic pressure on Japan,    We had felt doubts about this scheme, which had been communicated tothe United States Government    The Dutch had feltdoubts too, and the Chinese had reacted strongly against the proposals, which had been abandoned bythe United States Government,    In the end, theUnited States Government had submitted to theJapanese a Note setting out the broad lines on whichthey would wish to see a wider settlement.    This theyhad done on 26th November.    The impression had beenthat this document had been badly received byMr. Kurusu.Thereafter the tension had increased,and there had been reports that Japan was movingforces southward.    The Prime Minister would, nodoubt, report to the War Cabinet the action whichhad been taken.The latest pronouncement of.the JapaneseCabinet, reported in the Press, was that the Washingtonconferences v/ould continue, although there was great difference between the American and Japanese stand-points.    He thought that we were entitled to regard this as a favourable development,THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as the resultof a report that Japanese forces were moving south-wards, possibly with the intention of committing an act of aggression against Siam, there had been an    juexchange of telegrams with the Dominion Governments/The Australian Government thought that if Japancommitted an aggression against Siam, we should atonce take warlike measures,    Field-Marshal Smuts had /jthought that we could assume that the United states would sutrport us,  once we became involved in the Far&apos;East.     Even if we took the initiative in advancing/to the Kra Isthmus, it would be manifest that we were acting defensively in forestalling a Japanese landing.Mr. Mackenzie King, on the other hand, had warned usin strong terms of the dangers of becoming involved with Japan with no assurance of United States

co-operation.    The Chiefs of Staff,, having., considered,the telegrams from the four Dominions, had not-departed from the view which they had previouslyexpressed, that -(a) Until we were assured of American militaryseipport, we should take no action, save in defence of our vital interests, which was likely to precipitate war with Japan:(b) An occupation by Japan of the Era Isthmus.   &quot; could only be with the object of attackingSingapore.    Nevertheless, it would not by itself be an attack on our vital interests.The Prime Minister said that he was still ofopinion that we ought no-  to assume that the outbreakof war between England and Japan would, necessarilyprecipitate the entry of the United. States into thewar.    There was a strong party in the United. states who would, work up prejudice against being drawn intoBritain&apos;s war.The Prime Minister read, to the War Cabinet a copyof a Personal Telegram which he had. sent to president roosevelt on   the previous day.    This telegram read,as follows:-&quot;It seems to me   that one importantmethod, remains unused, in averting war between Japan and our two  countries, namely,a plain declaration, secret, or public asmay be thought best, that any farther act of aggression by Japan will lead, immediately to the gravest, consequences.    I real is eyour constitutional difficulties, but. itwould be tragic if Japan drifted into warby encroachment without having before herfairly and squarely the dire character ofa further aggressive step.    I beg you tocons id.ex1 whether, at the moment which youjudge right, which may be very near, you should, not say that &apos;Any further japanese aggression would compel you to place the gravest issues before Congress&apos;  or words tothat effect.   We would of course make asimilar declaration or share in a. joint declaration, and. in any ease arrangements are being made to synchronise our action with yours .   Forgive me ray dear friendfor presuming to press such a course uponyou, but I am convinced that it might make all the difference and prevent a melancholyextension of the war.&quot;The Prime Minister added that with the dominions secretary and the Chiefs of Staff, he had had a meeting that morning with Sir Earle Page and Mr0 Bruce;    theForeign Secretary had joined them shortly before the close of the meeting.    He (the Prime Minister) had explained that, in his view, we should not resist orattempt to forestall a Japanese attack on the Kra Isthmus

unless we had a satisfactory assurance from the UnitedStates that they would join us should our action causeus to become involved in war with Japans   The samewould apply, with even more force, in the event of a japanese attack on Russia, or aggression in theNetherlands East Indies,.    He had conveyed this view toMr. Bruce., and had authorised the despatch to Mr.Curtinof a copy of his telegram of the 30th November to president Roosevelt.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS read to the War Cabinet a copy of Telegram 763^just received from Australia, reporting the&quot; decision of theAustralian War Cabinet.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that there was some indication of a forward move in American publicopinion.    He also informed the War Cabinet that the   .Dutch, who had been asked whether they could detail twosubmarines to work with our forces, had agreed to put them under the operational control of our Commander-in-Chief , in order to avoid dual control,.    The Dutchhad also mobilised their Air Force Reserve^    He was far from happy as to our situation in respect of theDutch who were co-operating loyally with us and wouldcertainly look to us if they were attacked,The Foreign Secretary concluded by saying thatthe position at the moment was extremely fluid.    we might at anyraoment receive an answer from the UnitedStates Government which would justify a more forwardpolicy.The War Cabinet took note of thesestatements0Great George Street, S.W. 1.

JAPAN.

1. There are important indications that Japan is about to attack Thailand and that this attack will include a sea-borne expedition to seize strategical points in the Kra Isthmus.

2. The Royal Air Force are reconnoitring on an area of 180 miles from Khota Bharu for three days commencing the 29th November and Commander-in-Chief Far East has requested Commander-in-Chief United States Asiatic Fleet at Manila to undertake air reconnaissance on the line Manila-Camranh Bay on the same days. Commander-in-Chief Far East has asked for permission to move into Kra Isthmus if reconnaissance establishes the fact that escorted Japanese ships are approaching the Isthmus, and he is pressing far an immediate decision on this point. Time is the essence of this plan particularly at this season of the year when the Kra Isthmus is water-logged. Consequently great tactical advantage lies with the side which gets there first.

3. Our Military Advisers fear that operation might lead to a clash which might involve us in war and they have always emphasided that unless our vital interests were immediately threatened this should be avoided so long as we have no certainty of United States support.  In view however of United States Government&apos;s constitutional difficulties any prior guarantee of such support is most unlikely.

4. In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington has been instructed to explain the position at once to the United States Government and to take following line. To allow the Japanese to establish themselves so near the Malay frontier would be an obvious threat to Singapore, even though at present season it might not develop at once. We have also to bear in mind the encouragement which Japanese success would give to their extremists. Japanese appetite would inevitably grow and other Far Eastern peoples would be correspondingly depressed. It looks therefore as though, to ensure the defence of Singapore and for wider reasons, we

MOST IMMEDIATE

No. 762 MOST SECRET.

Addressed to the Secretary of State for ? Affairs No. 762. Repeated to Washington No. 138 and Prime Minister of New Zealand No. 601.

Your telegram of 30th November ? No. ?

The Australian Government&apos;s position is that we have awaited your advice regarding the four operations presumably open to Japan. We pointed out that attack on Thailand and a further attack on China were regarded by us as imminent, and that the Netherlands East Indies and Russia also are protected theatres of Japanese action, but that no understanding of what should be done or not done, in any one of these four contingencies had been reached. Our High Commissioner was requested to consult ? with a view to urgent consideration by the British War cabinet of these four possibilities.

He was advised that we considered that understanding should be reached either with United States participation or without United States participation. We still consider this opportune.

Regarding year U No. 406, our view is that the Commander-in-Chief Far East is advising on the presumption that (1) the Commander-in-Chief of United States Asiatic Fleet does undertake air reconnaissance on the line Manila - Camranh and (2) that the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Asiatic Fleet establishes the fact that escorted Japanese ships are approaching the Kra isthmus.

It is urgent to impress the United States with the obligation arising from its certification (sic) of Japanese aggression. We feel that United States evidence warranting our taking precautions at least require acceptance by the United States of her responsibility for the course we thereby think inevitable. But if this is not practicable because of constitutional reasons, we hope preliminary understanding at least will be attained.

We further point out:

(1) The available tropical Japanese expeditionary force seems to be based on United States intelligence report which also suggests

(a) commander of the proposed expedition still in Japan (b)any attack by Japanese will not come until after the break down of the Hull - Kurasu talks.

(2) Our latest advises from Washington are that in the event of Japanese attack on Thailand no definite understandings on armed support from the United States can be anticipated.

(3) This may result in the position which you regarded as the worst possible from the Empire point of view namely war with Japan, United States neutral.

(4) Crosby reported on the 21st November that the Prime Minister of Thailand regarded with suspicion the suggestion of British - Thailand co-operation in the region of Kra isthmus. Crosby further stated that if we occupy the isthmus before the actual attack by Japan, Thailand would oppose us by force and the "fat would be in the fire". Perhaps this dangerous possibility can be definitely excluded on the assumption especially contemplated by you, namely Japanese ships with escort actually approaching the isthmus.

(5) We suggest that Crosby obtains definite statement of the attitude of Thailand in the event of such attack by Japan.

I am calling a special War Cabinet tomorrow afternoon. We would be glad of your Cabinet&apos;s consideration of the subject matter of my telegram of the 29th November to Bruce. Please see that Bruce and Page receive copies of this telegram.

Stalintelling him what action we had taken, and. sayingthat if he now said the word we would declare war on Finland..    In this    event we should declare war against Hungary and Roumania at the same time.The Prime Minister added that, while he saw no alternative to action on these lines, he did notbelieve that it was in the interests of ourselves orof the Russians.In further discussion, THE FOREIGN secretary said, that Field-Marshal Mannerheim had been reported as making a statement that it was necessary for Finland to continue to fight in order to attain herstrategic aims.
