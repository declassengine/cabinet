(41) 112TH QOMOLUaTONflx..H,IHIJTZ-.lOonf idential Annex.(12th November, 1941 - 5.50 p. m. ). SIR EARLE PAGE said the- object of his visit was to give the War Cabinet the Australian 130int ofview with regard to problems arising from the war0Australia5 s geographical position rendered her situation,somewhat different from that of the other Dominions,except New Zealand.    This was owing to difficultiesof communication and absence of personal contacts,Australia&apos;s isolated position in&quot; the Pacific alsoinvolved special consideration.At the present meeting he proposed to confinehis statement to the position in the Pacific and thedanger arising from Japan&apos;s attitude.The portion   of the British Empire in the pacific and Indian&quot;tfcJftan was vital to the Empire&apos;future destiny and prosperity.    It was essential thatwe should keep ourselves, and deprive the enemy of the vital raw materials which this area provided.    The areaof the British Empire in the Pacific and Indian Oceanswas three-quarters : of its whole and held six-seventhsof its population. - Before the war the import and exporttrade in and out of the United Kingdom from this partof the Empire was double that of the remainder of theEmpire.    The products of this area were also vital tothe prosecution of the war.This objective could be best achieved by keeping Japan out of the war.    This could be done -(i)   by keeping ourselves strong and(ii)   by close co-operation with the U.S,A,With regard to (i), Australia recognised the paramount importance of the defence of the United Kingdomand also of the necessities of the situation in theMiddle East.    She also appreciated how limited ourarmaments had been when war started and the magnificenteffort that had been made to build them up,    Australiaalso recognised the difficulties of determining theallocation of these limited resources.    NeverthelessAustralia felt that up till now the importance .of thesituation in the Far East had not been sufficientlyrecognised.    In saying this he did not overlook thedespatch of the &apos;Prince of Wales5 and a battle squadronto the Far East -- an &quot;action which Australia greatlyappreciated - nor did she forget the steps which hadbeen taken to strengthen Singapore.    Australia thought,however, that wc -7.igat also to increase our air strength at singapore even, at the expense of other theatres.      the he FAR EAST.statement byir Earle Page.-1-

The Australian view was  oha-c these 336 aircraft should be availableimmediately at Singapore, first of all for their value as a deterrent to Japan,,Even if our air force was strengthened,and orought up to the figure of 320 machines, therewould remain four possibilities of a Japanese attackon neighbouring nations namely;--(a) On Russiae(b) On Kunming and the Burma Road,,(c) On the Dutch East Indies-.(d) On Biara.As regards (a),.    If Japan attacked Russiahe thought that wo should be forced to go to Russ&quot;ia&apos;said by declaring war on Japan.,    Public opinun inthis country and Australia would probably demand suchaction...    Whilst we should not be in a position to givedirect aid to Russia, the presence of a strong airforce in Singapore would enaljle us to give her   indirectaid by assisting the Chinese to   harass the Japanesein ChinanAs regards (b).

Further, the raw materials whichthe Axis would gain by a successful attack on theDutch East Indies would lengthen the war and cost manyhundreds of thousands of lives.    He thought the onlyimmediate step we oould take was the strengthening ofour air force&quot; in Singapore, now that the wise actionof sending a battle squadron to Singapore had beentaken0With regard to (d)- a possible Japanese invasion of Siam - Sir Earle Page said that Australia thoughtthat military necessity plus political considerations would force us into war with Japan,    He himself had little doubt that we should have to take action.    Thewhole of the political changes in Axistralia in thelast three months had really resulted from the sense of danger that the menace of Japan to Thailand had.brought to Australian political and public opinion.There again an increase in aix   -length was the only way to meet this contingency,,-2-

THE PRIME MINISTER said that early in Augustit had &quot;been thought that Japan might march immediatelyinto SiamL hut so far she had not done soc    He recalled that the Japanese situation had been discussed at the atlantic Conference, when President Roosevelt had undertaken -&apos;(a) to endeavour to gain time5(b) to warn Japan that she would come up against the United States in the eventof her marching into Slain,,..SIR EARLE PAGE, summing-up his argument on thispoint, said that in all these four contingencies theinitiative lay with. Japan, and that we might have totake the field against her.    The immediate action required was, therefore,  to ensure that we had sufficient forces,available in the Par East to act as a deterrent.Sir Earle Page then turned to the second point which he had mentioned at the beginning of his statement,  .namely, pprojoeratipn with the United States.The fact that the United States had taken theinitiative in exerting economic pressure on Japan had given great encouragement to Australia^    He thought thatour policy in the Pacific must he governed hy twoprinciples:-(i)    to keep Japan out of the war, at any ratefor the present j   and(ii) . if we were unsuccessful in this, we must ensurethat v/e had the co-operation of America.He understood that the United Kingdom Government&apos;policy in giving effect to these two principles was tomaintain the closest liaison with the United States and hyensuring, if possible, that she took the lead in any action^    He would he glad to discuss this policy sinceAustralia had douhts ahout the United Kingdom Government^attitude of insisting that the United States should takethe lead,..    In Australia&apos;s view attacks by Japan on Russia,Kunming, the Dutch East Indies or the Burma Road mightinevitably lead to our having to take action irrespective of what America did.    It was possible that America mightwi.lq.,U6imA  reinforce the Independent Air Force but not declare war,In such circumstances, it might he wise to state ourposition frankly to the United States and invite them togive us privately, without any commitment, an indicationas to whether they would come to our aid.There was no doubt that there had been a changein the American outlook as regards the situation in. the pacific    America had at first thought thau       would be necessary  to evacuate the Philip-Dines hut now they wereresolved to defend these Islands to the last.    the definite strengthening of the American attitude in thisrespect mad^        position easier.    This had also beenthe&quot;eficoo or the forthright statement made by the PrimeMinister in his speech at the Mansion House on Monday,10th November^    A^ strong attitude on our part would gainthe support of American public opinion, but if we allowed the Japanese too much latitude, he thought that the task of the&quot;Admihistration in the United States would he made more difficult.

In. the course of discussion earlier in the year-the United States authorities had &quot;been disinclined tohelp us on the naval side, on the grounds that the Britishaimed at simply protecting trade routes, and were not ina position to take offensive naval action.    This showedhow public opinion in the United States might &quot;be changedif we showed that we would take the leadcConcluding, Sir Earle Page said that opinion in Australia was anxious to help in the general war effort.A substantial contribution had already &quot;been made but owing to the situation in the Pacific, some 200,000young men were being held at home, three-quarters of whom would be available for service overseas and in tl\emunitions factories if the position at Singapore wass t r e ngthened.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked Sir Earle Page forhis statement and asked the First Sea Lord to explain the naval situation.THE FIRST SEA LORD gave a review of the Naval   ,position.Dealing first with the Battle of the Atlantic,he said that the German U-boats were now working rightacross the whole ocean.    At one time we had thought thatafter the Americans had assumed responsibility for thedefence of the Western half of the Atlantic, the german-boats would not operate in that sphere.    We now had some indication that while German U-boats would not takeaggressive action against United States warships except tofacilitate their own escape, there was no sign that theywould not attack convoys in this area,,At one time we had hoped that we should be ableto bring back all our Corvettes from the other side ofthe Atlantic.    Under the present arrangement, however,we retained responsibility for the SaC.  convoys.    Wehad therefore had to keep some Destroyers and Corvettesbased on Canadian ports.The U-boats&apos; present tactics were that some ofthem operated independently, and others in large groups^Those acting independently gave notice of movements ofour convoys to the larger groups.    Attacks were made at night, at considerable range, after which the U-boats madeav/ay from the convoy.    It was therefore difficult toestablish contact with them in order to attack them.    Thiswas being dealt with by fitting new apparatus.The air menace to our convoys had diminished,owing mainly to the greater number of guns amounted onour merchant vessels, and to our improved shooting.    TheFocke Wulf and other long distance aircraft now tended to confine themselves to reconnaissance duties.Enemy attacks on the East Coast convoys continued,especially at the full moon.    Our anti-aircraft gunnerswere now bringing ,more down.

The Mine menane continued, but the situation wasin hand.    We were always expecting to have to face a new type of mine.   But our scientific advisers thought thatthey knew the lines of possible future developments.The raider situation.    The Germans had normallyfrom one to three raiders out.    They had not done much damage lately^Destroyer escorts.    All the destroyers notrequired for service with the fleets were fully employedon escort dutyc    He hoped the Australian Government would agree to their four destroyers, lately in the Mediterraneanjoining the Far Eastern fleet after completion of refitin Australia.The cruiser situation.was pretty tight, owing tothe demands of escorts for convoys.,The Far Eastern situation.    The First Sea lord was asked to explain what the position would he if we find ourselves at war with Japan before Christmas, theUnited States remaining neutral.    He saw that in theabsence of a threat from the United States Pacific Fleet,the Japanese would be able to move southward a much strongercapital ship force than we could assemble in Far EasternWaters,    By January/February 1942, our Far Eastern BattleFleet would be composed ofPrince of Wales,One Battle Cruiser (Repulse or Renown),Four R. Glass Capital Ships (Resolution.Ramillies, Revenge and Royal Sovereign),SIR EARLE PAGE referred to the very strong anti-Japanese feeling evident in the United States, especiallyin the west,THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the United states authorities were&quot; showing signs of adopting a more forwardpolicy.    There were many people in America who thoughtthat they ought to send capital ships to join our Fleet at singapore.    For the moment^ however, the Americans stilladhered to the policy of maintaining their main fleet atHawaii,    They were, however, taking steps to strengthen their fleet in the Philippines,    They had already undertaken to send nine destroyers and twelve submarines to work withthe &quot;Eastern Fleet&quot; in the event of their coming in.   the philippines were now an American submarine base and the defences there were being strengthened.A complete understanding had not yet been reached as the result of our conversations with the United states naval Authorities.    They held that we ought to hold the&quot;Malay barrier&quot; in the event of war with Japan.    This hadbeen out of the question with the forces hitherto availableto us I?- the Far East;   but the adoption of the AmericanPlan 5      had eased the position in the Atlantic, and had enabled us to decide on the strengthening of our Far EasternNaval forces.    We were to hold further Naval conversations in the Far East with the Americans in December,    These wouldbe followed by joint conversations with the Americans and theDutch.

The United States Naval Staff contended thatit was unnecessary to maintain so many Australian andNew Zealand cruisers in Australian and New -Zealand Waters..It was possible that the Dominion Governments had over-estimated the raider menace in those Waters,    some compromise &quot;between the two views might well be arrived at.Air situation.    THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFFgave an appreciation of the air situation in the far east,    Our target was to maintain some 330 aircraft at singapore,.    We had now ahout 300 there.   He understoodthat Sir Barle Page agreed that this was an adequategarrison for defensive Tour-poses, hut would like to see powerful striking force added.    We shared that view,and wished to give effect to it as soon as possible.The United States had sent 30 heavy &quot;bombers to Manila.It was understood that 35 more would follow next year.Manila was, of course, a more central strategical situation than Singapore.If it became necessary to reinforce Singaporeby medium homhers,  this could only he done at the :;,expense of the Middle East,    Medium hombers would haveto be flown out, and v/e were already sending out as bigreinforcements, via, Gibraltar and Malta, as this routecould carry.If a situation in the Far East arose in whichit was necessary to send the Fleet from the MiddleTiiast to the Far East, there was no doubt that we shouldIsq send bombers from the Middle East to the far eastern theatre.    This journey could be done by air.The hroad situation was that in the ahsenceof extreme danger in the Far East, it was uneconomicalto employ there, in a precautionary role, bombers nowbeing used to attack targets in Germany and in theMiddle East,In reply to a question, THE CHIEF OF THE AIRSTAFF said that Liberator II aircraft, if to he used asday homhers, could not he sent direct from America tothe Far East.    They had to go via the United Kingdom,where they were fitted with turrets.   We should get no more Flying Fortresses from the United States until 1942,Military Forces.      THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL.GENERAL STAFF said that the garrison of Singapore was something over 63,000, together with 14,000 volunteers.In addition to the heavy fixed defences of the fortress,there were over 200 anti-aircraft guns there.    There were,-however,  shortages in field and anti-tank guns.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked Sir Earle Pagevery cordially for his statement which would he mostfully considered hy the Chiefs of Staff,    The UnitedKingdom were resolute to help Australia if she weremenaced with invasion.    But Sir Earle Page would recognisethat it v/ould he a grave strategical error to move forces to the Far East - possibly to remain inactive for a year -which were now actively engaged against Germany and Italy,Our correct strategy was to move our strength from theatreto theatre as the situation changed,     At the present timethe theatre in which forces could be most profitahlyemployed was the Middle East.   A policy of spreading our resources mo guard against possible hut unlikely dangers,might he fatal,,

What was the &quot;best deterrent to employ againstthe Japanese?   In his view the answer was to maintain a stiff attitude towards her hut not to become involvedin war with her unless we had the assurance of UnitedStates participation.    There were four situations whichwe had to contemplate in the   ?a:? East 3&apos;&quot;(i;    The United States at war with Germany and japan neutral,(ii)    The United States in the war with us and japan in the war against us,(iii)    Both   countries out of the war0(iv)    The United States out of the war but japan in against us.The fourth possibility was clearly the most   -.unfavourable and the one which we should at all costsavoido      But the whole position was too complex to bedealt with on the basis&quot; of any rigid formula,and he hoped that they might be allowed some latitude in handUin*the matter^    We had to watch the situation from week toweek, and from month to month, and to deal with it asbest&quot;we could.The Prime Minister said that he was not oneof those who believed that it was in japan&apos;s power to invade Australia,    Nevertheless, he would renew hisassurance that if Australia were gravely threatened,we should cut our losses in the Middle East and move in great strength to Australia&apos;s assistance.    Such adecision, however, was not one to be taken lightly.The Prime Minister went on to refer to thedifficulties which faced President Roosevelt as a resultof the slow development of American opinion and thepeculiarities of the American Constitution.    Nobody butCongress could declare war.      It was, however, in thePresident&apos;s power to make war without declaring it.President Roosevelt was a great leader.    In the last twelve months American opinion had moved under hisleadership to an extent which nobody could haveanticipated.    They had made immense credits availableto us;    they had made immense resources available tous under the Lease-Lend Act;    their Navy was escortingthe Atlantic convoys;    and finally they were taking a firm line with the Japanese.,The Prime Minister then referred to the seriesof personal telegrams which President Roosevelt and hehad exchanged since the beginning of the war,    Thisexchange of views continued down to the present moment,but it would be a great error on his part to pressPresident Roosevelt to act in advance of American opinion.The difference between the two countries in anutshell was that he, the Prime Minister, had it in his power with the approval of the War Cabinet to go to theMansion Plouse and&quot;say &quot;Should the United States become involved in war with Japan, the British declaration will follow within the hour&quot;.    The American President had nosuch power, and it remained possible, thr-Tgh unlikely,hat the United States would disinterest thc^eltves ifwe were to declare war on Japan*

ESVery likely developments in America might become more rapid after the repeal of the NeutralityAc t0THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the four forms which Japanese aggpessionwas likely to take:-(i)   An attack on Russia,   We had no commitment to come to Russia&apos;s assistance in thateventuality nor had they pressed us- in thematter in any way.    Equally they had no commitment to come to our assistance inthe Far East,(ii)    An attack on Siajn.     .    Here our maininterest was in the Kra Peninsula,    Wehad no commitment to SrLamc(iii)    An attack northwards from Indo-Chinaagainst the Burma Road,    Here our maininterest was in keeping China in the war.(iv)   An attack against the Dutch East Indies.This was nearer to a direct threat against us aThese four situations all contained differingfeatures and it was not possible to maintain &quot;a tidy -JtJLj^diplomatic front&quot; in the Far East, or to move fiMP- a-a.^^T^ g-^f the Unite! States. ^     ^fXU, ^MfaSIR EARLE PAGE said that hejwas content withthe assurances which he had. received.A He would onlydraw attention to the great psychological value of saving a &quot;fire break&quot; against the Japanese.    For example,could our air forces at Singapore be used as a &quot;firebreak&quot; against an attack on the Burma Road?   That seemedto him to be a suggestion which it would be worth while for the Chiefs of Staff to examine.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we were in thedifficulty that the R.A.F.  expansion programme fell short both of our expectations and our needs.    Sir EarlePage&apos;s suggestions would all he most carefully considered.The War Cabinet would hold themselves in readiness toassist Sir Earle Page while he was in this country.    Ifhe wished for another exchange of views, a special meeting could be held at any time.    Sir Earle Page would,no doubt5  report to   -his Government what had pssed atthe present meeting, of which a full record would bemade0IT oy emb er,. 1941r,
