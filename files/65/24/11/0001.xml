(41)  184th QOHOLUSIOHS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(4th December, 1941, 6.0 p.m.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State   for Foreign Affairs (w.P.(4l)288-Revise) relating to the forthcoming negotiationswith the Soviet Government.   Attached to thisMemorandum. were:-Annex I; a draft Note, intended to serve as a basis for the foreign secretary&apos;s discussions on thepolitical side?    and annex II: a draft Declaration by theSoviet Government and ourselves.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had Communication-cated to the American Ambassador the gist of the note, and had read to him the text of the draft-Declaration.   Mr Winant had agreed generally with thepolicy outlined therein.   He (the Foreign Secretary)did. not now propose to &quot;communicate any Memorandum tothe Soviet Government before he reached Moscow, althoughho would, no doubt, have discussions with M. Maisky onthe voyage.In discussion,  THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUERdrew attention to paragraph 10 of Annex I, whichreferred, to participation by the Soviet Governmentin the co-ordination of post-war economic policy generally.   The Chancellor said, he hoped that itwould not be necessary for Russia to be brought into these discussions at the outset, since this would add to the difficulties inherent in this matter-THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he agreed, andthat it was for this reason that he had inserted thewords &quot;appropriate: moment&quot; in this paragraph.    if need be, he would indicate that- there were certain matters on which the United States and. ourselvescould do some useful preliminary work before bringing in the Soviet Government.)       In discussion, it was suggested that the U.S.S.R.&quot;might desire to discuss territorial changes;    e.&amp;., the boundaries of post-war Germany, or the future of the baltic states.   On this, the Foreign Secretary would, nodoubt take the line indicated in paragraph 9, andwould avoid being drawn into any precise discussions as regards territorial changes or boundaries.

The War Cabinet:-(l) Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;sMemorandum (W.P.(41) 288-Revis e)and the two Annexes thereto, asthe Id a?, is for his discussions at moscow in the political sphere,on the understanding that he would refer &quot;back to the War Cabinet anysubstantial alteration involved:(S) Invited the Secretary of State forDominion   Affairs to communicate tothe Dominion Governments trie gist of the two Annexes:(3)  Invited the Foreign Secretary toconsider whether it would be advisable that he &quot;should visit Tehran, Angoraand Cairo, in addition to Moscow.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a discussion hadtaken pla.ee at the Meeting of the Defence Committeeon   the previous evening?; as to the military assist-ance which we could give to Russia..    At that Meetingthe vie&quot;r taken had been that we should lay thefollowing policy before the Russians:-(i) We would press on the Libyan offensivewith all the means at our disposal:(ii) We 616 not propose, therefore, to send troops north of Persia, because it. wo\ildmean diverting them from the Libyanbattle and woul d at the same time chokethe Persian supply line to Russia.:(iii) We felt    that the Russian cause would best be served by our engaging the Germans inthe manner proposed, while sending toRussia the utmost that we could sparein the way of equipment:(iv) We were making good the promises whichwe had made in Moscow, but now we wereprepared to run a greater risk in theUnited Kingdom in &quot;the Spring, and would send, in addition, as fast as the capacityof the North Russian ports would allow, afurther 500 tanks and 500 aircraft.The Chiefs of Staff had been invited to examine this policy and to sub?7?.it definite proposals for theadditional equipment which might be offered to theRussians, together with the implications of such an offer.THE CHIEF nrl Til&quot; L-lPiiRxaL GENERAL STAFF said that&apos;.h... wiiiefs of Staff had discussed the question that morning.    It would be inadvisable to withdraw tanksalready earmarked for the Middle East or India.-2-/ (dc0. (41) 71st Meeting.)

This meant that any extra supplies for Russia mustbe taken from tanks allocated to home defence.   As tothe type of tank which might be sent, not very many&quot;Matildas&quot; were coming out of the factories,   andthe Russians die1 not. like thern.    If &quot;Valentines&quot; were sent, it would mean a delay in re-equipping the 6thand 8th Armoured Divisions, which had been stripped of equipment in the interests of tte MiHLe East, and the forces required for &quot;GYMNAST&quot;.   Although the &quot;Churchill&quot;tank had not overcome its teething troubles, itpossessed certain advantages which would appeal tothe Russians;    e.g., increased radius of action, a wider track, and petrol (as opposed to Diesel)engines, which put up   a good performance in coldweather.    It was suggested, therefore, that we should send 50 of these tanks each month until June,.making300 in all.   But it must be remembered that three ofour Tank Brigades in this  country would, as   a   result,be short of tanks;    and if the Germans succeeded,should they invade this country, in landing an equal number of tanks to our own,   complete chaos must resultfor some little time.    The Libyan battle was an illustration of what happened when equal forces ofBritish and German tanks met in battle.   Further, thefact that we were arming other countries beforeourselves, might have a bad psychological effect onthe Army.Another factor was that the &quot;Churchill&quot; had notyet been used in battle, and there were somedisadvantages in disclosing its -potentialities to theenemy.Aircraft. THE CF.IEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that we couldnot spare any British machines, Vat he thought it-might be possible to find 300 aircraft from America.It must be remembered that we had only about 100more fighters of the Hurricane and Spitfire types (i, e.excluding    night fighters)  in this  country than atthe time of the Battle of Britain last year.    It wasvery difficult to make an accurate forecast of thenumber of British machines that would, be availablebetween now and June next, owing to the impossibility of assessing the effect of possible bombing attacks on production and the amount of reinforcements thatwould be necessary for the Middle East.After a careful survey of the situation, hesuggested that we should, offer the Russians 300United States aircraft, on. the condition that these machines were duly delivered to us by the UnitedStates .THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was  clearly ofopinion that it would be wrong for us to send two divisions to the Southern Russian front, the resultof which would be to clog the communications toRussia through Persia.   While we had fulfilled ourdeliveries to Russia, the American deliveries hadlagged behind their undertakings,   and they nowproposed to divert to Russia, shipping which had previously been allocated to sustain the import programme to this country.I -3-

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said, that he could now showM. Stalin that we taai had established an active second front in libya,   which was diverting a -part of the enemy&apos;attack from Russia.   The best military method opento us of. serving the common cause was to press on withthe Libyan offensive.   Nevertheless he saw greatdifficulty in his going to Russia empty-handed.M&apos;. Stalin would be bitterly disappointed, and time would then have to be consumed in telegraphing home for authority to make an additional offer to him.He suggested that he should be given authority tomake an offer (say not exceeding a further 300 tanks),if absolutely necessary.Reference was made to the telegrams exchangedwith M, Stalin.     &apos; In his telegram of the21st November to M-. Stalin,   the Prime Minister had said that &apos;Mr Eden would be accompanied by high militaryand other experts, and would be able to discuss  everyquestion relating to the war, including the sending oftroops, not only into the Caucasus, but into thefighting line of your armies in the South&quot;-.    It was true that this was only an offer to discuss, but inhis reply of the 23rd November M. Stalin had said&quot;I believe our joint, consideration and acceptance ofan agreement concerning the common military operations of the Soviet and British forces at our front, as wellas speedy realisation of such an agreement, wouldhave a great   positive value&quot;.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, there was no doubtthat M. Stalin expected that he (the Foreign Secretary)would arrive with a definite proposal to make Britishtroops available to fight in South Russia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when this offer had.been made, the late Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, in recommending the despatch of two divisions to South Russia, had made a mental reservation that bythe time our troops reached the Caucasus the russian front would almost certainly have moved, back to meet us, and that these Divisions would not in fact, get.beyond, the Caucasus, where they would be of great value in assisting to hold the gap between the mountains and the Caspian.   All this, of course, wasaltered by the success of   the Russians at Rostov.The suggestion was made that the Foreign secretary might postpone   his visit, giving as a reason thedifficulties of the international situation, particu-larly in the Fa.r East.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that a postponement would, be disastrous .   There was no certainty that, theForeign Secretary would be in a better position if he made his visit at a later date.

Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister saidthat he thought it was generally accepted that it would to a mistake for us to send two Divisions into south russia.    Our troops would he better employed elsewhere,and he felt sure that M.- Stalin would recognise this0He still wished, however, that at an earlier stage inthe Russian campaign we had found it possible to send10 squadrons of fighters to the Moscow front.The question whether the Foreign Secretary shouldbe authorised to make some further offer of military supplies,  e. g., tanks and aircraft, was a matter whichmust be further studied.The War Cabinet(l) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary, inhis military discussions at Moscow,should proceed generally on the basisof heads    (i), Cii) aud (iii) of thepolicy outlined at the Meeting of theDefence Committee on the previous evening (See &quot;X&quot; above):(2)   Deferred a decision on the questionwhether the Foreign Secretary shouldbe authorised to make some furtheroffer, e. g. , of tanks or aircraft,until this matter had been further examined:(3)    Invited the Service and ProductionMinisters to communicate to theForeign Secretary forthwith any points which they wished him totake up with M. Stalin,Great George Street, S.W. 1.

MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex,(4th December, 1941 - 6.0 p.-ra.)Since the last Meeting of the War Cabinet,telegram 5519, dated 1st December, had been receivedfrom Lord Halifax, reporting a long discussion whichbe had had with President Roosevelt and Mr. Hopkins.This telegram, together with a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (41) 29.6), had been considered on the previous afternoon at a Meeting of the Defence Committee, whichhad authorised the Foreign Secretary to despatchtelegram 6672 in reply to telegram 5519.    Copies Ofthese two telegrams, and of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sMemorandum, were before the War Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary brought to the Meeting,and handed round, copies of telegram 5577 from lord Halifax, reporting a further interview which hehad had with the President and the Under-Secretary ofState,  to whom he had read telegram 6672.It was agreed that this telegram not onlyconfirmed the very satisfactory impression made by telegram 5519 but went even further.The following points were made in discussion on ^legram .5577.Paragraph 6 recorded the Presidents assent to the statement in paragraph 3 of telegram 6672 thatin the event of any direct attack on ourselves or theDutch, we should obviously all be in it together.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in the lightof this assurance, we could vow say to the Dutch thatif any attack was made on them by Japan, we should at once come to their aid, and that we had everyconfidence that the United States -would do so also.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY suggested thatit might be wise to tell President Roosevelt that, inview of what he had said, we were proposing to make astatement on these lines to the Dutch.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY, however, pointed outthat this would need to be very carefully phrased,since President Roosevelt was probably under tneimpression that we had already given an assurance onthese lines to the Dutch.

THE PRIME MINISTER -said that he thought that further steps could now he taken to concert Staff plans,with the Dutch.Era Isthmus. The Prime Minister thought that, in viewfof the assurances    given   in   paragraphs 4 and 5,instructions could now he given to the Commander-rin-Chief ,Par East, to put Operation MATADOR into effect, if thecircumstances made this necessary.Slam.       . . It was clear that President Roosevelt was anxious to make some communication to the Government of siam in order to stiffen their resistance to Japanese,aggression.    Some objection, however, was seen to thefirst suggestion in paragraph 7, on the ground of probableleakage of our intention to Japan;   while neithersuggestion was hardly consistent with our proposal tocarry out a forestalling operation in certain circumstances.The.position in regard to Siam would require futher consideration,,    The suggestion favoured was an offer of help from both ourselves and the United states in the event of attack by Japan, without, howevertindicating very precisely what form that help would take.The Prime Minister summing up the discussion,suggested that the War Cabinet should take the followingprovisional decisions:-(a) That we could now say to the Dutch that in theevent of attack on them by Japan we should atonce come to their aid0(b) That instructions should now be given to, ourCommanders to put Operation MATADOR intoeffect either as a forestalling measure, if a japanese attack on the Kra Isthmus was plainlyimminent, or if Japan invaded Siam,(c) That we should give some joint assurance withthe United States to the Government of Siara,The decisions taken would have to be embodied in telegrams(l)   To our Ambassador at Washington:(2)    To our Minister at Bangkok,;(3)    To the Commander -in-Chief in the Par East:(4)    To Admiral Phillips, Commander-in-Chief,Eastern. Fleet,.who.was now.at Manila, tQacquaint him with the position.(5)    To the Prime Ministers of the Dominion Govern-ments   acquainting them with the position.These, telegrams would reauire careful drafting,-   and the drafts should no ouhraitted to him (the Prime.Minister;.The War Cabinet agreed to this procedure^^Great George Street, S.W.,1.
