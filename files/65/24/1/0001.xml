If theJapanese cut the Burma Road it would be impossibleto supply the Chinese with/aJinarafitr and GeneralChiang Kai-shek said that in   this event Chineseresistance would cone to an end.   The foreign secretary suggested that he should enquire of theUnited States Government whether they could do anything to strengthen the International Air Force,which was China&apos;s only &quot;means of meeting air attack.It must be remembered, however, that this force could only be strengthened at the expense of aircraftearmarked for ourselves and Russia.Co-operationwith theNetherlandsand UnitedStates .previous reference:W.M.(41)  75thConclusions ,Tinute 8.)The War Cabinet then discussed the Memorandumby the Foreign Secretary (W.P.(41) 254), asking for authority -(a) to examine   with the Netherlands Governmentthe possibility of a formal defensive agree-ment, to be concluded on the British sideon behalf of the Governments of Australiaand New Zealand, as well as the UnitedKingdom;   .and(b) to keep the United States informed of theprogress of negotiations, and to endeavourto secure from, the United States, in theevent of an agreement being reached withthe Netherlands, some declaration to showthat the agreement had. the whole-hearted support of the United States Government.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he did not suggest, that any publicity should be given to theproposed agreement at. the present, stage. The positionwould be changed if we received an assurance of UnitedStates co-operation *    It was becoming increasingly difficult to explain to   the Dutch why we were unwilling to conclude a formal defensive agreementwith them.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA AND BURMAstrongly favoured an agreement on the lines proposed.Prom the military point of view, the Dutch east indies was one of the outposts of India&apos;s defences.Aether or not we made an agreement with the Dutchwe should have to fight the Japanese if they attacked the Dutch East Indies.     Public opinion here and inAmerica would take it amiss if we stood aloof whileJapan attacked the Dutch East Indies.THE PRIMS MINISTER thought that the next act    of japanese aggression was likely to &quot;be against Yunnan,and saw no evidence of any early intention on their part to attack the Netherlands East Indiesa     our policy in the Par East should be to persuade theUnited States to cover our weak position in that area.We should not run the risk of finding ourselves at war with Japan without American support.     We should therefore press the United States Government to declare that they would take up arms against Japanif she committed any further azt of aggression.Such a declaration would be in line with the policywhich President Roosevelt had developed orally atthe Atlantic Meeting.    No doubt the President would find it necessary to use such language as that insuch-and-such circumstances he would find itnecessary to seek the support of Congress for themeasures required by national security for theUnited States.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR DOMINION AFPAIRSsaid that there would be a painful impression inAustralia and New Zealand if we did not intervene inthe event of the Netherlands East Indies being attacked.     He thought that this opinion would be so strong as almost to force us to declare war,THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY, THE MINISTER OF LABOURAND NATIONAL SERVICE and THE FIRST LORD OP THEADMIRALTY expressed agreement with the Prime Minister&apos;view.The War Cabinet:-(1) Agreed that further discussion of theForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum (W.P.(41) 254)should be adjourned for a week or ten days:(2) Invited the Prime Minister in the meantimeto send a Personal logogram to president roosevelt.     This telegram should make it plain that we would support any actionwhich the United States saw fit to take to restrain Japanese aggression in the far east, but that we could not take the lead;and would urge strongly that the president should make a public declaration that theUnited States would take measures for their national security if Japan made any furtherencroachments in the Par Easts(The Foreign Secretary undertook tosubmit a draft to the Prime minister on these lines*)

(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to enquireof the United States Government whetherthey could take any action to strengthen the International Air Force in China:(4)  Invited the First Lord of the admiralty to consider,   and report to the PrimeMinister, whether it would be appropriate that some public announcement should he made &quot;before long in regard to Naval re-dispositions in the Far East.,    in which event it would be for consideration whetherthe first public announcement on thismatter could appropriately be made bythe Prime Minister of Australia.Great George Street, S.W.1-3-

( HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY\S GOVERNMENT.JTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special dare may betaken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST   SECRET, COPY NO.-/J-W.M.(41) 1Q8TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annexe(3rd November, 1941 - 5,0 p.m.)AID TO RUSSIA.(previous reference:W.M.(41)  106thConclusions,Minute 8.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that severaltelegrams had been exchanged with Sir Stafford Crippson the question whether we should have discussions withthe Russians regarding military co-operation.     Therehad been little or no discussion on military co-operation during the Moscow Conference, which, ofcourse, had been arranged to deal with Supply matters.Since, however, the   point had been raised, the PrimeMinister said that he thought the best plan would bethat he should telegraph to M, Stalin and offer tosend General Wavell to Russia to discuss the questionof military co-operation.     On the whole, he thoughtit would be a good plan that General Paget    (theCommander-in-Chief-designate in the Par East in succession to Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham). should visit Russia at the same time as general Wavell, and assist him in the discussions.General Paget would be fully instructed before he left this country, and would be able to put general wavell into the picture as seen from here.Some discussion followed as to whether itwould be desirable that General Paget should joinGeneral Wavell.       It would, in any event, bedesirable to warn Stalin that General pagefsimpending appointment as Commander-in-Chief in the far East should not be disclosed.General Wavell (and General Paget, if hejoined   him) would be able to explain to M. Stalinthe limited possibilities of sending a British force to Russia.       Quite apart from the time involved, if either the Archangel or the Persian route was to beused to maintain any considerable British force,this would make it impossible to send any appreciablevolume of supplies to Russia over these routes.Later in the Meeting,  the War Cabinet were informed that - through no fault of their own - twoof the three senior members of our Military mission in Moscow had not established really close relationswith the Russian Government.      It was suggested thatthere might be advantage in making changes in theseappointments when a suitable opportunity offered.

The War Cabinet:-(1) Invited the Prime Minister to telegraph to M. Stalinrand suggestthat General Wavell and GeneralPaget should go to Russia in orderto discuss with the Russianauthorities the possibilities ofmilitary co-operation.(2) Took note that, in connection withthis visit, consideration would begiven to changes in the personnel of the Military Mission in Moscow.Great George Street, S.W.I.

FOREIGN OFFICE TO KUIBYSHEV, NO. 78.MESSAGE FROM PRIME MINISTER CHURCHILL TO PREMIER STALIN.PERSONL AND SECRET.1.     In order to clear things up and to plan for the futureI am ready to send General Wavell, Commander in Chief in India,Persia and Iraq., to meet you in Moscow, Kuibishev, Tiflis orwherever you will.   Besides this, General Paget, our new commander in Chief secretly designated for the Far East, will come withGeneral Wavell.    General Paget has been in the centre of thingshere and will have with him the latest and best opinions of our high Command.    These two Officers will be able to&quot; tell you exactlyhow we stand9 what is possible and what we think is wise.    Theycan reach you in about a fortnight.   Do you want them?2.     We told you in my message of September 6th that we were willing to declare war on Finland.   Will you however considerwhether it is really good business that Great Britain shoulddeclare war on Finland, Hungary and roumania at this moment?   It isonly a formality because our extreme blockade is already in force against them.    My judgement is against it because, first, Finlandhas many friends in the United States and it is more prudent to take account of this fact.    Secondly, Roumania and&quot;Hungary:these countries are full of our firends;   they have been overpoweredby Hitler and used as a catspaw.    But if fortune turns against thatruffian they might easily come back to our side.    A Britishdeclaration of war would only freeze them all and make it look asif Hitler were the head of a grand European alliance solid against us.    Do not pray suppose it is any want of zeal or comradeship thatmakes us doubt the advantage of this step.    Our Dominions, exceptAustralia, are reluctant.    Nevertheless,&quot;if you think it will bea real help to you and worth while, I will put it to the cabinet again.3.     I hope our supplies are being cleared from Archangel as fast as they come in.    A trickle is now beginning through Persia.We shall pump both ways to our utmost.    Please make sure that ourtechnicians who are going with the Tanks and Aircraft have full opportunity to hand these weapons over to your men under the bestconditions.   At present our Mission at Kuibyshev is out of touchwith all these affairs.   They only want to help.    These weaponsare sent at our peril and we are anxious they shall have the best chance.   An order from you is necessary.4.     I cannot tell you about our immediate military plansany more than you can tell me about yours, but rest assured we arenot going to be idle.5.     With the object of keeping Japan quiet we are sendingour latest battleship PRINCE OP WALES, which can catch and kill any japanese shro, into the Indian Ocean and are building up a powerfulbattle squadron there.    I am urging President Roosevelt to increasehis pressure on the Japanese and keep them frightend so that theVladivostock route will not be blocked.6.     I will not waste words in compliments because you knowalready from Beaverbrook and Harriman what we feel about yoursplendid fight.   Have confidence in our untiring support.7.     I should be glad to hear from you direct that you havereceived this telegram. W S C* 4.11. 41.
