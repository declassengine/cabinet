MINUTE 8.ConTllentlal Annex (Revise).(11th November, 1941, 5.0 p.m.)S.S.R. THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet acopy of the telegram which (in accordance with theconclusion of the War Cabinet on 3rd November) he hadd to Russia,sent to Premier Stalin on the 4th November, dealing witheviousference:M. ( 41)8 thnclusions,nute 6).( a) the proposal to send Generals Wavell andPaget to Moscow:(b) the proposed declaration of war on Finland,Hungary and Roumania:(c) the despatch of the PRINCE OF WALES to theFar East9and other matters.4-He also read the reply, dated the 8th November^which had been handed to him that day (llth November)by M. Maisky.When M* Maisky had handed him the telegram, hehad said that a telegram of this kind could not be answered.    There had been some frank speaking, in whichhe explained that if Russia had only let us know that theywere coming into the war on our side, matters might havebeen different.     As regards the suggestion in M.Stalinfstelegram of the 8th November that we should now reach adefinite understanding on war aims and on plans for thepost-war organisation of peace, he had said that we couldnot go beyond the Atlantic Charter now.   At the end of themeeting, he (the Prime Minister) had said that he would consult the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that he was stronglyconvinced that the right course was not to send any replyfor, say, a week, more especially as it was clear thatthe Russians did not wish for a visit from Generals Wavelland Paget,.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that Russia&apos;s attitude was very suspicious of us.      They feared that we and theUnited States would get together and leave them out of thesettlement of matters at the Peace.     He thought that itwas important that this suspicion should not remain, and -that we should take all possible steps to remove it.-1-

&quot;ri^   MM^mi   OP   SUPPLY   said   thathe thought Uxe telegram was capable of a rather differentexplanation   from that put upon it by the Prime Minister,M0 Stalin   .aew no English, and no doubt the telegram had suffered in translation     Further M. Stalin had at the back of his mind some idea of getting the Germans to pay for the damage they had done in the war.     No doubt, too,the great difficulties with which the Russians were facedmight have affected Ms Stalin&apos;s outlook.      He (the Ministerof Supply) would like to take up with M* Maisky the partof the telegram which dealt with aircraft having arrivedbroken,  through imperfect packing (a complaint which was justified, owing to the bad stowage on ships).      Hethought that, without in any way answering M* Stalin&apos;message, it might be possible to get the exchange of telegrams on a more pleasant basis,.      If there was a delaythere was a danger that the Russians would suffer from a feeling of isolation^.Pi nland,&apos;ungaryf andcoumani --npreviousReference:r/0M.(4l) 108thConclusions slinute 8)0THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that another cause ofsusp. cion was that we had failed&quot; to declare war on Finland,Hungary and Roumanian      The Russians regarded these asthree capitalist countries who were fundamentally hostile to them      They thought our reluctance to declare war onthese countries was due to our sympathy with them, and t.ieyattributed to us the publicity which had taken place.Notwithstanding the disadvantages, he would still declare war on Finland, in order to end the present state of ourrelations with Russia.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like totell M.j Maisky that Ma Stalin&apos;s message was such that thePrime Minister and the War Cabinet could not be expected to reply to it immediately.      He taought that this might leadto Ma Maisky saying that we had taken the message in the wrong way, and that this might lead to some improvement inthe atmosphereQTHE PRIME MINISTER said he felt sure that theright course was to leave the letter unanswered for a week or so.    Only harm would come for an attempt to answerpoints in a message such as had now been received.After further discussion,the War Cabinet agreed as follows:-(l) When the Foreign Secretary saw Ms Maisky on thefollowing day, he should inform him that it wasnot possible to send any reply for the present to Mr. Stalin&apos;s telegram of the 8th November,since it raised such very large issues.    Hecould add that the Prime Minister and the WarCabinet were pained and surprised at the toneand contents of the message,,    He would also saythat the Minister of Supply proposed to discuss with Mo Maisky the points about the package of tanks, planes and artillery, which should havebeen brought directly to his notice:( 2) The Foreign Secretary was authorised to send toSir Stafford Cripps a copy of the message receive from Mo Stalin, and to inform him of our attitude in regard to it0

Arising out of the above, some further discussion took place in regard to the proposed declaration of war by great Britain on Finland, Hungary and Roumanian    the disadvantages of this course, more particularly in regardto Finland, had become increasingly strong during the lastweek or so.      But it was fair to point out that we had gonea long way towards telling the Russians that if they pressed the point strongly we would declare war on Finland,Nevertheless, the general view of the War cabinet was that we should not take this step at the moment,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the sftr-p was onewe could always take, but, once taken, it was irrevocable.If the matter was raised in Parliament, we should say thatthe issues were complicated and would take time to settle.If there was any risk of discussion of the matter in theHouse, it would be necessary to go into Secret Session atonce.Great George Street, S.W.I.,12th November, 1941,

PERSONAL MESSAGE.PRIME MINISTER STALIN TO PRIME MINISTER CHURCHILL,Your message received on 7th November.1. I fully agree with you that clarityshould be established in the relations betweenthe U.S.S.R. and Great Britain.   Such a claritydoes not exist at present.   The lack of clarityis the consequence of two circumstances:(a) There is no definite understanding between our two countries on war aims and onplans of the post war organisation of peace.(b) There is no agreement between theU.S.S.R. and Great Britain on mutual military assistance against Hitler in Europe.As long as there is no accord on both these questions there can be no clarity inthe Anglo-Soviet relations.   More than that: tobe quite frank, as long as the present situationexists, there will be difficult to secure mutual confidence ...

confidence.   Of course, the agreement on military supplies to the U.S.S.R. has a groat positive value,but it does not settle neither does it eMhaust thewhole problem of relations between our two countries.If the General Wavell and the General Paget, whomyou mention in your message, will come to Moscowwith a view to conclude agreement on two fundamentalquestions referred to above, I naturally would behappy to meet them and to discuss with them thesequestions.   If however the mission of the Generalsis confined to the questions of information and tothe consideration of secondary matters, it would notbe I think worth while to intrude upon the Generals.In such a case it would be also very difficult forme to find the time for the conversations.2. It seems to me an intolerable situation hasbeen created in the question of the declaration ofwar by Great Britain to Finland, Hungary andRumania.   The Soviet Government raised this question with ...

is with the British Government through the secretdiplomatic channels.   Quite unexpectedly for theU.S.S.R. the whole problem - beginning with the requestof the Soviet Government to the British Government andending with the&quot;consideration of this question by theU.S.A. Government - received wide publicity.   Thewhole problem is now being discussed at random in thepress - friendly as well as enemy.   And after allthat the British Government informs us of itsnegative attitude to our proposal.   Why is all this being done? To demonstrate the lack of unity betweenthe U.S.S.R. and Great Britain?3. You can 1$ rest assured that we are taking all the necessary measures for speedy transportationto the right ptbace of all the arms coming from great Britain to Archangel.    The same will be done with regard to the route through Iran.   In thisconnection may I call your attention to the fact/although this is a minor matter/  that tanks, planes,*artillery ...

artillery are arriving inefficiently packed, thatsometimes parts of the same vehicle are loaded indifferent ships, that planes because of theimperfect packing reach us broken?STALIN.8/11/41.KREMLIN.
