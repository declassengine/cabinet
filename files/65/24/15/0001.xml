(41)  133rd OQNOTiUSIONS, MTWTJTE    .Confidential, Annex.(22nd December, 1941, 5.0 p.m.)The War Cabinet were given information as tothe action now in train, after consideration hy theChiefs of Staff and the Defence Committee (Operations)as to   the despatch of reinforcements to the Par East.&apos;The main points were as followsOne brigade group was leaving India for Malayaimmediately, and a second, with a squadron of light) tanks, was leaving very early in January.In addition, A.A. and anti-tank reinforcements,in   a convoy now at Durban, were being diverted to malaya.   The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, had been instructed to send 50 light tanks to India.12 Blenheims from the Middle East were alreadyen route to-Singapore .50 Hudsons would leave this country, as soon asthey had been modified and fitted with long-rangetanks.    The first should arrive within   three weeks.One mediurr/bomber squadron was    being sent fromthe Middle East to the Par East at once;    the Chiefsof Staff had recommended that the question of sendingfive additional medium^bomber squadrons from t heMiddle East to the Par East should be reviewed in a fortnight&apos;s time, in the light of developments in theMediterranean theatre.Instructions- had been sent to the Middle east to fit with additional equipment and to pack up 32Kittihawk aircraft at Port Sudan, for shipment toIndia or Singapore,as soon as it was known that- this type was free from technical troubles.&quot;In reply to questions, THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIALGENERAL STAFF said that our forces in Malaya were the equivalent of four Divisions.     The Commander-in-Chief wasin a difficult tactical situation, owing to the length ofthe Malayan coastline.      So long as fine weather continued,the Japanese could constantly out-flank him by new landingsin his rear.     Heavy seas were to be expected in January,as a result of which this particular difficulty ought tobe largely removed.      The Coraraander-in^Chief planned, to delay the Japanese advance, not giving ground unlessforced, subject to the condition that his fighting formationsmust not be broken up.     He intended gradually to concentrate .the 3rd. Indian Corps, bringing back detachments from theNorth-East and East to a position&quot;half-way up the MalayanPeninsula, where they could still deny the approaches fromthose directions.      The Japanese were thought to have four or five Divisions in Malaya, but they could probably reinforcethis number.      It was doubtful whether medium or heavytanks could be used in Malaya, owing to the weakness of thebridges. I -The v/ar Cabinet took note ofn a. n --,   this statement,,eat George Street,S..W,1,
