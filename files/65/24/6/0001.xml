In-&apos;-&quot; these circumstances, the Prime Minister had sent an forth Africa.      urgent message to President Roosevelt, f&quot;(previous reference:ff.M.(4l) 44thConclusions,Minute &amp;a )THE PRIME MINISTER outlined the salient points in the message which had been despatched^He had told President Roosevelt that our operations in cyrenaica had started and that the prospects were favourable.    He had asked the President^ to do all hecould to preserve General Weygand in his Command.    If not,we hoped that he would try to get some friendly figurefrom retirement appointed, as, for example, General Georges.The Prime Minister added that he thoughtnothing more could be done, until we knew the upshot ofthe battle which was now raging in Cyrenaica.    If wecould say that we had won an important victory, weshould then ask President Roosvelt to say to Marshal Petainthat now or never was the time when he should tellNorth Africa to assert its independence and freedom,and that we would give all the aid in our power.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it would beof great assistance if President Roosevelt could sendAmerican ships into the Mediterranean.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that president roosevelt, in conversations with him, had shown himselfmost keen on the North African situation, and had urgedhow important it was that General Weygand should remainin his post as long as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if -the Germansasked for access to Bizerta, the line to&apos; take withthe French would be that, if they agreed,  the UnitedStates would never help them again, and we would puton a merciless blockade.    If they refused to concedefacilities at Bizerta we should offer them the military aid for which preliminary arrangements had already beenmade.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that, while heentirely agreed with the view -out forward by thePrime Minister, he was a little anxious about the time-table.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the matter had better be considered again on the following day, in thelight of the military situation in Oyrenaica.Oreat George Street, S.W.1.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.

PRIMS. MINISTER^PERSONAL TELEGRAMSfhe approach and deployment of our forces in libya has been most successful, and the enemy was takenby surprise.    Only now does he realise the large scale of our operations against his.    Heavy fighting betweenthe armoured forces seems probable to-day.    Orders havebeen given to press what is now begun to a decision atall costs.    The chances do not seem to be unfavourable.2. It would be disastrous if feyg&amp;nd were to bereplaced by.some pro-Hun officer just at the moment when we are likely to be in a position to influenceevents in Worth Africa both from the last and from house.I hope you will try your utmost at Vichy to preserve, Weygand in his Command.    If tills cannot be achievedSome friendly figure from retirement, like general george might be agreed upon.    I have not seen Georgessince the collapse but I have reason to believe his

Heart is sound.    I taew him wry well.    Anyhow *Ma?* President, Tools and all French Forth Africa mightopen put to us if we gain a food victory in libya, andwe must be ready, to exploit, success.
