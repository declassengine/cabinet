GQPY,$Qr./.ifc-W.M.(4l) 1Q9TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(5th November, 1941 - 12.15 p3m.)THE FAR EAST.(previous reference:W.M.(41)  108thConclusions,Minute 5.)THE PRIME MINISTER referred to a telegramfrom Chungking^ reporting that General Chiang Kai-shek believed that the Japanese meant to make anattack on Yunnan in about a month&apos;s time.     The PrimeMinister read to the War Cabinet the draft of a personal telegram from himself to President Rooseveltdealing with the Far Eastern situation.SIR EARLE PAGE said he was glad to hearthat the Prime Minister proposed to telegraph inthis   sense to the President.      News received inAustralia from Japan indicated a considerable changein the situation.     The Australian Government thoughtit was of importance that action should be taken tostrengthen our forces at Singapore so that those forces would constitute an effective deterrent by december or early January at the latest.     By thismeans we might secure that the Pacific and IndianOceans remained peaceful for the next few months, sothat the Empire could continue to transport thesupplies necessary for our war effort.The strengthening of our forces at singapore would increase our prestige in the far east greatly.     In the United States they had wonderedwhy we had not taken steps earlier to strengthen ourposition there.     Some surprise had been expressed that we had sent the WARSPITE to the United States tobe repaired instead of repairing her at Singapore.But the position which gave rise to mostanxiety was the air.     Eight or nine months ago theChiefs of Staffs at Singapore had estimated ourminimum requirements at 336 aircraft (22 squadrons).We now had 130 aircraft in the front line (10 squadrons).He (Sir Earle Page) thought that it might be possibleto ensure that the numbers needed to fill this gapwere brought to Singapore very quickly.     A reviewof the dispositions of the air forces throughout theEmpire would assist In showing whether these additional forces could be made available to go to singapore.Broadly, the Australian view was that,if we had adequate air and naval forces at Singapore,Japan would not act against us, at any rate for many months *-1-

THE FIRST SEA LORD explained that theWARSPITE had been sent to the United States &quot;because in that way repairs would be effected more quickly^Referring to the suggested air reinforce-ments for Singapore THE PRIMS MINISTER said thatthe development of our Air Force had not proceeded as fast as we had hoped.     We had now to meet the demandsof Russia to whom we had promised :o send 200 machinesa month.       Burther,it was essential to obtain and keep air superiority in the Middle East.     Above all we had to keep a sufficient air force in thiscountry to assist in repelling any invasion germany might make next spring.     Hitler had great need to invade this country.      It would be possible for himto contain the Russian front,  and to move sufficientforces to the West and stage an operation on such a scale as had never been attempted before, and regard-less of losses.     The key to repelling such an attemptlay in fighter siiperiority over the enemy.     once the fighter command of the air waj lost, germany could invade this country.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said thathe did not think that the air situation at Singaporewas quite so bad as Sir Sarle Page imagined.     Wehad 250 aircraft in Singapore, -&amp;&amp; which        wereserviceable now, or within 14 days.     The figure of336 aircraft which the Chiefs of Staff had estimated as our immediate requirement, had been arrived atbefore the decision to reinforce our naval forcesin that area.THE PRIME MINISTER? continuing, said thatto send bombers to Singapore at this present moment,when they could be more usefully employed onattacking targets in Germany and Northern France,/would be a waste of effort.As regards our naval strength in the pacific and Indian Oceans, we had taken some riskin detaching the PRINCE OF WALES from the Home Fleet.The PRINCE OF WALES was now on her way to Cape Townand likely to proceed to Singapore.     Whether she would remain there permanentiv could not yet bedecided, but it was hoped to iceep her in Easternwaters until the NELSON and RODNEY were available.In any case, her appearance at Cape Town wouldhave a deterrent effect on Japan,,       It was intendedto build up a battle squadron, based on Singapore,which could be used for the protection of the vitalsupply lines between Australia and the Middle East.The Prime Minister then referred to telegram No. 714 from the Australian Governmentwhich suggested that Japan should be warned thatany attack by her on Russia would be resisted by force by this country.     The suggestion was somewhatalarming, for the one situation he was anxious toavoid was that we should be at war with Japan without

the assistance of the. United States.      It must be re^membered that a great step forward had taken place at&quot;the Atlantic Conference when Prealdent Roosevelt had agreed to tell Japan that if she took further steps in pursuance of a policy of domination by force, theUnited States would have to take steps to safeguardher security and interests.As for the safety of Australia herself,for which this country took supreme responsibility,he could not emphasise too strongly that if this question arose then we should be prepared to abandon ourposition in the Middle East in order to go to her assistance.       The essential taskwas to determine the right disposition of our forces.      In thismatter, risks could not be avoided.     We had to balance up the danger of finding ourselves too short of forces in this or that area at a crucial moment.All these questions were the subject of continuous,almost hourly, review&apos;by the Staffs concerned.The Prime Minister said that he would beglad to discuss this matter further with Sir EarlePage and in the meantime Sir Earle Page might discussthe naval, military and air force aspects of theposition individually with each Chief of Staff.Great George Street, S.W.I.
