In regard to Russia, we should no longer be in the position that they were fighting and wewere not, except in the air.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY read to the WarCabinet a draft telegram to Sir Stafford Cripps.After a short discussion, the War Cabineti-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to despatch the draft telegram to sir stafford Cripps forthwith, subjectto two minor amendments, and suggested that he should follow it up with a further telegram on thefollowing day, as soon as it was known that the operations in Cyrenaicahad started.In connection with the above :&apos;.tem, discussion took place on the question whether it would be desirableto make any further approach to Finland.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War cabinet a copy of a draft telegram to Field-Marshal Mannerheim,which he had prepared.The following points were made in discussions:(a)   THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that it wouldbe desirable to say something to the UnitedStates before any approach was made on thelines proposedo(2)    The Foreign Secretary drew attention to thestatement.made to him by the NorwegianForeign Minister on 14th November.

N. 6375.CYPHER. p R I s E C.PROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO KUIBYSHEV.No,, 15917th November, 1941.     D. 5.30 p.m. 17th November, 1941.IMMEDIATE.PERSONAL AND SECRET.Your telegrams Nos. 98 and 99.^ 1 fear that owing to the difficulty of explainingmatters fully and satisfactorily hy telegram, there may hea misunderstanding as to the views expressed in my telegram No. 121 as regards points (a) and (h) in paragraph 2of your telegram No. 98.2.     I did not intend to convey that all fruitfuldiscussion with the SoTriet Government on peace ohjectivesand Anglo-Soviet post-war collahoration was excluded at thepresent stage.    It is most certainly the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to collahorate most closely with theirRussian Ally in these matters.    I merely wished to indicatethat it would he difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government atthe present time to define at all precisely the lines ofsuch collahoration.   You will moreover realise that it wouldhe impossible to formulate in detail any proposals on principles going beyond those laid down in the atlantic charter without &quot;bringing the Americans into the discussions.The latter have repeatedly asked us not to undertake duringthe war commitments which would hind us at the peace andafter.3.     Since drafting the ahove, I have received yourtelegrams Nos. 109 and 110, in which you elahorate your views as to the existing state of relationships and as tothe possihility of their improvement.4.     I admit the unfortunate fact of &quot;had relationship&quot;and suspicion on the part of the Russians.    It isunprofitahle to argue where main fault lies.   We are determined to do our &quot;best to remove suspicion,5,     You say that Stalin will judge us hy his &quot;twotests&quot;, i.e. (a) whether we are willing to come to an understanding on war aims and post-war organisation ofpeace, and (h) whether we can agree on mutuf&amp;l assistance against Hitler in Europe.

6.     I have explained that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare perfectly willing to discuss (a).   I should have thought they had already given some proof of their attitude inregard to (b), and their offer to send Generals Wavelland Paget was made with a view to developing their military co-operation-operation with the Soviet.7.     But as regards (a), I must warn you that ifStalin&apos;s object is, as you put it, to make us &quot;go inwholeheartedly with Russia on his terms&quot;   I cannot ofcourse give any assurance that we are prepared to do that without knowing what his terras are.8.     You go on to insist&apos; on the necessity for &quot;giving a clear answer on the two points raised by Stalin&quot;.   Igive the clear answer that we are prepared to join in bothdiscussions.   We have no idea of &quot;turning these pointsdown&quot;i   but if a &quot;clear answer&quot; means that we are to giveStalin at once a clear statement of our conception of war aims and post-war organisation of peace, for him to acceptor reject, I must say that that simply cannot be done.   Wecannot ourselves yet have a sufficiently clear conception of what our conditions and problems will be, and we mustnot go ahead without America.    But I should hope that discussion would help to clear our minds and contribute to agreement.9.     On a minor point, as regards our offer to sendGenerals Wavell and Paget, I am surprised that Stalinshould appear to have expected that we meant them todiscuss both (a) and (b).   Of course, we did not, but we did believe, and still believe, that they would be ableto contribute usefully to the discussion of the latter.10.    I believe that Maisky is working to bring aboutsome explanatory comment upon Stalin&apos;s last message.    Ifhe succeeds this and other factors should help to clear,the ground and enable me to visit Moscow in a few weeks&apos;time.   The object of such a visit would be to do all inmy power to convince Stalin that our co-operation wasloyal and whole-hearted now and would be so after the war.I should be accompanied by military advisers who would be qualified to discuss joint military plans, includingdespatch of British land and air forces to Russia, withinthe&quot;possibilities of time, maintenance and transport.    Ishould of course greatly value your advice and co-operationduring my visit.IMDIV
