(44) 132ndlclusions,mte 3)The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum(W.P, (45) 46) by the Chancellor of the Exchequerreviewing the position regarding the proposals ofthe Bretton Woods Conference for setting up anInternational Monetary Fund and an international bank for Reconstruction and Development.     A message had been sent to Congress by President Roosevelt,covering a financial programme which would includeapproval of both projects.     A Bill was likely to be presented to Congress before the end of January andto be referred to the appropriate committees.     Itwas for consideration in these circumstances whetheropportunity should be given for a further debate inthe House of Commons.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hewas anxious for the guidance of his colleagues.The situation had developed somewhat unexpectedly.He had anticipated that there would be ample timein which to develop our line, but the timing hadbeen altered by the President&apos;s inclusion of a verydirect reference to the Bretton Woods position inhis recent message to Congress.     The appropriateCommittees of Congress would probably begin hearingsearly in February.He felt that the Government here must notexpose themselves to criticism on the ground thatwe had let the position go by default.      If theAdministrations proposals were accepted by Congress,there was the risk that if we did nothing now weshould be accused of having lost the chance of expressing judgment by our failure to consultParliament in the matter, since once Congress hadtaken a decision it would be extremely difficult forus to refuse to conform to it..  There y/as also the risk that if we took no action, it might operate to our disadvantage whenthe Stage III discussions began later in this year,and that we might then be confronted withpropositions much less favourable from our point ofview than those represented by Bretton Woods as acondition- of obtaining the assistance we require frorthe United States in Stage III.The Bretton Woods proposals gave us a freehand during the transitional period of five years(which might be extended), to adopt any policy whichwe regarded as in our interest, however discrimin-explanatory that policy might be.

So far as the transitional period was concerned,we were thus completely safeguarded.--    On the otherhand, without the Bretton Woods arrangements we werenot safeguarded at   all, and the United.States mightwell make considerable demands on us in return for -the help we should require   during the transitional period.What would our position under the Bretton Woodsarrangement he, after the conclusion of the transitional period?     The scheme proposed was thevery reverse of a return to the gold standard.-    Goldonly came into, the matter at all because the&quot; UnitedStates was on the gold standard, and some relationshiphad to be established between sterling and dollars.Under the scheme we should have&apos; the unfettered rightto move the exchange up or down 10%.      If there was a fundamental disequilibrium between our own and other currencies, we should be entitled to make a furtheradjustment.      So far as that further adjustmentrepresented a second adjustment of 10%, the Manager ofthe Fund was pledged to give an answer in a specified period of time, which was a very short one.     beyond total adjustment of 20% (i.e. the original 10% anda subsequent 10%) we were free to make any adjustmentthat v/e thought fit, but if we could not satisfy theManagement of the Fund as to the justification of our action, its facilities could be withdrawn from us.The vital difference between the conception ofthis plan and the arrangements which caused so muchtrouble after the last war was that, under the latter,when the pound slumped in relation to gold, anyadjustment had to be made by a change in our domesticeconomy.     Now, on the other hand, the adjustmentwould he made externally and not internally.    It wasno doubt arguable whether^the Bretton Woods plan infact produced that result^     His own view was that it.did.     .It was an International Fund for levellingtemporary fluctuations, coupled with provision for preventing a scarce economy country from adopting apolicy calculated to aggravate a situation alreadydifficult.He had done his best to apply an unprejudicedjudgment to this highly complicated and importantissue.      In the result, in his judgment, the plan wasone which ought to be recommended to H.M, Government.In the discussion which followed the followingpoints were made:-(1) THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that, despite the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sexplanation, he felt uneasy as to what theposition would be at the end of the transitional period.     He could not seenow how stability in the exchanges, and themaintenance of the internal price levelcould be combined, or how we could hope to insulate our economy under the proposed scheme when faced with unemployment in ourown country and the need to institute oUr^own remedial measures.-&apos;    He quite agreedthat a conflict between sterling and goldexchange would be fatal and that everythingmust be done to avoid it.      But he dislikedthe thought that the management of the Fund

and the decision as to these exchanges adjustmentsover certain limits would rest outside this country,,We must have the right to adjust our own internal economy to meet unemploymenti,(2) The language of the Bretton Woods instrument was -neither explicit nor lucid.     Something was neededthat could be easily.understood by the ordinary.&apos;  public.1    This was important because of  hepossibility of great conflicts in industry overadjustments of wages and conditions.     We must bein a position to say explicitly that nothing in thescheme precluded the community in its own rightfrom adjusting its own economy in its. own interestoNothing short of that would reassure the ordinaryman who had to handle the problem of industrial &quot;adjustment. . -(3) THE MINISTER OP LABOUR suggested that five years wason the short rather than the long side for the -transitional period.      It had taken 8 years to-establish anything like a sound relationship between wages and production after the last war.Other Ministers then expressed their views, generally in supportof the scheme, although some Ministers had anxieties on particular points. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he felt great. sympathy with the point of view put by the Minister of Labour.,He would be very ready to discuss with him, but thought thatin-fact the scheme as it stood did make provision to enable a country to adjust its own economy in its own interest.     he agreed that the wording of the instrument was obscure:    thatwas comprehensible given the circumstances in which it hadbeen drafted.      The letter which he had addressed toMr. Morgenthau had the effect of giving us freedom torecognise the inherent right of a sovereign state to adjustits exchange as it thought fit.      In general the purpose, of the scheme was not to prevent great changes being made,but to even out fluctuations&apos;in exchange.The War Cabinet then discussed the arguments for movinga resolution in the House of Commons on the lines proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer in W.P.(h5)On the one hand it was urged that, as the previous discussion had shown, there was considerable difference oi&apos;opinion inside the War Cabinet as to the soundness of the bretton Woods policy and Our attitude towards it. .   In those circumstances if any resolution was to be moved it should be most cautiously worded,- and in the most general terms, and beso framed and handled as to avoid, so far as possible,committing the Government in any way while giving anopportunity for a general expression of opinion on the broadmerits of the scheme.It was urged, on the other hand, that we were under no obligation to test Parliamentary or public feeling at-thisstage.      The reasons that had been urged in respect, of a verynon-committal -motion were&apos;an argument for avoiding any discussion at all.     However non-committal the resolution,the Government could hardly avoid saying something in debate about their attitude &apos;to so major an issue.     Itcould not reasonably be claimed that we had lagged behind inthis matter.     We had had already, one full discussion onthe broad issue in Parliament, though it was true that was now eight months ago; . while Congress were now to discuss it for the first time.      However little we might like it,

we could not overlook the predominant position of the United-States in the monetary world of today.   The attitude ofUnited States opinion as revealed in discussion in congress and. in&quot;the decision that Congress might take was thereforemost material to us.    if we spoke before the discussions in congress we would risk showing our hand and might find\    ourselves moving towards a position which we could not holdonce the Americans had made Up their minds.    On the other hand,the fact that we had already had a debate absolved us from thecharge of lack of interest or sympathy for a suitablearrangement.After further discussion, THE PRIME MINISTER said thatbalancing the arguments on either side, he thought thatthe general sense of the War Cabinet was that it would bebetter to wait on the United States, and to reserve our judgement pending the outcome of the discussion in Congress.Meanwhile, there was no reason why the Chancellor of theExchequer should not continue to test opinion by informal discussion in such quarters as he thought fit, includinggroups of.Members of Parliament.   He would no doubt also keepin touch with Mr. Morgenthau.   We had already, as had been pointed out, given in debate guarded support and welcome to. the general principles involved in the Bretton Woods discussion,and that sufficiently indicated our attitude of sympathy and interest towards them.    It was clear that there was a good dealof difference of opinion in the War Cabinet as well as outside,and there seemed a good deal of doubt as to the preciseimplications of the scheme.   He did not anticipate difficultyon our part in dealing with any criticism here, but ifnecessary, we could remind the House of the position (i.e.that the matter had already been discussed in Parliament,and had not yet come before Congress) and could undertake tobring it before the House again in the light of developments in the United States,(The War Cabinet -Accepted the Prime Minister1s View.Pices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
