Qthis Docnmm ^ the property of his britannic majesty^ governmentThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of..................S^o^iO!^    ^TOP SECRET Copy No. J.SW.M.&apos;(45) 25rd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2- Confidential Annex(21st February, 1945 - 6.30 p.ra.)S2POLAND * - ^       The War Cabinet had a general discussion about thePolish position.(Previous:Reference: THE PRIME MINISTER said that if the terms of theW.M.(45)12th communique agreed with Premier Stalin were carried out in conclusions, good faith, all would be well, If, on the hand, effectiveMinute 3)       reality were not given to those undertakings, our engagementwould be altered.      It was not the intention of His majesty&apos;s government to cease to recognise the Polish Government inLondon as the legitimate Government of Poland until aGovernment had been set up in Poland on the basiscontemplated in the communique to tide over the period untilfree elections could be held in that country.     Once an election of that nature had been held, our responsibilities to Poland were of course discharged.     There was no questionof failing to honour engagements which we had entered into.His own feeling was that the Russians would honour thedeclaration that had been made, but the acid test of theirsincerity in this matter in the immediate future would be whether any objection would be raised to M. Mikolajczykreturning to Poland.     M. Mikolajczyk was in fact preparedto go back, but if hie return was opposed by the lublin government, that would .be an issue that we must contestiHis was unquestionably the name to command the greatestconfidence in the United Kingdom and in the United States,He (the Prime Minister) had today seen General Anderswho was much concerned about the attitude of his troops inthe light of the decisions that had been taken at the Crimea .Conference.     He had made the very difficult point that heand his troops had sworn allegiance to the Polish Governmentin London.     What, he had asked, was to happen if thatGovernment declined to release him and his troops from theiroath?     He (the Prime Minister) had thought it necessary togive all proper reassurance to General Anders.     He had told him in the first place that in-the immediate future there was an obvious place for his troops in the occupation of germany in the British zone.     General Anders had reacted very well to that.     The Prime Minister had added (and he trusted thatthe War Cabinet would agree) that if in the last resort allfailed and Polish troops in Western Europe, or elements ofthem, felt that they could not return to Poland under the new conditions, they should have the right to booome citizens ofthe British Empire and to receive the treatment accorded toBritish soldiers who had rendered equal service.     The WarCabinet would remember that there were precedents for a degree of special treatment of this nature and that, forinstance, the King&apos;s Own German Legion a century and a half. ago had been settled at Cape Colony, ,and had very many yearslater, rendered signal assistance, to this country.     He had. felt justified in going as far &quot;as he had with General Anderssince he felt the force of General Anders&apos; plea that he mtisthave something to say to his men when he returned to Italy*-1-

.       The following points were taken in discussion:-(a) The wording of .any formal undertaking to implement thestatement which the Prime Minister.had made to General Anderswould need careful consideration.     There was some pressure inthis country for the naturalisation of all aliens who had served in the   British forces.     The Dominions too were closely concerned,  since there was a convention that they should be consulted about any changes&apos; in the basis of British citizenship.Would it not be desirable to warn them at once that thecircumstances that had arisen made it necessary to say something of a reassuring character to the Polish troops who were needed to hold their place in the line about their future, and thatwhile we had every reason to hope that difficulty would notarise over the implementation of the undertakings that had been concluded at the Crimea Conference, the possibility of some difficulty arising could not be wholly excluded?(b) Would it not be desirable to avoid, so far as that might bepossible, any specific reference of a public character, e.g. inthe forthcoming debate, to the steps we would be prepared totake, to deal with members of the polish Armed Forces who mightbe unwilling to return to their country under the new regime?It was important not to say anything that might give the impression that we felt that the undertakings that had been contracted at.the crimea Conference might break down.     Equally, there was the risk that if we committed ourselves publicly at this stage, the lublin government and its supporters- in Poland might be encouraged totake the line that those Poles, who did not sympathise with them andwere now serving abroad, were being looked after by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and that it was unnecessary to pay any undue attentionto their feelings.(c) The financial implications of any commitment to those Polishelements that might not feel able to accept the new regime shouldbe carefully considered before any public commitment was made.There was a difference between maintaining in this country a polish Government, which we recognised as the legitimate Governmentof Poland, and a general financial responsibility for a Government,or those of its nationals who supported it, which we had torecognise.After further discussion THE- PRIME MINISTER said that the precise terms of any statement that might fall to be made as towhat assurance could be given to the Polish troops would, however,need careful consideration.      In the meantime, he agreed that theDominions should be consulted, and that the importance of protecting the position of the Polish Forces which were fighting on our side in Western Europe should, be represented to them.The War Cabinet(1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Dominions, inconsultation with the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security, to settle the terms of a communication,to the Dominion Governments as to their attitudetowards the grant to Polish soldiers who had fought inthe war, and who might find it impossible to return to-   the post-war Poland, of British citizenship, and oftreatment on the same basis as British soldiers who hadrendered- equal service in the. war.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider the financial implications of the situationwhich would arise if we ceased to recognise the PolxahGovernment in London. ,,,

Oomrnuni c a ti on she two.en thepjlisJi Governmentip London andtheir supporters in PolandTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY informed the War Cabinetthat steps had been taicen to interrupt communications between the Polish Government in London and their supporters in Poland while the conversations at -ARGONAUT were in progress.      It had been felt that thePolish Government in London might send messages which,if intercepted by the Russians, would gravelyprejudice the course of negotiations designed tobring about an understanding between the PoliehGovernment in London, the Lublin Government and theU.S.S.R.      The point might, however, be raised in.the debate on the outcome of the Crimea conference that any such interference was inconsistent withour continued recognition as the legitimate Governmentof Poland of the Polish Government in London.   .&apos;the PRIME MINISTER suggested that as we continued   to recognise as the legitimate Governmentof Poland, pending the establishment of the interim government envisaged by the Crimea Conference, the-present Polish Government in London, that Governmentshould, now that the Conference was over, be entitledto all the privileges which would be admissible toa Government recognised by us, subject, however,  tothe operation of the censorship.The War Cabinet -Approved the view stated by the PrimeMinister at fX&apos; and invited theForeign Secretary to issue thenecessary directions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.
