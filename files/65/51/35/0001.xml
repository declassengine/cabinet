(45)16thConclusions &amp;W.M.(45)17thConclusions,Minute 1)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the.Exchequer (W.P.(45) 146) on reparations-and the Dismemberment of Germany.In his Memorandum theset out what were, in his view,of a reparation policy, viz.,Chancellor of thethe indispensableExchequerconditions(i)(ii)(ill)that any supplies necessary to put Germany in aposition to pay reparations should be a first charge on any deliveries taken from her;that permitted imports into Germany should be notmore than enough to secure to the people of germany the bare means of subsistence;that no &quot;once-for-all&quot; deliveries should be taken fromany Zone unless the Allied Control Commission, in,agreement with-the occupying Power, had agreed thattheir removal would not create conditions contraryto the administrative interests of the occupying power;(iv) that an occupying Power should not be expected totake responsibility for securing any reparationsdeliveries beyond what was judged to be within the capacity of its Zone.In addition, the Memorandum urged that nenor stocks should be moved from areas toGermany;    that German labour used outsidereconstruction purposes by any of the Unibe included in the reparation account in&quot;once-for-all&quot; deliveries;    and that it wwhether we should not refrain from undertperiod of occupation of Germany than that four occupying Powers would each and allmake themselves responsible.ither equipmentbe detached fromGermany forted Nations shoulaaddition toas for considerationaking a longerfor which thebe prepared toIn the second part of his Memorandum the Chancellorof the Exchequer raised the question how far such a policyof reparations was compatible with any drastic policy forthe dismemberment of Germany.      In introducing this partof his Memorandum, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that the views of the War Cabinet on the importance of thedecisions to be taken regarding dismemberment and reparations had been brought to the notice of the Crimea conference by the Prime Minister.      He was, however,disturbed about the implications of Russian policy, which apparently sought to combine maximum reparations with themaximum of dismemberment.      He believed that a policy ofdrastic dismemberment of Germany and substantial reductionof her territorial area was largely incompatible with the.policy of drawing large resources from her by way of

reparations,.    The application of a policy of maximum reparation payments to the most productive eirea of Germany under allied control might, if combined with dismemberment, leave a Germany&apos;incapable of independent existence;    and, in particular, might    ,leave this country, which ;would be responsible for the industrialNorth-Western area, in charge of a deficit area, whose conditionwould necessitate imports which we could not afford.&apos;     THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,  whileagreeing that. it was difficult to consider the policies of        &apos; .reparations and of dismemberment in isolation, did not believe-   ythat the two policies would necessarily be found to be mutuallyexclusive.      Some of the problems mentioned in the chancellor&apos;sMemorandum would arise whether or not a policy of dismemberment-was adopted.      In general, it would be undesirable for the WarCabinet to seek to reach conclusions on the wider issues raised in&apos;the Chancellors Memorandum without considering at the sametime the questions, discussed in the related Memorandum onDismemberment (A.P.W..(k5)k1) which he had circulated to-theArmistice and Post-War Committee.      He thought that these two documents should be considered simultaneously, either by theA.P.W. Committee in the first instance or Toy the War Cabinet. .&apos;THE PRTM31 MINISTER suggested that the problems of&apos; .reparations and dismemberment were- not so inextricably linkedishat they&apos; could not profitably be , examined &quot;by separate bodies.He- saw no reason&apos; to call in question the- arrangements agreed atYalta, by which reparations.was to-be considered by a Commissionin Moscow and dismemberment by a. Committee in London.. .  We had been faced with three main problems.     Thefirst,, that of the military zones, had now been settled in,principle, though he felt we should press the Russians for ameasure of uniformity of treatment in the three zones.Secondly, there was the question of dismemberment.The Russians had insistently pressed for this at Yalta.      they attached the greatest importance to it, and the term&quot;dismemberment&quot; now appeared in the instrument of surrender.It certainly raised questions of great difficulty, with a vast --historical background-, and it called for the most careful and prolonged study by experts... .    It might well be that no conclusionwould be reached&apos;on it for a year or so after the militarycollapse of Germany.He had himself always favoured&apos;a plan for isolatingPrussia and aiming at the establishment of a South German State,including Austria and the South German kingdoms, which couldreceive more lenient treatment than Prussia.Thirdly, as regards reparations, we must recognisethat the Russians were equally determined to get everything.theypossibly could out of Germany by way of reparations.      They hadnot had our experience of reparations after the last war .and werr:not. disillusioned about reparations, as we were,.    Moreover,their economy was such that, it could probably absorb more by wayof reparations than ours could.      In any event, we must take itas certain that Russia would press to be allowed to removemachinery and plant from all parts of C-errnany, including Silesiaand the. Ruhr,, in order to re-establish her industrial system which Germany had done so much to destroy&apos;.      In view of thesuf fe rings&apos; and: losses of the,,Russians, he thought that there was&apos;justice in such a claim and that it would be.very difficult to resist.In general, the Prime Minister thought there was aserious risk of confusing the issue if we tried to link up theproblems of reparations too closely with those of dismemberment.He.would certainly be opposed to any disturbance of the arrange-ments already made for the examination of these problems byexpert inter-Allied Committees in London and Moscow.

The. following were the main points made in. further discussion of these questions -(a) It was generally agreed that it would he. necessary to concede Russia&apos;s claim to remove machinery and plant fromGermany in order to re-equip her industries.    &apos; At the same time,two points ought if possible to be safe-guarded.      First, some special protection should be given to territories which wereto be assigned to one or other of the Allies under the peace settlement;    thus, it would be unreasonable&apos; that Russia&quot;shouldbe free to remove a substantial proportion of. the industrial equipment from Silesia before it was handed over to- Poland.Secondlyarrangements ought to be made&apos; to safeguard the.interests of other occupying Powers during the period ofmilitary occupation.      If.the Russians removed machinery from our Zone, they might be required to supply to that Zone food from the surplus areas in eastern Germany.      They could not herelieved of all responsibility for the difficulties which theycreated in the Zone of another occupying Power by the removalof industrial equipment from that Zone, ,(b) Russia proposed to exact reparations, not only in&quot;once-for-all&quot; deliveries, but in annual deliveries over anumber of years.      There were great dangers in accepting a&apos;systemof&apos; annual deliveries of manufactured or consumer goods.&apos;     Itwould help to maintain the German industrial structure and soassist to re-build the German war potential.     Moreover, itmight in the end result in pressure for the provision toGermany, of the machine tools and the finance necessary to enable her to discharge her industrial obligations under a reparationsagreement.      This might lead to a repetition of the loans toGermany which had brought such disastrous consequences after &apos;thelast war.(c) Prom our point of view there would be great advantages in restricting deliveries from Germany to capital goods, and rawmaterials such as timber, potash, etc.      If Russia could be persuaded to forego annual deliveries of manufactured goods,it would be much easier to keep Germany&apos;s industrial developmentwithin limits.(d) It should be a primary object of our reparations policy to secure for ourselves the export markets for manufacturedgoods which. Germany had held before the war.     v&apos;e should keep  ,this objective prominently in mind, in connection both with theremoval of    German machinery and plant and the avoidance of annual deliveries of manufactured goods.-.   (e) Measures for the reduction of Germany&apos;s industrial capacity should,not, however, be carried to a point at whichthey would destroy the German economy, -without hope of recovery.The heavily industrialised areas, which had previously supporteddense population, &quot;could not be wholly stripped of machinery -even though food supplies from other parts of Germany were assured by arrangements on the lines contemplated,at (a) above -without risk of-leaving large populations without any means ofemployment. &apos;  ,It was suggested that these populations could, to someextent, be transformed into less highly industrialised communitiesGermany was a rich and fertile country;    and, when the incentive to build up &apos;la huge war potential had been removed, she. should beable to evolve a balanced economy in which a&apos; larger agriculturecould be combined with a more limited industrial structure.     Thisshould afford for her population a &quot;standard of life which wastolerable, though &quot;below the level of the Allied countries.

(f) While the detailed examination of a possible basis for.dismemberment would take time, there, was a risk that before thatexamination.&apos;was -complete the shape of the future Germany wouldhave been determined by what had happened in the early partof the period of military occupation.      Failure to take in hand;from the moment hostilities ceased, such problems, as customsbarriers, and the retention of a central banking systems might make - it very difficult to introduce at a later stage a,schemeof-  di smerrib e rme,nt.(g) A. decision to set up a South German State which would-receive&apos; treatment more favourable than that accorded to Prussiaand&apos;the North would have a decisive bearing on the policy to befollowed in regard to reparations.(h) The feasibility of any scheme of dismemberment must turn to a certain extent on whether the dismembered States could leadan independent existence of their own. &apos;   That would be radically,affected by the demands made on them for reparationscontributions of equipment, machinery and annual deliveries.The problem of exacting reparations from three or fourGerman States was a different problem from that of exactingreparations from a single German   State.While it was recognised that there could be no.alteration of the procedure agreed at Yalta under whichreparations would be studied in Moscow and dismemberment in-London,  it was generally agreed that the instructions to begiven to our. representatives on both these bodies might with advantage be considered together, so as to ensure consistency inthe general lines of policy advocated on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on each of these two problems.      It was forConsideration whether the A.P.W. Committee should be invitedto consider the problem of reparations policy and reportto the War Cabinet on two alternative hypotheses - (a) a unified Germany and (b) a dismembered Germany.THE PRIMS; MINISTER said that he would consider thewhole question, in the light of the discussion, and would arrange for it to be brought, before the War Cabinet again at an early date.Offices of -the War Cabinet,  S.W.I.
