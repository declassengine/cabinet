W.M.(45) 20TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(16th February, 1945 - 11.30 a.m.)IIMEA CONFERENCEreviousference:M. (45) 18thuclusions,nute 1)At the request of the Deputy PrimeMinister,  THE MINISTER OF WAR TRANSPORT made astatement to the War Cabinet on the negotiations with he had conducted on dry cargo, shipping and oil at the Crimea Conference.DRY CARGOThe Minister of War Transport dealt, inthe first instance, with the problem of drycargo.He had had great difficulty with theUnited States military authorities over theshipping programme.     That was understandablesince so many demands had to be faced.     TheUnited States were sending 370 ships a month to the Mediterranean and North-West Europe,100 were locked up in North-West Europe and80-90 in the Mediterranean,     These were substantial figures;    and the United states authorities were naturally anxious in face ofthem to make sure of their own requirements,more particularly as they felt that they had contributed so materially to the building programme.     Nor had matters been eased by thedifficulty which the War Shipping Administrationfound in standing up to the claims of the war department.In that military requirements could not betabled for the period June to December, therehad been no point in tabling any of our civilrequirements and he had decided to restrictconsideration to the first six months of theyear and to use the figure of 13.2 million tons for that period, agreed in the Washington survey and accepted by the Departments concerned.     Hehad not moved from that figure.     At no time had he mentioned the figure of 26 million tons forthe full year.     30th June had been taken as a date to which the German war would carry on and,on the basis which he had used, v/e had not totake care of what happened afterwards.The Deputy Prime Minister, in the telegram sent tothe Prime Minister (FLEECE 214), had referred to thepossible cut in our import programme of 500,000tons in the interest of liberated areas, which  -had been approved by the Cabinet before he left for ARGONAUT.     He wished to explain that he hadnot at any point referred to the possibility-1-

of auch a cut and that our position in respect of itwas entirely intact.     Any action in respect of it wouldbe domestic to ourselves.&apos;The first objective had been to reduce.the   . -conditions produced by the shortage revealed by the   &quot;War Shipping Survey.    .Both sides had co-operated in securing by various economies a reduction, in the firstinstance, of about a third of those deficiencies.     But-the United States.military authorities had not beenprepared thereafter to consider what military cuts couldbe made, and while our own military authorities had been quite prepared to make Important cuts, no use was seen intabling these unless the United States militaryauthorities would correspondingly table their cuts.That they were not prepared to do.      Their attitude wasthat the first contribution to the necessary economiesshould be by severe cuts in the United Kingdom import programme designed to bring about a reduction in theUnited Kingdom stock level.     Any. such demand had ofcourse been resisted.Discussion had reduced the shortages on our side to about 35 sailings per month, the United Statesshortage being about double that of the British.    &quot; Onour proposal it was then agreed that each country shouldtake responsibility for its own shortages.      In our case35 sailings represented less than 5 per cent of our totalshipping allocations, and the figure was not so serious that it could not be faced, though the narrower the margin on which we had to work the less strong ourposition for dealing with the emergency demands thattended to be made upon us.       On the United States side,the War Shipping Administration were satisfied that theycould deal with the United States shortage by variouseconomies, and they hoped to be in a position, even after their shortage had been met, still to give us certain additional ships to help us.     Even if that expectationwas not realised we must be prepared to take care of ourown shortage ourselves.     Failing a windfall, he thoughtit fair to warn the War Cabinet that it would benecessary to cut various programmes.-     He would revert to this later.The Minister of War Transport added that it shouldbe remembered in this connection that the paper positionin.this- matter of shipping was not- necessarily the realone.     A paper schedule had to be drawn up because ofthe demands that were tabled.     But the United states military authorities tended to fail at short notice totake up shipping which had been assigned to them, andwhich, in consequence, was thrown back into&apos;the pool and-might, to some extent, become available for us.     Thus,on one day in January last, ho ships, to be loaded in14 days, had suddenly become available in this ?/ay.We had accepted them, and had loaded them with thematerial immediately available, though we had been unableto accept a further 10 subsequently offered to us.      Itwent without saying that while we were anxious to use allthe shipping that we could get, very short notice loadingsof this nature were unsatisfactory and tended to throwour own stock position out of balance.As for economies on our side, he felt that hewould have to ask for a cut in the Indian foodpcrainrequirements.      He could not believe.that India would need so much as 70,000 tons a month, and in a-oy event

the shipping for this&quot; would not he available, especially as,  in present circumstances, wheat would have, to comenot from Australia, which was our shortest haul for India, *hut from the U.S.AV and the Argentine.     He thought itwould also he&apos;necessary to cut the programmes of fertilisers and phosphates for the Dominions, South africa and Egyptv     It was relevant that these were allinvestments which would pay a somewhat delayed dividend,while the shipping position over the next few months would he one of acute urgency and shortage.      Greatlyas he would regret having to make the- cuts in question,it was better than having to cut the United kingdom import programme, though he could not exclude thepossibility that even that programme might have to yield, thefigure of 500,000 tons which the Cabinet had been preparedto earmark&quot;in connection with liberated areas, if the worst came to, the worst.His great concern had been to keep the settling ofthese programmes away from the Combined MilitaryTransportation Committee, in which the American militaryauthorities tended to have a voice more dominating than was always to our interest.      So far he had succeeded in^oing so.An agreement on the lines which he had sketched out above had been accepted at the plenary meetings.Thereafter, the Clayton Report on- United Kingdom stockshad been received.     That Report, as the War Cabinet wouldremember, recommended an additional cut in U.K. stocks of up to 1.8 million tons.      It had come as a great shock, foreven Mr. Hopkins, who was so friendly to us, had anticipated that the Report, when received, would be to our interest.     The Prime Minister had been greatly disturbed by its proposals.     The Report arrived too late to betaken into account at ARGONAUT, and he had made that point,and had added that as the Report was based, in any event,on assumptions different from those that had. already been settled at the Conference, no support for its proposals could flow from the Conference decisions.      In those circumstances it could only have been raised in the plenary session and that was generally accepted as undesirable.He had therefore seen Mr. Harry Hopkins, had explained theposition and had secured from him an undertaking (whichhad been given with Mr. Byrnes&apos; full popor*fc) that itshould be set aside. Suppcnt&quot;It was clear, at the same time, that the challenge to our import programme and our stock level was growing inthe United States, both in the political field and in the mind of the public, and that we must be prepared for thepossibility of a very strong attack on both.     Mr. Hopkinswas anxious that we should protect ourselves against this in time.      For this reason it had been agreed that the rejection of the Clayton Report should be coupled with arrangements for a further examination of the position ata higher level, on the U.S. side by Mr, Hopkins and possiblyMr. Byrnes, with Mr. Philip Reed, and on our side by a minister appointed by^ the Cabinet.     When that examination,had taken place in the United Kingdom, those responsible -would return to the United States with a short report, onwhich the President would issue an order designed to stop all further criticism, whether civil or military, ofthe United.Kingdom import programme.      This approach was,in the judgment of those best able to,speak, the only ;chance of achieving our object.     The Prime Minister, after

careful examination, accepted it at ARGONAUT, havingregard particularly to the fact that it was coupled with&apos;the setting aside of the Clayton Report.     He(the Minister of War Transport) attached great value to the proposed enquiry and felt that if it wasconducted, as proposed, by Mr. Harry Hopkins andMr. Philip Reed, who were both well disposed towards us, and had a thorough understanding of our position inthis matter, we should not fear the result.     Above all,it.was essential to silence these challenges of ourstock levels.THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION congratulated theMinister of War Transport on-the result of his negotiations.      He was uneasy, however-, at the thoughtthat the 500,000 tons for liberated areas might beswept away as part of the economies to be secured overthe whole picture.      The position of the liberated areas-was of the first importance from the political and operational point of view;    and assistance to them was an insurance, and in no sense charity.      He was apprehensive that the United States military authorities,who were concentrating on hastening the end of the warin Europe, might-, if the problem was not effectivelytackled now, leave us with a very grave political andeconomic situation in North-Western Europe.     The effectof the loss of the 500,000 tons he had mentioned wouldbe most serious.     Was it the case .that the raw materials for the liberated areas under the national programmes had had to be conceded under these arrangements?     It was difficult as it was to keep up even military supplies for S.H.A.E.F.      He was uneasy at the thought that weshould have the French industrial population unemployed,with all.the political and operational risks which thatwould involve.THE MINISTER- OF WAR TRANSPORT said that theUnited States had had to yield a good deal.     They were ready to agree that the liberated areas should have food and raw materials required to enable them to contribute to war effort or capacity.     But they were not preparedto apply any more generous criterion.      To have got themeven so far was in his view a substantial achievement.Had he not been able to secure this as a basicundertaking it would not have had much significancewhen it came to be worked out.    . Nothing that had passed in the negotiations had in any way weakened our claim,and he felt that it was satisfactory to have consolidatedand buttressed it by its inclusion as a basic under-taking.As regards priorities, the extent of the.&quot;prescribed military requirements&quot; was settled in thefirst instance by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, subjectto approval thereafter by the President and the PrimeMinister.     The effect of the list of basic undertakingswas that so long as the prescribed military operational requirements were not met we could not give liberated areas their supplies save with the prior approval of the combined.Chiefs &quot;of Staff and of the U.K.&apos; and UnitedStates&apos;Governments.     He was, however, determined tomaintain continuous pressure on the Combined Chiefs ofStaff.      The United States were so far unable to load,let alone discharge,ships to anything like the totalof their demands.-Li,-

The shortage of 35 sailings a month to which he had referred would fall.mainly on the military programme and nothing, unless by special authority,&quot; would be borneby-the U.K.  import programme.      He did not exclude thepossibility of supplies for the liberated areas over and .above those covered by the basic undertakings.     He had -had in mind the possibility of a 20 per cent overall cuton the liberated areas which would still leave a good deal.In reply to the MINISTER OP POOD, the MINISTER OPWAR TRANSPORT said that while, as he had already explained,it had been possible, in January last to load ,40 shipsoffered to us for loading in 14 days, such loading was notnecessarily to the best advantage and had temporarilyexhausted the material waiting to be shipped.     Furthermaterial was, however, being worked down and there had beena substantial improvement in the rail x^osition.     Hesuggested, however, that constant watching and followingup would be necessary to ensure that a sufficiency of thematerial consigned to us reached the ports in time for   -loading on the shipping that might become available.oil the Minister of War Transport then informed theWar Cabinet of the progress of the discussion at the crimea Conference over oil.He said that he had been faced with serious difficulties.     The United States who were short of tankershad decided to attack U.K. fuel stocks by way of easingthe oil tanker position.      The United. States negotiatorswere insistent that, in considering stocks,they must work on the TJ,3. practice of daysreserve, and not on the different U.K. method of calculation.      Applying this test, they had calculated on60 days reserves all round, which yielded a total figureof 4,650,000 tons as the maximum stock which we could properly claim to carry.      That was a position which infact we had been contesting for many months past.The United States negotiators took the view that,650,000 tons, or 60 days.reserves, must suffice for us.In view of the importance attached to the point by theUnited States.he had finally agreed to a change in the calculation basis from tons to days, feeling that if &quot;asa result we were able to secure our   desiderata the change was worth it and that it had the advantage of bringingall the countries on to a common basis.     Thereafter theUnited States- negotiators had decided that the combined chiefs of Staff must consult the Combined AdministrativeCommittee in the United States.     The Committee provedunable to reach agreement (possibly because our represent-ative on it had not heard sufficiently early of our readiness to accept the change of basis^ but the referenceto- Washington had been of advantage and: he had been ableto construct a situation for discuss ion with GeneralSomervell.A satisfactory solution had at last been reached,with the help of Admiral Carter, U. s\N.      The days of-reserve agreed under it gave a total of 6,450,000 tons.As our best hopehad been 6 million tons    while we wouldhave been ready i-n certain circumstances to accept5,500,000 under protest-     Jfe felt that- it was extremelysatisfactory that as the outcome of these difficult -negotiations we should have secured so high a figure.

The number of days varied in the case ofdifferent products..    The 60 days originally proposed and agreed for S&quot;HAEF and the War Officeremained at 60;    for the R.A.F. for 100 octanefuel the figure was 65;    for fuel oil 90;    forall other aupplies 90, going u.   to 180 days in thecase of lubricants.     This was satisfactory and, would come under review from time to time for a rise or fallagainst estimated daily requirements.     He thoughthimself that consequent on the discussion we needfear no further challenge on our oil fuel stootcs.Further, he had been able to emphasise the greatimportance of the United Kingdom because of itsgeographical situation as a strategic storageplace for oil, and he thought that&apos; in consequence,quite apart from the minimum stocks--agreed as aresult of the discussions, we might expect the UnitedStates to send us larger quantities of oil for storage here.The United States chiefs of Staff, on returnto Washington, had confirmed these arrangements.Our problem now was how quickly v.e could arrestour present falling stocks, and then to begin tostep up to our new position.      There was inevitablya time lag, and the shortage of tankers made it moredifficult.      By.the end of March our stocks would begetting to a figure approaching 5,000,000 tons, but after that there should be a steady but marked improvement.      We should have to concentrate onbringing about that improvement.THE CHAIRMAN OF THE OIL CONTROL BOARD said thaton the basis of what the Minister of War Transport had just said about the attitude of the United StatesGhiefs of Staff, the results secured and thearrangements^ reached were most satisfactory.The making of the agreement was the first step:    the securing of the oil admissible under it the next.We should fall about a million tons this month.April was probably the critical    month, and it wouldbe necessary to work very hard indeed to turn the corner.      The stock level dispute had been a mosttroublesome one.THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER expressed the warmcongratulations of the War Cabinet to the Minister ofWar Transport on the admirable results he had secured in respect both of dry cargo and of oil, andthanked him for his lucid explanation.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.

(45) 18thonclusions,minute 4)THE LORD PRESIDENT informed the War Cabinetthat subsequent to the Minister of State&apos;sstatement in the House of Commons on Wednesday,14th February, an emergency meeting of ministers had been held to consider reports received from belgium which suggested a probable shortage in supplies of food for that country.     Thosereports had since been confirmed by S.. H.A.2.-F.(which estimated the shortage up to the end ofMarch at 100,000 tons) to the Combined Chiefs ofStaff and the matter had been investigated hereby the Departments concerned and the P.A.O.SIn the result it appeared that while the figure of100,000 tons was probably a marked over-estimate,provision would have to be made for an immediateshortage of some 55,000 tons.     This it was proposed should be met from stocks held on accountof S.H.A.E.F., and without calling on stocks held for the U.K.THE MINISTER OF STATE said that since themeeting of Ministers -.(i) S.H.A.E.F. had assured the BelgianGovernment that they would increase thepresent standard of supplies.     this assurance had been given despite thefact that so far as we knew S.H.A.E.F,might be as much as 100,000 tons shortat the moment, and he did not know howit was proposed to implement the assurance.(ii) The Belgian Government had reduced the rations in Belgium to a figure of 1,400calories per day.     The effect of this,coming as it did immediately after hisown statement in the House, would bevery unfortunate.It seemed clear that S.H.A.E.F., as noworganised, was incompetent to handle the situation.While at the European end S.H.A.E.F. was alive tothe difficulties, -the handling at the United Statesend had been inadequate-.      It was most important that steps should be taken to improve the S.H.A.E.F.machinery and meet this situation, whether by anappeal from the Prime Minister to the Presidentor otherwise. -   As matters stood, we ran the riskof having to carry blame for a disaster for whichin fact we had no responsibility.-1-

In discussionj the following points were made.(a) THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR, &quot;while, fullyendorsing the Minister of State&apos;scriticisms of S.H.A.E.F., was averse from. an approach to the President.     The U.S.supply system was an unsound one, basedon principles contrary to ours, andincapable, he thought, of being properlyintegrated with ours.-     But any suggestionthat the United States machine was.incompetent would produce a hostile reaction, and might set things -backinstead of improving them.     He was al-readyarranging that representatives .of the WarOffice should visit S.H.A.E.P. and&apos;N.W.   &apos;Europe to see the position on the spot andreport.     He thought that there would be advantage in a preliminary review of this nature.(b) THE MINISTER OP LABOUR enquired to what   -extent we could get implements or rawmaterials to liberated areas which would at once assist them to begin to produce,particularly on the agricultural side, andso reduce the amount of supplies for which shipping and manpower had to be providedby this.country.     The Italian ambassador had recently urged on him the case for thesupply of 1,000tractors to Italy.      THEMINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT pointed out theshipping difficulties.      The allocation ofshipping was in the hands of the militaryand independent action on his part would only cause confusion.(c) It was important to &quot;prime the pump&quot;.     Thefirst essential was to help the liberated areas over transportation.     After this had been done, coal could be moved, and used, to generate power and restart industry,xTHE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION.said that we were trying to ship 200 - 300 lorries a week to france  and Belgium&apos;.      Up to now, repairfacilities had been lacking in N.W. Europe.As a result of this, and of the shortage in france of spare parts and tyres,  it hadbeen necessary to recpndition second-handlorries for the liberated areas in&apos; thiscountry, with a consequent drain on shipping and on U.K. manpower.     As a. -    result of arrangements which he had now made, in consultation with the.Minister ofWar Transport, repairs would, within 10-   days ,from now, in future be arranged onthe Continent.(d) It was suggested that, even accepting the argument a.gainst inviting the PrimeMinister to approach the President, othersteps must be taken to deal with thesituation arising out of the incompetenceof the S.H.A.E.P. machine.     Gould we forinstance tactfully arrange-for an enquiry into the machinery of S.H.A.E.F. ; or foran alternative and more effectiveorganisation to be suggested to them in-2-

-terms &quot;to which they could not take   -exception?     We needed a review of theproblem and advice as to its handling.It was politically most important that responsibility for any breakdown should^not be fixed upon us.   - There was. grave --.danger that as matters stood ourreputation would suffer with the liberated areas.After further discussion;&apos; THE DEPUTY PRIMEMINISTER said that there was general- agreement &quot;both as to the need for improving   the situation as quickly as possible, and as to its political and operational importance to us.In addition to the action already initiated by theSecretary of State for War as described in (a) above,there might be advantage in a visit by the Secretaryof State for War himself, if that could be arranged,to review the position and report to the War Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that he would gladly pay an immediate visit, but suggested thathe should, as a preliminary, invite General Galeto this country for discussion.The War Cabinet -Approved the suggestion at &quot;X&quot; and invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange,after discussion here with General Gale,to proceed to North-Y/est Europe with aview to ascertaining,and reporting on theposition.Offices of the war Cahinet, S.W.1.
