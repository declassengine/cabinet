Gousev had againstrongly urged on him that the Lublin Committee must at   attend the San Francisco Conference even though no agreement as to the reconstitution of the PolishGovernment had been reached before the beginningof the Conference.     The Foreign Secretary had;made it clear that in no circumstances would he agreeto this.     M. Gousev had suggested that it wouldhave an unfortunate effect on world opinion ifH.M. Government adopted such an attitude.     Hehad replied that world opinion was more disposed torecognise the London Government than the lublin government.The Foreign Secretary added that it waspossible that, if we stuck to our guns as we proposed, the Russians might decline altogether tobe present at the San Francisco Conference.      Thiswould, of course, be most unfortunate.and would makethe Conference very unreal.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he entirelyagreed with the Foreign Secretary^ line.     If theRussians were not prepared to go to San Francisco,the Conference would have to proceed without them.iOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
