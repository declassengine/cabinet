(k5) 1stConclusions,pinute k)THE PRIME MINISTER said that &quot;beforeParliament met he thought.that the War Cabinet should decide exactly what answer should be givento whatever criticisms were likely to be raised inParliament in regard to the Government&apos;s Greek policy.On the military side, it was clear that by our action we had prevented a massacre.     It was now for the Greek Government which had been established toraise the necessary National Forces.Field Marshal Alexander had submitted a plan for the next stage of the military operations.This included holding Patras and developing a militarycorridor linking Patras with Athens.     The Chiefs ofStaff were now examining this plan.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to theannouncement made by General Scobie on the 6th january to the effect that the terms for a truce offered onthe 12th December were no longer applicable (seeTelegram No. 75 from Athens).     These terms had referred to the rebels retiring beyond the&quot;boundaries of Attica.     As; the E.L.A.S. forces had now left Athens, it was clear that the original termsrequired modification-.     Nevertheless, he thought thatGeneral Scobie ought not to have altered the termswithout prior reference home.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that a telegram had just been received from athens to the effect that two members of E.A.M., whowere not Communists, might join the new Government..He thought that, if this was done it would have a very valuable effect and he would like to reply at onceencouraging this move.1 This suggestion was approved.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY also referred to thepolitical appreciation of the situation, which had beenreceived that morning (Telegram No. 86 from Athens);This telegram said that the Greek Government proposedto make, an announcement of policy shortly, and would consult us before publication, and outlined the main

points which might &quot;be. included ,in such a declaration.The Foreign Secretary said that he thoughtthat the programme outlined was very favourable andwould have&quot;a very good effect.      It would clearly be ofgreat&apos; advantage if the proposed declaration could bemade before the meeting of Parliament.     Among thepoints included in the declaration was that a plebiscite and general election   would be held as soonas conditions made it possible, and that communal andlocal elections would, be held in parts of the country as and when cleared from insurgents.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was strongly in favour of the latter suggestion.      There might be something to.be said for a number of Members ofParliament, selected from all Parties, going out fromthis country to Greece, in order to see for themselves that the elections were being fairly held.As regards the announcement of policy proposed, THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would prefer to examine the matter in consultation with theForeign Secretary before a decision was reached.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.

(44) 171stConclusions,minute 1 )The War Cabinet had before them:-(i) ANote by the Prime Minister (W.P.(45) 4)to which was attached a copy of a letter dated 29th December, 1944* from King-Peter II -of Yugoslavia to the Prime Ministerexplaining the difficulties which he felt in accepting the advice which had beengiven to him on behalf of H.M. Governmentthat he should accept the Subasic-Titoagreements regarding the Regency council,the composition of the future Governmentand the elections of the ConstituentAssembly,,. (ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (W.P. (45) 13) agreeing-   that King Peter&apos;s letter of 29th Decembercontained a fair statement of the criticismswhich could reasonably be levelled at theagreement from his point of view, butpointing out that those criticisms,  thoughwell argued, were irrelevant to the main problem and did not take into consideration the realities of the situation. Acceptanceof the agreement as it now stood was theKing&apos;s best chance of preserving the monarchy and his own position,  given the&apos; dominant situation which Marshal Tito had achieved in Yugoslavia.      Subject to theWar Cabinet5s approval the Foreign secretary proposed that he and the Prime minister should see King Peter immediately and urgeupon him the desirability in his own interests and those of his country as awhole of accepting the Subasic-Titoagreement forthwith.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the case for advising the King to take the action proposed in w.P. (45) 13.was briefly,  that this was the only course that appeared to offer him any-chance ofregaining his position in Yugoslavia.      The arrange-ment in view would keep in being the framework ofthe Royal Yugoslav Government, with Marshal Titoas its Prime Minister,    It might well be that if,after an interval. Marshal Tito-found it not so easy to impose a Communist regime on Yugoslavia,  the fact --1-

ilthat the form of monarchcal government had beenpreserved, would improve the King&apos;s prospects.The wise course for His Majesty in these circumstances-was to accept the agreement, and to declare at thesame time that he accepted the assurances&apos;given init in&apos; the hope that they would, be so fulfilled as toenable his people to make a free-and democratic choice of their future government, and that in accepting themin this spirit he hoped to make his best contributionto the welfare of his people and State..     he understood that M. Subasic hoped to persuadeMarshal Tito to agree that persons who had previously been elected to the Yugoslav Parliament should beinvited to sit in the proposed Constituent Assembly.THE PfilUB MINISTER said that the realities     . -of the situation must be, faced.     He could see no alternative to the course of action proposed.     Thethree Regents to be appointed were respectableelderly men with university backgrounds and were notCommunists.      It must be remembered that thefunctions which fell to the King under the YugoslavConstitution were strictly defined, and that even ifKing Peter- were now to return to that country, he.would have to act on the advice of Marshal Tito andhis Ministers.      He proposed,  subject to the WarCabinet&apos;s approval,  that he and the Foreign secretary should see King Peter tomorrow, and advise him toaccept the agreement forthwith.The War Cabinet -Approved the course of action proposed in w.P. (i+5) 13 and invited the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary to discuss thematter with King Peter on the lines proposed therein.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.-2-
