MINUTE confidential Annex(8th March, 1945 - 6.0 p.m.)UMANIA(previous reference:.1.04-5) 26thonclusions,minute 5)THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Radescu, onthe fall of his Government, had sought sanctuary inthe British Legation at Bucharest.     The british representative had reported that there was apossibility that the new Prime Minister, .M. Groza,had issued instructions for M. Radescu to he removed from the Legation, alive or dead.     The british representative and Air Vice-Marshal Stevenson wereresolved to resist any such attempt, and had atfirst indicated that they would offer resistanceshort of opening fire.     Later, they had reportedthat they intended to open fire if it became necessary in.the last resort.The Prime Minister proposed that the british representative should be informed that he was authorised to open fire in the last resort if thiscourse proved necessary in order to prevent theRumanians from removing M. Radescu forcibly from theLegation.      If, as was proposed, the Rumanianmilitary authorities in Bucharest were warned inadvance that we were prepared to take this course inthe last resort, he thought it unlikely that the attempt would be made to remove M. Radescu.by force.This proposal met with the general approval ofthe War Cabinet.Discussion then turned on the question whetherthe Russian Government in Moscow should be informed,either through the diplomatic channel or by a personal communication from the Prime Minister to marshal Stalin, that the British representative hadbeen-authorised.to open fire in the last resort inorder to prevent M. Radescu from being removed by force from the Legation.     On this point, the view ofthe War Cabinet was that, as there was no definite evidence that the new Rumanian Government intendedto make this attempt, it would be. enough if theForeign Secretary told H.M. Ambassador in Moscow,for his own information, of the authority given tothe British representative in Bucharest.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1
