THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.................TOP SECRET Copy No.W.M.(k5)  1 ST CONCLUSIONS,, MINUTE 6Confidential Annex.(2nd January, 19U5 - 5.30 p.ra.)FOREIGN AFFAIRSGreece(previous reference:W.M.(W) 176thConclusions,Minute 1)THE FOREIGN.SECRETARY informed the WarCabinet of the latest developments in the Greeksituation.     The Archbishop was seeing party leaders and had invited General Plastiras toserve as Prime Minister.     The General had,however, been very reluctant to accept on theground that he was-a soldier and knew nothing-of politics, but the Regent had not lost hope ofsecuring him.Meanwhile, however, there had been a very embarrassing occurrence.-    As the War cabinet were aware (W.M.(i4-^) 176th Conclusions, Minute 1)he and the Prime Minister, in deference to the earnest request of the King of Greece, had given him, for his private and confidential record andon the understanding that it would not be trans-mitted to Athens or published, a note (which theForeign Secretary read to the War Cabinet) of theirimpressions of the attitude of the Archbishop on,various points.      It now appeared that -His Majestyhad telegraphed to M. Papandreou a version of this document which was inaccurate in materialparticulars and had asked him to communicate it tothe political leaders.-     M. Papandreou had done so and the text of the King&apos;s telegram had appeared in the Greek press on the morning of 1st January.The effect was, of course, gravely to embarrass the Archbishop in his task of forming a Government...The most important respects in which the document was inaccurate was that it stated thatthe Archbishop did not intend to allow E.A.M.to be represented in the new Government, and thatthe Regent would be in close contact with&apos;the king and would lend a willing ear to his directives.There was no foundation for either statement.The document handed to the King had made it clearthat we could not in any way commit the Archbishopas regards policy.THE PRIME MINISTER said, that he took aserious view of what had happened.     Not onlywas the message to M. Papandreou a garbled .version of the note given to the King, which might&apos; cause serious misunderstanding in this country and in theU.S.A. as well as in Greece, but the disclosureWas   a clear breach of the understanding on whichit was given to His Majesty.      It would benecessary to make clear to the King our view ofhis action in releasing it, and to v/arn him thatif, as might be- anticipated, the question was raised in Parliament, we should have to explain

that the statement he had communicated to M. Papandreouwas not factually accurate, and that His Majesty had promised on his kingly honour to make no transmissionon this subject and to treat the paper handed to him as for his personal record only.Steps should now be taken effectively to control the transmission of messages by the King through theGreek Embassy in London.      It was essential too thatthe Archbishop should be informed of the true facts ofthe case, and be given, for his personal information,the text of the original document handed to the King.He might be authorised to inform Party Leaders that hehad received an account of the interview, agreed atthe time by both parties, and that the record did not agree with the statement published by the King(authority.The Archbishop was, of course, in no way committed by anything in the statement agreed with theKing, which was in no way binding upon him.The following points were made in discuss ion:-(a) Our settled policy was to leave Greece assoon as circumstances made that possible.It was, however, important that we should do what we could to assist to arm theforces to be raised to support the Regent.(b) THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that any facilities that M. Papandreou might desireto go to Cairo should be provided.      Hehad, after all, done his best to deal witha situation which had in fact proveduncontrollable.      The War Cabinet agreed.After further discussion THE FOREIGN SECRETARYread to the War Cabinet the draft of a telegram toMr. Leeper on the lines suggested at &quot;X&quot;.The War Cabinet -(l).Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement and approved the issue of thedraft telegram.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make representations to the King of Greece onthe lines suggested at &quot;Y&quot;.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider how best to control the despatch of telegrams by His Majesty through the GreekEmbassy in London.Poland.(previous reference:W.M. (UU) 176thConclusions,Minute 1)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY informed the War Cabinetthat he was disturbed at the extent to which the LublinPoles were opening their mouths.      It was satisfactorythat British and American policy in this matter was so closely in line.      The President&apos;s recent message(No. 68U of 30th December) to Premier Stalin had beenwholly satisfactory to us, and Mr. Stettinius had recently, made a,helpful statement in this connection.The War Cabinet took noteSecretary&apos;s statement.of the ForeignOffices of the War Cab. . *i vi om JL UO \J f1 .
