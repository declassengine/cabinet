He added that a greatchange had taken place in the military set-up sinceGeneral Wedermeyer had taken over command.-General Stilwell- had tended to concentrate on burma to the disadvantage of South-East China, but thebalance was now being redressed.      It was most satisfactory that the threat to Kung-ming haddisappeared, at any rate temporarily, since he feltthat its capture would inevitably lead to the disintegration of China,  since it would effectivelycut the air supply route.     He thought that the explanation of the Japanese withdrawal was that theyhad over-reached themselves.      It looked as if theyhad for the moment dropped the idea of going forKung-ming and were aiming at keeping a corridor opento get supplies up from Indo-China and Burma.     Theywere very dependent on both those countries for rice.They were also dependent on supplies of antimony andphosphorus, from the areas under their control.      Thepossibility of a renewal of their advance towardsKung-ming could not, of course, be excluded, and he saw little prospect in that event of the chinese troops now in China putting up an effective resistance.On the other hand, the two Divisions that were being withdrawn from Burma might well put up a fight^ andif they did it might change the whole picture.General Carton de Wiart added that in his judgment the Chinese soldier was first-class.     the weakness lay in the officers and in the High Command.It was possible that the new Minister of War, who wasa man of much activity, might improve things, but hethought that it would take time.On the political side there was a generaldisposition to suggest that the Generalissimo waslosing power, but General Carton de Wiart did notshare that view.      Given the Generalissimo&apos;s position,he saw no possibility of any change until circumstancesthrew up a man who was strong enough to upset theGeneralimssimo and he did not in present circumstancessee any such man.On the economic side, he was inclined to thinkthat reports of starvation, so far at any rate as- theChinese troops were concerned, were exaggerated...&quot; .&apos; i. - .In conclusion, General Carton de Wiart brieflyinformed the War Cabinet of the circumstances attending the recent relief of General Stilwell.THE PRIME MINISTER,   on behalf of the WarCabinet, warmly thanked General Carton de. Wiart forhis interesting statement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S..W.1

The Foreign Secretary added that he-had pointedout to King Peter that the last paragraphs of his statement to the Press were most unfortunate and might expose himto a sharp reply from the Russians.      The last way to make contact with Premier Stalin was to put out in this manner,in a statement to the Press, that the King wished to see him.After discussion, THE PRIME MINISTER said that hewas clear that the general sense of the War Cabinet wasthat King Peter&apos;s action had been most ill-considered andunfortunate.      We could take no responsibility for it.It was, on the other hand, very important If possible tomaintain the Subasic-Tito Agreement and in particular theprovisions contained in it for free elections, etc.    Moreover,we must be at pains to avoid any impression in the minds ofthe Russians or of Marshal Tito that we had been privy toKing Peter&apos;s action in issuing  this statement.In these circumstances he suggested that we should at once telegraph to Premier Stalin and to Marshal Titoexplaining what had happened, adding that we did notthink that the action the King had taken, without consult-ation with, or advice from, his Prime Minister, constituted a legal or binding decision;    and in these circumstances wewere prepared to support Marshal Tito and M. Subasic insetting up a Government on the basis contemplated by theAgreement;    to take as granted the King&apos;s approval of theAgreement, and to treat the views expressed byHis Majesty in his statement as null and void.    IfMarshal Tito agreed, we would be prepared to grantrecognition on the basis of the Agreement to the Governmentformed by him and M. Subasic under its provisions, andwould be ready to exchange Ambassadors on the same basis.It would, of course, be open to the Government so formedto appoint a Regency if they desired, and in that event the Ambassadors, if appointed, would be accredited to theRegents.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY suggested that it would bedesirable to carry the United States with us in thismatter, and that the proposed telegram should be repeated to President Roosevelt and should be so worded as to makeit clear that while he would be ready to act in the senseindicated if this was accepted by Marshal Tito andM. Subasic, we should of course have to consult theUnited States.Government.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he hadbeen giving the recognised Government of Yugoslavia inLondon moderate amounts of money ( 250,000 at a time) forsome little time past at the request of the Foreign Office,on the understanding that these amounts would be adjustedin due course against the gold held by the yugoslav government.    In the light of these latest developmentshe would, of course, put an end to these supplies.The War Cabinet -Approved the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal and invited him to settle with the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs the terms of telegrams in the sense proposed.

leecereviousif erence:(:L(ll5) 2ndlusions,te 5)\THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had seena statement in the press that, following on the resolution passed at the conference of thelS-eeiai-iB^ Party &quot;deeplyregretting&quot; the situation in Greece and calling upon the British Government to take steps towards an armistice, he would he asked to receive a deputationheaded by Mr. Arthur Greenwood, M.P. , including-Mr. Harold Laski, Mr. J. Griffiths, M.P. andMr. Aneurin Bevin, M.P.The Prime Minister said that as the positionin Greece would be debated in Parliament soon after it had re-assembled, he doubted whether it would be ofadvantage that he should receive a deputation beforethe debate took place.    He agreed, however, that thematter should he further discussed when the request for a deputation had been received.Reference was made to the great improvement inthe situation in Greece, and in particular to the factthat certain of the organisations which had formed partof E.A.M. were now withdrawing from it.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had already sent a telegram to Greece, emphasising the importanceof seizing the present favourable opportunity to reach a settlement which would put an end to hostilities.Nevertheless? he was a little anxious lest our representatives in Greece might lose this   opportunityof reaching a settlement through attempting to securetoo much;    more especially since it was clear that wecould obtain terms far more&apos; favourable than thosepublished in December.The War Cabinet -Agreed that the Foreign Secretary shoulddespatch a short telegram that night,emphasising the importance of not missingthis opportunity of ohtaining a settlement,provided that reasonable and sat isf actor^rterms could be obtained.ffices of the War Cahinet, S.W.I.Q

APPENDIXPRESS COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY KING PETER II OF JUGOSLAVIAThe Chancellery of the Royal Jugoslav Court, in connectionwith the present Jugoslav situation, has issued the followingcommunique:King Peter II of Jugoslavia has closely studied thedraft agreement prepared by Dr.-Subasic, Prime Minister of theRoyal Jugoslav Government, and by Marshal Tito, President ofthe National Liberation Movement of Jugoslavia, for a solutionof pending problems.     Faithful to the democratic traditions.of his forefathers, King Peter II approves the basic proposalslaid down in the draft agreement and its amendments, whereby the future constitution and the form of Government of his country shall be determined solely by the free decision of the &apos;.peoples of Jugoslavia.      The King will accept such a decision,but, as a Constitutional Monarch, it is his sacred duty to seeto it that the people shall be consulted and their freelyexpressed will given full respect.      The King of Jugoslaviawholeheartedly welcomes the interest with which the GreatAllied Nations envisage the reorganisation of post-war europe on the basis of the freely recorded will of its peoples.     he fully agrees with their established policy that the widest possible grouping of democratic parties and movements from the left to the Sight, is the only guarantee of a really free expression of the popular will.      He is deeply convinced thatthe same path must be followed in his own country, and evenmore so than in other- countries, where the population is morehomogeneous.In consequence His Majesty has raised two essentialobjections to the agreement in its present form.     The firstconcerns the suggested formation of the Regency, and thesecond the provisions &quot;of Article 2 of the Amendment by whichthe Anti-Fascist&apos;Council of National Liberation would wieldunrestricted legislative power until the Constituent Assemblyhad finished its work.      This suggests a transfer of power in Jugoslavia to a single political group.     King Peterbelieves, on the contrary,  that the setting up of an all-party Government comprising every political movement would furnish the sole valid guarantee for a new and better future,in the country to. which he hopes shortly to return. King Peter,who brought his country into this war on the side of theGreat Allies, like the whole population of Jugoslavia, has followed with the keenest,sympathy and admiration the magnificentprowess of the Russian armies under Marshal Stalin.    Fraternitywith Russia is the basic sentiment of the Slav peoples, andthe King would welcome an opportunity to confer directly with marshal Stalin whose name has meant so much to the people intheir heroic resistance.London, 11th January, 1945.Note; The above is the version of the communiquewhich was issued to the American Press and given &quot;to the Foreign Secretary.    In the version givemto the British Press, the word &quot;form&quot; was *i. 0 substituted for the word &quot;formation&quot; in the thirdline of the third paragraph.
