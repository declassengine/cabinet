MINUTE confidential Annex(26TH JANUARY,  1945 - 12.30 p.m.)POLAND^(previous reference:W.M. (45) 7thConclusions,Minute 4)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(W.P.(45) 48) by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on the Western Frontier of Poland.     TheMemorandum reviewed the undertakings given to thePolish Government in the past in regard to theirWestern Frontiers, and recorded that they had beengiven as part of our endeavours to induce the PolishGovernment to accept the Curzon Line as the basis ofa settlement with Soviet Russia in the East.If, as now seemed more probable, we had to dealwith the claims of the Lublin Poles who were readyto accept the Curzon Line anyhow, there was no longer any need for H.M. Government to support any more extensive transfers of territory than we thoughtconvenient and proper on other grounds.The present indications were that the LublinPoles were anxious that the frontier should follow the line of the River Oder up to the Gttrlitzer Neisse(the more westerly of two tributaries of this name).While we should not commit ourselves in sucha way as to prejudge the future settlement, theMemorandum suggested that the time had come to make clear to our principal Allies that we had doubts onthe subject and must not be regarded as committed the support of any annexation by Poland beyond thoseof East Prussia, Danzig and the Oppeln District.Our line might be that H.M. Government must notbe considered as having accepted any definite lineas a Western Frontier of Poland;   but v/e consideredthat the matter, affecting as it did   other aspectsof long-term policy towards Germany, was a suitableone for examination by the European advisory commission.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had thoughtit would be of assistance to the Cabinet to have a review both of our commitments and of the arguments for and against the claims now being put forward bythe Lublin Poles and the general handling of thequestion of Poland&apos;s Western frontiers.      It was not quite clear whether the River Neisse referred t-o bythe Lublin Poles was the Eastern or the Western Neisse,If it was the Wes&apos;tern, the effect would be to givePoland practically the whole of Silesia;    if theEastern, a little more of the Oder Valley.      In theformer case, an additional 3 million Germans wouldhave to be reckoned with.     The Foreign Office feltthat it would-be a very heavy strain on Poland toaccept this additional burden, and a frontierrepresented by the Western Neisse would go far beyond any commitment which had&apos; ever been made either by thePrime Minister or&quot;by himself.-1-

&quot;A&quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that he entirely agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view that we should oppose a western Neisse boundary.      It would he no small matter toarrange for the removal of 5 to 6 million Germans from the territories which we were in any event prepared to seePoland acquire if she so desired.     But a total figureof 8 or 9 millions would, in his judgment, he quiteunmanageable.     Nor could we be certain that the reducedGermany, would be able to absorb so large a figure.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theForeign Secretary and agreed with the view expressed by the Prime Minister at &quot;A&quot;.iiY&quot;A discussion followed on the general Polish position.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it must be expected, now that the Germans had been practically driven out of thewhole of Poland, that the Lublin Committee, with theRussian Government behind them, would grow very rapidly in power.     He anticipated that the soviet representatives at the forthcoming meetings of Heads of Governments would demand the recognition&apos; of the Lublin Committee as theGovernment of Poland,     We must bear in mind that recognition was the one counter which&apos;remained in our hands, and that we should not give it up save in &quot;returnfor something worth having.      In general, our attitude would;.be,  if the War Cabinet approved, to continue toadvise the Poles to compromise as regards the eastern frontier, and to remain adament on the question of ensuring a free, sovereign and independent Poland, coupled with arrangements for free elections,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY expressed his agreement withthe Prime Minister&apos;s view.      The Soviet Government had the chance, now that Poland had been so largely liberated, tomake the Lublin Committee much more representative and tobring in personalities such as M. Mikolajczyk and M. Witos.It. was important that the parts of Western Poland now.being liberated were the least anti-Russian and the mostanti-German.     He hoped himself to see 3/1. Mikolajczykagain this afternoon.      He was not seeing the PolishGovernment in London but was arranging that they should beseen by Sir Alexander Cadogan..THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITYsaid that there was much sympathy for the Poles in all parties.     They were very popular in this country, andthere was a good deal of feeling that the Russian attitudetowards them had been very harsh and imperialistic.     he hoped we would be able to protect the Underground Army in poland against persecution.The War Cabinet took note of the statements by thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, and approved the general line proposed by the PrimeMinister at &quot;Y&quot;.Offices of the War Cabinet,.S.W.1.
