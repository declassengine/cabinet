(45)  25TH CONCLUSIONS., MINUTE confidential Annex(26th February/ 1945 - 5.30 p.m.)SINKING OF a japanese C OAS TEH..  THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe Prime. Minister felt, in view of the possibilityof difficulty arising at a later stage,  that thecircumstances attending the recent sinking of a japanese coaster by one of our submarines shouldbe brought to the notice of the War Cabinet.The Captain of one of our submarines, aR.N.R.  officer with a very distinguished record,had reported that, in a recent cruise, he had sunk coaster of some 350 tons loaded with drums andtins of oil which were clearly intended for enemyuse.     He had fired 67 rounds at the coaster, ofwhich 40 had hit her, though without setting heron fire.      She had then been boarded in shallowwater, when some 50 men had jumped overboard andswum to shore.     About eight women and childrenwere, however,&quot; still seen to be on board.      Theboarding party were unable to persuade them toleave the coaster and proceeded to lay in. the usualway a demolition charge for sinking the vessel.    Onthe boarding party returning to the ship, the captain learned that there were substantially morethan eight women and children on board.      It wasthen too late to return and remove the demolitioncharge.      The submarine was in shallow water,within range of the shore and exposed to attack from the air.The Commander of the submarine flotilla on receiving the report considered that the commander of the submarine had been wrong in the action whichhe had taken.      That officer had, however, an excellent record, and though the flotilla Commanderthought that he had made an error in this matter,he felt that, given opportunity, he would redeem it.. Unfortunately the flotilla Commander had sent acopy of this report in the normal circulation tothe Senior United States Naval Officer.      TheBritish Naval Commander-in-Chief, disagreeingwith the flotilla Commander, had caused theCommander of the submarine to be relieved of his command and sent home, and but for the embarrassingconsequences of publicity, would have ordereda court-martial.-1-

The First Lord said that, given the greatdifficulty of the position in which this Officer was .placed, the fact that it would have been open to himto have sunk the ship with gunfire, in which circum-stances no question would have arisen, and thedifficulty of the judgment which he was called on tomake at the shortest notice and in ignorance of thelarge pa-rty of women and children aboard, he felthimself that he had been sufficiently punished by being relieved of his command and that no furtherspecial action was called for.   . There had &quot;been no complaint so far from the Japanese, and he had receiveda signal from the Oommander-in-Chief, East Indies, thatthere were no repercussions from the United States Forces.THE FIRST SEA LORD hoped that the,. War. cabinet would realise the conditions under which our submarinesoperated in&apos;the Far East .off enemy coasts, in veryshallow water close to the shore, and under threat from aircraft.      This particular submarine had been three times attacked from the air during the patrol in question.There was no time for an officer to form a nice judgment.One of the reasons for placing the demolition charge would, he thought, have been that, this would probablyhasten getting the women and:children over the side.In a case of this nature considerations of humanityhad to be balanced against the assistance ?/hich the cargo being carried would represent to the enemy.Moreover, &apos; as he understood it, the demolition charge,was the ordinary sinking charge, probably placed in the engine room, and there was nothing to prevent the women and children from reconsidering their decision and leaving the ship.     Had he attacked her from submergedand sunk her by torpedo, even though he had seen women and children on board, no question would have been raised.     He felt himself-that this officer had been sufficiently punished by being removed from his command and that further action was not called for. &apos;After discussion,  the War Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the FirstLord of the Admiralty and endorsed theview of the matter referred to at &quot;X&quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,
