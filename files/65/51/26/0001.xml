(45) 25thonclusions,minute 3)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs informed the War Cabinet that a telegram just received from Sir Archibald Clark Kerr reportedthat he and the United States Ambassador had hada very unsatisfactory discussion of three hourswith M; Molotov on the re-organisation of thepresent Polish Government.     M. Molotov had refused to abandon his claim that, under the termsof the Yalta communique, which provided for consultation &quot;in the first instance in Moscow with members of the present Provisional Government andwith other Polish democratic leaders from withinPoland and from abroad&quot;, the Warsaw Roles must be heard first since it was their Government that wasto be reorganised, and had pressed that theCommission must be sure of democratic sentiment inrespect of all nominees for the Governmentsproposed to be reconstituted before summoning them.He had finally, despite the opposition of the twoAmbassadors, asked them to suggest to their governments that as a beginning, and withoutprejudice to further invitations, the commission should call on M. Bierut and his two colleagues,- plus two of the Poles from London (M. Grabski andMo Zeligowski) and two from Poland (M. Kutrzeba andone of the Bierut nominees) about whom he claimed that we had none of us any doubts.      It had furtheremerged from the discussion that M. Molotov was going to make a determined effort to excludeM. Mikolajczyk.The Ambassadors had made it clear that weon our side were determined to includeM. Mikolajczyk, and after&quot; further discussion of poles from Poland had offered M. Molotov the wholeof M. Bierufs list of nominees in exchange for ourfive..     He had not been prepared to accept this,and on his insistence the Ambassadors had finally agreed to put his proposal to their respective governments, while warning him that they were-sure that it would be rejected.A further telegram from the Ambassador wasawaited, but the position was disturbing.     he felt that we must reject the Russian proposal and insist on the nominees being fully represent-ative and on all our own choices being invited.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that there was much feeling in labour circles over Poland.     Hesuggested that M. Molotov, and not Marshal Stalin,might be responsible.for these proposals.-1-

THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had been fullyentitled to take the line we had in the debate on the crimea conference since we were bound to assume thegood faith of an Ally in the execution of an     ^Agreement so recently signed.     If, however, it became clear that the Russians were not going tocarry out the conditions to which we had agreed, it.would be necessary to give the full story toParliament.     We could not run any risk.of a suggestionthat Parliament, in which feeling on this matter was strong in all parties,, had been deceived.     Subjectto-the further telegram awaited from Sir A. Clark-Kerr,he agreed that we must make it clear to the Russiansthat we could not agree to these proposals.     We were,however, entitled to expect the full support of theU,S.A, in doing so, and must carry them with us;    for we could do no more to help the Poles than the UnitedStates would help us to.     If Marshal Stalin was infact behind these proposals, he might modify his attitude if, after consultation with the U.S.Government, we warned him that, if they were pressed,we should have to explain the position to parliament and admit with great regret that the Yalta agreement had failed.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFARISinformed the War Cabinet that a telegram had just beenreceived from Air Vice Marshal Stevenson, who wasHead of the British element in the Rumanian control commission, indicating that he might at any time be faced with a request from King Michael and the QueenMother for sanctuary in the British Embassy, and asking for instructions.     The Foreign Secretary saidthat he was greatly concerned at the way in which theRussians had been handling the Rumanian position andby the revelation of their attitude which it:represented.     The King&apos;s standing in the country hadbeen good, and he had handled the situation withcaution.     Were he now to be driven to take refuge in face of-pressure by our Ally, the effect on publicopinion and on Anglo-Russian relations might be very-awkward.      He thought in any event that, as we hadalready been asked to give shelter to General Radescu,the United States Embassy might shelter the King andthe Queen Mother if the necessity arose. / The Rumaniap/    &quot;The Roumanian position was a difficult one,since under the arrangement that had been made between Marshal Stalin and ourselves we were to .take the lead in Greece, an undertaking whichhad been fully honoured by the Russians, whilethe Russians in return were to take the lead(subject to our presence and that of the UnitedStates on the Control-Commission) in Roumania.&quot;Stal indirect.   - The Rumanian position had not beendis^cuBsed with him at Yalta, since it was so largely .c^ovorod by the understanding mentioned above.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the existence of; the understanding mentioned by the Foreign Secretaryto some extent tied our hands, particularly as theRussians had so strictly observed their part of the

&quot;bargain in respect of Greece.     He agreed also as tothe unfortunate effects on Anglo-Russian relations ofthe King and the Queen Mother having to seek forsanctuary.     He felt, however, that the United states should be asked to share the burden of giving sanctuary,and he would be very ready to telegraph a statementof the position to the President..    He invited theForeign Secretary to give him some suggestions as tothe lines on which he might telegraph to Marshal Stalin.His message might be to the effect that we fully recognised that it had been agreed that Rumania should fall in the Russian sphere and Greece in ours;    thatthat understanding had been fully respected &quot;by theRussians in the case of Greece;    that in that country the communists were now back in- Athens and that we had no intention of allowing General Piastiras (with whom, thePrime Minister said, he trusted we would now take astrong line) to establish a Right.Wing dictatorship.;that Marshal Stalin was at liberty to send observers tosee how the situation v/as developing, and that every consideration should be given to them;   but that hegreatly hoped that, given the possible effect on Anglo-Russian relations, further consideration would be givento the situation in Rumania.    &quot;It would, he thought, befor consideration whether the Yalta declaration onliberated territories could he construed as supersedingprevious independent arrangements such as that inrespect of Rumania and Greece which had been made ata time when we could not rely on United states assistance.Meanwhile, however, he thought that Air Vice&quot;&quot;Marshal Stevenson should be informed that sanctuaryshould if necessary be given to the King and the Queen-Mother, but that we thought it desirable that theUnited States should help to carry this burden, andthat he should make a suggestion in that sense, if thesituation arose, to his United States colleague.The Foreign Secretary undertook to prepare a draft telegram to Marshal Stalin for the Prime Ministersconsideration.The War Cabinet -Approved the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion at&quot;X&quot; and invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to arrange for the necessary instructions to be issued.Offices of the War Cabinet, &apos;s.w.1.
