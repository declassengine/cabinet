(45)  5TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(12th January, 1945 - 3.0 p.m,)REECEPreviousReference JW.M. (45) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)The War Cabinet considered the position whichhad arisen consequent on the truce concluded between general Scobie and E.L.A.S.* with particular referenceto the fact that the truce did not provide for thereturn of the hostages taken by&apos;E.L.A, S.      PromMr. Leeper?s reports (Athens telegrams 150-156 of12th&apos;January) it appeared that E.L.A.8.  had beenwholly uncompromising as regards the hostages, andthat the British negotiators had finally decidedthat the truce could not be allowed to break down on this issue.      The Regent and General Plastirashad been gravely concerned at the omission of provision for the return of the hostages, but after discussion \vith Mr. Leeper and General Scobie theRegent had finally informed the E.L.A. S. representatives that he had been informed of the terms of the truce,that he was profoundly shocked at their refusal to release the hostages, but that if the E.L.A.:S. central committee felt that they could assist in the  ee-establishment of law and order, such as should exist in a civilised state under the rule of law, he would readily facilitate a meeting between them and representatives of the Greek Government.THE PRIME MINISTER reviewed the telegramsexchanged with our representatives in Athens.      the taking of hostages was. a barbarous custom condemnedby international law, and the Cabinet had alwaystaken it for.granted that there would be no compromise on the question of exchange of prisoners and releaseof hostages.      General Scobie had originally, on12th December,  (Athens telegram No. 75 of 6th January)coffered E.L.A.S.  an immediate truce on the condition(subsequently repeated both by General Scobie and bythe Prime Minister himself) -(a) that the armed E.L.A.S.  troops should retiretowards the boundaries of Attica;(b) that those citizens of Athens who had taken up arms in support of E.L.A.S.  should lay down and hand in their arms..E.L.A. S.  had not agreed to carry out theseconditions and on 6th January General Scobie, without reference home, had announced that the development ofevents made the original terms no longer applicable.Any truce must therefore deal with the .whole questionof prisoners;    and must cover the situation created by the taking by E.L.A.S.   of a large number of Greekcivilians, and some British civilians,  as hostages,an act wholly contrary to the rules of civilised-1-

warfare.  .   This was the first occasion on which any reference had been made to the question of prisoners and hostages../In a MinUte addressed to the Foreign Secretarydated 7th January, he (the prime Minister) had said&quot;delivery of hostages and prisoners would surelyfollow automatically on a truce^7.On 9th January the Ambassador and General Scobiehad further advised that, given&apos; the deterioration ofthe position of E.L.A.S.,  the truce terms should beextended to give,, us Lamia and Volos, and to insist on E.L.-A.S,  evacuation from Salonica airfield (Athenstelegram No. 119).The War&apos; Cabinet had thereafter on two occasions&apos;urged on Mr. Leeper that no risk should be run of a breakdown merely because of our insistence on theseextended terms.      In doing so they had, of course,had in mind the extended territorial areas to whichhe had just referred.      It looked now as thoughMr. Lec-per and the negotiators had decided that ratherthan risk a break they should give way over theposition of the hostages.      This had.never, been theintention of the War Cabinet, and while there was no desire to blame the local negotiators, it would inhis view be intolerable, and inconsistent with our obligations of honour, were we to desert the hostages.After some discussion, the Prime Ministerput forward the following suggestions.(i) We should make an immediate public anriounce-ment accepting the.truce, the terms ofwhich in other respects were whollysatisfactory;(ii) We should couple this with a statement thatthe taking.and holding of hostages was abarbarous custom condemned by internationallaw, and that no truce could be enduringunless and until the hostages taken byE.L;A&apos;.S.  had been effe-ctively safeguardedand released;(iii) The announcement should also bring out that,in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government,the release of these hostages should be .accompanied by some guarantee of immunityin the case of persons involved in therecent civil convulsion who were notguilty of acts contrary to the rules ofwar or were amenable to the ordinarycriminal codes of civilised countries;-(iv) It was very desirable at the same time onthe one hand that our representatives in    N&quot;Greece should not feel that they had inany way lost the confidence of the Cabinet,and,  on the other,  that it should bebrought out that while the Cabinet hadbeen anxious to&apos; avoid a breakdown on the limited issue of the extended.terms &quot;.  &apos; &apos;      &apos;      proposed by General Scobie on 9&apos;th January(Athens telegram 119)* it had at no stage.: been their intention to compromise on thequestion of hostages.     A telegram

reviewing&apos;the course of the correspondencethat had passed and designed, withoutimputing blame,  to bring this out mightbe drafted and despatched without delay &apos; .&quot;/by the Foreign Office.The following points were made in discussion -(a) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed out thatthe terms agreed by the British and E.L.A.S.representatives contemplated (Athens telegram No, 152,paragraph 6(a) and (b)) that all Service personnel of whatever nationality captured by E.L.A.S.  would bereturned, and that an equal number of E,L.A.Siprisoners would be released by the British authoritiesin exchange.  .   It appeared that we had some 7,000prisoners in excess of the number of prisoners heldby E.L.A.S.  and that this would&apos;give a substantialbargaining counter.(b) The Foreign Secretary suggested that it was likely that E.L.A.S. were holding these hostages as security for their own lives.      The case for the. grantof immunity in respect of offences committed duringthe recent disturbances consequent on the release ofthe hostages by E.L.A.S.  was felt to be a very strongone, and the offer of it a further bargaining counterof substantial value.(c) It was important, to bring out the barbarouscharacter of the action of E.L.A.S.   in taking-and holding hostages.      The fact that they had excluded-these hostages from the truce which they were preparedto negotiate would by itself reflect seriously upon them.     &apos;(d) The Foreign Secretary said that whileGeneral Ares,  the Commander of E.L.AiS., was accused of crimes that ought well,  if established,  to excludehim from any amnesty such as that proposed, it was probably better to let one individual of this character escape, than to plunge Greece into misery and &apos;.to risk the fate of the large number of hostages heldby E.L.a.3.(e) As regards the&apos; timing of these arrangements,if the Archbishop were to hold his Conference withE.L.A.S.,  it might be made clear either simultaneouslyby His Majesty&apos;s Government or at the opening of thediscussions that, failing satisfactory arrangements on this point, hostilities would be renewed.      Thegeneral sense of the War Cabinet was, however,  thatit would be preferable that a statement should be made about the hostages before any Conference took place between the Archbishop and E.L,A.S.(f) The Foreign Secretary and the Lord Presidentof the Council felt that we must be at pains to avoid any suggestion that we were condoning the taking ofhostages or allowing ourselves to be blackmailed intoagreeing to individuals escaping punishment merelyin return for their release.

The general view of the &quot;War Cabinet was thata statement should be issued forthwith by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to the Press in this countrysetting out their views on the question of hostages.It was agreed that this statement should be as inconolusion (1 ) below and should continue as in thefollowing paragraph -&quot;In all the circumstances His Majesty&apos;sGovernment consider that the release of thesehostages by E;L,A.3.   should be accompanied bythe assurance that no penalties will be. enforced-against persons involved, in the recent civilconvulsion unless those persons have beenindividually guilty of acts which a re eithercontrary to the rules, of war or amenable to theordinary criminal codes of civilised countries&quot;.At this point in the War Cabinet proceedingsMr. Leeper&apos;s telegram No.  160 of the 12th Januarywas received and read to the War Cabinet.      Promthis telegram it appeared that our representatives in Athens had apparently been under the impression that it would be the wish of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat they should give way on the question of hostages,rather than allow the negotiations to break down;and that, but for this misunderstanding, they mightwell have taken a stiffer line, and stood firm on thequestion of hostages.This led the War Cabinet to consider thatit would be preferable that it should be left to   .the Greek Government rather than His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to decide the appropriate moment at which an assurance should be given that the release ofhostages by E.L.A,S. would be accompanied by an assurance that no penalties would be enforced against persons involved in the recent civil convulsionother than for offences amenable to the ordinarycriminal law.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows -(1) The following statement should be issuedforthwith in London on behalf of his majesty&apos;s  jesty&apos;s Government:-&quot;The terms signed by the British andE;L.A. S.   representatives for a truce areendorsed by His Majesty&apos;3 Government.      the taking and holding of hostages is, however,a barbarous custom condemned by internationallaw.      His Majesty&apos;s Government must makeit clear, therefore, that no truce can beenduring or ripen into peace unless or until the hostages taken by E.L.A. 3.  havebeen effectually safeguarded and released&quot;.(2) The Foreign Secretary was invited to repeatthis statement to Mr. Leeper for communication--to the Regent, and to instructhim at the same time to invite His Beatitudeto associate himself with its terms.  --

(3) The Regent should, also be informed thatin . the opinion of His Majesty1 s Governmentthe release of the hostages by S.L.a.S.should be accompanied by an- assurance from the Greek Government that nopenalties would be enforced against persons involved in the recent civilconvulsion unless they had beenindividually guilty of acts which were either contrary to the rules of. war or were amenable to the ordinarycriminal codes of civilised countries.It would, however, be for the GreekGovernment to decide at what momentthis assurance could properly be given..(4), The Foreign Secretary was invited toarrange for- a telegram to be sent toMr. Leeper on the lines proposed bythe Prime Minister at &apos;X&apos;.Offices of the War Cabinet,.

On reflectionhe thought it would fully meet the case, that so far as British Commanders were concerned,that the C.I.G. S. should again draw their attention to the earlier instructions that public statements should not be made, orpress conferences held, without the prior approval of the Government, nor in any casewithout the prior submission of the wholetext here.
