MINUTE confidential Annex(22nd January, 1945 - 5.30 p.m.)THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that theposition in Greece should he considered in cabinet later in the week.     It was desirable tosettle what kind of support we could encourage the Archbishop to expect from us beforediscussions began between the representatives ofthe Greek Government and of E.L.A.S.     He washimself very apprehensive of the sort of compromise which merely superficially unitedelements which intended to resume the struggleas soon as opportunity offered.The general situation was encouraging.In particular, E.L.A.S. had started handing backhostages, and were clearly anxious that conversations should continue and an under-standing be reached.     Nevertheless he remaineddoubtful whether the two parties could be got to sit round the same table.     He was inclined tothink that the fighting was over, and felt nodoubt as to the solid success of the policy wehad followed.The War Cabinet took note of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.The War Cabinet had before them aMemorandum (W.P.(45) 45) by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs reporting the latest developments in the Yugoslav situation.     Attheir meeting on 11th January (W.M.(45) 4thConclusions, Minute 2) the War Cabinet had decided that if King Peter declined to accept theTito-Subasic Agreement, H.M. Government wouldpresume the King&apos;s assent,    recognise the unitedGovernment which would be set up under theAgreement in Yugoslavia, and exchange Ambassadorswith that Government. The Prime Minister had publicly stated that that was our policy in his speech in the House of Commons on 18th January.Marshal Stalin was strongly in favour of it,and was pressing for its implementation.     no reply had, however, yet been received from president Roosevelt, and. there were signs thatthe State. Department was reluctant to agree until it was clear that there was no longer any hopeof a compromise between King Peter, Marshal Titoand Dr. Subasic.-1-

-V   -30Meanwhile, &apos; King Peter had been in .consul&apos;t-ation virith the Yugoslav Government in London, and marshal Tito,- in reply to a message, from HisMajesty, had declined to deal directly with theKing, and had suggested that if he did not acceptthe Agreement as it stood, Dr. Subasic should immediately proceed to Belgrade with hisGovernment and take the necessary steps to put theAgreement into force.     A formal protest had nowbeen.received from King Peter against the PrimeMinisters statement in the House &quot;on 18th January.Ought we in these circumstances to go ahead,without waiting for the United States Government,on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in theHouse, or ought we to delay a little longer, and endeavour in the meantime to obtain a definite   - -decision for or against our policy from thatGovernment?THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he had little to.add to his Memorandum..     When, on .21st January, our ambassador had sought an audience with King Peter,His Majesty had refused to see him, and had notaccordingly been warned of.our intention to go ahead with or without his concurrence.    We were under no obligation to give any date to&apos;the King, and if hewould not receive our Ambassador (who had now been instructed to make .no move towards His Majesty)there was no more to be done.In the ensuing discussion the followingpoints were made:-&quot;(a) There was the risk ,that unless we moved,quickly, King Peter might create an embarrassing position by dismissing theSubasic Government.     Equally, MarshalTito or Marshal Stalin might losepatience and depose the King or denounce the Tito-Subasic Agreement.(b) In the Balkan area, we had in practiceno power to influence events in roumania and Bulgaria.     We had still some slightinfluence in Yugoslavia though ourposition was very far from strong.      Ifthe King remained obstinate, was itdesirable to risk sacrificing whatremained of our influence, solelybecause of United States delay, more&apos; particularly as there seemed littlereason to hope that the United StatesGovernment would have any constructive,alternative to put forward?(c) It was agreed, on the other hand, thatthere was a very great advantage incarrying the United States Governmentwith us,, and that if a decision one way or another could be obtained from themwithin, say, the next 48 hours, thedelay would be worth while.After further discussion the War cabinet agreed that the Foreign Secretary should postpone further action until the viewsof the United States Government on our proposal were&apos;available, on the under- .standing.that the delay involved wouldnot exceed 48 hours.   &apos; &quot; -

andevious Referenceaclusions,ute 6)..   A general discussion took place on thePolish situation.     The discussion centred round:-(a) the attitude likely to he adopted bythe U.S.S.R. at the next meeting of the heads of Governments, and ,(b) the Western boundary of Poland.On the question&apos;of the attitude likelyto be adopted by the U.S.S.R,; THE MINISTER OPLABOUR informed the War Cabinet that he had learned from sources that had in the past provedreliable, that M. Gousev&apos;s recent return to moscow was thought to be due to the desire of theSoviet Government to satisfy themselves as to thereal trend of opinion in this country on thePolish issue.     M. Gousev, before leaving London,had made a number of contacts and had been toldvery frankly the attitude of the Labour Party onthis issue.     There seemed some reason, to think,though he could&apos;not guarantee the reliability ofhis information, that Premier Stalin might beready to make a dramatic gesture on the occasion of the meeting of Heads^ of Governments, and toagree to the inclusion Of Lvov within the boundaries of Poland,.and to the setting-up ofa mixed Polish Government which would replace theLublin Government and might include a small number of persons from here, one of whom mightbe M. Mikolajczyk.     The suggestion that ifLvov was made over to&quot; Poland, Premier Stalinwould transfer its population and build, as his .own gift to. the Ukraine, another greatUkrainian city in its place over the frontierhad,  it was said, been canvassed in Russia duringthe last couple of months.      It was impossibleto judge Y/hat foundation there might be for these reports.      But if there was anything in them, itappeared to be an argument against reachingconclusions ourselves as to our policy in Polanduntil we saw how things went.      So far as theEastern frontiers of Poland were concerned, he.doubted whether there had ever been real support for the Treaty of Riga, or any question aboutthe soundness of the Curzon Line, save as regardsits Southern extension, of which he would not himself make a point of principle.     ,   .   iTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY Salt thoil uii^Mfoundation for the reports referred to bythe Minister of Labour.     He thought that premier stalin was genuine when he urged that theUkraine would be a State on its own,  in which case, of course, it would need a capital city as its centre.      If, however, ^cilwcipc- confrontedr:*m&amp;fa. a proposal for a united Polish Governmentto include M. Mikolajczyk and sorrie other representatives from Polish circles supporting the present Government in London, we should, hethought, be prepared to come to&apos; an agreement onthat basis.THE PRIME MINISTER said that nothing could have exceeded the stiffness with which premier stalin had in earlier conversations refused to concede Lvov.     He had always thought, however,that&quot; Premier Stalin might make a great gesture

at the Peace Table, and might then yield Lvov to poland.     The possibility that he might decide to&quot;do so now, when Russian arms had&apos;been so outstand-ingly successful, could by no means be excluded.He thought himself, however, that Premier Stalinwould be more likely to&apos; give Lvov-to the Poles if .we refrained from maintaining constant pressure on .him about it, though we should be criticised on theground, that we had abandoned the point prematurelyif Lvov were in fact ceded to Poland without pressure from us.He had always felt that the question.of theEastern Polish frontier was- of subordinateimportance.      It was certainly a matter on which wecould exercise little direct influence.     What was,on the other hand, of vital concern to Poland wasthat she should be re-established as a free,independent and sovereign State.     We were ourselvespledged to;see her so restored;    the issue touchedour honour, and, in fighting for it, we could rely on the support of the United States Government.It went without saying that if Poland were to sacrifice areas to the East of the Curzon Line,she would be entitled to adequate territorialcompensation at the expense of Germany.THE MINISTER OP AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION referredto the possibility of a joint and several guaranteeby the Three Great Powers of the independence ofPoland, coupled with the&quot; constitution of a mixedGovernment, such as had been referred to, and a clear understanding about free elections.     the numerous declarations which had been made by premier stalin as to his anxiety to see Poland live freelyas an independent nation would make it verydifficult for him to oppose such a solution.     he agreed that it would be a mistake, if the Polishposition could be secured in that way., to make theissue of Lvov a stumbling-block.Discussion then turned to the Western boundary of Poland.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR referred to the ..suggestions that had been made for the Westernfrontier of Poland and, in particular, -the adoptionof the line of the Oder.     There was a good dealof criticism in Labour and other circles of anysuch arrangement.      It was felt that if the newPoland were to cut so deeply into Pomerania itwould be almost impossible for Germany to live atall.      It was likely to create an unstable internalposition in Poland owing to the size of the Germanminority which would have to be absorbed, while-  -the task of transfering the German population of so large an area was, on the face of it,  so great vas to be almost insoluble.      He felt that we should,be extremely careful how we committed ourselves in this matter.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had been atspecial pains to avoid any commitment, and had notgone beyond telling the Poles that&apos; if they wereprepared to agree to the Curzon-Line, we would support them in acquiring up to the limit of theOder as much territory as they could digest.

3SHe recognised the difficulty of transferring   -populations, but thought that the difficulties might well be overcome.&apos;    After all, Russia was now moving great masses of people without difficulty, and very substantial numbers had in  .the past been moved out of Turkey into the barrenand unfertile land of Greece.     He did not himself,however, wish to see put under Poland any area which could not be cleared of what he mightdescribe as &quot;characteristic German elements&quot;.Nor had he ever suggested taking asiy territoryfrom Germany for Poland from which German -inhabitants should not be moved. xTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY drew attention to thesighs that the Lublin Government were now openingtheir mouths still wider, and were asking for additional territories in Pomerania, togetherwith Lower Silesia.      He felt himself&apos; considerablehesitation as to the justification for concedingthe Oder Line, and held strongly thai we shouldnot allow ourselves to go beyond the undertakingson this matter which we had already given.The War Cabinet took note of these statements./Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
