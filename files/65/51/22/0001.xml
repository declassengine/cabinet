(45)  22nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex(19th February, 1945 - 6.30 p.m. )THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER welcomed back thePrime Minister and the&apos; Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, and expressed the hearty congratulations ofthe War Cabinet on the results that they had achievedand their safe return.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked the War Cabinetwarmly on behalf of the Foreign Secretary and himselffor their good wishes.      They were both most grateful to the War Cabinet for the full support and the latitude in.negotiation which the War cabinet had given them during their discussions.It was difficult, if not impossible, faithfullyto reproduce the atmosphere of the discussions that had taken place between the three Heads of Governments.But his colleagues might welcome his impressions.S.R. So far as Premier Stalin was concerned, hewas quite sure that he meant well to the world and to poland.      He did not himself&apos;think that there would beany resentment on the part of Russia&apos;   about thearrangements that had been made for free and fairelections in that country.      On arrival in the Crimeahe found that the situation had undergone an extraordinary change.      In three weeks the russian army had fought its way from the Vistula to  the Oder;almost the whole of Poland had been liberated;    inmany parts of the country so reconquered the russians had been warmly welcomed, and great cities had changed hands very nearly intact.      In his discussions at the Crimea Conference he had been at pains at all times to press the policy that had been approved by .the War Cabinet viz.  a free aiid independent Poland,sovereign in her own territories;   with a Governmentmore broadly composed than it had been, and with theprinciples of ,free and fair elections maintained.Whatever criticisms there might be. of the arrangements that had been reached,, he felt no doubt that they .were on any broad and statesmanlike view the bestpracticable, and that they were truly in the interestof Poland.     Premier Stalin, at the beginning oftheir conversations on the Polish question, had saidthat Russia had committed many sins (the word was sotranslated, but the actual word used might have beencrimes) against Poland, and that she had in the pastjoined in the partitions of Poland and in crueloppression of&quot; her.      It was not the intention of theSoviet Government to repeat that policy in the.future.He felt no doubt whatever that in saying that premier stalin had been sincere.EA CONFERENCEviouserence:,(1+5) 20thelusions,ute 1)

He had a very great feeling that the russians were anxious to work harmoniously with the two Englishspeaking democracies.     Relations at the conference had been very easy, and the fact that we and theUnited States spoke the same language while theRussians had had to use an interpreter had not, hethought,  in any way impaired the closeness of contact or understanding.      Premier&apos; Stalin was aperson of great power, in whom he had everyconfidence.      He did not think that he would embark on any adventures, but he could not deny that muchrested on Premier Stalin&apos;S life.He had been immensely impressed by themagnificent bearing and proud look of the russian troops.      There was.no question that the russian army was a formidable machine.Nothing could have- been better than thecordiality and the completeness of the arrangementsv/hich their hosts had made to see that the discussions were conducted in the most comfortable surroundingspossible.Discussions of great importance had takenplace on various other secret matters^ in particular,in relation to Japan.As regards Greece,  the Russian attitude couldnot have been more satisfactory.      There was no suggestion on Premier Stalin8s part of criticism ofour policy.      He had been friendly and even jocularin discussion of it.      He had expressed a wish forfuller information of what was going on, and arrange-merits had been made to let him have a full statement in writing.      The Prime Minister added that premier stalin had most scrupulously respected his acceptanceof our position in Greece.     He understood that theemissary sent to the U.S.S.R.  by the Greek Communistshad first been put under house arrest, and thensent back.      There had been no shadow of criticismin the Russian press at any time, and the conduct ofthe Russians in this matter had strengthened his viewthat when they made a bargain, they desired to keep it.The experiences which he and the foreign secretary had had in Athens had been astonishing.The crowd which had welcomed them had been the biggest he had ever seen.      He had driven two to three hundred yards with the Regent through streetswhere,  a month ago,- there had been firing and murder,and he had been enormously impressed by the enthusiasm shown.      The joy of these people, who hfidbeen relieved from fear and from war, was incredible.Our policy had beyond any doubt been fully justified.He hoped in these circumstances-that, in theinterest of establishing the regime, we should do what we reasonably could to help the Greeks financially.The amounts involved were probably not so very great.In particular, it was important to avoid a cut in the pay of the Army before we were well round the corner.He had seen Sir David VValey, who had been handling the situation on very broad and sensible lines.      TheForeign Secretary had remained behind in Athens after he (the Prime Minister) .had le t, and had done what he could further to. urge the various parties to get together.    He thought that the visit had been wellworth while.

He had been struck by the desire of theRussians to meet the President half way on points towhich they thought he attached real importance.He had had a further discussion with the Presidentat Alexandria. &apos;    Mr. Wiriant was there at the sametime, -but he feared that he had secured no realsatisfaction over eivil aviation, though he thoughtthat it was possible that when the President reachedhome,  something might be done in that regard.    -Asregards oil stockshe was sure that the War cabinet would agree that he had scored a great victory, when we would have been quite prepared to settle on a figure of 6 million tons,  to have secured acceptance by the Americans, as the result of Lord Leathers&apos;negotiations, of a figure of approximately 6  million tons..     As regards the feeding of Europe, he hadbegged the President to&apos; help, and the President had replied that this would be the- first thing to whichhe would apply his attention on his return.      ThePrime Minister added that General de Gaulle&apos;refusal of the President&apos;s invitation to meet him&quot;&quot; in Algiers had been the more difficult to excusegiven the extent of the.American contribution in menand in material to the- liberation and the rehabilitation-tion of Prance.He had had a discussion with the Emperor of ethiopia.      The impression made on him by His Majestywas, however, far from favourable, and the Emperorhad shown no particular gratitude for all that hadbeen done by this country to restore him.He had also seen the Kin:,&apos;of Egypt, whose attitude was he thought much better than before,and who was said now to be on very good terms with us.      It was,  of course,  the case that His Majestyhad recently carried through a successful coup d&apos;etatwhich had no doubt materially strengthened hisposition.      He had expressed to the King his regret that so much of the population of Egypt might be without representation in,the new Parliament, but his Majesty had replied that he hoped to get someof them in.      He had advised the King to concentrate on good works and,  in particular, on improving thecondition of the Fellaheen, for while Egypt at themoment was a country of great wealth,  the differences between the level of living of the various socialclasses were more marked than ever before.      ThePresident, he understood, had spoken to King Faroukon much the same lines, and he trusted that some goodmight come out of it.iThe Prime Minister said that he had also hadconversations with King Ibn Saud.      Ibn Saud was amarvellous and most impressive figure, who had arrivedattended by a superb suite, and whom we had been atpains to send back in a very smart cruiser.      Aluncheon party had been arratiged for the King whichhad gone off very well.      Ibn -Saud had displaj^ed -even more than the customary Arab generosity in thepresents which he had given to the British party.He (the Prime Minister) had pleaded the case of theJews with His Majesty but without, he thought, makinga great deal of impression, Ibn Saud quoting theKoran on the other side, but he had not failed to impress upon the King the importance ?/hich we     : -attached to this question.
