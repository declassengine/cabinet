The Prime Minister.

1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed his colleagues that the Prime Minister was suffering from an attack of ? and would probably not be able to attend Meetings of the War Cabinet for a day or two although he was able to deal with business in his room. The Chancellor read out a copy of a Notice which was to be issued to the Press, informing them of the reason why the Prime Minister would not be able to be present at the Luncheon at the Mansion House that day.

The War Cabinet expressed their sympathy with the Prime Minister.



The Air Situation (Previous Reference: W.M. (39)75th Conclusion, Minute 1.)



2. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet that German aircraft had been active on the previous day over the middle of the North Sea, off the Dutch Coast, and off the English coast between Yarmouth and Skegness.

A mine-sweeping flotilla north of Cromer had opened fire on one enemy aircraft, which had immediately turned away, dropping two bombs, which had fallen one mile off the flotilla.

Several Fighter Patrols had been sent up from aerodromes at home to investigate reports of enemy activity throughout the day, but no contacts had been made.

Coastal Command, in addition to carrying out the usual searches and patrols, had provided escorts for seven convoys.

A series of encounters between reconnaissance aircraft of Coastal Command and German aircraft had taken place over the North Sea. In one of these one of our aircraft had succeeded in bringing down an enemy aircraft 44 miles West of Terachelling. A second aircraft had sighted two enemy aircraft 110 miles East of Flamborough Head. Both of these had been attacked, one five time, after which it had been seen going down out of control. After two attacks on the second enemy, our aircraft had been obliged to return home, having expended all its ammunition. The aircraft was an Anson, piloted by a New Zealander.

In France one enemy reconnaissance aircraft had been shot down. One of our aircraft, which was missing, was believed to have landed by mistake in Luxemburg.

As a result of recent alleged flights of German aircraft over Belgium, all aircraft had been prohibited from flying over Belgian territory without special permission.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.



Dominion Personnel. Publicity regarding exploits.



3. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs hoped that it might be possible to publish the name of the New Zealand pilot who had engaged the enemy aircraft over the North Sea as recorded in Minute 2.

The Secretary of State for Air explained that this raised a point of principle which affected all the Services, and which he therefore hoped to have an opportunity of discussing with his Service colleagues in the near future.

The Lord Privy Seat said that arrangements had been made during the last War whereby information of this kind had been passed to Canada, on the understanding that it was not telegraphed back to this country.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Chartering of neutral shipping. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 63rd Conclusions. Minute 11.)



should be taken to bring to a successful conclusion the negotiations for chartering neutral tonnage. It was vital to us to secure this tonnage.

The Lord Privy Seal said that this matter had been discussed at the Home Policy Committee on the previous day and had produced a flood of complaints as to the delays involved and the difficulties resulting from the diversion of shipping to the West coast. He endorsed the First Lord&apos;s view that the chartering of neutral tonnage was a matter of supreme urgency, and he suggested that the War Cabinet should be provided with an early statement as to the Shipping position as a whole, which appeared to him to be unsatisfactory.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had seen the Minister of Shipping that morning and had impressed upon him the seriousness of the situation. He had pointed out that, on the question of measuring the price to be paid, obtaining the shipping at once might be an economy, since delay in reaching a settlement would only raise the price. A Meeting had been arranged that afternoon between representatives of the Treasury and the Ministry of Shipping. He added that Lord Cadman had explained to him the difficulties experienced by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company on account of some of the Company&apos;s tankers being diverted to Gulf ports.

The Secretary of State for War said that ships which had been sent to Canada to collect timber had instead been loaded with grain, despite the fact that the timber was urgently required. He asked that consideration should be given to the possibility of buying foreign shipping to rectify our present shortage.

After further discussion, the War Cabinet-

(i) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Shipping would hold a meeting that afternoon with a view to settling any outstanding points in regard to the chartering of Norwegian tonnage, and that a report on this matter would be made to the Meeting of the War Cabinet to be held on the ensuing day.

(ii) Invited the Minister of Shipping to submit to the War Cabinet at an early date a general survey of the shipping position as a whole. This survey should indicate the steps which, in the Minister&apos;s view, should be taken to rectify the shortage of tonnage (including tankers), and should include consideration of the possibility of buying foreign ships.



German Exports.

Question of seizure.



7. The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that the violation of Dutch or Belgian neutrality by Germany would be a crime which would fully justify our departing from International Law to the extent of seizing Germany&apos;s exports in neutral ships. This would strike Germany a very severe blow.

The Minister without Portfolio was inclined to think that there was already a good case for our taking this action. He informed the War Cabinet that the Minister for Economic Warfare and the Attorney General were in process of examining the question in the light of Illegal actions taken by Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement, and invited the Minister for Economic Warfare to submit a memorandum on this matter.


The Netherlands and Belgium. Imports of oil and other raw materials.



8. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that he had had a letter from the Minister for Economic Warfare asking whether it was desirable to hold up, for the time being imports into Holland and Belgium of oil and other raw materials. Oil, for example, was being imported into the Low Countries at the rate of 100,000 tons a week. Imports into Holland and Belgium could be slowed down without difficulty through the medium of our contraband control. There was general agreement that this should be done.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would like to inform the Dutch and Belgian Ministers that he would like to inform the Dutch and Belgian Ministers that we proposed to slow up their imports for the next few days, and to ask them whether they approved this action, or whether they saw any objection to it.

The War Cabinet agreed-

(1) That it was desirable to slow down supplies of oil and other raw materials to Holland and Belgium for, at any rate, the next few days, and that the Minister of Co-ordination of Defence should inform the Minister for Economic Warfare accordingly.

(2) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the Dutch and Belgian Ambassadors of our proposed action, and invite their comments.



War Aims. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 61st Conclusions, Minute 8.)



9. The War Cabinet had before them the following Papers:-

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, covering draft communication to the French Government (W.P. (G) (39) 77):

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, covering telegram from Mr. Savage to Mr. Fraser (W.P. (G.) (39)74):

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, covering circular telegram despatched on the 27th October to the Dominion Government, together with replies received from Mr. Menzies and General Smuts (W.P. (G.) (39) 76).

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the object at which the French Government were aiming was the formulation of certain general principles, in agreement with us. The intention would be that neither Government should thenceforward make any public statement of its war aims which was inconsistent with those agreed principles. The machinery by means of which they contemplated that the principles would be formulated was, first, an exchange of despatches between the two Governments, which might be useful in clarifying their respective aims: and, secondly, a meeting between British and French Ministers.

A War Cabinet decision would be required before any answer was sent to the French, but he did not ask for any decisions that day. The draft attached to W.P. (G.) (39) 77 was of purely preliminary character and would, no doubt, require modification in the light of further comments from the Dominions. There would be some thorny problems to face in due course--for example, the suggestion that effective guarantees should be taken, as part of the peace settlement, against future aggression on the part of Germany.

The Secretary of State for Domination Affairs said that the Dominion High Commissioners had thought that the matter could be best dealt with in personal discussion between United Kingdom and French Ministers.


The First Lord of the Admiralty regarded it as certain that the French would insist after the war on some form of dis? of Germany.

The War Cabinet took note:-

(1) of the Memoranda by the Foreign Secretary and the Dominious Secretary, with their enclosures;

(2) that no decision was required on these documents for the present.



The Netherlands and Belgium. Peace appeal by Queen Wilhelmina and King Leopold. (Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 75th Conclusions. Minute 11.)



10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had no further information to indicate the reasons which had prompted Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and King Leopold of the Belgians to make their peace appeal. He still thought that this action had been prompted by fear of German aggression. As regards the intentions of Germany, the view of the Foreign Office was that, if on this occasion precedent were to offer any guide, the probabilities were that Germany would violate Netherland and Belgian neutrality, since on all previous occasions on which there had been public debate as to whether or not Germany would commit an act of aggression, she had invariably done so, not withstanding the fact that at the time there often appeared very strong grounds for anticipating a contrary dicision. After the speech delivered by Herr Hitler the previous evening it would be very difficult for Germany to remain inactive.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Canada. Destination of the First Canadian Division. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 75th Conclusions. Minute 5.)



11. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, as arranged at the meeting of the War Cabinet referred to in the margin, he had taken such soundings as were possible in this country to ascertain the probable Canadian view on the question whether the First Canadian Division should be landed in this country or in France. Brigadier-General Crerar had no doubt that, for sentimental and personal reasons, the Canadian troops would prefer to come first to this country, but that clearly the safety of the troops should be the governing factor. If the War Cabinet saw no objection to a slight delay before a final decision was taken in this matter, he (the Secretary of State) thought it would be well to telegraph to Ottawa putting the position before the Canadian Government.

After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed:-

That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, after consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War, should send a telegram to the Canadian Government, setting out squarely the relative advantages and disadvantages of the First Canadian Division being landed (i) in the country, and (ii) in France, and asking them to indicate which course they preferred.
