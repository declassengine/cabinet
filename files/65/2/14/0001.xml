The Air Situation. (previous Reference: W.M. (39) 79th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that it had now been ascertained that the aircraft which had failed to return from the reconnaissance flight over Southern Germany on the night of the 10th-11th November (reported at the Meeting of the War Cabinet referred to in the margin) had crashed in France and the crew had been killed. The other aircraft had reported that the German black-out appeared to be very effective. There had been ineffective anti-aircraft fire and considerable searchlight activity, which had, however, failed to pick up the machine.

Following on a Naval report of German warships off Heligoland, three Blenheims had been sent out on the previous day. Visibility had been extremely bad and nothing had been sighted. Two of our aircraft had failed to return.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval Situation. (Previous Reference: W.m. (39) 79th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

2. The Chief of Naval Staff informed the War Cabinet of certain Naval dispositions taken to meet the possibility of a German advance into Holland.

owing to fog, 5 ships of an East Coast Convoy had run aground. Four of them had been refloated, and it was anticipated that the fifth would be refloated at the next high water. Fighters were patrolling in the vicinity.

The Chief of Naval Staff summarised the impressions which had been gained of the German submarine personnel, as a result of the questioning of prisoners. They appeared to have no hatred for England and no enthusiasm for the War. They appeared to be very ignorant of happenings in the outside world, and were merely carrying out their orders in a machine-like manner.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Military Situation, (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 79th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

3. The Secretary of State for War said that one more division had been identified on the Western Front. The distribution of the German divisions now appeared to be-Western Front 89-97; central Germany and Eastern Front 36-44 divisions. The War Office had no information of the exact number of divisions on Germany&apos;s Eastern frontier.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Belgium. Staff Conversations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 79th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

4. The War Cabinet was informed of the latest developments in the situation regarding Staff Conversations with the Belgians. A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet-

Took note of the information given and agreed that, for the moment, no further action could usefully be taken.
