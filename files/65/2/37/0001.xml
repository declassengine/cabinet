2 ft-The AirSituation1.   The Secretary of State for Air gave the War Cabinetfurther details of the attack carried out by 24 Wellingtons on(Previous German warships at Heligoland on the 3rd December.   There had reference: been 2 cruisers and 6 to 9 destroyers in the roads at the time. TwoW.M. (39) 102nd or three direct hits had probably been made on one of the cruisers,Conclusions, and one destroyer had been closely straddled by one stick of bombs.Minute 1.) Owing to cloud, however, the damage could not be confirmed byphotographs taken at the time. A bomb dropped by an aircraftmaking a steep turn had fallen on an anti-aircraft battery, whichhad been silenced. Our aircraft had been followed up by 7 or 8Messerschmidts, but only one of the enemy fighters had pressedhome its attack, and this aircraft had been shot down. The anti-aircraft fire from the batteries on Heligoland had been heavy andaccurate. Two of our aircraft had been hit, but had not sustainedvital damage and all had returned home safely. It seemed clearthat the German warning system was inefficient, since before reaching Heligoland our aircraft had reconnoitred Wilhelmshaven.It was also interesting that the German fighters had not pressedhome their attacks against our Wellingtons, which seemed morethan a match for them.Three Wellingtons had carried out a sweep of the area offTerschelling and Sylt, but without sighting any targets.In the attack made on a U-boat off Texel, reported the previous day, a direct hit had been scored on the base of the conning-tower,:    The U-boat was believed to be one of the large ocean-going type.A patrol off Texel on the 3rd December had had a brush with enemy aircraft, but no casualties had been sustained on either side.A search had been carried out south of Iceland, in consequenceof possible indications of enemy vessels in that area, but nothinghad been seen.A reconnaissance had been made by the IA^al Air Forcecontingent of the Field Force to investigate the presence of pontoonbridges over the Rhine and to observe road and rail movement.On the night of the 2nd/3rd December leaflets had been dropped by balloons, and it was believed that they might havepenetrated as far as Brno. .The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the war situation. Cabinet that H.M.S. Nelson had sustained damage from a mine(Previous while entering a harbour on the West Coast of Scotland.   It was reference:        thought that the damage had probably been caused by a magneticw.M. (39) 102nd mine, in 19 fathoms.   It was believed that thirty of the crew had conclusions,      been injured, but that no one had been killed.   Some of the ship&apos;sMinute 2.)        compartments had been flooded.  The full extent of the damage hadH M. S Nelson   no&apos;      &apos;3een ascertained, but it would be necessary for the vessel to1 1 &apos;   e son-   gD jn 0 dock for repairs.   In the meantime there was some danger that an air attack might be launched on H.M.S. Nelson if theGermans received information of the explosion from the submarinewhich had laid the mine.   There were no anti-aircraft defences inthe harbour at present, but the Air Ministry were being asked toprovide special protection, and the Admiralty would transfer someof their anti-aircraft defences from the Thames to deal with thesituation.   The First Lord proceeded to give details of the redistribution-position of our heavy ships which would be necessitated by the damage to the Nelson.Towards the end of the Meeting the First Lord said that he proposed that the Nelson should remain where she was for somedays. He thought that for the time being it would be necessarythat, when our Capital Ships were entering ports, they should be preceded by large merchant ships.The Admiral Scheer had now appeared off the South-Westcoast of Africa.   There were strong forces at the Cape which had. been sent to search for the raider, but if she went out into the[20453] b 2
unfrequented areas of the Southern Atlantic it might be verydifficult to pick her up.The patrol of the South African Air Force which had spottedthe German liner Watussi was an improvised formation of shore-based aircraft. It appeared that these aircraft had not received theinstructions issued to His Majesty&apos;s ships for the action to be takento prevent the scuttling of German ships by their crews.The Prime Minister expressed the view that the scuttling ofGerman ships by their crews was quite indefensible at a time when we Avere very short of shipping and the Germans were sinking our ships without warning. We could not afford to be quixotic in thismatter, and it might be necessary for us to take more drastic action.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to reinforce theinstructions which had already been issued by the Admiralty on thisquestion.Proceeding, the First Lord reported that an attack had beenmade on a U-boat off St. Catherine&apos;s, but without result.The submarine Triad had safely arrived in harbour.S.S. Chancellor had been severely damaged in a collision offHalifax. S.S. Hamsterley had been sunk in collision in convoy offGreat Yarmouth.Satisfactory progress was being made with investigations intothe methods of dealing with the magnetic mine. The magnetic ship which had been developed before the outbreak of war appeared tobe the most promising, but several other methods were being tried.A mine had been successfully exploded by a towed lighter containing a magnetic coil.Movement of shipping into and out of tJhe Port of London was proceeding normally. The number of ships in the Downs had been greatly reduced.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.A.A. Defence of 3.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had beenthe Tyne. disturbed on his recent visit to the Tyne at the position in regardto defence against low-flying air attack. He suggested that 20-mm.Hispano-Suiza aircraft cannon, which were at present being-produced more quickly than they could be used in aircraft, shouldbe temporarily employed for this purpose.The Chief of the Air Staff said that arrangements had alreadybeen made to use these temporarily surplus guns on land pedestalsfor anti-aircraft purposes. The allocation of these defences to thevarious vital points in the country was the task of the DeputyChiefs of Staff Committee, who were advised by a technical Sub-Committee.The First Lord of the Admiralty also enquired whether it wasnecessary for the balloons to be kept in the air except when warning of an attack was given.The Secretary of State for Air explained that experience had shown that more damage was sustained by balloons on the ground in rough weather than when they were flying. The output ofballoons was being accelerated.The War Cabinet agreed : (i) To instruct the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Committee toconsider what defences against low-flying attack couldforthwith be provided for the Tyne, having regard to : (a) the importance of this area in comparison with other important localities;(b) the possibility of using Hispano-Suiza guns in the.manner suggested in the above discussion,(ii) To report to the Military Co-ordination Committee by12 noon on Wednesday, the 6th December, 1939.Reprisals forInhumaneMethods ofSubmarineWarfare.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 92ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Magnetic mines.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 102ndConclusions,Minute 2.)
Military 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that there was anOperations. increase of two in the number of Divisions directly opposite(Previous Holland.   There was one more Division in the extreme South.Reference: Against this, one Division had been withdrawn from the FrankfurtW.M. (39) 101st area, and another from Trier.Cone U810^8&apos; jn reply to the Prime Minister, who asked as to the significance1 mu e v of these movements, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff saidthat the German troops were still in a position close up ito thefrontier, and that, from this point of view, were ready for an attackat any moment. On the other hand, the state of the ground on theWestern Front was appalling. Part of the line was completelyinundated and could not be traversed by tanks. For these reasonshe regarded an imminent attack as impossible.The Secretary of State for War mentioned that arrangements had been made whereby British formations would take their turnin the sector of the line on the Franco-German frontier.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Weekly Reports.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 96thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The War Cabinet took note of Weekly Resume No. 13 bythe Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (39) 145).Finland.Invasion by soviet Union.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 102ndConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for War said that the Soviet hadclaimed further slight advances in the Karelian Isthmus, but itwould appear that they had not yet reached the Finnish maindefensive line. Reports indicated that these advances had cost theRussians heavy losses. The Finns appeared to be still in possessionof Petsamo. One Soviet report mentioned the launching of a newmovement against Suolussalmi. This was the point on Finland&apos;sEastern frontier, where that country was narrowest; but it was alsothe point where the Russians would be furthest from the Murmanskrailway line.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Finland.Proposed supplyof fighter aircraft.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theFinnish Minister, who had visited him the previous day, thoughtthat the Finns would give a fair account of themselves on theground. The majority of their Air Force, however, was absorbed in support of the Army and the defence of such vulnerable points aspower stations. They had, therefore, no fighter defence for the civilpopulation. The Finnish Minister had given a tragic account ofthe way in which Russian aircraft had, unmolested, been free tomachine-gun the civil population. It was clear that the russians were out to Bolshevise the whole of Finland, and, if they succeeded in the conquest of that country, he (the Foreign Secretary) had little doubt that they would ultimately endeavour to edge round andseize the Northern ports of Norway. In these circumstances, theFinnish Minister had asked whether, as an immediate measure of help, we could supply his country with 30 fighters. The suggestion was that, although we could not supply Spitfires or Hurricanes, we might be able to spare Gladiators, which would be collected in thiscountry and flown to Finland by Finn pilots. (Some doubt was expressed as to whether this was practicable.) From the political point of view, the Foreign Secretary considered that it would beto our interest to try to give the Finns this measure of help.Whilst it was to our advantage that Russia should be causingembarrassment to Germany, we must, at the same time, realise that[20453] b 3
the Russian invasion of Finland might, in time, prove very embarrassing to ourselves, particularly through its repercussions onthe Scandinavian countries. He had examined the question of meeting Finland&apos;s request for fighters from the neutrality point ofview, and this need not present difficulty. The real difficulty,therefore, was whether the aircraft could be spared from thiscountry, and on this point he had been in touch with the Secretaryof State for Air. He urged that, if we were unable to give them thefull number, we should at least endeavour to let them have a proportion -say, twenty fighters.The Secretary of State for Air said that the air defence of thiscountry was becoming an increasing burden which made it almost impossible to meet outside demands of this nature.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the demand for fightersto defend not only this country, but also France, was growingheavier day by day for the protection, for example, of the Navy;of Liverpool, and of the Tyneside, as suggested by the First Lordthat morning. We had been obliged to refuse the demands ofTurkey. On military grounds, he did not think that we ought to release any further fighter aircraft at this juncture.      ,fi.The Prime Minister said that he was inclined to support theview of the Foreign Secretary that every effort should be made togive the Finns at least a measure of support. The political effectof such a gesture might be very considerable, particularly on the swedes, to whom we looked for shipping and iron ore. Turkey wasnot at war, but the Finns were. To give the latter such help as wecould would conform with the policy of -throwing in our resources in places where they would be of most value.The Secretary of State for War felt that a Russian occupationof Finland would bring the Soviet menace dangerously close to us;and that therefore anything which we could do to hold up theRussian advance would be of great importance. It was particularly desirable that the Swedes should not be thrown into the arms ofGermany. Help to Finland might produce a good moi&apos;al effect onthe United States. Failing British aircraft, would it be possibleto supply the Finns with Italian machines ?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he under-stood that the Finnish Government were enquiring into this possibility.After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed : (i) That the Secretary of State for Air should consider further the Finnish Governments request for the &quot;supply of fighter aircraft, and should report thereon to the WarCabinet next day.(ii) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the Finnish Minister that the request for Britishfighter aircraft was being considered sympathetically,but that this request presented us with great difficulties.League ofNations.forthcoming meeting of theCouncil and assembly.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 92ndConclusions,Minute 9.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that uponthe application of the Finnish representative, the Secretary-Generalof the League had called a meeting of the Council of the League forthe following Saturday (9th December, 1939) in order to considerthe situation arising out of the aggression by the U.S.S.R. uponFinland. So far as could be seen, M. Maisky would be theChairman. The Meeting of the Assembly would take place onMonday. His (the Secretary of State&apos;s) opinion was that it was unfortunate that these meetings should take place, since they couldnot produce any useful result, and would still further damage theLeague. He did not propose to go to Geneva himself, but he thoughtthat Mr. R. A. Butler, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, should represent this country.  The line to be taken
should be concerted with the French Government. He consideredthat, if any proposal were made for the imposition of sanctions against the U.S.S.R., this should be resisted not only because it wasfutile but also because of the bad effect which it would create in italy. He would propose that, if this subject were raised,Mr. Butler should state plainly that we considered that this waswhich could only be met by force of moral opinion.The War Cabinet expressed general approval of this statement.Turkey. 9    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that arisingBritish obliga- out of the communication which, at the request of the War Cabinet,tions under the the First Lord of the Admiralty had made to General Orbay, theAnglo-Turkish Turkish Government had asked for an assurance that that state-Treaty, ment was not intended to whittle down our obligations under the(Previous Anglo-Turkish Treaty to assist Turkey in the event of her beingReference: attacked by a European Power. He proposed in answer to explainW.M. (39) 66th that the action indicated by the First Lord was that which weConclusions, proposed to take in the event of Turkey being threatened. It didMinute 10.) not refer to the action which we should take in the event of Turkeybeing engaged in actual hostilities, in which case we should carryout to the full our obligations under the Treaty.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed. The action whichhe had indicated to General Orbay that we were prepared to take in certain circumstances was additional to. and not in substitution for, the action to be taken by us under the Treaty.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.italy- 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionAttitude to telegram No. 1195 (R.) dated the 3rd December, 1939, from Histowards Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, in which Sir Percy Loraine reportedU.S.S.R. that organised pro-Finnish and anti-Soviet demonstrations byaggression on students had taken place the previous day in Rome, and must beFinland. assumed to have had official approval.  No mention of this incidenthad so far appeared in the Italian Press.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.Anxiety over british Contra-band Control.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 94thConclusions,Minute 10.)11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thefurther recent telegrams received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Rome, on the subject of our Contraband Control measures (andin particular Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s telegram No. 1191, dated the1st December, 1939) were causing him considerable anxiety. Hewas in consultation with the Minister for Economic Warfare onthe subject, and he did not wish at the moment to ask for any decision from the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.U.S.S.R.Attitude ofBritish Presstowards theSovietGovernment.12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet that hitherto we had been somewhat secretiveregarding our negotiations the previous summer with the U.S.S.R.He had, however, the previous day been asked whether it would bepossible to permit further statements on this subject to appear inthe Press. In view of the U.S.S.R. aggression on Finland he had thought it wise to permit this within moderate limits, since thiswould strengthen our position in the Scandinavian countries. Onthe other hand it would not, he thought, be wise for the Press
to adopt too violent an attitude towards the U.S.S.R. On the whole he thought that the Press that morning had taken a satisfactoryattitude.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Far eastern situation.The Tientsinsilver question,and proposalsfor&quot; settling theTientsinincident.(previous reference:WM. (39) 97thConclusions,Minute 12.)13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 1582 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo,reporting that it was clear that the Japanese Government were anxious to close the Tientsin incident as quickly as possible. Agreat struggle was taking place behind the scenes between the advocates of a rapprochement with respectively the Democraciesand the U.S.S.R. Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s own view had all along beenthat there was no time to be lost in settling the Tientsin question,and he thought that there was much to be said for the suggestionthat the silver should be placed under the joint control of, if not actually deposited jointly with, the Hong Kong and ShanghaiBanking Corporation and the Yokohama Specie Bank. Sir robert craigie considered that if we were to insist, we could now secureJapanese assent to the deposit of the silver in a neutral bank, buthe felt that it would be good, politically, to meet the Japanese to theextent of accepting joint control of the silver placed in someneutrally owned safe deposit.He (the Secretary of State) considered that what was importantwas that we should satisfy ourselves that, wherever the silver wasdeposited, it could not be withdrawn by the Japanese without ourapproval. If we could secure this, he favoured giving Sir robert craigie some latitude in order to enable him to reach a definiteagreement. Japanese feeling had been affected by the action of theU.S.S.R. against Finland, and we should be wise to take this opportunity of settling the Tientsin question. He would be glad to have the authority of the War Cabinet to telegraph as soon aspossible to Sir Robert Craigie on the lines which Ihe had indicated.The War Cabinet- .Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to despatch a telegram to Sir Robert Craigie authorising himto reach a settlement of the Tientsin question on the lines indicated.Evacuation ofGovernmentDepartments.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 6thConclusions,Minute 2.)14. The War Cabinet had before them a Report on the Evacua-tion of Government Departments (W.P. (G.) (39) 124) by the civil defence Committee.The Home Secretary and the Minister of Home Security statedthat the Government Staffs to be evacuated had been divided into two categories : (1) the &quot; A &quot; or the more essential staff, i.e., those concerned with war duties, which amounted to some 22,000 andmust be moved as a body (this was called the Black Move); (2) the&quot;B&quot; or less essential staffs, amounting to some 42,000, whichwould be evacuated under the Yellow Move. The Committee recom-mended that this latter move, only half of which had been carriedout, should be proceeded with on the ground that if later the BlackMove had to be carried out, the difficulties of this Move would thereby be greatly lessened.The Committee considered that the Black Move should takeplace only at the last possible moment and in face of absolutenecessity, owing to the great loss of efficiency that would result.The Committee had considered alternatives to the Black Move,such as concentrating the Government Departments transferred from London in one suitable headquarters town, but were satisfiedthat this was impracticable.  They had also considered transferring
some of the Departments to the North-Western suburbs of London,as was contemplated in the September crisis of 1938, and were of theopinion that this plan might be re-examined by the Air Staff.The Home Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that the agita-tion against what had already been done by the Government inthe way of requisitioning still continued, and the claims for reliefby hotel keepers and the boroughs concerned was becoming moreinsistent.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Ministryheld that, if the situation was so desperate that the work of govern-ment could not continue in Central London, then the position inthe North-West suburbs would be almost as bad, and little wouldbe gained by making a move to that area. He also drew attentionto the fact that Mr. Garvin, in an article in The Observer on theprevious day, had said that the air threat to this country stillcontinued, and that Germany might have the question in suspensein a way that admitted no abatement of our vigilance and discipline.The Prime Minister said that in view of previous discussions ofthe War Cabinet, the Civil Defence Committee were bound to reach the conclusions set out in their Report, which struck him as a verythorough document. There was no doubt, however, that the BlackMove would result in a great loss of efficiency, and he thoughtthat the need of such a move was growing less and less. It was clear that Germany was anxious to avoid starting an attack ofthe kind that would mean retaliation on her cities. He did notthink that the time had come to repeal the previous decision of theWar Cabinet, but there was no doubt that the emphasis had been changed since they had first considered this question. As for theYellow Move, if it meant great loss of efficiency and hardship to civil Servants, he thought that the necessity of proceeding further with it might be reconsidered.The First Commissioner of Works hoped the Yellow Movewould be proceeded with. The accommodation question forGovernment Departments in London was still an acute problem and, although 18,000 Civil Servants had been evacuated, he hadalready had to find office accommodation for 16,000 Civil Servantsfor new or expanding Departments, and accommodation for another6,000 had been asked for. In addition, so long as it was impossibleto hand back the hotels which had been requisitioned, the influx ofCivil Servants to the towns affected was regarded as alleviating theposition to a very considerable extent. Indications had been given that further Civil Staffs were to be evacuated, and it would become very difficult to bold the position if any indication was given thatthese orders were being countermanded.Reference was also made to the desirability on general grounds of some of the less essential Civil Staffs, which had previously been located in London, being located in the provinces.Hie Prime Minister said that what he had in mind was that further evacuation under the Yellow Move should not take placemerely on the ground that such evacuation was a necessary preliminary to the Black Move. To the extent that evacuation of staff was based on other consi derations, that was a different matter.The Home Secretary said that he proposed to institute a thorough review of the whole position towards the end of the calendar year.The War Cabinet-Approved  the recommendations of the  Civil  DefenceCommittee, subject to Conclusion (a) being amended to read as follows : &apos;&apos; That, in view of the decision of the War Cabiuetthat a start should be made on the evacuation from
Air RaidProtection forEvacuatedGovernmentStaffs.15. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the civil defence Committee (W.P. (G.) (39) 88), covering a Memorandum bythe First Commissioner of Works containing specific proposals forair raid protection for evacuated Government Staffs (C.D.C. (39) 21).After the Home Secretary had explained the main points in theReport, the Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff raisedno objection to the provision of accommodation on the scalerecommended.The War Cabinet agreed That approval should be given to the proposals for air raidprotection for evacuated Government staffs set out in aMemorandum by the First Commissioner of Works(C.D.C. (39) 21) enclosed in the Report of the Civil DefenceCommittee (W.P. (G.) (39) 88), subject to the followingqualifications : (a) that, in implementing the policy, the First Commis-sioner of Works should give instructions that action should be taken unobtrusively, and that due regard should be paid to local air raid protection standards;and(5) that, in order to secure reasonable conformity with localpractice, the First Commissioner of Works should arrange with the Minister of Home Security forclose consultation between their respective Depart-ments.Unemployment 16.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theAssistance Minister of Labour (W.P. (G.) (39) 130) explaining that it wasBoard. proposed to make Draft Regulations to give effect to certainProposed proposals submitted by the Unemployment Assistance Board forIncrease increases in the scales of payment.   These increases amounted toin Scales of Is. in the weekly rate for each person of the age of 16 or over, and payment; of 6d. in the rate for each person under 16.It was explained that these proposals had been fully discussed by the Departments concerned and the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy, and that the view had been reached that theyshould be accepted.The War Cabinet :-Approved the action proposed in the Minister of Labour&apos;sMemorandum.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,-   December A, 1939.London of the staffs comprised in the &apos; Yellow &apos; move,further gradual transfers in that Move should be conducted as and when practicable, it being under-stood that each Departmental Minister concerned should determine what portions of the Staff of his department could be transferred from London without serious loss in efficiency.&quot;
