4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the War Cabinet telegram No. 89, dated the 4th November, from Mr. Osborne, His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Holy See, reporting that a German doctor, who had recently been in Italy for consultation, had told a friend of Mr. Osborne (an expatriate German Jew) that very considerable numbers of young German troops had had to be sent back from the Front for reasons of health. Intensive physical training, to which they had been subjected, combined with lack of nourishment and rest, had, while developing their bodies, left them with enfeebled stamina and powers of resistance. A great many had had to be replaced by older men, while they had returned to police and other duties on the Home Front, where they were a nuisance and menace to the population.

The War Cabinet took note of this information.

Italy. The recent changes in party and military posts. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 67th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had received several reports on the recent ministerial and military changes in Italy, which supported the views which we had already formed as to the political implications of these changes.

The Foreign Secretary read to the War Cabinet extracts from a letter, dated the lst November, from Sir Noel Charles, British Chargé d&apos;Affaires in Rome. It was stated in this letter that these changes had come as a surprise to everyone in Rome and it was known for a fact that most of the victims themselves had only heard of their fate at about 8 A.M. on the morning of the 31st October. The German Ambassador in Rome had been recalled on the 30th October for the purposes of consultation and, in reply to a suggestion by M. François-Poncet that Herr von Mackensen had probably been in a position to inform Herr Hitler of these changes, Count Ciano had stated that the German Ambassador had not been told anything
