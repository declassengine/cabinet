It had been necessary, however, towithdraw the ships temporarily in order to search for one of ourflying-boats, which had failed to return from a reconnaissance flightto the eastward of the Shetlands.A Danish ship had been mined in an area off the East Coast ofEngland which we had proclaimed dangerous. This was the secondDanish ship to be mined in these circumstances, although the danish government had been kept fully informed of all navigationalrestrictions. The Admiralty were making representations to the danish authorities in the matter.There had been a collision between two British merchant ships in the Irish Channel and one of the ships had sunk. A torpedo hadbeen fired at a French destroyer in the Channel and our huntingcraft had subsequently carried out an attack on a submarine in thevicinity. The result was not known.The War Cabinet took note of the abbve statement.The &quot; City ofmud.&quot;-;(previous reference:W.M. (39) 69thConclusions,Minute 3-)3.

Finland, Supplies of war material. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 69th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

5. The Chief of Naval Staff described to the War Cabinet the various routes by which supplies could be sent to Finland in the event of the all-sea route through the Baltie being stopped.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Finnish Minister had confirmed that Germany had been facilitating the passage of war material to Finland, and he (the Finnish Minister) was confident that this attitude would be maintained.

The Secretary of State for War said that six tanks were being constructed for the Finnish Government by Messrs. Vickers, and the War Office had now agreed to the issue of the necessary export licence.

The Prime Minister hoped that all possible steps would be taken to expedite the despatch of these tanks to Finland.

The Foreign Secretary said he understood that arms bought by Finland in this country would be shipped in Finnish and neutral ships. None of the arms released in this country for Finland had yet been shipped, but one consignment of French arms had gone to finland via Narvik.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

         ----------------

Bulgaria. German propaganda and trade.

6. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to an article in The Times of that morning in which complaint was made as to the scarcity of allied news, in contrast to the great volume of Germain news which reached that country. The article also mentioned that Germany was known to have promised Bulgaria about £500,000 worth of petrol and oil supplies (after Roumania&apos;s prohibition of further supplies, save against payment in foreign exchange), and that Germany had also promised to pay for about £1,000,000 worth of her purchases from Bulgaria in foreign exchange. Bulgaria had also been able to find a market in Germany for acorns and plum stones which were previously unmarketable. It seemed possible that by some ingenious currency device Germany was effecting tripartite trading arrangements with Bulgaria and Roumania.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that about a fortnight ago information had been received in the Foreign Office as to the sale of oil to Bulgaria, and enquiries had been made from our Minister in Sofia, but no answer had yet been received. He suggested that the Minister without Portfolio should be invited to look into the matter. He would furnish Lord Hankey with the information in the possession of the Foreign Office as to oil. He would also send to the Ministry of Supply the information about plum-stones, although the story that some special explosive was to be made therefrom sounded rather fantastic.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements, and approved the action proposed by the Foreign Secretary.

            --------------

The Balkans. Plan for the formation of a neutral bloc. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 69th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that, as contemplated in the Conclusion mentioned in the margin, he had conferred, on the previous afternoon, with Sir Ronald Campbell, Sir Percy Loraine and his departmental advisers, on the proposal made by the Roumanian Government to the Turkish Government for the establishment of a Balkan Pact of Neutrality (telegrams 704 and 705 of the 2nd November, from Angora). Lord Lloyd, who would shortly be leaving to visit Budapest, Sofia and probably Belgrade, had also been present at the discussions.


W.M.70(89).

It had been generally agreed :-

(1) that there was little prospect of progress being made for the establishment of a Balkan bloc, unless Roumania showed some disposition to meet Bulgaria&apos;s claims;

(2) that the wisest course would be to allow Turkey to handle the matter at the present stage;

(3) that we should go slow with Italy for the present in this matter, but should keep her informed of developments.

Sir Ronald Campbell had informed him that Yugo-Slavia was afraid to take a prominent part in the negotiations lest by doing so she might give Germany an excuse for accusing her of infringing her neutrality. On the other hand, Yugo-Slavia did not want to be left out of the negotiations.

The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to deal with the proposals made by the Roumanian Government to the Turkish Government for the formation of a Balkan bloc on the lines indicated above.

Italy. Visit of Field-Marshal Goering. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 67th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had no definite information as to the reasons for Field-Marshal Goering&apos;s forthcoming visit to Italy. His object might be either to intimidate Italy, or to endeavour to enlist Italy&apos;s support for some new peace proposals.

In reply to a suggestion that the opportunity might be taken of endeavouring to ascertain Italy&apos;s probable future policy, the Foreign Secretary informed the War Cabinet that both Sir Percy Loraine and Sir Ronald Campbell doubted whether any change in Italian foreign policy need be apprehended in the near future.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Spain.

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that Lord Lloyd had had a long discussion with General Franco, and was the first foreigner that the General had seen for several months. He had found General Franco full of German propaganda, including absurdities such as the alleged sinking of the Repulse and the Ark Royal, which had been officially denied on many occasions. The meeting between Lord Lloyd and General Franco had not been discouraging and he (the Foreign Secretary) was taking up with the Ministry of Information the question of strenghthening our propaganda in Spain.

Lord Lloyd had also had a conversation with the Cardinal Primate of Spain, who was violently anti-German, and had in particular taken the strongest possible exception to certain forms of propaganda in which the Germans had recently been indulging in Spain.

(39) 66).Fourth Periodical Report submitted by the Secretary ofState for Burma covering the period the 15th-31st October,1939 (Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 67).India and the(previous reference:W.M. (39) 60thConclusions,Minute 1;)12. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram, dated the3rd November, 1939, received from the Viceroy of India, which hadbeen circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for India(Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 70).The Secretary of State for India said that the substance of theViceroy&apos;s message was that, if th% opportunity occurred, he Wouldlike to bring into operation at a very early date the scheme of federation contemplated in the Government of India Act, 1935.It was hard to feel optimistic about this latest suggestion fromthe Viceroy. It might well be that the Princes could be induced to fall in with the suggestion; indeed, it came in the first place fromthe Dewans of Mysore and Baroda. In present circumstances,however, neither Congress nor the Moslem League would look at theproposal. The fact that the Princes were coming round to the ideaof Federation was a belated recognition of their own unwisdom in having made difficulties at an earlier stage over the terms of theiraccession. -. ;     - -The Secretary of State went on to saythat he had that morningreceived a further telegram from the Viceroy informing him thata letter had been received from the Congress leaders indicating that they would not co-operate with.us except on their own originalterms. A break with Congress now appeared inevitable. In anycase,-the new telegram seemed to have put the Federation proposalcompletely oat of court. He had already telegraphed to the Viceroyenquiring whether, in the light of -his new talegrcxm, he still il &quot;ohsdto proceed with ithat: -proposals y:^5&apos;- &apos;1In the course of discussion the following points emerged : (i) The scheme of Federation contained in the Act of 1935..... - -was one:-which, we should -still, wish to. see brought lato-operation, if the situation percn-t; ;d.

: of a Constituent- Assembly, without any outsideinterference. The Congress Party were now rigid&apos;inthis demand. All signs of their being willing to meet us half--wayhad, disappeared. .&apos;v   -(iv) On the communal issue, Congress recognised the existenceof important minorities, and the necessity for providingagreed safeguards for those minorities. They said,however, that agreement on the safeguards would never be obtained so long as we held the ring. It was a question- which India must settle for herself.(v) In accordance with the War Cabinet decision referred toin the margin, the Viceroy had now invited the leadersof the Congress Party and the Moslem League to meet him. The meeting had taken place a few dayspreviously. Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Rajendra Prasad had represented Congress and Mr. Jinnah the moslem league. The Viceroy had put to them the suggestionthat additional Indian Members might be appointed tothe Executive Council. The discussion had not advancedmatters, and at the end of it the Viceroy had suggestedthat the two sides should meet without him.(vi) The Viceroy had then written a letter to the two sides,setting out the substance of what he had said at themeeting and indicating that he would be prepared toconsider the appointment of additional Indian members to the Executive Council if the two sides could reach agreement on a solution on these lines.It was agreed to resume -the discussion at a special meeting of the War Cabinet to be held on Monday, the6th November, at 3 -15 p.m. In the meantime, the Secretaryof State for India undertook to circulate the new telegram received from the Viceroy, together with other relevantdocuments.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 4, 1939. *
