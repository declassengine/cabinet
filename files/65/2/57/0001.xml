Scandinavia.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 122ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : (a) A Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty on German and russian Designs on Scandinavia (W.P. (39) 172).(b) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on Assistanceto Finland and the Scandinavian Countries (W.P. (39)173).(c) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on the proposed communication to the norwegian and Swedish Governments (W.P. (39) 174).(d) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee in connectionwith the conclusions of the War Cabinet, at their meetingon the 22nd December, with regard to communications to be made to the Governments of Norway and Sweden(W.P. (39) 175).An account of the discussion and of the conclusions reached isgiven in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Finland.Supply of aircraft.(previous reference:2.   The Secretary of State for Air said that, in view of themanifest desire of the War Cabinet to give Finland all possible assistance, he was proposing to supply Finland with 12 long-nosedBlenheim bombers.   They had asked for 24, but we could not sparemore than 12 at the present time.   He would take up with theW.M. (39) 120th Chancellor of the Exchequer, if necessary, the subject of the paymentConclusions,      fQr these supplies of aircraft to Finland.   The Air Ministry were.Minute 8.)        examining the question of the transport of the aircraft to Finland,and it had been suggested that the Blenheims might be delivered in Scandinavia by air, being flown over by British crews in plain,clothes.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that therewould be no objection to British crews in plain clothes flying theaircraft over to Norway or Sweden.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 121stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Secretary of State for A ir said that the preceding five days had been relatively quiet as regards operations, though anumber of reconnaissances and sweeps over the North Sea had been necessary.Only three enemy aircraft had been reported as havingapproached or crossed our coasts. One of these had been engaged,but had made its escape in cloud.Fighter patrols over the Lowestoft fishing centre had been maintained in daylight whenever weather conditions had allowed.A patrol of the enemy seaplane bases had been carried out onthe 24th December, combined with the dropping of leaflets overHamburg and Bremen. On other nights the weather had interfered with this patrol.In consequence of reports received by the Admiralty it hadbeen considered possible that the enemy might attempt a navalsortie, and sweeps in force had been maintained by aircraft of bothCoastal and Bomber Commands on the 24th and 25th December,and reconnaissances had also been carried out on the 26th. Thesereconnaissances by day had swept an area west of Horn&apos;s Reef and north of the German minefield.During one of the patrols on the 24th a formation ofWellingtons had sighted some enemy minelayers and patrol vesselseast of the German mine area. Our aircraft had been heavily firedon by these vessels and had replied with bombs. These or similarvessels had been seen on the 26th December by a reconnaissance of[20568] b 2
Coastal Command. Our aircraft had again been heavily fired on and had replied with bombs, but no hits had been obtained by either side. :Coastal Command routine patrols and reconnaissances had been maintained except for some interference by weather.In France on the 22nd December a patrol of eight Messer-schmidts had suddenly dived out of cloud and attacked three of ourHurricane fighters which were on patrol on our side of the line.In the fight which had ensued two of our Hurricanes had been shot down. One enemy aircraft was believed to have been shot down andone other to have been heavily hit, but it had not been possible tofind the wreckage.Patrols off the Tyne and the Firth of Forth had been carriedout by moonlight on the night of Christmas Eve and Christmasmorning by our Coastal Command against the possibility of a navalraid. During these various reconnaissances no enemy vessels hadbeen sighted.A damaged submarine, H.M.S. Triumph, was being escortedback by patrols of Hudson aircraft.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 121stConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the previousfive days had been a quiet period. Secret sources had indicated thepossibility of a raid on the East Coast, and special precautions hadbeen taken.The Northern Patrol had been maintained.Twenty German merchantmen had been reported to be passingnorthward through the Great Belt on the morning of the25th December, but the searches which had been so far carried outhad failed to find this convoy.The German merchant ship steamship Windhuk (17,000 tons)was reported to have been taking in fuel at Santos on the22nd December. H.M.S. Shropshire was off Santos to intercept herif she sailed.The German merchant vessel steamship Gluecksburg(2,600 tons) had left Cadiz at 4-30 p.m. on the 26th, but, on sightingH.M.S. Wishart, who signalled her to stop, had made for the shoreand beached herself near Cadiz.On the night of the 26th December H.M.S. Triumph had strucka floating mine in the North Sea. She was able to move at 7 knots,and so was returning under her own power, escorted by fivedestroyers in addition to the Hudson aircraft previously mentioned by the Secretary of State for War.Steamship Pandora, which was to have been used as a blockship, had been mined off Blyth and had sunk, without casualties.On the 25th December steamship Stanholme (3,000 tons) hadbeen mined in the Bristol Channel and had been sunk. Thirteenof the crew were missing. On the 26th December steamship A dellen(8,000-ton tanker) had been mined off the North Foreland, but hadnot sunk. She had anchored for the night and was entering the thames that morning, and had reported that she was in no dangerand did not require help.Notwithstanding these sinkings, the past fortnight had been one of the most satisfactory periods since the war started, from thepoint of view of merchant shipping, and our shipping losses hadbeen relatively light,The anti-submarine trawler Lochdoon had not been heard ofsince the morning of the 26th December, when she had been reported on her way to sink a floating mine off Blyth. . It was feared thatshe was a total loss.Despite searches which had been made by ourselves and theFrench, no trace had been made of steamship Altmark, which was reported to have had 300 British prisoners on board.
(previous reference:W.M. (39) 117thConclusions,Minute 3.)The experiments for dealing with the magnetic mine were giving satisfactory results.The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinet detailsof the second Canadian troop convoy, and hoped that the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs would find it possible to make suitable arrangements for its welcome on the lines of the arrangements forthe reception of the first Canadian convoy.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 5.   The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that situation. there was nothing of special importance to report from the Western(Previous Front.Reference: The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.W.M. (39) 120thConclusions,Minute 5.)contraband control Service.Delays to shipping.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 79thConclusions,Minute 16.)(previous reference:W.M. (39) 122ndConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the invitation given by the War Cabinet to the Lord Privy Seal toprepare a Report in regard to the shipping position. He askedwhether the terms of the invitation could be extended to coverdelays to shipping caused by our Contraband Control Service. Hethought that various improvements could be made which wouldlessen these delays. &quot;&quot;&apos;The Prime Minister thought that it was hardly necessary tomodify the terms of the invitation given to the Lord Privy Seal bythe War Cabinet. But he asked the Foreign Secretary to communi-cate the points which he had in mind to the Lord Privy Seal.The War Cabinet took note of this arrangement.The white paper Policy inregard to palestine:attitude of theAmericanZionistOrganisation.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G.) (39) 161),regarding representations by the American Zionist Organisationabout His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy in Palestine and covering a telegram from the Foreign Office to Washington which had been dispatched, but on which action had been suspended at the requestof the First Lord of the Admiralty for the reasons given in his memorandum (W.P. (G.) (39) 163).The Colonial Secretary said that he had a suggestion whichmight shorten discussion.The proposals in the White Paper fell into three main headings; first, immigration, secondly, constitutional proposals, and,thirdly, regulation of land sales. The policy in regard to immi-gration had been in operation for nine months. Jewish opinion in Palestine, and he thought elsewhere, was reconciled to the policyand, in his view, there would be no difficulty in continuing to carry it out. In regard to the constitutional proposals, there could be noquestion of any advance at the present time. It was the third point which had given rise to the present criticisms. Legislation was in course of preparation for the regulation of land sales, and he was preparing a paper for the War Cabinet, which would not be ready for about a fortnight, as certain details still had to be settled withthe High Commissioner.His suggestion was that a shorter interim telegram should besent in reply to Lord Lothian&apos;s telegram No. 33, Saving, of the24th November (Annexure 1 to W.P. (G.) (39) 161) in order to
remove certain Jewish apprehensions, e.g., in regard to the cutting down of immigration, and that the telegram on the major issuesshould be postponed until the War Cabinet had had an opportunityof considering the paper which he would circulate.The Prime Minister observed that the protest from theAmerican Zionist Organisation covered two points, first, thatJewish immigration to Palestine as provided for under the white paper was to be restricted, and, secondly, that restrictions of landsales as recommended in the Woodhead Report were being carriedout. It would be desirable to deal as far as possible with these points in the interim reply.The Colonial Secretary said that assurances could be given thatthe rumours about immigration were incorrect, and that the white paper policy was being carried out. As regards the second point,it would be possible to say that the whole question was under con-sideration at the present time and that no decision had been reached,but that a further telegram would be sent as soon as a decision hadbeen taken. In the meantime it was not the fact that restrictions were in force. If it was ultimately decided to maintain the white paper policy, it would, of course, not be possible to satisfy theAmerican Zionist Organisation, but he thought that it might bepossible to modify their anxieties and to satisfy them on minorpoints.The War Cabinet agreed:(i) to invite the Colonial Secretary to prepare a draft interimreply to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington onthe lines indicated in the discussion, and to circulate it for the consideration of the War Cabinet;(ii) that further consideration of the matter should be post-poned until the Colonial Secretary was in a position tobring his proposals for the regulation of land sales beforethe. War Cabinet.The Balkans. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that at(Previous the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin it had beenBeference: agreed that he should send a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,W.M. (39) 120th Rome, informing him of the general policy which we proposed to conclusions, adopt in regard to the Balkans, and asking for his opinion as to the minute 9.)        method to be adopted in notifying the Italian Government of thepolicy proposed.   Since that date, two important developments had occurred : (i) Several telegrams had been received from Sir percy loraine in regard to Signor Mussolini&apos;s attitude to our. . Contraband Control measures. Mr. Rodd was on his way home with various suggestions which it would benecessary to discuss with the Ministry of economic warfare. In the meanwhile, on the advice of Sir percy loraine, the Master of the Rolls had postponed his departure for Rome. The moment was thus unpropitiousfor us to sound the Italian Government on the subjectof the Balkans. He (the Secretary of State) had there-fore reached the conclusion that it would be better forus to go ahead with the preparation of plans by the staffs,particulars of which he had obtained from the Chiefs.   . of Staff Committee, and to delay making an approach tothe Italian Government for, say, three or four weeks.In the meanwhile, it would be possible for us to takecertain diplomatic action in the Balkan countries andfor the French to continue their secret conversations in yugoslavia and Greece.
It mow appeared that M. Francois-Poncet, the french ambassador in Rome, had on his own initiative and ona personal basis on the 24th December, discussed the balkan problem with Count Ciano. M. Cambon, theCounsellor at the French Embassy, had shown him (theSecretary of State) the previous evening the telegram inwhich M. Francois-Poncet had reported this discussion to the French Government. M. Francois-Poncet hadopened the conversation by informing Count Ciano thathe was anxious to know what was likely to happen tothe Balkans; that he proposed to give him (Count Ciano)his own impressions and that he hoped that Count Cianowould do the same. The French Ambassador had goneon to say that it was evident in Paris that it would notbe long before Germany and the U.S.S.R. committed an act of aggression against Roumania, and that the Britishand French Governments had decided that they couldnot stand aside in that event, and would therefore opposesuch aggression. In this, he believed that the views ofthose Governments were analagous with the views heldby the Italian Government. If the situation were todevelop in this way, it was important that the Britishand French forces should not arrive too late. The forcesof those Governments were in Syria and elsewhere in theMiddle East, and it would take some time for them toreach the Balkans. The French and British Govern-ments wished to take certain preliminary measures, butthey were anxious not to do anything which might arouseunfounded suspicions in Italy. They hoped, indeed, tosecure the co-operation of Italy. What did Count Cianothink was likely to happen ? Did he believe thatRoumania was likely to be invaded at an early date andwould Italy allow the U.S.S.R. to seize Bessarabia?Would Italy be prepared in that event to defendRoumania, and, if so, would she be prepared to act inconjunction with the British and French?Count Ciano had replied that he did not believethat either Germany or the U.S.S.R. would invadeRoumania at an early date. Germany had given certainassurances on this subject to Italy, and the U.S.S.R.,who were fully occupied in Finland, where they had suffered a serious defeat, were unlikely to extend theircommitments at the present time. Moreover, Hungary,which had only recently been extremely nervous, nowfelt no immediate apprehensions. Italy would notdisinterest herself from the Balkans, which would,Count Ciano thought, naturally come together and forma bloc. If Bessarabia were invaded by the Soviet, italy would intervene. The question of Italy co-operating with the Franco-British-Turkish group obviously raisedmost delicate problems. He (Count Ciano) would,however, report to the Duce his talk with M. Francois-Poncet, employing the same purely personal basis. Hethought that too much haste might well be extremelydangerous. What appeared very difficult, or evenimpossible, to-day might prove relatively easy to-morrow.In reporting this conversation to the FrenchGovernment, M. Francois-Poncet had expressed the viewthat Count Ciano&apos;s advice was sound. There were atthe moment two dangers: first, that of acting tooquickly; and the second, that we might postpone actiontoo long. In his (M. Francois-Poncet&apos;s) opinion, theformer was the greater danger.    He added that he
proposed to revert to the.subject at a later interview with Count Ciano, for the object of eliciting furtherenlightenment on the views of the Italian Government.If the information reported by M. Francois-Poncet could be relied upon, he had been very successful in obtaining enlighten-ment as to the attitude of the Italian Government. In thecircumstances, he (the Secretary of State) thought it might be wise to telegraph to Sir Percy Loraine, who was no doubt aware ofM. Francois-Poncefs action, suggesting that he should not act atpresent at least on the detailed instructions despatched to him theprevious day (the 26th December, 1939), directing him to approachCount Ciano on the same subject.The Prime Minister thought that the best course would be tosend a telegram to Sir Percy Loraine informing him that we had had no knowledge of M. Francois-Poncefs action when drafting the instructions sent to him (Sir Percy Loraine), and that he(Sir Percy Loraine) would no doubt consider how and in what manner it would be wise for him to proceed having regard to theaction taken by M. Francois-Poncet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldtelegraph to Sir Percy Loraine accordingly.that their next meeting should be held on Thursday, the28th December, 1939, at 12 noon.*Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 27, 1939.* It was not in fact found necessary to hold a meeting on this date.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.War cabinet arrangements.9.   The War Cabinet agreed
