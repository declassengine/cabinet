The War Cabinet had before them the following paperscirculated by the Minister of Shipping : Memorandum  on   the   Shipping   Situation   (W.P. (G.)(39) 155).Memorandum on the Shipbuilding Situation (W.P. (G.)(39) 158).After an introductory statement by the Minister of Shipping,a general discussion took place in which the chief points made inconnection with the shipbuilding situation were as follows : (1) Approval had been given by the War Cabinet on theoccasion referred to in the margin to the principle ofmaintaining an annual output of mercantile ship-building, whether on Government or on private account,of about 1 million gross tons per annum.(2) Attention was drawn to the estimate in the Appendix toW.P. (G.) (39) 158 of 739,545 gross tons of new merchanttonnage to be delivered between the 1st January and the30th June, 1941. It was suggested that this figure ought not to be regarded as adequate.(3) It was explained that it was hoped that the rate of construc-tion of 1 million tons a year would be attained by the spring of 1940 and that large tramp steamers would be built in 6 and 7 months. In addition, if the necessaryraw materials could be made available, 8 large ships ayear could be constructed in Hong Kong.(4) The Admiralty shipbuilding demands were roughly equalat the present time to those of the Mercantile Marine.The most obvious method of securing an increase inmercantile construction would be by a diminution inAdmiralty construction. In particular, the Admiraltymight reconsider their requirements in small vessels.(5) Other important limiting factors were steel supplies andlabour supplies.(6) In certain cases the progress of construction work in ship-building yards was being impeded by work on repairs tovessels damaged by enemy action.;&apos;205291b 2
The shipping situation.Restriction ofimports.Import pro-grammes of thesupply depart-ments.The exporttrade.Education ofpublic opinion.The following points were made in discussion : (1) It was urged that the shipping situation was still capableof being improved by additional charterings of neutral vessels, and by the purchase of vessels in the UnitedStates, and that greater attention ought to be paid tothese aspects of the problem.(2) Was it certain that our existing tonnage was in every casebeing used to the best advantage; for example, could notvessels which now made three round voyages a year makefour round voyages a year ?(3) Considerable discussion took place on the thesis putforward on page 12 of W.P. (G.) (39) 155 that &quot;themain adjustments required are in the sphere of supply,not shipping.&quot; It was urged that such adjustments insupply might at any rate be postponed until moreconclusive proof had been furnished that the position could not be retrieved by making more tonnage available,or using the available tonnage to the best advantage.The War Cabinet were informed by the President of the Boardof Trade that measures for the restriction of unessential importshad been put into force immediately on the outbreak of war, andwere already more thorough than at any time in the Great War.They were used, not only to keep out goods which were not wanted,but also to bring goods under the control of the Ministries of Supplyand Food.The Minister of Shipping said that he was not altogethersatisfied as to the effect of these particular restrictions on theshipping situation, and that he would welcome a re-examination tosee if they could be made more effective.The President of the Board of Trade said that the restriction of non-essential imports was probably more important in its effecton the exchange than on the shipping position. From the shippingpoint of view, the import programmes of the Supply departments were the most important, as they covered goods of the more bulkykind, such as cereals, ores and timber, and he suggested that a review might make it possible for some reduction to be effected inthis direction. Measures were already being put into operation forsecuring larger quantities of home-grown timber, but unfortunately the quantities available were very much smaller than they had beenin the Great War.Discussion ensued as to the measures taken to ensure that rawmaterials imported for the manufacture of exports should be used only for that purpose.The President of the Board of Trade said that efforts to thisend were being made by the Minister of Supply, but that it was difficult to devise machinery which would achieve this purposeeffectively. It was very difficult, for example, to keep track of woolthroughout its many stages from the raw material to the finishedarticle, with the result that at the present time there was no shortageof woollen goods in the shops, while demands for goods for exportcould not be met.The Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed that the need formachinery for this purpose was fully realised, and that theCommittee under the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry ofSupply was making every effort to improve the position.There was general agreement that steps should be taken tobring the situation home to the public.   How should this be done?The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the survey of Economic and Financial Plans (under the chairmanship ofLord Stamp) was taking steps to draw up. a comprehensive statement
showing the demands of the Supply Departments in relation toour resources, with a view to preparing the public for the idea thatthere must be a great reduction in the consumption of importedcommodities. This was, of course, of vital importance from thepoint of view of exchange as well as of shipping. It was important that, with the least possible delay and at the same time as measures were being taken to increase our shipping resources and the efficiencywith which they were used, steps should be taken to educate thepublic in this way. In particular he was attracted by the suggestionon pages 13 and 14 of the Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping(W.P. (G.) (39) 155), that the case presented to the public should emphasise at the same time our small shipping losses and the factthat the increase of our war effort required us to devote more andmore shipping to war supplies and less to civilian goods.The Prime Minister said that he did not think it possibleto secure the desired result by advising the public how to spendtheir money, but only by seeing that there were no available suppliesof the goods which it was not desirable that they should consume.Apart from the other considerations which had been mentioned,if public demand were in excess of supply, inflation would follow.This was a matter which M. Reynaud had mentioned to him inParis and with which the French Government were very much concerned, as they did not think that we were doing enough toprevent inflation.It was important to educate the public generally as to the policywhich was necessary in this matter and as to the need for reducingthe consumption of non-essential goods, and he proposed in his speeches in the new year to take the line that the public must make up their minds to more severe restrictions and controls with thisend in view. We should, at the same time, press on with measures for securing as much shipping as we could get and with puttingboth our shipping and the supplies of imported goods to the best possible use.He thought that it would be of great assistance to the Ministersrepresenting the case to the public to have before them a compre-hensive picture of what was being done to meet all these needs. he therefore proposed to ask the Lord Privy Seal to prepare for theWar Cabinet, in consultation with the Ministers concerned and with lord Stamp, a report describing the measures actually in operation.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Staff strongly supported the recommendations in the Memorandum by the Ministerof Shipping (W.P. (G.) (39) 155), in view of the possibilities thatthe German campaign of mine-laying by aeroplanes might be furtherextended or that the East Coast ports might be bombed, or that military operations in new spheres might involve a further drain onour shipping.The War Cabinet-(a) Took note of the Memoranda by the Minister of shipping on the Shipping and Shipbuilding Situations (W.P. (G.)(39) 155 and W.P. (G.) (39) 158).(b) Accepted the view  that the problem confronting HisMajesty&apos;s Government would have to be attacked by the simultaneous use of the following methods : (1) the increase by every means in our power of theshipping tonnage available;(2) the use of that tonnage to the best advantage;(3) measures to &quot; restrict civilian consumption, and to utilise home resources to the utmost possible extent, and to use the economies to increase our stocks of absolutely vital supplies against theunknown hazards of hostile action and the inevitable increase of war demands &quot; (W.P. (G.)(39) 155, page 13).
(c) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to prepare for the War Cabinet,in consultation with the Ministers concerned and with lord Stamp, a report describing the measures actually in operation for making the best use of our shipping resources and of our imported supplies.History of theWar.Answer to begiven torequests forspecial facilitiesfor unofficialhistorians.3. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that theService Departments and a number of civilian Departments hadreceived requests for the grant of special facilities from Sir RonaldStorrs, who had been asked by a firm of publishers to write acontemporary history of the war to be published in quarterlyinstalments.As there were differences of opinion, he had thought that thematter (which had been discussed at the Military Co-co-ordination committee) should be brought before the War Cabinet.After some discussion, the War Cabinet agreed (a) That all Departments should adhere to the general practiceadopted in the Great War in this matter, namely, that special facilities should not be accorded to persons engaged in writing unofficial histories of the war.(b) That the Departments which had been approached bySir Ronald Storrs should inform him that in the face ofthis general rule it was regretted that no special facilities could be afforded to him in the preparation ofthe unofficial history of the war on which he was engaged.War Cabinet 4.   The  Prime   Minister   said   that  the   Secretary   wouldArrangements. communicate to Members of the War Cabinet a note setting out thearrangements which had been made to ensure that a panel of WarCabinet Ministers would be available at short notice throughout the periods in the Christmas Recess when full meetings of the WarCabinet would not be held.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 22, 1939.
