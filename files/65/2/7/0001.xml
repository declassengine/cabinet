India and the War. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 70th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

1. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Secretary of State for India setting out telegrams which had passed between the Viceroy and himself since the 31st October, Papers W.P. (G.) (39) 70, 71 and 73.

The Secretary of State for India said that we now had to deal with the simple fact that Congress had rejected our offer of share in the responsibilities of the Central Government of India, and that there was now nothing more for us to do, unless we were prepared to fall with the Congress demands for a declaration that India was a free and independent country, &amp;c. This he assumed to be out of the question. It would be noticed that Gandhi took no exception to the resumption by the Governors of the administration in the Provinces where the Congress Ministers had resigned, and was anxious to avoid civil disobedience. His attitude was, indeed, entirely friendly, but he was out of touch with realities and his optimism was probably ill-founded. It was far more likely that the Left Wing of Congress would make trouble and force us to take proceedings against them.

It would be noticed also that the Moslem League had not committed themselves in any way. He was pretty sure that the Punjab would remain sound, and probably Bengal also; but Congress would definitely not co-operate in any way, and in this they were probably influenced both by the absence of any spectacular Allied victory in the war, which made them think that our position was one of some difficulty, and also by the encouragement which they had received from certain quarters in this country. He therefore saw no alternative but to let things take their course.

The Lord Privy Seal agreed that the Congress demands could not be accepted. Our offers had gone very far, and the trouble now was simply the failure of Indians to agree among themselves. We should not, however, merely sit back as spectators, but should make every effort to see that as good as a job as possible was made of the administration of the Provinces under Section 93 of the Act, and that the best use was made of returning economic prosperity to carry through useful measures. He would also like even now to explore the possibility of proceeding further with all-India Federation. The Princes had woken up to the folly of their past opposition and might now be persuaded to co-operate with the Moslems, a start being made, perhaps, with Hyderabad. In that case it might be possible to make a beginning with Federation without the co-operation of Congress. It would be necessary to repeal that part of the Act basing election to the Central Legislature on the Provincial assemblies, but that course had in any case a great deal to be said for it.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that Congress had made our choice an easy one, as their terms were clearly unacceptable. It would be a pity to try to set up a formal Federation, which the Princes did not want, and which Congress would oppose. In any case we had said that we could not legislate on Indian constitutional matters during the war. Our interest was to maintain law and order and prosperity, and the Governors should therefore be encouraged to make the best possible use of their powers, and incidentally to restore the good name of British administration. We should encourage all the reliable elements in India and he did not then anticipate serious trouble from the Congress Party. We should thus improve both our own position and the condition of India, and should build up a basis of strength from which we might well make lasting concessions after the war.

The Chancelloer of the Exchequer agreed that it was quite impossible to comply with the Congress demand for the declaration set out on page 2 of Paper W.P. (G.), (39) 71, though he pointed out that it might well be argued that the self-determination claimed

[20287]
under heading (2) of that declaration was no more than the Dominion status which we had ourselves set as our aim for India. We must therefore take the other alternative of carrying on the government of the country and overcoming such opposition as might be met; but he feared that this might well be serious, as the notions of self-government had taken root too strongly and would almost certainly lead to campaigns of passive resistance and general social unrest. He thought that under present conditions Federation was almost impossible.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affais agreed that the Congress terms could not be accepted, but he thought

that we should be faced with a very difficult time, and that the position at the end of it would be worse rather than better. We had insisted that the Hindus and Moslems should come to an agreement on the Provincial issue as a first step, and had to meet the charge that we were following a deliberate policy of "divide et impera." India was engaged in a very serious struggle to achieve her unity and the attempt might very well fail. If we could take some active step to help her in that struggle, we should gain time, we should occupy the attention of Congress, and should have an answer to the charge that we were merely encouraging India&apos;s divisions in ourown interest. As a suggestion that might possibly be considered, he put forward the possibility of regrouping the Provincial units and incorporating some of the smaller States in them so as to form more homogeneous Provinces and to overcome the communal difficulties with which the Provincial Governments were faced. Legislation would indeed not be possible during the war, but we might send out a Mission composed of members of Parliament of all parties to discuss this plan with Indian Leaders, so showing that we were really anxious to help India towards the goal which all India wished to reach.

The Secretary of State for India said that he saw great difficulties in the proposal as the communities were interwoven to a large extent. He referred to the experiment made by Lord Curzon in dividing Bengal. This had resulted in an agitation which had continued for ten years until the original boundaries had in great measure been restored. There had always been sensitiveness to interference with boundaries. The Government of India were already working on certain proposals for the absorption into the Provinces of small States, where the rulers might be said to be virtually only large landowners. He felt that an attempt to get homogeneous Provinces would be extremely difficult. Something on these lines had been achieved in the new Province of Sind, but he doubted whether much could be done elsewhere withoutinsuperable difficulty.

Some discussion ensued on the military position. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that most of the Army &apos; was recruited in the Moslem areas in the North and North-West, whereas the non-fighting population case from the South and the East. It was pointed out that this was in part due to the recruitment policy of the Commander-in-Chief.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, if there were to be disturbances in India, it was most desirable that we should not be embroiled with all parties at the same time. It was essential to keep the loyalty of the police and the army.

The Lord Privy Seal said that he had no doubt it would be possible to create a large army and maintain our position but the position of Indian official would become extremely difficult and this might well seriously hamper day-to-day administration. They might well feel that, if and when Congress got into power they would be victimised.
W.M. 73 (39).

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he did not believe that the consequences of trouble would be so widespread as seemed to be anticipated. Even if the standard of administration fell in certain areas, the peasants who formed the great majority of the population would continue to fill the soil.

The Secretary of State for India said that there had been some appreciable improvement in the economic position, due to, e.g. the demand for jute, but it would be necessary to produce a war budget as there would be inevitable increase of expenditure. He understood that the Finance Member was finding considerable difficulty in devising means for raising the necessary funds. In the meantime the Provincial Governments would not be in a position to spend large sums of money.

The Secretary of State added that Congress had opposed Federation hitherto because it involved the inclusion of an autocratic element. The Right Wing of Congress were not so much opposed to Federation as their public statements implied. The Moslems, however, were very reluctant to agree to it, because they feared a permanent Hindu majority.

In the ensuing discussion general agreement was expressed with the view that it was most important, while taking a firm stand in support of the Viceroy in the maintenance of law and order, to make it clear that there was no intention to close the door, if Congress on their part were prepared to co-operate in the working of the Provincial Legislatures.

The Lord Privy Seal attached importance to the point made in paragraph 6 of the telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 4th November enclosed in W.P. (G.) 73, that Section 93 was the appropriate course, and that the use of this Section should be regarded, not as a sanction, but as an expedient to carry over a temporary period.

In the course of discussion the First Lord of the Admiralty advocated strongly on humane grounds the use of tear gas for dealing with crowds.

The Secretary of State for India said that there were supplies of teargas in India, but that in a large part of the country the police were untrained and the equipment was short.

The War Cabinet agreed:-

(1) that it was impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to accede to the demands of Congress for a formal declaration in the terms set out in the memorandum by the Secretary of State for India (Paper W.P.(G.) 39) 71):(2) that it was, therefore, necessary to envisage the possibility of a period of non-co-operation in which government in the provinces would be carried on under Section 93 of the Government of India Act, 1985:

(3) that it was essential that full support should be given to the Viceroy and to the Provincial Governors in taking the necessary measures for the maintenance of law and order.

(4) that it was most desirable that during the period of the operation of Section 93 the Viceroy and the Governors should encourage a forward policy in administration:

(5) that, while it was impossible to accede to the Congress demands, it was desirable, both from the point of view of opinion in India and elsewhere, that no step should be taken which would place any obstacles in the way of resumption of co-operation by Congress; and that any statement made should therefore be of a conciliatory character:
(6) that arrangements should be made for a Question to be put in the House of Commons on the situation and that the Secretary of State for India, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, should prepare a draft answer on the lines indicated in the discussion:

(7) that the Secretary of State for India should impress on the Government of India the advantages, from the humane point of view, of tear gas in dealing with riots.

Withdrawal of British Troops from India.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 58th Conclustions, Minue 6.)

2. In the course of discussion on the previous item the First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the suggestion which he had made at the Meeting referred to in the margin, that British troops should be brought back from India. He had not appreciated that there had been 77,000 British troops in India at the oubreak of the last war as against 42,000 at the outbreak of this. This altered the position, and he was prepared to modify his view, that further troops should now be withdrawn, and to accept the arrangements set out in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War dated the 28th October (18/1/2).

The War Cabinet agreed :-

(1) To accept the arrangements proposed foy the Secretary of State for War in regard to the withdrawal of British troops from India, viz.: a gradual interchange of personnel between units at home and those in India.(2) That the arrangements for a Ministerial Committee to consider the question of the withdrawal of British troops from India need not be proceeded with
