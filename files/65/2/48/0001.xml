The food position.Home. Foodproductionpolicy; Brewingand Distilling inWar-time.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 106thConclusions,Minutes 4and 5.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them (1) a Report of the Sub-Committee of the Home PolicyCommittee on (a) Home Food Production Policy, and(b) Brewing and Distilling in War-time (W.P. (G.) (39)141).(2) the Draft of a Statement to be made by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (W.P. (G.) (39) 142).The Lord Privy Seal said that the policy embodied in theReport was based on two main considerations. First, even if therewere no further sinkings, we should be short of shipping and ourexchange difficulties would increase. We must, therefore, restrictso far as practicable imports of food and feeding stuffs. Secondly,the ploughing-up campaign was not proceeding as well as had been hoped. Only a proportion of the 800,000-900,000 acres covered byploughing-up promises had been ploughed to date. It was therefore essential to put body into the programme so as to get a considerablylarger production in 1940 than in 1939. If things were allowed toproceed as at present, the production of 1940 was likely to be lessthan that of 1939.The objective was the 2 million acre programme as a minimum,but it was doubtful whether, owing to labour difficulties, that programme could be increased. It had been thought best to leave itto the farmers and the County Agricultural Committees to see thatthe land, when ploughed up, was used in growing crops best suited to particular soils, &amp;c.The Report also emphasised the necessity for ensuring to farmers a guaranteed market for the extra production in regard totheir staple cash crops, e.g., potatoes; it was also essential to impress upon Parliament the necessity of avoiding after the warany sudden and drastic changes in agricultural policy, such as had occurred as a result of the repeal of the Corn Production Act afterthe Great War.Unless there was a moderate rise in agricultural price levels,the increased production would not be realised. It was estimatedthat increases on present prices varying from 7^ per cent, to 15 percent, would be necessary, and these increases would be reflected in arise in the cost of living. This must be accepted as inevitable unless we were prepared to subsidise agriculture on a very wide scale. Itwas proposed to undertake in the New Year a campaign explaining the reasons for instituting rationing, and pressing for increasedhome production of food. If this was to be successful, the farmersmust be in full accord with the Government&apos;s policy, and pricesmust be settled quickly.The conclusion was also reached that, both on political andfinancial grounds, it would be better to take no action in regard tobrewing, though this might have to be reconsidered later. Asregards distilling it was proposed to restrict, during the twelvemonths ending the 30th September, 1940, the amount of grainavailable for distilling to the quantity which would enable thedistilleries to produce one-third of the amount of spirits produced in the preceding twelve months. This proposal would enable us toretain our good will in the American market, and would give riseto no serious revenue problems.The Prime Minister observed that in paragraph 4 of theStatement it was said that &apos;&apos; The Government recognises that, ifthe desired increase in home production is to be secured, a higher level of prices will be necessary for agricultural products generally.&quot;How was it proposed to secure this rise, and how was the rise to belimited 1The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries explained thatcattle prices would be negotiated between the producers and theMinistry of Food, and an agreed price list would be published.  As[20492] b 2
regards feeding stuffs consumed on the farms, prices need not befixed, and there would be a free market for beans, peas, &amp;c.Wheat prices were already determined by statute, and aminimum price for oats had also been fixed.The Minister of Food observed that barley and oats were nowrealising very high prices.The Prime Minister enquired on what basis the County Agri-cultural Committees would advise the farmers to use the increasedploughed-up acreage?The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that the farmers would be advised to grow wheat or potatoes where the land was best suited for those crops. If the land was best suited forpasture, the farmers would be advised to i-e-seed it to good grassleys. Farmers would not be pressed to grow7 wheat or potatoes onunsuitable land.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the financial aspectsof the proposals had caused him anxiety, but he had come to theconclusion that tlhe Statement was one which the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries should be authorised to make, and thatthe War Cabinet must face the fact that, if it was necessary toincrease home production, some moderate increase in the level ofprices was inevitable. If prices rose to the extent indicated in theReport, and if the increased cost was to be passed on to the consumer,the result might be a rise of some 4 points in the cost of living.If the rise could be limited to 4 points, we would be well out ofthe difficulty. At the same time he had been pressing the TradesUnion Congress to refrain from demanding increases of wages onthe ground of rises in the cost of living, and if it was now announcedthat food prices were going to rise, the position vis-a-vis organised labour would be embarrassing.The First Lord of the Admiralty enquired whether it mightnot be cheaper on the whole for the Exchequer to avoid a rise inthe cost of living, by subsidising the agricultural productsconcerned.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as regards milk,he proposed that the Treasury should assume the burden of theincreased price of milk during the next few months. The increasein prices of other commodities would not in general occur untilwell into 1940.The Secretary of State for Scotland drew attention to the verygreat rise in the price of oats and barley which was causing anxietyamong consumers in Scotland. Farmers were expecting that steps would be taken to restrict prices and he was in consultation withtlhe Minister of Food as to the action to be taken in this direction.The Secretary of State for War drew attention to the proposal in paragraph 12 of the Report that during the next 9 months mencertified by the County Committees as needed for - the fulfilment of the food production campaign should not be withdrawn from agriculture by the Fighting Services. He urged that we should maintain unimpaired the system of reserved occupations and notundermine that system by giving other bodies, such as county committees, the power to make further exceptions. At present noagriculturist over 21 could be taken for the Army, and at an earlier stage he had proposed that men of from 18-20 should be enlistedand then be employed in agriculture. Rather than give discretion inthe matter to the Agricultural Committees he would prefer to lower the age for agricultural exemption from 21 to 20.In the course of discussion it was pointed out that this question was to be considered on an early date by the Man Power Sub-Committee.   It would be unwise to adopt too rigid a rule on the
subject, particularly in view of the large number of those small farmers who could not afford hired labour, but who ran their farmswith the help of their families.The War Cabinet :-(i) Approved the recommendations for the Home Food Produc-tion Policy and Brewing and Distilling in War-time asset out in paragraph 15 of the Report of the Food PolicySub-Committee of the Home Policy Committee (W.P.(G.) (39) 141). These proposals are attached to these conclusions as an Annex,(ii) Remitted to the Man Power Priority Sub-Committee forconsideration and decision the question raised in para-graph 12 of the Report regarding the temporary retention-tion in agriculture of men who, during the next 9 months,might be withdrawn for service in the Fighting Forces.(iii) Took note that the Agricultural Ministers would consult with the Minister of Food as to the action to be takento fix a maximum price for oats, and to exercise controlover the distribution of barley supplies.(iv) Approved the Statement of policy to be made in the debate on the Adjournment of Parliament that day by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries in the form ofthe draft annexed to W.P. (G.) (39) 142.Small Arms 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the ChiefsAmmunition.     of Staff on the Small Arms Ammunition Situation (W.P. (39) 158).The Secretary of State for Air explained that the Chiefs ofStaff were very anxious that the War Cabinet should be made aware of the serious position which confronted us. It was for this reason that the Chiefs of Staff had desired their Report to be laid beforethe War Cabinet as a matter of urgency. It was agreed, however,that the arrangements to be made for increasing our productionof small arms ammunition should be suitably examined by theMilitary Co-ordination Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that emergency measures should be taken even at the cost of heavy expenditure, ifnecessary in dollars, to rectify the immediate shortage that was anticipated. The Chiefs of Staffs long-term proposals, however,raised considerations which he would like the Military Co-co-ordination committee to consider when they were examining the Report. Itwas in his view dangerous to assume that the expenditure of small arms ammunition would necessarily increase in exact proportion to the increase in our forces.The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the small arms Ammunition Situation (W.P. (39) 158).(ii) Agreed that the Report should be examined by the military co-operation-ordination Committee as a matter of urgency, witha view to immediate steps being taken to overcome the anticipated shortage of ammunition in the near future,and to the submission of recommendations for the long-term production policy.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 113thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Secretary of State for Air said that, although the weather on the previous night had been satisfactory for mine-laying operations, no German mine-layers were reported to have visitedour coasts.Eight bombers had been sent out to maintain an offensive patrol,four over the Sylt bases and four over Borkum and Norderney,working in relays. The patrols had been maintained with a slightinterruption, due to weather, from 1600 hours until 0200 hours.
The first aircraft which had left for Sylt had observed a forceof seven ships proceeding at full speed in a Northerly direction.This appeared to be a force sent out from Wilhelmshaven to escortin the damaged German warship (see Minute 5). The patrols had reported that no activity had taken place at the German float planebases. Slight anti-aircraft fire had been encountered during the night.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.naval operations.Naval Action offthe Plate: the admiral GrafSpee.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 109thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a naval action had taken place on the previous day between three British cruisers and the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee (six 11-inch,eight 5-9-inch guns). It now turned out that it was this vessel,and not the Admiral Scheer as had been thought, which had beenin the South Atlantic. The British force was under the command of Commodore Harwood and consisted of the A chilles (eight 6-inch guns), A jaw (eight 6-inch guns) and Exeter (six 8-inch guns). TheGerman ship had concentrated her fire on H.M.S. Exeter. AllH.M.S. Exeter&apos;s guns except one had been put out of action, herspeed reduced to 18 knots, and she had been forced to fall out ofthe action. H.M.S. A fax had had two of her four turrets put outof action. The two 6-inch cruisers had only broken off the actionwhen they were running very short of ammunition. They had thenkept in touch with the Graf Spee, which had run for the River Plateand had entered neutral territorial waters during the night. Shewas now at anchor off Montevideo with our two cruisers watching the entrance to the river.The First Lord of the Admiralty contrasted the offensive spiritshown by Commodore Harwood with the lack of enterprise shownin somewhat similar circumstances at the beginning of the last war when the Goeben was allowed to escape.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence voiced the unanimous view of the War Cabinet that the British cruisers had fought a very gallant and brilliant action.The First Lord described the dispositions which were beingmade to ensure the destruction of the Graf Spee. The cruiserCumberland (eight 8-inch guns) was on the way from the falkland islands and would arrive later in the day. Stronger forces were also proceeding to the scene with all despatch and would arrive inthe course of a few days.The German Minister in Montevideo had issued a statement to the Press stating that the Graf Spee had 36 killed and 60 wounded&apos;&quot;&apos; mostly because the British ships had used mustard gas shells.&quot;He had also stated that the ship bad landed the Captains of sixBritish merchant ships.The Chief of Naval Staff observed that the Admiralty had estimated that the German raider in the South Atlantic had sunksix British ships. Nothing was known of their crews and it waspossible that they had been landed on an island such as Tristanda Cunha.   Search of the possible islands was being arranged.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the First sea lord said that the Graf Spee was entitled to remain in a neutralport until the necessary repairs could be made to render her fit for sea, but not of course fit for action. The ship must be very short of ammunition and the Naval Attache had been warned to watch the position very closely. If the ship did not leave neutralterritorial waters as soon as she was fit for sea, it was the dutyof the neutral to intern the crew and to dismantle essentialmachinery in the ship and to remove the breech-blocks from the guns.
5. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a report hadbeen received on the previous afternoon from the submarine Salmon(the submarine which had sighted the Bremen two days earlier)that a German Fleet, consisting of 2 battle-cruisers, 2 8-inch cruisers, 2 smaller cruisers and 8 to 10 destroyers was in the north sea on a westerly course. The Salmon had sighted the Fleet at1000 hours in the Dogger Bank area. She had fired her full outfitof torpedoes and had obtained a hit on the cruiser Leipzig. Owingto depth charge attacks by the German destroyers, the Salmon hadbeen unable to make her report until 4 hours later. InterceptedGerman signals tended to confirm that a damaged ship was making for home.High appreciation was expressed at the conduct of theCommander of the Salmon.In view of the possibility that the German Fleet intended tocarry out a tip-and-run raid against the coast, all coastal defenceshad been put on the alert and a force of destroyers had been sent out to endeavour to carry out a night attack on the German Fleet.Appropriate steps had been taken to ensure the safety of East-coast and Scandinavian convoys. Suitable dispositions, in which theFrench Navy were co-operating, had been taken to safeguard impor-tant Atlantic convoys, should the German Fleet intend to breakout into the Atlantic. Nothing further had so far been heard ofthe German Fleet. It was possible that, knowing that they wouldhave been reported by the submarine which attacked them, theFleet had returned to harbour.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff informed the War cabinet of the action being taken by Bomber, Fighter and Coastal Commandsto endeavour to locate and attack both the German Fleet and thedamaged ship.Referring to the warning which had been sent out to the defences on the East coast, the Minister of Home Security saidthat the Home Security War Room did not appear to have been kept fully informed of what was taking place.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that it was essentialthat when, for example, the Admiralty War Room received informa-tion which required action affecting the other Service departments and civil defence, the fullest information should be passed at theearliest possible moment to the other War Rooms. On the previous day the Admiralty had to deal, not only with the situation arisingfrom the presence of the German Fleet in the North Sea, but atthe same time with the movements and dispositions occasioned bythe Naval action in the South Atlantic (see previous Minute). Itwas no doubt partly due to the great pressure of the moment thatthe necessity of keeping the Home Security War Room informed the naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 113thConclusions,Minute 2.)German fleet in the north sea.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the British Minister atMontevideo should be given the fullest possible advice on theposition.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs agreed and said thathe would send a telegram as soon as possible in consultation withthe Admiralty.The War Cabinet :-Took note of this statement, and expressed their highappreciation of a very gallant action.
had been over-looked. He would, however, go closely into the matterand ensure that any gap which might exist in the organisation was closed.General. The anti-submarine trawler Lord Lloyd, which had beenhunting a U-boat off the North Foreland, had been joined by the anti-submarine trawler Lady Else and was continuing the attack.Two enemy aircraft had flown high over the Firth of forth the previous day.Attacks on The steamship Deft ford (4,100 tons) with a cargo of iron oreShipping. had been torpedoed and sunk off the Norwegian coast insideterritorial waters. This was the third ship in three days whichthe Germans had sunk inside neutral territorial waters, and he (theFirst Lord) felt that we had the strongest possible case forretaliatory action. He was proposing to submit a Memorandum tothe War Cabinet as to the steps which we should take.The following additional shipping losses had occurred in theprevious twenty-four hours : A British trawler sunk by a mine.   (Only one survivor).Belgian steamship Rosa (1,350 tons)- sunk by a mine offthe Tyne.Danish steamship Magnus (1,339 tons)- sunk by a mine offPeterhead.   (Only one survivor.)The Tyne had been temporarily closed to shipping and mine-sweeping operations were now in progress.(Previous In the course of discussion, the view was expressed that it was reference:. of the utmost importance that steps should be taken to draw theW.M. (39) 113th attention of the whole world, by means of repeated propaganda,Conclusions, to the frequent sinkings of neutral ships as the result of action by minute 3.) Germany and to the callous way in which neutral seamen were treated.The War Cabinet: (i) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty would take steps to ensure that Naval information which affected theCivil authorities was communicated to the Home SecurityWar Room.(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, in association withthe Minister of Information, to arrange for widespread and repeated diffusion of information as to sinkings of neutral ships and the inhumanity of German methodsof sea warfare.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 113thConclusions,Minute 4.)Finland.Invasion by theU.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 113thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for War said that the position onthe Western Front remained unchanged.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.7. The Secretary of State for War said that, according toPress reports, fighting was continuing in the Karelian Isthmus,with heavy casualties among the Russians. It was probable thatthe Russian troops in this area had been further reinforced.
Seizure of enemy Exports.The Case ofthe S.S.Sanyo Maru.(previous kef erence:W.M. (39) 113thConclusions,Minute 10.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that information had been received from the Admiralty early that morning that the S.S. Sanyo Maru was probably leaving Rotterdamthat day. A copy of her manifest had been received, which showed that nearly all her cargo was consigned to the Japanese Army and navy or to firms under their control. The goods consisted mostlyof mechanical apparatus, but included a quantity of sulphate ofpotash.The Foreign Secretary then read to the War Cabinet a record of a conversation which Captain Knox, the head of the Prize CourtDepartment of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, had had theprevious afternoon with M. Okamoto of the Japanese Embassy.M. Okamoto had said that, having furnished particulars of theGerman cargo of the Sanyo Maru, he imagined there would be no necessity for her examination at a Contraband Control Base. Hehad been told that this would be necessary and that we could not allow exemption to any ship known to be carrying German cargo.M. Okamoto had explained that it would make it difficult for Japanif Germany thought that she was obeying British orders for controlof German exports. He had added that they were anxious for theship to sail on the morning of the 15th, but that it was their intention in any case to sail on that day and desired to conceal the movements of the ship from the German Naval Authorities.M. Okamoto had made enquiries as to the safest route, and saidthat, if the ship was sunk in obeying British instructions to proceedto a base, the Japanese Government would hold the british authorities responsible. To this the reply had been given that thesafest thing for the Sanyo Maru to do was to remain at Rotterdam.The Foreign Secretary said that, although the documentsshowed that full payment had been made for the goods in every case, yet we were in possession of information that this was not actually a fact.The question now arose as to what treatment was to be accorded to this ship in view of the assurances already given tothe Japanese that she would be subject only to a cursory examina-tion (though those assurances had been given before the secret information had been received that her cargo included &quot; secretnaval goods &quot;) and in the light of our policy of avoiding trouble with Japan at the present moment. He thought the enquiries bythe Japanese regarding the safest route and their statement thatthey wished to conceal her movements from the Germans weresignificant and did not fit in with the supposition that the cargocontained sinister machines for use in Far Eastern Waters. he added that on the whole he was inclined to allow the ship to go through our control with a purely formal examination.It was suggested that, if this was done, it might be said thatwe were relaxing the Order in Council in favour of German goodscarried in Japanese ships.Sir Frederick Leith-Ross said that it had been decided to apply the Order in Council with leniency at the outset, and for the timebeing not to detain cargo which had been paid for at the dateof the Order in Council, provided it was shipped before the1st January, 1940.. In this particular case, however, the Japanesestatement that the goods had been paid for before the 27th Novemberhad not been proved. He thought that either the ship might beallowed to proceed, or the Japanese should be informed that, owingto the complexity of the cargo, it would be necessary to send herinto port for examination.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that we should tell the Japanese quite frankly that we had secret information that the cargo of the Sanyo Maru might not be all that it pretended to bein the manifest, and suggest to them that, if they could not tellus the exact nature of the cargo, a search would have to be made.[20492] c
Doubt was expressed as to what reliance could be1 placed onsuch an assurance, and it was suggested that it would be safer tomake a thorough examination of the cargo. Japan had treated usroughly in the past and it might not do any harm to mete outrough treatment to the Sanyo Maru.The Prime Minister said that it might be possible to adopt thesuggestion of the Minister without Portfolio. The Japanese couldbe told that the question whether the ship was examined would depend on the information supplied as to the nature of the cargo,but in the meantime the ship should sail. In this event, he thoughtthat the Japanese, fearing that a thorough search might be made,would not risk putting the &quot; secret naval goods &quot; on board, and thatwe could then safely risk letting the ship through, after a briefexamination.The Foreign Secretary was doubtful of the wisdom of informing the Japanese that we had received secret information about the cargo. Before coming to a decision he would like to make enquiries into this aspect of the position.The War Cabinet: Deferred further consideration of this matter until their meeting to be held at 4-30 that afternoon.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 14, 1939.
ANNEX.The Food Position (Minute 1).Recommendations of the Food Policy Sub-Committee of the Home PolicyCommittee (W.P. (G.) (39) 141, pages 6-8).Home Food Production Policy.THAT the proposals contained in Appendix 1* for increasing home foodproduction in 1940 and thereafter should be approved in principle, and inparticular (a) That approval should be given to the scheme for ploughing up at least2,000,000 acres of second and third rate grasslands with a view totheir being sown to crops or reseeded straight away to good grass leys.(b) That the policy should be directed to a general increase of productivityrelated to our present farming systems as outlined in paragraphs 6-8of Appendix I.(c) That, if this policy is to be successful, it is essential that there should bea moderate improvement in the general price level as explained inparagraphs 10-12 of Appendix I.(d) That it will also be necessary to ensure to farmers, whether the war endsin 1940 or not, a guaranteed market for the extra production whichthey are being called upon to undertake in regard to their staple cashcrops, and further to assure them that the transition from war-timeto peace-time conditions will be effected with full regard to thenecessity for avoiding sudden and drastic changes in agricultural policy.(e) That the County Agricultural Committees should be authorised toundertake cultivations on behalf of farmers, who are unable to finance the necessary initial outlay, beyond the limit of  2 an acre and to recover their expenditure after the harvest.(/) That the measures in paragraph 16 of Appendix I should also beadopted, viz. :  (i) drainage of land which is potentially fertile, but is at presentwaterlogged;(ii) authority to County War Agricultural Executive Committees ona more general scale than hitherto to undertake or finance the cultivation of of derelict or semi-derelict land which areto be found in many counties;(iii) special measures in aid of hill sheep farmers, including firmassurances as to the price of wool in 1940, and possibly special assistance in regard to improvement of pastures;(iv) the continuation of the  2 an acre subsidy for ploughing-uppermanent grassland beyond the 31st March, 1940, with a viewto a further expansion of production for the harvest of 1941.(g) That a statement in the form agreed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Lord Privy Seal and the Agricultural Ministers, covering as muchas possible of Ihe home production policy, should be submitted to WarCabinet for approval on the 14th December, with a view to its beingannounced in Parliament later on that day.Brewing and Distilling in War-time.(i) That it is at present inexpedient on social and other grounds to reducethe supply of barley needed by&apos; the brewing industry, and that suppliesof barley should be made available to that industry sufficient to enable it to maintain, during the brewing year ending the 30th September,1940, the same rate of output as during the year ended the30th September, 1939&apos; The use of maize, however, for brewing shouldbe prohibited.
Doubt was expressed as to what reliance could be1 placed onsuch an assurance, and it was suggested that it would be safer tomake a thorough examination of the cargo. Japan had treated usroughly in the past and it might not do any harm to mete outrough treatment to the Sanyo Maru.The Prime Minister said that it might be possible to adopt thesuggestion of the Minister without Portfolio.

The use of maize, however, for brewing shouldbe prohibited.
(ii) That in order to safeguard the seed position in 1940 steps should be takento obtain a lien on some part of the stocks of home-grown barley,suitable for seed purposes, already purchased by brewers or maltsters.Any stocks of barley taken for this purpose should be replaced in due course by imported barley.(iii) That in view of the serious shortage of feeding-stuffs the amount of grainmade available to distilleries during the 12 months ending the30th September, 1940, should be limited to such quantities as willenable the distilleries to produce in that period one-third of thequantity of whisky and other potable spirits produced in the12 months ended the 30th September, 1939. This rate of production would be sufficient to safeguard future export requirements.(iv) That the Ministry of Food should be authorised to bring supplies ofhome-grown barley under full control as soon as possible, in order to achieve these objectives, as well as to control the amount of barleypurchased by brewers and distillers for carry-over into the year1940-41, and to facilitate the direction of barley supplies into theappropriate channels,(v) That the form of control should empower the Ministry of Food to acquiredistillers&apos; existing stocks of barley and maize to the extent that theyare in excess of their estimated needs (as defined in (iii) above), andalso, if necessary, to acquire stocks of barley in the hands of brewers,maltsters and merchants to the extent that those stocks may prove tobe in excess of requirements for this season&apos;s brewing and for areasonable carry-over for the 1940-41 season,(vi) That the Ministry of Food should consider, in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned, the question of making gin from potato andother spirit in order to prevent the depletion of existing stocks of maturing whisky.
