W.M. 101 (39).

The Air Situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 100th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

 1. The Secretary of State for Air said that a report had been received from H.M.S. Keith, the previous morning, that an object thought to be a mine, had been seen to drop from an aircraft in the Thames Estuary. To counter the possibility of minelaying by aircraft by day in the Thames Estuary, a standing fighter patrol had been instituted over that area during daylight hours.

 Three Wellingtons had carried out a sweep over the North Sea, in the area of Terschelling and Sylt. Two destroyers and four mine-sweepers had been seen 30 miles North East of Terschelling. The aircraft had prepared to attack and had been engaged by the ships, which had not replied to the recognition signal made by the aircraft. The aircraft had not, however, released their bombs because they had observed that the destroyers were displaying on their decks the British marking of the day. Subsequent investigation had shown that these were enemy destroyers bearing our marking of the day.

 The Chief of the Air Staff said taht this matter was being further investigated, and it was hoped to improve the means of recognition between ships and aircraft.

 The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that it was comparatively simple for an enemy aircraft to sight one of our ships early in the day, and to report back the markings displayed. A system was in operation whereby the Admiralty gave the Air Ministry every day an area in which no British ships would be operating. Anything found in that area, therefore, must be enemy.

 The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.



The Naval Situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 100th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

 2. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff gave the War Cabinet information regarding the disposition of the Fleet.

 In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that the enemy ships which had sunk the Rawalpindi were thought to have been the Deutschland, and a cruiser of the Leipzig class. The possibility of their having been battle cruisers could not, however, be entirely excluded. They were now delieved to be on the North Russian Coast.

 The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence enquired whether they were being pursued.

 The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that the information available was not very definite, and the necessity for refuelling certain of our ships had prevented their being sent after the raiders for the time being.

 The submarine Traid would probably be leaving Norwegian waters that day.

 One British ship, of 4,500 tons, had been mined near the Tongue Lightship, and one Finnish ship had been sunk, probably by torpedo. The British ship which had been sunk should never have passed near the Tongue Lightship. The Admiralty controlled the movements of all merchant shipping, but occasionally the Masters of ships disregarded their orders.

 The Prime Minister referred to the rumour that the Germans planned large-scale air and sea operations against our shipping for the 4th December, to celebrate the coming into force of our embargo on German exports. He did not attach much importance to reports of this nature, but he thought it would be unwise to disregard them entirely. He suggested that special steps should be taken on that day to safeguard the shipping congregated in the Downs, and at Kirkwall. It was agreed that this should be done.

 The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Magnetic Mines.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 100thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff gave the War Cabinet an account of the progress being made with measures to counter themagnetic mine.Various devices were being developed, which would explode the mines satisfactorily, but he thought that the most promising line ofaction would be in the direction of making ships immune. this might be done by counteracting the magnetic properties of the ships,so that the mechanism of the mine would not be operated when theypassed over it. It was known that ships built in the Southernhemisphere, which had magnetism of the opposite polarity, did not operate magnetic mines; and it was believed that the Germans hadfitted their own ships with some device for achieving this object.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothingSituation. of importance to report from the Western Front.(Previous ji^e poreign Secretary referred to a report of German troopReference: movements from the Western Front towards Vienna.W.M. (39) 100thConclusions, The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he Minute 4.) had no information of any such movement.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Finland.Invasion by soviet Union.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 100thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Secretary of State for War said that reports fromFinnish sources made claim to some success in withstanding theRussian invasion in the South. There was no doubt that theRussians had made considerable progress in the North, had capturedPetsamo, and had reached the Norwegian frontier. The nickelmines were reported to be on fire. There was even a report thatthey had actually entered Norway.There had been further air raids on Helsingfors, Lahti andTammerfors.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Russian air raids had been carried out by flights of from 7 to 10 aircraft, flying ata great height. Their bombing had been inaccurate, and manycivilians had been killed. The Finnish air force was very small,though it contained a few British and Italian aircraft.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Soviet Union.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 97thConclusions,Minute 7.)The invasion off inland asaffectinggeneral policy inregard to theU.S.S.R.6. In connection with the previous Minute, the War cabinet considered the possible implications of the Russian invasion off inland. In the course of the discussion the principal points which emerged were as follows : (i) Russian expansion in the Baltic would have no directadverse effect upon the Allies, and might indeed sowdissension between the Russians and the Germans. Onthe other hand it might be the prelude to further Russianexpansionist schemes, which might develop later inSouth-East Europe and in Asia, and would be to our disadvantage.(ii) The Chiefs of Staff had consistently advised against being drawn into war with Russia; but if Russian aggressionoccurred in South-East Europe, we might be forced to declare war upon her whether we liked it or not.
Belgium.Pursuit ofGermanAircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 92ndConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for Air on the Pursuit of German Aircraftentering Belgium from France (Paper W.P. (39) 144).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that theproposed communication to the Belgian Government correspondedto that already made by the French without consulting us, exceptthat we proposed to quote specific instances of German violations of belgian territory, and also that we should say that we intended touse the right only very sparingly and in the event of close pursuit.In fact, penetration of Belgian air would be limited to a depth of 10 kms., but no mention of this figure would be made in the communication.Some discussion ensued on the wisdom of stating that we intended to use the right of pursuit &quot; very sparingly.&quot; It was urgedthat if we had the right to pursue at all, it should be used on everyoccasion. The Germans were flying both ways over Belgian territoryregularly. Further it was doubtful whether the inclusion of these words would make the communication any more palatable to theBelgian Government, whose attitude would be determined by our action rather than by the terms of our communication.The War Cabinet .-Approved the proposed communication to the BelgianGovernment contained in Paper W.P. (39) 144, subject tothe deletion of the words &quot; very sparingly, and, in anycase,&quot; in the last sentence of paragraph 10.(iii) In view of this possibility there would be every advantage in making it quite clear to Signor Mussolini that westrongly disapproved of Russia&apos;s action in Finland.Such a communication should be made in such a way asto lead Signor Mussolini towards the idea of co-operating with us in the defence of Italian interests in the Balkans,in the event of Russian aggression in South-East Europe.In this connection attention was drawn to telegram No. 835from our Ambassador in the United States of America, reporting that the State Department had evidence that Russia hoped to settle the Finnish question rapidly in order to obtain a free hand to dealwith the Balkan question.(iv) It would be equally desirable to take the opportunity ofpointing out to the Japanese the worthlessness of anyagreements made with Russia. The Japanese might be particularly receptive of such an idea owing to theiraffinity with the Finns,(v) Indignation with Russia was likely to increase in thiscountry, and it might be difficult politically to avoid amore open condemnation of her action in Finland inview of its similarity to German aggression in Poland.The War Cabinet agreed : To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for suitable representations to be made to theGovernments of Italy and Japan on the lines suggestedunder (iii) and (iv) above.
broadcasting stations inFrance.Proposal to close Fecamp.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 94thConclusions,Minute 8.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 127) setting outthe technical grounds for closing the Fecamp Broadcasting Station.The Secretary of State for War said that the Commander-in-Chief in France concurred in the closing down of this station, andthat the Director of Military Intelligence, who was now in thiscountry, had reported that its entertainment value to the troops was negligible. He thought that it was for the French to state theplan of synchronisation of stations in France and to issue anyorders.The Secretary of State for Air said that it would in fact be forthe French to give the order to close down Fecamp. According toa letter, dated the 23rd November, which the Chief of the Air staff had received from General Vuillemin, General Gamelin had already given the order. It was suggested that, if this had not been done,it would be necessary to send a telegram, stating the War Cabinetsviews, to the British Ambassador in Paris. Reference was also made to Telegram No. 882, dated the 29th November, from our ambassador in Paris, according to which General Gamelin was tobe instructed by M. Daladier to settle the matter urgently, inconsultation with the British General Staff.The Lord Privy Seal said that he understood the B.B.C. had now evolved a new plan, which would, enable them to give a much better service to the British Expeditionary Force. The B.B.C. were only waiting for Air Ministry approval before putting it intooperation.In reply to a question by the Minister without Portfolio, theChief of the Air Staff undertook to enquire what use, if any, ourown Air Force made of German and neutral wireless stations fordirection finding.The War Cabinet agreed (a) That it was necessary that the Fecamp BroadcastingStation should be closed down at once.(b) That the French authorities should be requested to giveorders for the closing down of the Station, as part oftheir general programme of synchronisation.(c) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Secretaries of State for War andAir, to send a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inParis asking the French Government to give effect tothis decision.Germany.possible intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 100thConclusions,Minute 9.). 9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 835 from Washington, reporting that the UnitedStates Under-Secretary of State had said that a good source inBerlin believed that the German Army would attack throughLimburg on the 3rd December.
TheNetherlands.Views ofNetherlandGovernment onthe Possibilityof PeaceNegotiations.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 93rdConclusions,Minute 10.)Magnetic Mines.(previous reference:WM. (39) 100thConclusions,Minute 3.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred toSir Nevile Bland&apos;s telegram No. 93 reporting the views ofM. van Kleffens, the Dutch Foreign Minister. The latter had saidthat it would be wrong to neglect any means which might contribute to the speedy conclusion of the war, before any of the combatantsbecame exhausted. If &quot;the war went on long enough, Communismwould be likely to spread through Germany to England and, moreparticularly, France.In discussion it was pointed out that M. van Kleffens had nolonger made any pretence of doubting who had laid the magnetic mines. It might be worth while to note this admission in connec-tion with the Memorandum on the subject of the German magneticmine campaign, which the First Lord of the Admiralty was preparing for publication.The War Cabinet were also reminded that the BelgianAmbassador had said that our propaganda failed in its effect from lack of repetition. We ought to hammer in the same points day after day.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Far eastern situation.American-japanese relations.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 97thConclusions,Minute 12.)11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hiscolleagues would have seen a recent private and confidential tele-gram from Sir Robert Craigie (Tokyo telegram No. 1567, dated the29th November). The telegram reported a conversation between sir Robert and his American colleague, Mr. Grew, the gist of whichwas that Mr. Grew had recommended to Washington a line ofpolicy in dealing with Japan which was, in fact, somewhat similarto our own. Mr. GreAv had been impressing upon his Governmentthe risks attending an over rigid attitude in American-japanese relations, and had urged the desirability of starting negotiationsfor a new commercial treaty.Sir Robert Craigie had asked Mr. Grew whether he thought itwould be useful if His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington wereto exchange views on this subject with the State Department.Mr. Gi*ew had replied in the affirmative, making, however, theprivate suggestion that it would be well for Lord Lothian to see Mr. Cordell Hull himself.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.(previous reference:.W.M. (39) 95thConclusions,Minute 7.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 1187 from Sir Percy Loraine, reporting that count ciano had told him that the Fascist Grand Council would meet onthe 9th December to review the general situation. Count Cianopersonally anticipated that no change in the attitude of Italy wouldresult.? The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Dominions. 13. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had hadFinancial discussions with all the Dominion Ministers now in this country inArrangements    regard to financial matters.It was clear that this country would have not only to find thedollars required for the Australian and New Zealand shares of theDominion Air Training Scheme, but also to accept a Canadian
proposal to deduct the Canadian share of the scheme from the dollar advances which Canada was proposing to make to us. this had been a great disappointment to him; but it had become quite clear that it was no use attempting to force the Canadians to accepta solution on other lines.(Previous It had also become clear that when Canada said that agreementReference: on the Dominion Air Training Scheme was subject to settlement of w.M. (39) 96th outstanding financial questions, what was really involved was that conclusions, we should agree to purchase Canadian wheat at a very high price.Minute 6.) The market price until recently had been 70 cents a bushel, and canada now asked that we should buy wheat, by arrangement withthe Canadian Wheat Board, either at a dollar a bushel over aperiod of two years, or at 93^ cents for the ensuing twelve months.It was clear that the real reason for this demand was in order toobtain the good will of Canadian farmers, although Mr. Crerar had urged that the price of wheat was likely to rise. This point was still unsettled, and he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) thoughtthat we should have to agree to purchase wheat at a price in excessof 70 cents a bushel. It was most important, however, that at atime when the Minister of Supply was about to make large purchases in the United States, we should not give the impression that we couldbe dragooned into paying iniquitous prices.Continuing, the Chancellor of the Exchequer -said that australia and New Zealand also had their own financial problems.He thought that the New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister, whowould be leaving this country shortly, was fairly well satisfied withthe discussions on financial matters which had taken place. TheAustralian representative (Mr. Casey), however, had put forward a proposal which in effect amounted to a request that we shouldtake over responsibility for part of the Australian indebtedness.This was clearly not a proposition which we could accept.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Parliament.Proposed secret session of theHouse ofCommons.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 97thConclusions,Minute 14.)14. In reply to a question, the Prime Minister said that the leader of the Opposition had not raised the question of a secret session in the Debate in Parliament on Tuesday last. Since then,however, he had received a formal request for a Secret Session. Hehad asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury to explain to Mr. Attlee that the Government were prepared to agree to ademand for a Secret Session, subject to the following twoconditions (1) that it would be necessary to make a Defence of the RealmRegulation under which appropriate safeguards couldbe taken to ensure the secrecy of the proceedings :(2) that the Secret Session would last for one day only, andwould be confined to Ministry of Supply matters.He understood that Mr. Attlee accepted these two conditions, but itwould be desirable to set them on public record as Sir A. Sinclair,according to the newspapers, proposed to ask for a second day&apos;secret Session, in the course of which the debate might range overa variety of topics. The Secret Session would probably take placeon Wednesday, the 13th December.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 2, 1939.
