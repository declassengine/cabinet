(39)81);(ii) by the Minister of Food (Paper W:Pv (Gd (39) 84);(iii) by the Minister of Health (Paper W:P, (&amp;) (39) 85).The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that thesituation was serious. It was impossible to exaggerate thedifficulties of livestock producers in getting feeding-stuffs. Theimmediate problem was what should be Said to producers of baconpigs and poultry. Government statements had been made to theeffect that, as soon as we could get a fair view of the situation, weshould let them know what the future held in store for them. Thepresent proposals would not come as a great shock to the farmers,who were expecting something of the sort, though they might comeas a shock to &quot;the public, both at home and abroad.Discussion then turned on the amount of shipping available,which was the key to the problem.Sir Cyril Hurcomb gave the War Cabinet certain figures froma Memorandum on the Shipping position which was being preparedfor the consideration of the War Cabinet later that week. he pointed out that the figures were necessarily based on estimates,which in turn rested on many uncertain factors or assumptions, suchas the extent of losses through enemy action, the French Govern-menfs requirements, the amount of neutral tonnage available, andthe cumulative loss of importing capacity owing to delays. broadly speaking, the Report would indicate the position at the end of next summer.At the end of the first year of war it was estimated that47 million tons weight would have been imported as against a normal 60 million tons. Actual imports in September and Octoberhad been 5 million tons; estimated imports for November to january (three months) were 10  million tons; and for february to April (three months) 12^ million tons. On the basis of a totalimportation of 47 million tons a year, the quota for three months would be 11^ million tons. Tonnage for the next six months wouldbe very tight, and it would be very difficult to alleviate the immediateposition.During the remaining ten months of the first year of war(i.e., from the beginning of November) it was estimated thatT11 million tons would be imported in neutral ships of all sorts, eitherchartered or on behalf of commercial importers. This representedabout 57 per cent, of the normal quantity shipped to this countryin foreign bottoms. In September and-October only 40 per cent, ofthe imports had been in neutral shipping. We were bound toexperience serious difficulties in regard to neutral shipping, andthe figure of 57 per cent, might be optimistic.There were suggestions that Lisbon should be used by theUnited States as an entrepot depot and there was a possibility ofthe use of Alexandria in a similar way. These measures mightalleviate the position, but could not take effect until next Summer,and would be done at a price.Turning toi requirements, the original requirements of theMinistryof iFeod hadbeen/22^ million tons. This, however, hadincluded certain items which might be regarded as non-essential and, after discussion, the figure had been fixed at approximately207miUionb The Ministry of Supply figure was 24 million tons,which might not cover thewhole&apos;ground as there were certain commodities which the controls did not^completely cover. On thebasis of these two figures, about 3 million tons remainedunallocated, and to cover miscellaneous items.- n&apos;2

Indeed, the cut-proposed for food was from 2 f million tons to just under 20 million tons,or 10 per cent. ^a discussion followed on certain aspects of the general shipping position which had a bearing on the supply of feeding stuffs.Among the points to which attention was called were thefollowing: (1) The Minister of Food stated that he was considering whether to accept an offer of 200,000 tons of wheat from france. He would probably do so, if he could be reasonably sure of the necessary tonnage. It would bea condition of our accepting this offer that we shouldbind ourselves at a later date to make good to the French,at Marseilles, an equivalent quantity of wheat.A similar offer of 100,000 tons of wheat from france has already been accepted.(2) It was suggested that, following the precedent of the last war, an appeal should be made to the public to dispense with unnecessary luxuries imported from abroad. Thiswould secure a certain economy in shipping space, though not an economy commensurate with the money value ofthe goods. Broadly speaking, such goods did not occupymuch shipping space.(3) In this connection, the Minister of Health expressed thehope that fruit would not be regarded as a luxuryimport. The science of dietetics had finally proved thenutritive value of fruit. Any cutting off of fruitsupplies would damage the health of the population.Some discussion took place regarding the import of oranges from Italy and Spain. As regards Italy, thedifficulty was that the Italian coal importer preferred to send his ships to this country in ballast, in order tosecure a quick voyage. It might, however, be possiblefor the Ministry of Shipping to bring pressure to bearon the Italians to alter their practice. As regardsSpain, our trade with that country was now at a standstill, partly owing to a hitch in the Anglo-Spanishcommercial negotiations now being conducted by theBoard of Trade, and partly owing to the insistence of spanish exporters oh receiving payment in dollars.(4) The suggestion was made that a good deal of additionalcargo space might be made available in the larger trans-Atlantic liners, and also in the ships which were tobring the first Canadian Division to this country. Itwas not thought, however, that much cargo space couldbe obtained in this way.(5) It was suggested that it might be possible for the admiralty to: release; Sbh^A merchant, cruisers. A further -suggestion was that: the&apos;Admiralty might mot require the whole of the 2GUS(U0D):a- ......  : -tonsd;^a :.; .

Aaierioa would be by some considerable;---; acceleration- in- the-convoy system.(7) It was suggested thati on along View, the shipping position was an unproving one. The&quot;right, course,therefore, wasnot to impose drastic measures which would result in amarked decline in the pig and poultry population, but rather to take such steps as might &quot;be necessary to enablethe pig and poultry producer to come through the difficult times in the next few Weeks until the positionimproved.(8) On the other hand, it was pointed out that the position inregard to feeding-stuffs was already extremely serious,and that the shipping position would continue to be extremely tight until the late summer of 1940.The Minister of Food drew attention to the statement of theserious position in the matter of cereals for human consumptionas set out in the tables appended to his Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 84.These showed that, since the war began, we had imported onlyhalf the quantities that were being consumed, and that on the4th November the stocks in public granaries and flour mills wereequivalent to only seven weeks&apos; supply, and the stocks on farms to only eight weeks&apos;. At the end of tine year the stock in both formstogether would represent only eight or nine weeks&apos; supply. Incertain mills on the east coast and in London stocks were now downto two or three days&apos; supply. These mills were in danger of closing down and it had been necessary to release some of the SecurityStock to keep them in operation. If there were any shortage inthe estimated arrivals, the position at the end of the year mightbe even worse than indicated above.It had therefore already been necessary to take steps to load all available ships with wheat for human consumption, thus con-tributing to the shortage of agricultural feeding-stuffs. He had no hesitation in recommending, as a matter of urgency, that the home-grown wheat supply should be brought under the control of theMinistry. This was necessary, not only as part of a policy of controlling animal feeding-stuns, but also to ensure that the stocksof wheat on the farms shown in his calculations were actuallyavailable for human consumption. In the absence of control, anawith the shortage of alternative feeding-stuffs, large quantitieswould otherwise be fed to livestock. His Memorandum also touched on another expedient for eking out our stocks of wheat, namely, the extraction of a higher percentage of flour from the grain milled,but he did not recommend the adoption of this course, because the raising of the percentage of extraction by some 7 per cent, (whichwas all that could be contemplated) would increase only by a littleover 10 per cent, the amount of flour available. At the same time,for every increase of 3 per cent, in the percentage extracted, therewas a loss of 10 per cent, of offals available for feeding livestock,thus making the agri(Mtnral position worse.It was generally agreed that it was essential, as proposed by theMinister of Food, tohring the home-grown wheat supply under control.-- ------&apos;In the discussion on-this particular aspect.of the food situation the following were the principal points made  (i) From.the point of view -:oi\shipping space, it was more- -. . eoapeasc&amp;i - to. - import Ae Saisheci, product-bacon ore&quot;SE&quot;3-das ddo A3&apos;:   -cd^rt;,d,;/-;(ii):: :t A.) ads ttmiipi of-grains used for producing bearand whisky, so as to increase the supplies avail &quot;siMq: for
(iii) The Ministerof Health uj^^proposed reduction in. Jeedlng^stufls as-between livestockOf various kinds needed reconsideration from the -pointof view of dietetic values. In particular, he was opposedto the heavy reduction proposed in feeding-stuffs forpoaltsy.(iv) Once Hie farmers became aware that there was a shortageof normal feeding-stuffs, they would be ready to turn toalternatives to produce the &quot; war pig &quot; rather than the&quot;luxury pig&quot; produced in normal times,(v) Animal feeding-stuffs were largely of a perishable nature,and large reserves were therefore out of the question.The farmers fully expected to have to put up withreduced quantities in war time, but they wanted to know the Governments policy, and they must be disabused ofthe idea that there might be a secret hoard available inthe Governments hands.(vi) It was important to secure that the announcement of ashortage was not misunderstood by the general public and did not provide useful propaganda for the enemy!It should therefore be represented not as a shortageimposed upon us, but as the result of a proper decisionto use shipping in the most economical way for the most urgent needs, e.g., the import of munitions.(vii) It would not suffice merely to tell the farmers that theshortage of feeding-stuffs was going to continue, butthey must be given some more precise guidance as to theGovernments policy in the matter, e.g., as to theprobable degree of restriction, and its apportionmentbetween the various forms of livestock.Summing up the discussion, the Chancellor of the exchequer said that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland had made out a case that someannouncement was needed to tell farmers the probable extent of theshortage of feeding-stuffs and to give them some guidance as to theGovernments policy. But, before the precise form of such anannouncement could be determined, he thought that the ministers concerned would wish to review the whole matter in the light of thelatest available figures as to the shipping position and to other points brought out in the discussion.The War Cabinet agreed (1) To authorise the Minister of Food to bring the home-grown wheat supply under control, with a view to securing thata larger proportion of it should be turned into flour for human consumption.(2) To invite the Minister of Food, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Ministers of Health, Agriculture andFisheries, and Shipping to confer together with a viewto submitting revised proposals to the War cabinet before the end of the week in regard to imported feeding-stuffs and livestock policy. In framing theseproposals, the Ministers should take into account thelatest information as to the,shipping position..r.(3) To invite the Ministers to include in then! revised proposals- &apos; ;V&apos;.-:;V;;&apos;(a) any measures which they regarded as practicable,with imview to%increasing the available animal feeding-stuffs, e:g:, by. the restriction of grainused for malting beer or distilling whisky;,

The War Cabinet had before them the Second report submitted by the Minister of Food, covering the period the3rd October to the 2nd November, 1939, incorporating a Report on home Production by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries andthe Secretary of State for Scotland (Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 69).The Minister of Food said that the only point in this Reportto which he wished to invite attention was the position in regard tocereals, which had already been dealt with in the discussion onanimal feeding-stuffs (Minute 1).The War Cabinet took note of the above Report..
