The AirSituation1.   The Deputy Chief of the Air Stuff informed the WarCabinet that there had been no air operations of special interest(Previous on the previous day.reference: That morning, however, a sweep in force by 24 WellingtonsW.M. (39) 101st had been carried out over the Jade and the Schillig Roads, and conclusions, thence on to Heligoland. All our aircraft had returned safely.Minute l.) Full reports had not yet been received, but present information wasthat two cruisers and a number of destroyers had been found in theroads between the two islands at Heligoland. Attacks on these had been carried out by two formations from 7,000 and 10,000 feetrespectively with 500-lb. semi-armour-piercing bombs. A direct hitwas believed to have been obtained on one of the cruisers, and ifthis were confirmed the damage was likely to be severe. the bombers had encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire. They had been attacked by only one Messerschmidt, which they had shot down.Apart from its operational success the attack had been of value as having been the first occasion on which the Wellingtons had beentested on this type of raid. Weather permitting though the forecast was very discouraging the attack would be repeated that night.A submarine had been attacked from the air off Texel, theaircraft claiming a direct hit.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 101stConclusions,Minute 2.)Magnetic Mines.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 101stConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that at 4-15 p.m. the previous day S.S. Doric Star (10,000tons) of the Blue Star Line, a defensively armed merchantman, had reported that she was being gunned 600 miles east of St. Helena.It was evident that she had met the Admiral S cheer. The FirstLord informed the War Cabinet of the present fleet dispositions to intercept this ship.Late the previous night an enemy unit had been heard speakingbetween Iceland and the Faroe Islands, its position having been fixed by some six or seven D.F. stations. This unit might be aU-boat or the Deutschland. The Commander-in-Chief had issuedinstructions for a search by Naval patrols, which were still out,and aircraft had also been ordered to carry out reconnaissances.The First Lord mentioned that two British merchant ships hadbeen sunk by mine or torpedo the previous day, making a total of21,000 tons of British shipping. A Swedish steamer of 2,100 tonshad also been mined or torpedoed east of May Island.Shipping had been moving freely in and out of the port ofLondon 79 ships having left the Downs, and 36 having entered.In response to a message which had been sent to South Africa,shore-based aircraft had carried out a reconnaissance 150 miles south of the Cape, and had spotted the German liner Watussi(9,500 tons) 55 miles from land. On being ordered to proceed toSimonstown, the crew had scuttled and set fire to the ship. the crew and passengers had been rescued by H.M.S. Sussex and landed at the Cape.HALS. Triad had been satisfactorily repaired and was now proceeding home.The First Lord said that the investigations into the methodsof dealing with the magnetic mine had been proceeding satis-factorily. Weather had hampered the practical tests, but a numberof devices would shortly be at work.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[20430]
Publicity 3.   The First Lord of  the Admiralty  said that,  on  theregarding Naval nth September, the War Cabinet had agreed : Losses- &quot; That for the present the policy to be followed should be(Previous that the publication of losses of fighting ships, about which theInference: enemy had no means of discovering otherwise,  should beW.M. (39) 93rd withheld.   It would be necessary, of course, to inform theConclusions, relatives of personnel lost with the ship, but the notificationMinute 5.) could take the form of a telegram stating simply that the menbad been killed in action.&quot;In the light of their experience since September the admiralty were proposing to revise this policy on the following lines : (i) To publish all losses of His Majesty&apos;s ships due to enemy action, whether these losses are known to the enemy ornot, as soon as it is possible to inform the next of kin.(ii) No reports of  damage to His Majesty&apos;s ships  to bepublished, unless these become widely known at home or are certainly known to the enemy.(iii) It followed from (i) and (ii) above that the Admiralty would accept no responsibility for denying enemy claims orrumours, unless they considered that it was in their interests to do so.The First Lord of the Admiralty proposed that the admiralty should use the above points as a guide in dealing with the Press,but that they should not be published textually.The War Cabinet agreed : To approve the Admiralty&apos;s policy in regard to thepublication of losses of His Majesty&apos;s Ships as set out under (i), (ii) and (iii) above.Finland.Invasion by soviet Union.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 101stConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that, according tothe Finnish reports, there had been a slight Russian advance inthe Karelian isthmus, though the main Finnish positions had notyet been reached.There was no change elsewhere, and the Finns claimed still to hold Petsamo. All the Finnish islands in the Gulf of Finlandhad been occupied by the Russians.It was reported that the Swedes intended to help the Finns withguns, clothing, volunteers, &amp;c, but not with official units.In reply to an enquiry by the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the russians would undoubtedly encounter difficulties on account of the natureof the country, and the snow. It was not to be expected, however,that the Finns would hold out long against heavy air attack, though they might continue guerilla warfare for a considerable period.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Forth-coming Yisit toFrance of HisMajesty TheKing.5. The Chief of Naval Staff raised the question of the nature and time of the announcement to be made regarding the forthcoming visit to France of His Majesty The King. The War Cabinet were informed that the King&apos;s Private Secretary had intimated That itwas His Majesty&apos;s pleasure that the announcement should be made public on His arrival in France and should not be deferred until after His return to this country.It was pointed out that while this course might involve some additional risk, particularly on the return journey, the fact that
the King was in France was bound to become known and it would be most undesirable that the British public should first learn of the visit from German or other foreign sources.General agreement was expressed with the suggestion that theannouncement, when made, should be limited to the statement that&quot; His Majesty The King is in France on a visit to the troops,&quot; andthat no details should be given regarding the programme of the visit.The Secretary of State for War observed that the Director ofMilitary Intelligence at General Headquarters, France, had contem-plated rather different arrangements, and agreed them with thePress in France. It would therefore be necessary that he should be told the Cabinets view.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that Major-General Mason-Macfarlane was still in this country, and that hewould take steps to have him informed of the Cabinets decision.The War Cabinet agreed :  (a) That, subject to the King&apos;s approval, the announcement ofhis visit to France should be made public in this country as soon as His Majesty had landed in France.(&amp;) That the above announcement should be in general terms,namely &quot;His Majesty The King has arrived in France on a visit to the troops.&quot;(c) To instruct Major-General Ismay* to inform Sir AlexanderHardinge forthwith of the above views of the WarCabinet, and to ascertain whether they met with theKing&apos;s approval.(d) To invite the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to take steps to have the Director of Military Intelligence at general Headquarters, France, informed of the above conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 3, 1939.* In accordance with the above instruction, Major-General Ismayascertained immediately after the meeting that His Majesty approved thearrangements in question.
