Air Operations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 74th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there had been considerable air activity over the North Sea on the preceding day. Enemy aircraft had been encountered by aircraft of the Coastal Command at a number of points from the Shetlands down to Yarmouth, and a number of inconclusive combats had taken place.

Aircraft of the Royal Air Force contingent of the Field Force had carried out reconnaissances of North-West Germany. They had been much hampered by bad visibility, and one aircraft was missing.

Further details had now been received of the French engagement, of which the first report had been received the day before. It now appeared that four enemy aircraft had been shot down. No French aircraft had been lost.

An example of German propaganda leaflets dropped in France had been obtained. It consisted of a number of closely printed pages containing Hitler&apos;s speech.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Naval Operations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 74th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the heavy gales now being experienced were hampering the work of convoys, but were also a handicap to enemy submarines. There had been no attacks on trade.

There had been five or six cases of attacks by enemy aircraft on small vessels in the North Sea, but no damage had been caused. In one case an enemy seaplane had fired a torpedo at a Polish destroyer. This was interesting, as it was the first case in war of the use of torpedoes by aircraft. The destroyer had managed to evade the attack.

H.M.S. Cossack had been badly damaged in collision. A certain number of mishaps to destroyers were unavoidable under the onerous conditions in which they had to operate.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Security of Fleet Bases. Scapa Flow and the loss of the Royal Oak. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 74th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty read to the War Cabinet the Statement which he proposed to make that afternoon in the House of Commons on the loss of the Royal Oak.

Some discussion ensued on the terms of the Statement. It was argued that too much emphasis was laid on the risks which the Navy was called upon to run, and on the dangers which beset its operations. Such emphasis might have a bad effect at the present time on neutral opinion. On the other hand, it was thought that a frank statement of our difficulties and of any losses we had undergone, together with a presentation of our reasons for confidence in the future, would have a good effect on neutrals as a contrast to the puerile and boastful propaganda of the Germans.

The First Lord of the Admiralty thought it right to give the House the complete picture, not slurring over our setbacks, but leading up to a happy conclusion. He proposed to inform the House of the loss of one of our submarines, which had hitherto been concealed, and to give them the facts about German submarine production; and of the inevitable slowing down of trade, which was caused by the convoy system.

With regard to the loss of the Royal Ook, he thought the House would accept the decision not to hold an enquiry to opportion blame, and would be content with the knowledge that he was taking all the necessary steps.

In this connection, he informed the War Cabinet of the action he proposed to take, an account of which is included in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that he was about to answer a question by Lord Strabolgi on the subject of the Royal Oak, and he would follow the general lines of the First Lord&apos;s Statement. He was glad to hear the steps which the First Lord proposed to take, and he thought that action of the kind indicate was required to allay the natural feeling in the Navy aroused by the disaster.

The War Cabinet:-

Approved the general lines of the First Lord&apos;s Statement, and the action which he proposed to take, in regard to the loss of the Royal Oak.

Military Operations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 74th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said that one more German Division had been identified in the Aachen area. One Brigade of the British Expeditionary Force was about to move into the Saar area to get experience of the line. It was proposed to send brigades down in rotation.

The General Staff had no confirmation of the reports appearing in the Press of an imminent German invasion of Holland and Belgium. In response to a communication received from General Gamelin, the Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff were going over to discuss the position with General Gamelin that afternoon.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Canada. Destination of the First Canadian Division. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 4.)

5. The Secretary of State for War said that he had discussed with the Canadian Military Representatives, who were over in this country, the proposal that the Canadian Division which would shortly be leaving Canada should be taken straight to France to complete its training. Brigadier Crerar had made it clear that the Canadians would prefer to come to the United Kingdom, where they had friends and relations and would be unwilling to accept the proposal to go straight to France. From the point of view of the War Office, it would also be more convenient for them to come to the United Kingdom, as their depots of all kinds would be established in this country.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the matter had not yet been put officially to the Canadian Government.

The First Lord of the Admiralty thought the case for taking their first Division straight to France should be put squarely to the Canadian Government. The bringing of a Division through submarine-infested seas to these shores should not lightly be undertaken, especially as the journey would have to be followed by another when the Division moved to France.

The War Cabinet-

Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to consider whether to raise directly with the Canadian Government the question whether the first Canadian Division should proceed direct to France, instead of completing its training in this country.

Weekly Reports. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 67th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

6. The War Cabinet took note of the following Reports:-

(a) 9th Weekly Report by the Secretary of State for War (Paper W.P. (39) 117)

(b) 9th Weekly Report by the Secretary of State for Air (Paper W.P. (39) 115).
Leakage of information to Germany. Censorship of Cable and Wireless messages from Eire. (Previous Reference W.M. (39) 68th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

7. The Minister without Portfolio said that the War Cabinet would be glad to know that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had been successful in the two requests in connection with censorship which he had made to the Government of Eire in accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin.

The Government of Eire had no objection to our approaching the Cable Companies with a view to routeing all cables from Eire via London. They understood we were not asking for formal approval, but merely to make sure they would not raise objections.

The Government of Eire would also be very glad to have the machines for intercepting wireless communications. As these machines would be very expensive, they might ask to hire them from us.

The Secretary of State for War referred to reports that the Germans had broadcast information about movements of our warships, and similar matters, which pointed to effective espionage on their part, and said that he had been unable to obtain any confirmation from sources at his disposal that such broadcasts had taken place. The War Office were anxious to trace these reports to their source.

The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to pass on to the War Office any information he had on the subject.

The Lord Privy Seal said that the High Commissioner for India had been told by the High Commissioner for Southern Rhodesia that he had himself heard one of these broadcasts from a German station.

The War Cabinet took note:-

(a) of the statement by the Minister, without Portfolio;

(b) that the Secretary of State for War was anxious to have an opportunity to trace the source of reports of German broadcasts indicating a leakage of information from this country.

Air Requirements of the Army. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 11.)

8. The War Cabinet had under consideration Memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary, of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air on the air requirements for the Army (Papers W.P.(39) l10, 111 and 1l2).

The Lord Privy Seal said that the Papers before the War Cabinet showed clearly the question at issue. The Land Forces Committee had been divided on the principle involved, which had, therefore, been brought before the War Cabinet for decision. He proposed to give the War Cabinet the background of the controversy and his own broad conclusions. He was struck by two points in the Papers :--

(i) The Secretary of State for Air presented, he felt, rather a depressing picture of our future air programme, in that in the present conditions air parity and not air superiority was apparently the utmost that we could achieve and that not for a year at least. Hence he had been attracted by the idea of introducing some new factor which might obtain air superiority for us. This factor, he thought, might be found in experiments with mass-produced aircraft to which he attached considerable importance. Agreement had been reached in the Land Forces Committee on the production of two ? of a mass-produced close-support aircraft. Action was proceeding in this matter but no aircraft ?
(ii) He was impressed by the new conception of the General Staffs on both sides as to the type of battle which might be expected on the Western Front in modern conditions -- a gigantic offensive with large forces of aircraft and tanks and every mechanical appliance all working in co-operation together. It was clear that, unless these large bodies of aircraft, tanks, &amp;c., were available, there would be very heavy casualties. He had been much impressed by the fact that the Army possessed no special aircraft for close-support purposes in a battle of this nature. The larger bombers became, the less likely were they to be used in support of the Army. Further, there had been no joint training of the Army and the Air Force in close-support tactics, probably because it was only recently that we had set ourselves to build up an Army on a continental scale. His deductions from these considerations were, first, that the Army should have 20-25 close-support aircraft of a special type per Division, and, secondly, that intensive training in the necessary co-operation should be put in hand immediately.

Continuing, the Lord Privy Seal said that the Air Ministry pointed out that our production facilities were already fully occupied, and that it would take 18 months to develop a special close-support aircraft of the type desired by the Army. The alternative was to employ Blenheims and Battles from the air striking Force. To make these available to the extent desired by the Army would reduce that Force by 50 per cent. He did not see how we could deplete the Air Striking Force in this manner for the sole benefit of the Army, but he suggested that the General Staff and the Air Staff should examine the programme again and see whether some proportion of the Air Striking Force could not be allocated primarily to the support of the Army and given intensive training with that end in view. Further, it might be necessary to reconsider the present aircraft production programme to see whether more Blenheims could not be constructed, instead of concentrating so much of our aircraft production on very heavy bombers. Also, every encouragement should be given to Army Officers to second to the Royal Air Force on the general understanding that they would be used on Army work and would assist in developing close-support tactics.

This brought him to the question of control. The present position was that the Army had control, in the field, of its own reconnaissance aircraft and of a small number of fighters. The really difficult, problem was whether close-support aircraft should be regarded as tactical and primarily under control of the army, or strategical and primarily under the control of the Air Striking Force. His own view was that it was premature to come to a decision in this matter, since no special close-support aircraft were available or in sight. On the other hand, he would like to see the mass-production experiment given the fullest-chance, and he hoped that the possibilities of buying close-support aircraft in the United States would be investigated.

His conclusion was, therefore, that the General Staff and the Air Staff should endeavour to reach agreement on the proportion of the Air Striking Force which should be allocated primarily to army work and on the special training required for that proportion, but that a decision on the question of control should be postponed for the present. His last suggestion was that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should lend his good offices to assist the two Staffs in coming to an agreement. In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Privy Seal explained that the massproduction experiment to which he had referred was designed to produce a special close-support aircraft possessing the
characteristics required by the Army, but produced by mass-production methods and hence outside the existing aircraft productive capacity.

The Secretary of State for Air said that he had approached this problem with a view to investigating the practical steps which he could take to help the Army in the light of the possible course of air operations in the next 6, 12 or even 18 months. At no time had he said that he was unable to allot aircraft to Army control. He had, however, said that in present circumstances and with our existing insufficient resources he could not make such an allotment except at the expense of the Air Striking Force. It seemed highly probable that the Germans might seize air bases in Holland and Belgium from which to launch an air offensive on this country, and he could not contemplate depleting, in any way, the forces available to meet such attack, by permanently assigning part of them to the Army. It was possible that the best reply by the Royal Air Force to such a German offensive would be an attack on the Ruhr, which would call for every available bomber aircraft. In his view, there was not likely to be an Allied offensive on the Western Front in the next 12-18 months. The most immediate danger was from the air.

Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air detailed the steps which the Air Ministry had taken to help the Army, as follows :--

(i) Detailed plans had been drawn up and arrangements made to enable both the Advanced Air Striking Force and the Air Striking Force to support not only the British Expeditionary Force, but also the French Forces.

(ii) Arrangements were in hand to give the ten squadrons of the Advanced Air Striking Force and six Blenheim Squadrons in England special training in co-operation for the Army. As there were already two bomber squadrons in the air component, this would mean that a total of 18 squadrons with 288 aircraft would receive special training.

The Air Staff maintained, and the lessons of the last war confirmed, that the provision and maintenance of aircraft and flying training must be centrally controlled. The Germans did not attach their Bomber Force to any one arm of the Service, and it was obvious that, if our Bomber Force were split up between the Army and the Royal Air Force, flexibility would be lost and concentration at the decisive place and time would become impossible.

Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air referred to the mass, production of aircraft. He had agreed, and would do his best, to produce prototypes of the close-support mass-production aircraft required, but he was bound to say that the Air Staff were sceptical of the possibilities. He could only hope that they were wrong, since mass production would greatly ease the provision of aircraft. He warned his colleagues, however, that even if thousands of aircraft could be produced by mass production methods, the difficulty of obtaining, enlisting and above all training the very large numbers of pilots required would still have to be faced.

The Secretary of State for War said that the present procedure by which relations between the Royal Air Force and the Army were governed was unsatisfactory, and would cause difficulties in the future which might well be avoided if they were faced now. He was asking his colleagues to accept the principle that the Army, as a fighting Service should be allowed to indicate its requirements of aircraft both in number and type, and that the Air Council should ? and organise the necessary squadrons to meet requirements and ?. The principal in fact, would ?


dissatisfied. Army requirements could be tabulated under the following heads :--

Reconnaissance.

Artillery spotting.

Inter-communication.

Low-flying attack, machine gunning and short-range bombing.

Transportation of personnel, supplies, and wounded by aerial ambulance.

Of these requirements, only the first three had been met in full by the provision of Army Co-operation Squadrons. The Air Ministry admitted that air bombardment was an essential part of land operations, and they had agreed to provide prototypes of economical machines for this purpose. In paragraph 9 of W.P. (39) 108 the Chiefs of Staff, reporting on the military implications of a German invasion of Holland, had said --

"The Germans would probably employ their air forces in direct support of the Army in the normal way, though it is possible that parachute troops might be used in the later stages to create disorganisation in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam area."

We had no aircraft suitable for either of these functions. Continuing, the Secretary of State for War quoted the conditions governing relations-between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry for the Fleet Air Arm, and pointed out that the Admiralty were represented at all stages in the design and production of their requirements. Similar representation was essential for the Army. In present circumstances, the Army were merely petitioners, and indeed had to argue with the Air Ministry, regarding their tactical requirements. For instance, the Secretary of State for Air had said that no offensive operations by us were likely for 12-18 months. That was not the War Office view. He was not asking for an Army air Arm. The Air Ministry were prepared to give special training to certain bomber squadrons, but the matter was not quite so simple as that. The Commander-in-Chief in the Field must have the closest contact with the officers of the air forces which would act in support of his land forces, and those officers should be constantly employed in studying the topography of the field of operations and in working in the closest collaboration with their Army colleagues.

Lord Gort had written repeatedly to the War Office is regarding the position of inferiority in which he found himself, and had said:

"The absurdities of having independent Air Commanders in France are always cropping up." The procedure which Lord Gort had to go through in order to obtain air co-operation almost defied description. His headquarters were about 280 miles from General Vuillemin and Air-Marshal Barratt, and 110 miles from the headquarters of the Advanced Air Striking Force. In certain circumstances, the Commander-in-Chief had to refer to the Chiefs of Staff and even to the War Cabinet. He was anxious to avoid controversy and, if the Air Ministry could not give the Army 250 modern aircraft, he was prepared to take older types and even fewer numbers. The Secretary of State for Air objected to his proposal on the grounds that it would delay the achievement of air parity with the Germans but it should be left to the Air Ministry to say that the needs of the Air Striking Force must first be fulfilled, and what was left over given to the Army.

He was therefore asking the War Cabinet the War Cabinet to adopt the principle that the Army should frame its requirements and the Air Ministry provide those requirements to the utmost of their ability, and also that the War Office should be associated in all the stages of design and production. If the War Cabinet accepted that principle, he


would be happy to accept the arbitration of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in regard to the steps which should be taken to implement it.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that he would be glad to help in any way that he could and he believed that a satisfactory arrangement could be made if the War Cabinet adopted certain suggestions which he would like to place before them. In his view it was not possible, now that we were at war, to hold an enquiry on the lines of the enquiry into the Fleet Air Arm. He thought it essential, however, that the Army should have certain assurances regarding its air support. For the present, while we were short of aircraft and support for the Army had to be taken from our main Air Forces, these assurances must be subject to the other responsibilities of the Air Striking Force. He felt that there was an essential difference between the Army and Naval air problems, in that the Navy were often operating at great distances from the other Services. For instance, we had aircraft-carriers at present far removed from our main Naval Forces. Hence, a seperate Fleet Air Arm was essential. The Army and the Air Force, on the other hand, were dependent on each other, they were working in the same area and should work in the closest co-operation. Whatever measures were taken to give the Army its assurances of air support should be supplemented by goodwill betweeen the two Services. For this reason he suggested that the problem should first of all be examined by the Joint Planning Organisation of the Chiefs of Staff, before he himself intervened to obtain agreement. He therefore suggested that the Chiefs of Staff should be instructed to try and reach agreement in this matter within the following framework:-

(a) that any radical change in the administration of the Air Striking Forces is out of the question at the present time;

(b) that, subject to the above overriding consideration, and having regardto the other responsibilities of the Air Striking Force, it is essential that the Army should have full assurances as regards its air support;

(c) that, subject to (a) and (b) above, the Chiefs of Staff should endeavour to reach a settlement on some such lines as the following:-

That an agreed proportion of the Air Striking Force should be specially trained to work with the Army.



If the Chiefs of Staff were unable to reach agreement, he was quite prepared to do all he could to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of all concerned.



The Prime Minister felt that the problem before the War Cabinet raised two main questions. The first was a wide and somewhat theoretical question of basic principle regarding the control by the Army of its direct support aircraft. He understood the Secretary of State for War to say that he did not require an Army Air Arm, but wanted the principle accepted that the Army should lay down its requirements and the specifications of its aircraft, which would then be provided by the Air Ministry. If, however, the result was to provide a type of machine which was suitable for Army needs only and could not be used for anything else, where would be in effect, an Army Air Arm. He was all in favour of continuing the development of prototypes of close-support aircraft, but there was at present no prospect of such aircraft being available in quantity by the Spring of 1940. His conclusion, therefore, was that this wider theoretical question of control should stand over for the present.


Containing the Prime Minister said that the second question for decision was what air support the Army would receive for its operations next year. In the nature of things, the decision must be something of a compromise. He was interested to bear that plans were going forward for special training for 18 squadrons, but what the Commander in Chief had in mind could not be met only by training. The Commander in Chief wished to be able to plan definite operations which involved discussions with the Air Commanders concerned, and this planning and discussion could only be carried out if the Air Commanders were readily available to him. It seemed to him, therefore, that it would be right to earmark a proportion of the machines, which were suitable for work with the Army, normally for that purpose. These aircraft would not be handed over to the control of the Commander in Chief of the Army because, owing to the size of our total air forces, we must be in a position, when necessary, to use the whole of our air forces for other purposes. They would, however, be at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief, unless some emergency arose which made it necessary to use them for other purposes.

If this principle were approved by the War Cabinet, it would remain to settle the number and types of aircraft to be earmarked as being primarily for work with the Army, and the conditions under which the allocation would take place. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had suggested that his question should be examined first by the two Staffs concerned and that he (the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence) should, if necessary, arbitrate in the matter later. He was not sure that this was the best approach to the problem.

He could not help feeling that if the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence could assist from the very beginning, he coud do much to help to smooth out difficulties. He therefore invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to assume the task of endeavouring to promote agreement in this matter.



The War Cabinet agreed:-



(1) that steps for the development of prototypes of an aircraft susceptible to mass production methods, and complying as nearly as possible with the requirements of the War Office, should be continued as a matter of urgency :

(2) that, for the reasons indicated in discussion, no useful purpose would be served by raising at the present time the question whether in principle the Army should have complete control of an Air Force furnished with machines in accordance with its own designs and specifications:

(3) that in present circumstances it was essential that the whole of our Air Striking Force should be available for whatever purpose the strategical situation might require:

(4) that, subject to (3), the Army should have full assurances regarding air support, and with a view to operations next year, a proportion of suitable machines should be earmarked for work with the Army, these machines to be the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief unless some emergency arose which made it necessary to use them for other purposes.

(5) to invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to work out, in association with the Departments a scheme for agreed types and numbers of the machines mentioned in Conclusion (4).
