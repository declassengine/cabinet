The Air 1;   The Secretary of State for Air informed the War cabinet situation. that there had been no important air activities on the previous day.(Previous    .

(39) 108thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff gave the War Cabinetthe details of certain action which the Air Ministry proposed fordealing with the laying of mines by German aircraft.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.. The War Cabinet :-(1) Approved, as an immediate measure, the action described by the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff for dealing with german mine-laying aircraft.(2) Took note that a Memorandum was being prepared by theAir Staff on the wider issues involved in an attack onthe German mine-laying bases, and that this Memo-randum would be considered in the first instance by theSecretary of State for Air and the First Lord of theAdmiralty.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 2.)H.M.S. Nelson.S.S. Bremen.3. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet particulars of the movements of the Fleet.H.M.S. Barham had collided during the night with H.M.S.Duchess, causing the latter to sink with a loss of sixty to seventylives.   The Admiralty would issue a statement to the Press.H.M.S. Valiant was completing her trials and would shortly besailing.It was estimated that H.M.S. Nelson would be repaired intwo months from the date on which she was dry-docked.There had been no reports of German attacks on trade, otherthan an unconfirmed Press report which stated that a Greek ship had been sunk by a U-boat forty miles North of Trondhjem. Itwas suspected that a U-boat had crossed the Plymouth Loop.Destroyers had been ordered to hunt, but had found nothing.Another U-boat was believed to have been in St. Alban&apos;s channel, West of the Isle of Wight.H.M.S. Acheron was reported to be anchored in St. Helen&apos;sRoad with her starboard engine out of action.H.M.S. Mohawk, which had been damaged in the raid on theForth, had sustained slight damage in a collision on leaving the tyne, where she had been repaired.The Bremen had been sighted by a British submarine in theSkager Rak returning to Germany under an escort of aircraft.,It was agreed that a statement should be issued to the press to the effect that the Bremen had been sighted by one of our submarines within torpedo range, but as we were precluded by the laws of war from attacking a merchant vessel without warning,the submarine had not attacked the Bremen.
The Militaryjivuauuu.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report on the Western Front.        - -The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Supply ofMunitions.Finland. 5.   The Secretary of State for War said that the Russians wereInvasion by the reported to have made some advance and to have captured a townU.S.S.R. North of Lake Ladoga.(Previous ^n *&quot;ne extreme North, it appeared that the Russians were in reference: occupation of a strip of territory on Finland&apos;s eastern border, butW.M (39) lllth ^ne situation in this area was obscure.  It was reported in a telegramConclusions, from Oslo (No. 342) that the Norwegians feared the possibility of minute 5.) &apos; tne Russians turning the Northern flank of the Finnish Army by a landing in Norwegian territory.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Imperial General staff said that he did not think the Russian advance North of lake ladoga so far made need be taken very seriously. Owing to deepsnow, large-scale operations in this district were out of the question.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had heard from the Finnish Minister that the Finnish General staff had verified the arrival of three Russian divisions at Murmansk.According to a captured Russian Officer, these divisions would beheld in reserve for later operations against Norway and Sweden.He also said that the Soviet troops had been told that the ultimate aim of the U.S.S.R. was to reach the Atlantic, from which theyhad previously been debarred by the Imperialist Powers.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegramNo. 219 from Finland, reporting the position in regard to the supplyof Italian aircraft to Finland. So far as the Director-General ofthe Finnish Foreign Office knew, the only arrangements made were those reported some time previously for the despatch of 25 aircraft by rail through Germany and thence by ship to Sweden. Only twoof these had arrived in Sweden and the remainder were held up in italy, owing to difficulties made by Germany as to transit, and the reported flight over Germany of a further 50 Italian aeroplaneswas a myth. Finland had received a few anti-aircraft gunsordered from Hungary, although Germany had made the greatest difficulty about transit, and even about the transit of a singleambulance aeroplane offered by Holland after the outbreak of the russo--Finnish War. Germany&apos;s only motive in sanctioning suchrelatively unimportant consignments of rifles as had arrived hadbeen the desire to acquire foreign exchange, and it seemed likely that the rifles, although German property, were Czech or Polishrifles. The Director-General had made it clear that any inferencethat Germany had any sympathetic feeling for Finland would bethe most complete delusion. Germany was hand in glove withRussia and it was probable that she would recognise the puppetGovernment as soon as the Finns suffered reverses in the field. TheFinnish Minister at Berlin was being treated as a pariah. TheItalian attitude, however, was very different. The Italian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs had informed the Finnish Minister in Romethat Italy was ready to do what she could for Finland, but that&quot;unfortunately, as we cannot offend Germany, we cannot do verymuch.&quot;
The Secretary of State for War referred to a suggestion :madeby Lord Bea verb rook that Scandinavian opinion in the UnitedStates should be roused by such methods as organised marchescalling for American intervention.The Prime Minister thought that the best, way to enlist UnitedStates sympathy was to do as much as possible for Finland ourselves.The Secretary of State for War said that a very comprehensivelist of requirements had been received from Finland. It wasimpossible for us to meet requests for such arms as Howitzers and anti-aircraft guns, but in addition to the 20 Gladiators, thefollowing munitions could be sent: RespiratorsEye-shields2-oz. tins of ointment (decontamination)      :.. &apos;Flame tracer ammunition   ...Anti-tank minesVerey pistols ...Hand grenadesAnti-tank riflesAmmunition for anti-tank rifles   ..Vickers machine gunsSmall Arms Ammunition   ...60,000360,00060,00050,000   roundsper week5,00020010,00010010,000 rounds1001,000,000 roundsThere was some discussion as to whether the Finns would, infact, require anti-tank rifles at the present moment and, further,whether the supply of these rifles to Finland would be at the expenseof our undertaking to Turkey.The Secretary of State for War assured the War Cabinet thatthe despatch of 100 anti-tank rifles would not interfere with our undertaking to send 50 anti-tank rifles per month to Turkey.There was general agreement that the supply of anti-tank riflesto Finland would have a valuable moral effect. .;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it would takeabout three weeks for the arms to reach Finland, and he thought itwould be advisable to send someone with the consignment to ensureits safe and timely arrival.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed with thissuggestion and undertook to make the necessary arrangements.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed that the Secretary of State for War should arrangefor the despatch of munitions to Finland, on the lines indicated by him, including the despatch of 100 anti-tank rifles.(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for a suitableagent to accompany the arms sent from this country tothe Finnish Government, in order to ensure their speedyarrival.(iii) Invited the Foreign Secretary to communicate to theFrench a list of the requests for arms which we hadreceived from Finland, and of the arms which we wereourselves supplying, in the hope that the French mightbe able to meet some of the Finnish requests.(iv) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United StatesGovernment of the action which we were taking in thismatter.
(v) Agreed that, as in the case of the 20 Gladiators, the armsshould be supplied by British firms and that, if Parlia-mentary Questions were asked on this subject, it shouldbe stated that the Government were granting export licences for the supply of certain arms to Finland(without specifying details).Balkans andthe Middle East.Military Policy.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 107thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. At the request of the Prime Minister, the Chief of theImperial General Staff gave a brief outline of the main points which had emerged from the Meeting held the previous day inParis between the Chiefs of Staff and General Gamelin. TheMeeting had been on the whole most successful and no fundamentaldivergence of view had been revealed. General Weygand had made no exaggerated claim for action in the Balkans. A full report ofthe Meeting would be placed before the War Cabinet in the nearfuture.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Yatican.Suggestion forChristmasTruce.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 107thConclusions, .Minute 9.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff on a proposal by the Vatican that a truce should be arranged to cover the 24th and 25th December (Paper W.P. (39) 155).The War Cabinet-Endorsed the opinion expressed by the Chiefs of Staff in(Paper W.P. (39) 155), namely-&quot; That a truce, even if it Avere practicable, would be most undesirable and that the proposal should be rejected.&quot;Seizure of enemy Exports.The case of theJapanese s.s.Sanyo Maru.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 12.)8. The&apos;Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theJapanese steamship Sanyo Maru Avas still at Rotterdam and would remain there until the Japanese Embassy furnished us with a copyof her manifest and we had then informed the Embassy regardingthe extent of the control to Avhich this vessel would be subject.He had arranged with the Minister for Economic Warfare thatthis preliminary stage should be prolonged as much as possible but had informed him that when any further delay would becomeobvious, he should resubmit the matter to the War Cabinet, whowould then have to take their final decision. There was no doubtthat the Japanese Embassy anticipated receiving a favourable reply from us as soon as they furnished us with the ship&apos;s manifest.In accordance with the suggestion made by the Prime Minister atthe Meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin, he had given instructions that special attention should be given to methods whichmight provide information as to the nature of the cargo of thisvessel and particularly in regard to the &quot; secret naval goods &quot; which she was said to contain. No further information had, however, yetbeen obtained on this subject.
The Balkans.British attitudetowards Sovietthreats ofaggressionagainstRoumania.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 109thConclusions,Minute 5.).9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, inaccordance with the arrangements agreed upon at the Meeting ofthe War Cabinet noted in the margin, he had consulted the FrenchGovernment in regard to the telegram proposed to be sent to HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Bucharest, in regard to our attitude in the eventof Soviet aggression against Roumania. The French Governmenthad agreed to the British draft, subject to the following modification in the second sentence of paragraph 3, where the circumstances weredefined in which the British and French Governments would considerthat &quot; an entirely new situation would be created.&quot; In the British draft it had been proposed to state that this situation would have arisen &quot; if Italy&apos;s neutrality were to be assured and if Turkeywere to declare her intention to go to war with the U.S.S.R.,&quot; while in the French draft this phrase ran &quot; if Italy&apos;s neutrality wereto be assured and if Turkey were to show that she was ready to collaborate with France and Great Britain with a view to assistingRoumania to resist Russian attack.&quot; He (the Secretary of State)had not thought that this change was one of substance, and he had accordingly accepted it. The telegram in its amended form hadbeen despatched the previous evening (telegram No. 769 toBucharest).The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.League ofNations.Meeting of theCouncil and assembly.(previous reference.:W.M. (39) 108thConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprevious afternoon M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, had told him that the French Government felt that the least which it wouldbe possible to justify to French public opinion would be theexpulsion of the U.S.S.R. from the League. As regards sanctions,the French Government did not propose to make proposals, but,if other Governments were to take the lead, they were preparedto follow the general example. He (the Secretary of State) had replied that the instructions given to the British Delegation wereto the effect that above all things they were to- avoid giving theimpression that we were not clear as to our attitude towards theU.S.S.R., and that, if the question of the expulsion of the U.S.S.R.was raised, they were unhesitatingly to vote for expulsion; asregards sanctions, they were to state clearly that these were not practicable and that the proper course would be for each Govefn-ment to take such steps as seemed proper. Later in the day,M. Corbin had telephoned to say that the French Government feared that if sanctions were not imposed against the U.S.S.R., Italy mightclaim that the League were treating the U.S.S.R.- more lenientlythan they had treated Italy in the case of Abyssinia. Further, theFrench Government might find it necessary themselves to propose the expulsion of the U.S.S.R. in view of French public opinion.He (the Secretary of State) proposed to inform M. Corbin that while,as he was aware, we were willing unhesitatingly to vote forexpulsion, we were definitely opposed to any attempt to imposesanctions.The Prime Minister agreed that we should oppose the applica-tion of sanctions. As regards expulsion, we had already decidedto support it,&apos; if brought to a vote; but under the procedure of theLeague, which required unanimity in the Council, it was unlikelythat this motion would be effectively carried owing to China&apos;attitude. The effect of these proceedings might therefore be to bringfurther discredit on the League. He personally rather regretted that we had proposed that a time limit of twenty-four hours shouldbe given to the U.S.S.R. in which to state whether they were willingto cease hostilities against Finland and accept the mediation ofthe League.   In view of the impotence of the League, it would, he
scandinavian countries.possible developments.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 6.)thought, have been preferable merely to inform the U.S.S.R. that,if no reply were received within the time limit, it would be assumed that she had refused the League&apos;s suggestion.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that no doubt the action taken by our delegation in this matter was prompted bythe general instructions, which they had been given, above all things to avoid giving the impression that we were not clear as to our attitude towards the U.S.S:R.The War Cabinet agreed That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the French Ambassador that, while we were willingunhesitatingly to vote for the expulsion of the U.S.S.R.from the League of Nations, we were definitely opposed toany attempt on the part of the League to impose sanctions.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said theprevious afternoon he had told the French Ambassador that wewere proposing to study the strategical situation which, on the basisof various assumptions, might arise in the Scandinavian countries,and that we should be very glad to communicate to the FrenchGovernment the conclusions which we might reach on this subject.M. Corbin had taken a gloomy view, believing that Sweden and norway might decide to accept German protection against theU.S.S.R.,The Prime Minister said that in that event the scandinavian countries would not be able to secure the advantages of neutralityin their relations with us, and that we should be free to make useof their territorial waters.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that thiswould be so, and reminded the War Cabinet that we treated theformer Czecho-Slovak territories as enemy territory.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Turkey.financial arrangements.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 11.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 144).The Chancellor explained that the main points to be covered in the proposed financial arrangements with Turkey were asfollows : (1) We should have to agree with Turkey&apos;s demand that theservice of the war material credit of  25 millions shouldbe paid in Turkish currency which should be used forthe purchase of Turkish goods.(2) In return for this we should obtain our requirements inregard to chrome.In this connection the Minister without Portfoliopointed out that the exports of chrome from Turkeyamounted to more than one-third of the world&apos;s output,which was some 556,000 tons per year. Last yearTurkish exports of chrome had been some 208,000 tons,of which some 68,000 tons had gone to Germany.(3) M. Numan, the Secretary-General of the Turkish ForeignOffice, had said that, if we wished to buy all Turkey&apos;schrome, we must also buy 40,000 tons of sultanas, 12,000tons of nuts and 10,000 tons of figs a year, for the duration of the war. . The cost would be about 2 millions a year. These were enormous quantities,and far more than the Minister of Food could put to
Turkey. 13.   The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence made a state-Anti-tank Guns. ment regarding the discussions with M. Numan on the Turkish(Previous Governments demand for anti-tank guns.   The Turkish view was reference: that the important campaigns of the spring of 1940 were moreW.M. (39) mth likely to take place on the Thracian plains than on the WesternConclusions Front, and that it was essential to send anti-tank guns to TurkeyMinute ll)&apos;      before Germany mounted any offensive in the Balkans.The War Cabinet were informed that during the discussions of the previous day between the Chiefs of Staff- and general gamelin, it had been suggested that the Turks should be given a proportion of the 25-mm. anti-tank guns which the French were under contract to supply to us. [Of our order of 500 of these guns,there were still 280 to be delivered, which would become availablein January and February 1940.] It was suggested that, if this happened, the French would take the whole credit for the trans-action, suppressing the fact that the guns had already been promised to us.Our own production of anti-tank guns was much in arrears.The only alternative source of supply was the Breda gun from Italy.Tests of Breda guns in Italy were now being carried out, and theoutput of Breda guns would be at the rate of 50 guns a month,starting in four months time. The Turks, however, wanted the guns by February.any reasonable use. It seemed that we should have toaccept this demand in order to secure Turkey&apos;s exportsof chrome.(4) As regards the gold loan, we should, if possible, stipulate that, instead of being obliged to send the  15 millions in gold to Ankara, we should be allowed to deliver it tothe Turks in London and in Paris.(5) M. Numan had suggested that, as security for certaintransactions which he wished to put through imme-diately, the Bank of England should lend gold to theTurkish Central Bank to the amount of some 3 millions. Instead of this, the Chancellor proposedto insist on the Turkish Government pledging 3 millions out of the  15 millions gold loan, unlessthe Turks would agree to our proposal at (4) above.These suggestions had been discussed with the representativesof the Departments concerned, who concurred in them.The Chancellor explained that the Financial Agreement withthe French did not apply to the loans to Turkey, which were thesubject of a separate arrangement. While he did not expect to achieve complete agreement at his interview that afternoon withM. Numan, he hoped that the interview would mark a distinct step forward in the process of reaching a financial settlement with turkey.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, while he appreciated that we were unlikely to reach early and complete agreement with the Turkish Government, he was sure that theChancellor of the Exchequer, in his negotiations with M. Numan,would bear in mind the importance of preventing the export ofchrome to Germany, and of reaching a settlement which would ensure the willing co-operation of the Turkish Government.The War Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to negotiate with the Turkish Government on the lines indicated inhis Memorandum, and to reach a settlement on the most favourable terms obtainable.
The Secretary of State for War said that he was opposed toletting Turkey have any of the anti-tank guns which the french had promised to us. Even without handing over these guns, theBritish Expeditionary Force in France would be seriously deficientin both tanks and anti-tank guns.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, after the conversations which he had had with General Gamelin, he refused tobelieve that the French would play fast and loose with us in thismatter. On the Turkish position being put to General Gamelin, thelatter had indicated that, if we were prepared to reconsider our anti-tank gun position with a view to assisting the Turks, he also wouldbe prepared to reconsider his position.It was necessary to weigh the danger of the Turkish Govern-ment running out of their Agreement with us, if we could not satisfy them on this particular point. General Weygand andGeneral Wavell had considered this to be a real danger, but he(General Ironside) could not believe that Marshal Chakmak wouldbe influenced, in so vital a decision, by a matter of 150 anti-tank guns.Any reduction of the supplies destined for the british expeditionary Force was a serious matter. Nevertheless, he feltthat the decision would have to be taken mainly on political grounds.It was presumably a major object of policy to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to preserve the Turkish Alliance at almost any cost.On the assumption that some provision of anti-tank guns wouldhave to be made available to the Turks, the War Cabinet discussed the number of guns which could be spared. The original Turkishdemand, which had been for 800 guns, was not practical politics.The maximum number available was represented by our unfulfilledorder for 280 guns. It was suggested that, of this number, 100 guns,or, alternatively, 150 guns, might be made available to the Turks.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theForeign Office thought that the risk of a political swing-over inTurkey was not great. There was, however, always the danger that Turkey might drift back, economically, into the German orbit.His own view was that we should be incurring a distinct risk ifwe allowed the Turks to receive the impression that they werenot getting the assistance to which they were entitled. In that event, they would be unlikely to break away from us at once, butthey might begin to sit loosely to the Alliance. On the whole, hewas inclined to think that the Turks should have 100 of the anti-tank guns we had ordered from France.     &apos;&apos;s-:nThe Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested that itmight be possible to make an arrangement with General Gamelinby which the Turks were given 200 guns 100 from France, and100 taken out of our order placed in France.The War Cabinet agreed: That the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, at his forthcoming interview with M. Numan, should beauthorised to settle this matter either (a) by promising to Turkey 100 anti-tank guns out of the outstanding order of 280 from France, on the under-standing that the French would make an equal number available; or(b) if it  appeared  that the  French  authorities were unwilling to offer any anti-tank guns to Turkey,by promising up to 150 guns out of the outstandingorder from France.
Refugees fromGreaterGermany.;;-:.Proposal forAssistance from public funds.14. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by theCommittee on the Refugee Problem, under the Chairmanship ofthe Secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 138),submitting proposals for t)he provision of assistance from public funds for alien refugees in the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the CentralOrganisations which were at present wholly responsible for themaintenance of some 13,300 refugees from Greater Germany in thiscountry (the Jewish Committee being responsible for 85-90 per cent,of these) would be unable to go on with their maintenancefor more than a few days. In these circumstances the committee could see no alternative but to propose that these refugees shouldbe maintained for the next six months partly at the cost of theNational Exchequer and partly at that of the voluntary organisa-tions who had accepted the responsibility to maintain them. They,therefore, asked the War Cabinet to accept this principle, so thatthe Departments concerned might negotiate with the voluntary organisations on this basis. It might be difficult to persuade the voluntary organisations to accept even a share of the cost, but theywould do their best to persuade them to do so at any rate for thenext six months.It was hoped to avoid any public announcement on the matter,but, if such an announcement were necessary, it was suggested thatno mention should be made of the fact that it was proposed that theassistance from the Exchequer was to be calculated on the basis of8s. per head per week, in addition to that provided by the voluntary organisations.The Minister of Labour said that this was important, because it would be embarrassing to the Unemployment Assistance Boardand to the Exchequer if it became known that the scheme was basedon grants amounting to 8s. per head from the Exchequer and 8s.per head from the voluntary organisations, as there were cases ofBritish subjects who would not qualify for assistance on this scale.The Lord Privy Seal said that he was satisfied that the voluntary organisations had done their best to fulfil the under-takings which they had made when the refugees concerned wereadmitted to this country, but that the war and the consequentincreases in taxation had entirely changed the position for them.In regard to the suggestion that Governments of south american Republics should be approached in connection with war trade Agreements to facilitate the entry into their countries of refugees from this country, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (who had left the Meeting before this point) left a note tosay that no War Trade negotiations were being conducted with theArgentine Republic or Brazil, but that he would be glad to usewhat influence he could to secure their co-operation in the manner suggested.The War Cabinet--(i) Agreed to accept in principle the proposals of theCommittee on the Refugee Problem for assistingrefugees from Greater Germany in the United kingdom as set out in the Annex to Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 138,and to authorise the Secretary of State for the home department to negotiate with the Jewish Committeeand the other Committees concerned with a view to obtaining their acceptance of it.
(ii) Took note of the fact that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would do what he could to persuade theGovernments of the South American Republics tofacilitate the entry into their countries of the refugeesin question.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,December 12, 1939.
