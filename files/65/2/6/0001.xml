The First-Lord-of the-: Admiralty said that; po.,attacfe- on opr. trade or oh German &apos; submarines&apos; in previous.1$ future, submarines would be employed in escorting convoys.No special steps would be taken to keep this policy secret, as thefact that we were employing our submarines in this manner was likely to have a valuable deterrent effect.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.(Previous    ,Reference:W.M. (39) 71stConclusions,  .Minute 3.)-Tisit to IfBaaoeby the FlesfcLord of theAdmiralty.3. The Secretary of State for War said that the total numberof German divisions on the Western Front remained at 133. Thedisposal of the divisions opposite the Dutch Frontier was consistent with the possibility of a German attack pn Holland.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.; 4. The First Lord of the A dmiralty gave the following accountof his recent visit to France. He had seen M. Daladier who, at the outset of the meeting, appeared to be labouring under a sense ofimminent, crisis. He undoubtedly felt, that unless the Germanstook the offensive either in France or against this country, in thevery near future, the opportunity for doing so, with any hope ofsuccess, would not present itself again until next spring. TheGermans must be fully alive to this, and to the fact that if they remained inactive until the spring it would be tantamount to agreat victory in the field for the Allies.The First Lord said that he had explained the reasons why we had not mentioned any figure for the number of divisions whichwe were raising beyond the figure of 32, which-had already been stated to Parliament for all our purposes. He had said that we wished to go better than our word, that the whole strength of thecountry was being thrown into the struggle,. and that we werearranging to provide equipment for a considerably greater numberof divisions. He felt that he had left M. Daladier in a moreoptimistic frame of mind.: His conversations with Admiral DArlan on the Naval positionbad been most satisfactory, and the French Naval Authorities hadbeen ready to meet us on all points. They were taking steps tocomplete the destroyers now building as soon as possible. Thecontruction of the battleships Richelieu and Jean Bart was also being pressed forward. He had been assured that the requiredskilled labour for carrying out this work in the shortest possibletime&apos;would be provided.&apos; He had had long conversations with General Gamelin andGeneral Geprges during which a number of points had arisen which,thotigh p^ihiarilythe businessof the&apos; Army, also affected the Navy..Llfirst        ;yra* &apos;&quot;$e, ^ifbstipli.of ;the;; fey&apos; the British Army of the&apos;0h$n^elp in shortening the ArmyV^release an appreciable number. these destroyers could then&apos;H^&apos;$f$i^^ throughout*t tPlSl$^^ would pass.;:it;h^&apos;$ still underth! of x?ijai*training jRvsmce, to districts such.as could feeplaced2
disposal,would, remain .,-unwere&quot;--fit; for battle&apos;,adapted for training and the presence of these British troops would;have a most heartening-effect- on the French -and perhaps a usefuleffect, on Italian opinion.   In this connection there was much-tobe,said for sending the Canadian Division.-direct to Francg.?.;:jath^erthan to this country, in- the first instance.   . .....A further point which had been.mentioned was the desirabilityof sending petrol supplies for the,British Army direct to france in bulk, instead of, as at present, re-shipping them in containersfrom this country.The Secretary of State for War entirely; agreed with what hadbeen said on the use of the Channel ports. He emphasised, however,that it would be necessary to maintain our present lines ofcommunication, and that the use of additional ports would entailvery heavy requirements in line of communication troops and increased demands for anti-aircraft protection. The War Officealready had the matter in hand. He was attracted to the idea ofthe training of both our own and Canadian units being completed in France, and he would go very closely into the matter.Continuing, the Secretary of State for War said that, on thequestion of the Army&apos;s petrol supplies, the present arrangements were necessary, owing to the lack of storage accommodation inFrance. The matter had been taken up with the.. french authorities, and the Army&apos;s petrol would be sent direct to france as soon as they could let us have the necessary tankage.The War Cabineto-(1) Took note of the First Lord&apos;s account of his visit toFrance.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War ; to consider thepossibility of certain British; troops, including the firstCanadian Division, completing their training m France,and to submit a Memorandum to the War Cabinet.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for War to submit a replyto M. Daladier?s letter of the 27th October 1939, to the* a Prime Minister, based on the number of Divisions whichwe should be ready to put into the Field in France byFebruary 1940.taey implications-tioiis of aGermanInvasion.(previous reference:W.M. (89) 61stConclusions,Minute 5.)a*5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report by theChiefs of Staff Committee on the Military Implications of a german invasion of Holland (Paper W;P.

He-had: suggested&apos; in his Memorandum, that the Estimates Committee should take onthe work, with suitable new terms of reference, but he now under-stood that the Chief Whip was doubtful whether this would bethe best course.It was generally agreed that a Committee should foe appointed on the lines suggested, and the main point raised in discussion was whether the Estimates Committee should be asked to take on this work, or whether some new Committee should be appointed. TheChairman and members of the Estimates Committee had consider-able experience of this type of work, and would be very suitable totake it on. They might also feel somewhat affronted if their services were not used for this purpose. On the other hand, thewishes of the House might be more fully met by the appointmentof an ad hoc Committee. It was agreed that this aspect of thematter should be further considered.As regards the terms of reference, the Committee would, ofcourse, not be concerned with Government policy, but with thequestion whether the Governments policy was economically carriedout. AH services connected with the war should fall within the purview of the Committee, and not merely the Defence Services.From this point of view the wording of Sir Archibald Sinclair&apos;motion was too narrow. It must, of course, be understood that therewould be a number of matters which the Committee would not beable to investigate, on grounds of secrecy.The War Cabinet agreed :-(i) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer should make a. statement in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the7th November, in regard to the Governments intentionsto appoint a Select Committee on National expenditure for the period of the war.     A(ii) That this statement should follow the general lines proposed in the Chancellors Memorandum, subject tothe following :-(a.) that no reference should foe made to Sir archibald sinclair&apos;s Motion in indicating the general termsof reference proposed; and(6) that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider further, and decide in consultation with thePrime Minister, whether;the Estimates Committee;,!:v&apos;&apos;&apos;:should^ppropriate terms of reference, or whether-::hew;-Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,
