The ? Situation. (Previous Reference: W,M. (39) 66th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there had been little German air activity in the previous twenty-four hours. A few German reconnaissance machines had been sighted and in each case they had been driven off.

Effective reconnaissance over North-West Germany had revealed no undue movement by road or water. One of our reconnaissance machines had not, so far, returned. One of our fighters had been shot down, the pilot landing safely by parachute in France.

During night operations over Germany red searchlight beams had been observed. These were presumably thought to be more effective in misty or cloudy conditions.

The War Cabinet:--

(1) Took note of the above statement.

(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to arrange for an examination into the possibility of special searchlight beams for the purpose of penetrating clouds.

       -------------------------------------------------

The Naval Situation. (Previous Reference: W,M. (39) 66th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that no attacks had been made on British merchant ships in the previous twenty-four hours. One French ship had been sunk. Further-attacks had been made on submarines, and the submarine reported on the previous day as probably damaged was now considered to have been definitely destroyed. There was also good reason to suppose that one of the merchant ships in the Narvik convoy had rammed and sunk a submarine.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

       -------------------------------------------------

The "City of Flint." (Previous Reference: W,M. (39) 66th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

3. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that, in company with the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, he had had an interview with the United States Ambassador on the previous day. Mr. Kennedy had agreed to recommend to his Government that. the Norwegian Government should be urged, on the ground of the irregularities which had occurred, to apprehend the City of Flint, intern the German prize crew and release the ship to her American owners.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

      -------------------------------------------------

Security of Fleet Bases. (Previous Reference: W,M. (39) 65th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

4. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet of the results of the discussion which he and the First Sea Lord had had with the Commander-in-Chief, and of the action which it had been decided to take. This discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

      -------------------------------------------------

Fire. Control of communications between Ireland and this country. (Previous Reference: W,M. (39) 65th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

 5. The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the rapidity with which accurate information on such matters as Fleet movements, rearrangement of defences, and so forth, was being received in Germany. A ban on telegraph and telephone communication to Ireland would at least have a big delaying action on the receipt of information, and it, must be remembered that a few hours might be of vital importance where the Naval movements were concerned.

The Minister without Portfolio doubted whether the stoppage of telephone and telegraph messages alone would have the desired effect. There was strong reason to believe that communication was

 [20258].                                               B 2
taking place from very low wave wireless sets which, at present, we were unable to detect. The perfecting of suitable apparatus was being pressed forward as fast as possible.

The Lord Privy Seal said that there was a reverse side to the question of communication to Eire. He had been informed that a considerable amount of intelligence on the mouvement of submarines was available in Eire, but that no channel existed for passing the information rapidly to the authorities in this country.

The Chief of Naval Staff said that a Naval Attaché was being sent to Dublin, to whom such information could be passed. He pointed out that we had a number of agents in Ireland, and a trawler was engaged in watching the coast. A number of rumours of submarine mouvements were current, but there had not so far been any confirming reports. He would be glad to be put into touch with the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s informant.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

           --------------------------------------------

The Military Situation.(Previous Reference: W.M. (39)66th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

6. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that the total strength of the German Divisions on the Western Front had been increased by one in the Aachen area. There was one Division less in the Saar, but this was compensated for by an increase of one Division in the Basle area.

           --------------------------------------------

Weekly Reports. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 59th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

7. The War Cabinet took note of the following Reports :--

(a) 8th Weekly Report by the Secretary of State for War (Paper W.P. (39) 106)

(b) 8th Weekly Report by the Secretary of State for Air (Paper W.P. (39) 105)

           --------------------------------------------

German report of British supply to Poland. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 66th Conclusions, Minute 7 and 8.)

8. The Secretary of State for War said that he had arranged for the issue of a statement on the lines suggested at the previous meeting of the War Cabinet. He had also cancelled the instructions issued to the British Advisory Censor in Paris that no mention should be made of possible gas attacks, although he had not yet discovered whence the original instructions had issued.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Soviet aggression against Finland or other Scandinavian countries. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 57th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on Soviet aggression against Finland or other Scandinavian countries, to which was annexed a copy of telegram No. 161 from Mr. Snow (Helsingfors) dated the 21st October, 1939 (Paper W.P. (39) 107).

The Chief of Naval Staff gave the War Cabinet a résumé of the Report paragraph by paragraph.

The Secretary of Stats for Foreign Affairs said that the Chiefs of Staff had entirely reflected his own views on this matter. These views were, moreover, confirmed by M. Molotov&apos;s speech of the previous day, which showed that the Russians were not out for adventures. This opinion was supported by the telegram No. ? from
Stockholm, which reported. Field-marshal goering: as having said^   -I.   1&quot;:, :&apos;kJZ    .

Tike -XT/eito such criticism was that we must take first things first. The onlyar^umeh^;l^ffiieh\ c^ried/&quot;&apos;^!^ one - made- in para-graph 15 of the Chiefs of Staff Report, namely, whether a stand against Russian aggression would bring us accretions of strengthfrrim neutrals.In. this connection he agreed that we should not be justifiedin adding to our present burden by declaring war on Russia unless and until the United States of America had definitely rangedthemselves on our side. There was general agreement with the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary.The War Cabinet agreed : To approve the views expressed by the Chiefs of Staffin their report on Soviet aggression against Finland orother Scandinavian countries (Paper W.P. (39) 107) and,in particular, their conclusion that &quot; Great Britain andFrance are at present in no position to undertakeadditional burdens and that we cannot, therefore, from a&apos;military point of view, recommend that we should declare war on Russia.&quot;. 10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drewattentionto telegram No. 171, dated the 31st October, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Helsingfors, reporting that the Finnishdelegation was returning to Moscow that evening. The Finnish minister for Foreign Affairs had informed Mr. Snow that morningthat there was only one point outstanding in regard to which noadjustment of Finnish and Soviet views was in sight:The Secretary of State added that it seemed, therefore, as though the U.S.S.R. might have withdrawn their most extremedemands, thus leaving over one point which so far. had provedimpracticable. Mr. Snow&apos;s telegram showed that in Helsingforsat least the situation was not viewed with undue alarm.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that onthe whole M. Molotov&apos;s speech of the previous day could be regardedas satisfactory from our point of view. Though giving full moral support to Germany&apos;s case, M. Molotov had made no concretepromises of more active assistance. Moreover, he had emphasised that: the1 Soviet-German pact provided that- the; U.S.S.R. should remain neutral if Germany was involved inwar. :T^ above statement.

(39) 65thConclusions,Minute 8.)13. The Secretary of State for Foreign A flairs drew attentionto telegram No. 84 dated the 28th October, 1939, received from HisMajesty s Minister to the Holy See, in which Mr Osborne reportedhaying gathered from a very high and well-informed source inclose touch with the Vatican that the German Government, actingthrough an unofficial channel, was continuously bringing strong pressure to bear directly upon the Pope to induce him to believe in the possibility of a peace settlement at the present time and toaccept assurances from Germany on the Catholic and other questions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Balkans.Plan for theformation of a neutral bloc.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 63rdConclusions,Minute 7.)(previous reference:W.M. (39) 62ndConclusions,Minute 11.)Internal ;CEuaafion.(previous reference:14. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that itwas clear from various telegrams received from the British missions in the Balkan countries that the possibility of forming a Balkanneutral bloc was arousing considerable interest. He referred, inparticular, to telegram No. 517 from His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Athens, in which Sir Michael Palairet reported having beeninformed by the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thatthe Greek Government had just received a telegram from theRoumanian Government suggesting a Balkan neutral and no -aggression bloc, this bloc to include both Hungary and Italy. the under-Secretary had indicated that the Greek Government would reply that they were ready to examine such a proposal with the othermembers of the Balkan Entente, either by diplomatic correspondenceor at a special meeting. He had added, however, that his firstimpression was definitely hostile to the idea of a Balkan bloc underthe patronage of Italy, a proposal which he thought it would be equally difficult for Turkey to accept. The inclusion of Hungary,on the other hand, would rouse no difficulty.The Secretary of State felt that the Greeks probablyexaggerated the degree of anxiety which Turkey would feel as tothe possibility of the inclusion of Italy in such a bloc. As arranged at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin, he proposedto discuss the whole question of the possibility of forming a Balkanbloc with Sir Percy Loraine, whom he had arranged to .see:&apos;$hatafternoon. When hie (the Secretary of^State) had seen Sir Perbyl he proposed to telegraph to His majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, inorder (as suggested by the Secretary of State for War at the meetingof the War Cabinet noted in the margin) to clear to;theTurkish Government that we realised that the proposal to form aBalkan Woe owed its inspiration to Tazxtoy.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.,;   .      &quot;3 coat) IC ^1 iJ:T^7j-VrswoT-&apos;5: J&quot;TssS^M

(39) 52ndConclusions,Minute 9.)16. The War Cabinet had- before them a Note: by theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 63) covering aMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade on the subjectof the difficulties which would arise, owing to the existence of long-term colliery contracts, in the fixing of an increased price for coalin order to allow for the increase in wages authorised by the WarCabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin, and in other costs of production.the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, much as he dislikedhaving to suggest such a course, he saw no alternative but to acceptthe recommendation of the President of the Board of Trade that aminimum price should be fixed for coal for internal use, even if this meant overriding existing long-term contracts. Lord Stamp had suggested that the colliery owners should in the first instance try tonegotiate a friendly agreement with the larger consumers concerned for the revision of their contracts, but the reply had been that theycorisidered that it was a matter for the Government to deal with by regulation.The President of the Board of Trade said that he did not likethe proposal which he had put forward, but he could see no other alternative. Many of the purchasers of coal under the contracts inquestion would be able to pass on their increased costs, but therewould be some difficult cases, such as pottery and glass manufaturers-turers, who had sold their own production forward on longcontracts. It was unfortunate that this difficulty had not beenbrought forward at an earlier stage, hat the Mining association had said that they did not know beforehand how much coal wasbeing sold on long contracts.The Secretary for Mines said that the difficulty arose from thefact that in the case of coal the Government had not taken controlover the commodity as such, as they had in the case of a numberof other:important raw materials. If the owners were not&apos;allowed in one way or another a price increase sufficient to cover the wage increase already granted and other increases in costs, wages would fall under the ascertainment procedure and there would then beincreased pressure on the Government to take the mines over. Therewas no &quot;question of allowing anything for additional profits in fixing the new price of coal.- Some of the spokesmen for the gas and electricity industries had said, in the course of the negotiations fora voluntary revision of contracts, that it was in their view equitablethat the increased price should be spread over all consumers.In the course of discussion the following points were made: - -&apos;-(1) &quot;Could the difScE&amp;j- be. got over by a subsidy from the.Exchequer?  This would mean a, subsidy of  3 millions
(3) In reply to this, it was pointed out that some measure of protection was provided for cases of this kind, and that a Committee was considering what further action could be taken on this matter.

(4) It was also urged that the coal industry stood on a different footing from other industries, owing to the special relationship between the wages of miners and the pithead price of coal.

(5) It was also urged that business firms could not be expected to provide against all the contingencies of war, and that any action taken to override contracts in war-time would not, therfore, form a precedent for any similar action in peace.

The general view of the War Cabinet was that, while there was great force in the objections to the present proposal, there was no practical alternative.

The War Cabinet accordingly agreed:--

To approve the proposal that the President of the Board of Trade should by Regulation, despite existing contracts, prohibit the sale of coal at anything less than a permitted price; it being understood that in the case of contracts without a "break clause" this would be determined by adding the authorised increase to the existing contract price.

         --------------------------------------------------

Russia. Proposal for a Trade Agreement.(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 13.)

17. The President of the Board of Trade said that he had little to add to the statement which he had made at the Meeting of the War Cabinet referred to in the margin. He had ascertained indirectly that M. Maisky had not yet received authority from Moscow to begin negotiations in London. The delay was attributed by the Soviet Embassy to the preoccupation of the Moscow authorities with the arrangements for the previous day&apos;s meeting of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that it would be an error in tactics for His Majesty&apos;s Government to appear unduly anxious to start the negotiations.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

         --------------------------------------------------

Restriction of Imports from the United States of America and Canada. .(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 54th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

18. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded his colleagues that, at the Meeting referred to in the margin, they had left it to him to decide as to the method to be adopted in intimating to the United States Government that we proposed to prohibit the entry of apples and pears from the United States during the remainder of the present season. Now that the United States Neutrality Bill was making such satisfactory progress, he had seen the American Ambassador and had conveyed to him the War Cabinet&apos;s decision. He had explained that this decision was the inevitable result of the drain on our dollar resources, which would continue throughout the war. Mr. Kennedy had received this message in a very different way from that in which he had received our message on the subject of the admission of American films. He had made no objection and had, indeed, shown the greatest goodwill. Neither Mr. Kennedy nor he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) had made any reference to our imports of Canadian apples and pears.

He had handed the Ambassador an aide mémoire, in addition to informing him orally of our intentions.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
