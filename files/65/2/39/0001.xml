The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 104thConclusions,Minute 1.)o1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there had been considerable enemy activity off the East Coast during the previous night, about 15 raids in all having been plotted.Two aircraft appeared to have crossed the coast: one in theneighbourhood of Norwich, and one near Hull, which had pene-trated to Sheffield and the Midlands. The activity had seemed tohave been along the route of the East Coast convoy, between SpurnPoint and North Foreland, and had been greatest in the vicinity of the Thames Estuary.It had been a very dark night, and there had been no reportsof anything having been seen to drop from the aircraft. one aircraft, however, was reported to have landed on the water, not farfrom the Isle of Sheppey, and a searchlight on the island was reported to have been fired at.A Fighter section had been sent up in the latter part of the night, but had not made any interception. One enemy aircraft hadcrashed on the beach near Sheringham.There had been two attacks on U-boats by aircraft, but withoutdefinite result.In reply to enquiries, the Chief of the Air Staff said that theGerman aircraft had carried out a very difficult operation in theconditions prevailing the night before. They had probably beenguided by a beacon situated at Sylt. Our pilots who had gone uphad reported that they could see nothing.The aircraft which had crossed the coast might have beenattempting to locate particular objectives, or might have lost their way. It was probable that the aircraft reported to have landed onthe water had not been within range of defensive weapons. Therehad formerly been certain restrictions limiting the opening of fireagainst single aircraft, but these had now been removed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Naval 2.

Weekly Reports.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 98thConclusions,Minute 4.)Finland.Invasion by soviet Union.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 104thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The War Cabinet took note of Weekly Reports by the secretaries of State for War and Air (W.P. (39) 147 and 146).5. The Secretary of State for War said that Press reports from Copenhagen stated that Russian troops had occupiedKuolajarvi in the north of Finland. There was no confirmation ofthis report, but it was a likely operation. It was also reported that russian troops from Murmansk had been landed near Petsamo.Such an operation could easily be carried out, but it was doubtfulwhether the troops would make much progress owing to the verydifficult nature of the country and the bad climatic conditions.There was no change in the situation in the Karelian Isthmus and north of Lake Ladoga. The Finns claimed to have bombedMurmansk and to have captured 64 Russian tanks.The Secretary of State for Air added that bad weather had prevented much air activity. The clothing of captured Russianairmen was reported to be of very inferior quality.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Dominion AirTrainingScheme.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 100thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat a reply had just been received from the Prime Minister ofCanada to the telegram which had been despatched to him as aresult of the discussion which had taken place at the meeting ofthe War Cabinet referred to in the margin.The Secretary of State then read the telegram which had beenreceived (No. 125, dated the 6th December, 1939, a copy of whichis attached as an Annex to the present Conclusions).He thought that the terms of the draft statement which mr. Mackenzie King now favoured were acceptable; but he wouldtake an opportunity of consulting the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, before submitting a draft reply to the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet agreed to this course.League ofNations.forthcoming meeting of theCouncil and assembly.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 409, dated the 5th December, 1939, from Paris,in which our Ambassador reported that he had been informed byM. Champetier de Ribes that the French Government thought thatthe intention of a number of neutral countries, including certainSouth American States, to demand the expulsion of the U.S.S.R.from the League of Nations at the impending meeting of theAssembly, might give rise to an &quot; interesting situation&quot; whichmight be turned to our advantage. The French Government realised the importance of not provoking the U.S.S.R., but in the face ofFrench public opinion they could not appear to acquiesce in theatrocious crimes against Finland. M. Daladier had been thinking of going to Geneva himself, and had not, M. de Ribes thought,entirely abandoned the idea.The Secretary of State added that he proposed to ascertain from M. Daladier the nature of the situation which he thoughtmight arise at Geneva, and at the same time to discourage him from himself attending the League meeting. If, however,M. Daladier decided himself to represent France at this meeting,the War Cabinet might wish to consider whether or not he (theSecretary of State) should also be present.
Italy.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 104thConclusions,Minute 9.)Attitudetowards the united kingdom:contraband control.(previous reference:WM. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 11.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that beforeSir Percy Loraine had left London, he had handed to him a personal letter for delivery to Count Ciano. The latter had now sent a written reply in which he drew attention to the grievances of Italianshipping on account of our Contraband Control. In telegramNo. 1197, Sir Percy Loraine had expressed the view that count ciano had made these representations under Signor Mussolini&apos;orders and that the latter, though possibly disillusioned about theGermans, was still nurturing his grudges against the democracies,and had not yet moved closer to us in personal sympathy. the ambassador considered that both the question of Italian shipping and also doubts in Italy regarding the genuineness of our intentionto place considerable orders with Italian industry were likely to bediscussed by the Grand Fascist Council at its meeting on the9th December, 1939, and were likely to react to our disadvantage.The Secretary of State felt that the situation demanded the greatest care, and that our best course would be to go slow in the matter of contraband Control in relation to Italian shipping, but to press on as rapidly as possibly with our purchases from Italian industry.The Prime Minister said that Signor Mussolini was in a very embarrassing position and was sensitive in regard to his personalengagements to Germany. It was natural therefore that he shouldreact violently, whenever his attention was drawn to Italiangrievances against this country.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was important that it should be against this background that Anglo-Italian economic relations should be judged.The Prime Minister thought that M. Daladier should be discouraged from going to Geneva, since this would give undueimportance to the meeting, which could not produce any usefulresults. Even if M. Daladier decided to go to Geneva, he (the PrimeMinister) would require a lot of convincing that it was desirable for the Foreign Secretary to do so also.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that we might reapsome advantage from the meeting of the League, since the discussionthere would tend to focus the conviction that in the war we stoodfor the principles of humanity against barbaric aggression. Therewas also strong support in this country for international co-opera-tion, and some organisation for this purpose would be needed afterthe war.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that theLeague of Nations should be treated with proper respect, but hispredominant feeling was that the forthcoming meeting would befutile and could therefore only tend to discredit the idea ofinternational co-operation. There was also the danger, that ifundue importance were attached to the meeting at Geneva, signor mussolini might become more difficult to deal with.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.
Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 10.)Attitudetowards theU.S.S.R. in the balkans.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 1199, dated the 5th December, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, in which Sir Percy Loraine reportedthat he had been informed by the Daily Telegraph correspondentthat he had a representative at present in Hungary. This repre-sentative had reported that the Hungarians were alarmed at theaction of the U.S.S.R. in concentrating military forces on theirfrontier. Moreover, the Ukrainians in Hungary were being told that they would shortly be liberated. Sir Percy Loraine added that,according to the Daily Telegraph correspondent, the head of theForeign Press Bureau had authorised him categorically to state that italy would go immediately to the assistance of Hungary in theevent of her being attacked by the U.S.S.R.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.France.Anglo-Frenchfinancialarrangements.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 99thConclusions,Minute 11.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G.) (39) 135) on the results ofhis recent discussions with M. Paul Reynaud, the French Ministerof Finance. It was explained in the Memorandum that M. reynaud had been prepared, apart from one question which remained out-standing, to sign a comprehensive Anglo-French Financial Agree-ment, putting into practical effect, for the duration of the war andfor a period of six months after the signature of the Treaty ofPeace, the principle of monetary and financial co-operation.There were attached to the Chancellors Memorandum : (1) a summary which had been prepared for communication tothe Press, if the Agreement had been signed;(2) the French text of the Agreement, as initialled, but notsigned;(3) the English text of the above;together with other relevant documents.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Anglo-FrenchFinancial Agreement would secure for us a number of points towhich we attached great importance. He instanced thefollowing : (a) The French would supply us, in return for sterling, withall the francs we needed for the British ExpeditionaryForce.(b) The French would not ask to have gold for the sterlingwhich they now held (some  20 millions) or for furtheramounts of sterling which they might acquire; nor would they be, free to sell that sterling for dollars.(c) No alterations were to be made in the official rate ofexchange between the   and the franc without prioragreement between the two Governments.The difficulty which had prevented the signature of the Agree-ment was the French insistence that our contribution to certainexpenses in the common cause* should be double the French contri-bution.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had proposed* Namely: &quot;(1) future financial assistance to neutral and Allied countries;(2) losses on blockade purchases;(3) the expenses of the Polish armed forces and Czecho-Slovak armed forces(if and when raised);(4) expenditure under the following clause:  &apos; If the development of the war in third countries involvesextraordinary expenses in the common cause which would fall to an unreasonable degree upon one of the two governments, thenthis principle (of sharing expenses) shall be applicable so far as agreed between the two Governments&apos;.&quot; (See W.P. (G.) (39)135, page 1.)
that our contribution to these items should be 60 per cent, and theFrench contribution 40 per cent.; he had put this forward as apractical solution, and had not thought it necessary to go intoelaborate calculations of wealth per head in the two countries.The utmost concession that M. Reynaud had so far made wasto suggest that our contribution should be 65 per cent, and theFrench 35 per cent. The Chancellor said that he had seen no reasonto depart from his own proposal. It had accordingly been agreedthat he should report the position to the War Cabinet. before taking this decision he had telephoned from Paris to the PrimeMinister.The Chancellor added that the psychological objections to a proportion of 2 : 1 seemed to him to be insuperable. The adoptionof that proportion would present the German propagandists witha new argument in support of their favourite contention that france was being left to do the fighting while we supplied themoney.The Prime Minister thought that the Chancellor of theExchequer was entitled to the support of the War Cabinet in the stand which he had taken for a contribution of 40 per cent, by france. The 2 : 1 proportion was quite unacceptable, and would be quoted in support of the German theory that we were the paymastersand that the French had to carry out our instructions.The Secretary of State for War said that, in his view, theessential point in the draft Agreement was that summarised in thedraft press communique in the sentence : &apos;&apos; The question of sharingequitably the expenses which the two Governments have to defrayin gold and dollars will be kept under review.&quot; He hoped thatarrangements of this kind, once established, would be perpetuatedin time of peace. They would be an instalment of the international economic co-operation which most men of goodwill desired to see.So long as the war lasted, we and the French ought to have a commonpurse. The large French gold reserve ought to be at the service ofboth Allies.It was pointed out in reply that there were many difficulties inthe way of a completely common purse, as between this country andFrance; for example (1) The position in which we stood vis-a-vis the self-governingDominions. To mention two financial projects nowunder examination, the French would be willing enoughto share in the proceeds of the Canadian dollar loan, but most unwilling to join us in paying for the dollar expenditure to be incurred by Australia and NewZealand under the Dominion Air Training Scheme.(2) Our financial position differed in many other respects fromthat of France. The French had; more gold than ourselves, but fewer foreign securities. Our arrange-ments for the realisation of these foreign securities werein better order and more advanced than theirs. It wasvery difficult to see how two countries so differentlysituated could agree to throw their gold, foreign exchange and foreign securities into a common pool.(3) M. Reynaud had done much to restore French finances.The fact remained, however, that our taxation and our national Debt were incomparably greater than theFrench taxation and National Debt.(4) The suggestion of a common purse, if carried out to its -logical conclusion, would mean British interference inthe details of the French budget and French interference in the details of the British budget.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that Articles and 10 of the Agreement would mark a great step forward, in that neither country would be able to dissipate its financial resourceswithout consulting the other. In view of the differences betweenthe two financial systems, it did not seem practicable to carryco-operation much further than that. -The following additional points were made in the course ofdiscussion : (1) If the Agreement went through, it would provide a considered plan to take the place of the formerhaphazard financial co-operation between this countryand France, for example, over the gold loan to turkey and with regard to the purchase of Roumanian oil.(2) If the Agreement were signed in its present form, it wouldbe essential to impress upon Departments the importanceof taking advantage of Article 19 to the greatest possible extent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that M. Reynaud would very shortly be presenting his Budget. In these circumstances hewould be anxious to announce an Agreement with us. On the whole,therefore, it seemed probable that the French Government wouldgive way if we adhered to our view regarding the one item in dispute.The War Cabinet agreed : (i) that the French proposal, according to which this countryand France would share items of &quot; extraordinaryexpenditure in the common cause &apos;&apos; in the proportion2 : 1 was unacceptable, and that we should adhere tothe proportion 3:2;(ii) to invite the Prime Minister to inform M. Daladier of theWar Cabinets views on this matter, and in particular of the apparent disadvantages of the French Govern-ments suggestion, from the point of view of the grounds which it would afford for misrepresentation.Italy.Anglo-ItalianEconomicBel ations.(previous reference erences:W.M. (39) 55thConclusions,Minute 11,and 81stConclusions,Minute 8.)(previous reference:WM. (39) 89thConclusions,Minute 3.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum prepared by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consulta-tion with the Minister for Economic Warfare, on Anglo-ItalianEconomic Relations (W.P. (G.) (39) 131).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that itwas very desirable that we should inform the Italian government at an early date to what extent we proposed to incur expenditure during 1940 in respect of payments for the purchase of Italiangoods or for the use of Italian Shipping. The figures supplied by the Departments concerned indicated that we could safely givethe figures of  20,000,000 for the former and  5,000,000 for thelatter, making  25,000,000 in all. The need for an early decisionarose in part from the fact that the notification of such a figure would help greatly in maintaining friendly relations with Italy.If possible this figure should be communicated before the meetingof the Fascist Grand Council on the 9th December. Further, our policy of seizing German exports would cut off the importantsupplies of German sea-borne coal to Italy, and it was no useencouraging Italy to look to us for supplies of coal unless we could make purchases in Italy which would enable tihe Italians to pay forthem.The Chancellor of the Exchequer welcomed the proposal, buturged that any figure given should represent the total of purchases
which we considered we should be able to make. He asked, therefore,that the figure should be further examined before the telegram was sent to Sir Percy Loraine.The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to the greatimportance from the point of view of naval strategy of continuingour present satisfactory relations with Italy. If there were to beany difficulty in finding satisfactory ways of spending the money,which on general political grounds it was desirable to spend in italy, the Admiralty would willingly see if any increase could bemade in purchases on their account.The Secretary of State for War said that his latest information was that we were likely to buy 1,000 anti-tank guns from Italybut that tJhe cost of these would amount to only  1,250,000. TheSecretary of State for Air said that so far his information wasthat the goods offered by the Italians to his Department were not of very satisfactory quality.It was pointed out that, in addition to actual armaments, wecontemplated making considerable purchases of Italian rawmaterials, e.g., hemp and sulphur.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that it was essential that our offer to make purchases in Italy should be linked with a satisfactory Clearing Agreement to ensure that the proceeds of our purchases were used by the Italians in financing purchases in this country and in paying off debts already incurred. Since thewar started the Italians had accumulated a debt of  1,000,000 onthe clearing, and we could not undertake to supply coal in place oftheir imports from Germany, unless satisfactory arrangements weremade for payment. He also suggested that the Minister of shipping should explore the possibility of purchasing Italian ships. Hethought that there was some risk that once a general offer hadbeen made, the Italians might seek to sell us goods which we didnot want, e.g., fruit and vegetables which they had hitherto sold to Germany. In this connection the Secretary of State for Warundertook to explore the suggestion that supplies of this kind mightbe used for our troops in Egypt and Palestine.The War Cabinet :-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and&quot;the Minister for Economic Warfare, to examine further the information provided by the Service and supply departments, in order to satisfy himself that we shouldbe justified in informing the Italian Government thatwe proposed to spend not less than  25 million in Italyup to the 31st December, 1940, in the purchase of rawmaterials and manufactured goods and in freightpayments.(ii) Subject to this examination proving satisfactory (a) authorised  the  Secretary  of  State  for  ForeignAffairs to inform His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in rome that he could at once assure the ItalianGovernment that we proposed to incur expendi-ture as indicated under (i) above;(b) authorised  the  Secretary  of  State  for  ForeignAffairs, in consultation with the Treasury andother Departments concerned, to negotiate a clearing Agreement with the Italian Governmenton the basis of the expenditure contemplate under (i) above and on the understanding set outin recommendation 3 of their Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (39) 131), namely, that-&quot; the necessary guarantees are forthcomingregarding the use made of raw materials[20455] . c
imported from the British Empire, and thatwe continue to receive the co-operation whichwe have encountered in our relations sincethe conclusion of the agreement to set up theJoint Standing Committee.&quot;(c) authorised the Ministry of Economic &quot;Warfare totake steps to stop Italian imports of Germanseaborne coal, as soon as we could supply thenecessary additional coal and as soon as satisfac-tory arrangements could be made by means of a clearing Agreement for payment to be made forthis additional supply.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 6, 1939.
