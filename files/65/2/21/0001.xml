The Air Situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 35th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet that, with weather conditions generally unfavourable, there had been little activity on either side the previous day.

Two aircraft of the Air Component in France had carried out a reconnaissance of the Siegfried Line towards the Dutch border. One aircraft had returned with nothing special to report, while the second had been forced to land in Belgium as a result of its controls having become frozen.

Unknown aircraft had been heard flying over the Upper Savoy and had dropped leaflets.

A successful reconnaissance of Heligoland and Wilhelmshaven had established the location of certain important units of the German Fleet. Some anti-aircraft fire had been encountered, but all our aircraft had returned safely (see also Minute 3).

Enemy reconnaissance aircraft had appeared over the Shetlands and Lossiemouth the previous morning. Anti-aircraft fire had been opened in the Shetlands without apparent result.

Three aircraft had been reported over the Midlands the previous day. It had been proved that two of these were our own, one of which had been in bad weather conditions over Liverpool, where it was engaged and slightly damaged by anti-aircraft fire. The third, probably a German Dornier 17, was engaged by anti-aircraft fire, with no known result.

The weather conditions under which this aircraft was carrying out a reconnaissance were such as to render the results of doubtful value.

Seventeen searches and patrols had been carried out by the Coastal Command.

There had been increased German air activity over the North Sea on the previous day.

Wireless signals had been received that morning again reporting German activity over the North Sea, which it was thought might presage an attack on our convoys, which were at that moment approaching the Humber.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.



Air raid warning system. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 59th Conclusions, Minute 6.)

The Minister of Home Security referred to technical difficulties which had been experienced in the passing of air raid warning messages during the passage of an enemy aircraft over the Midlands on the previous day. The red signal had followed the yellow signal so closely that the telephone lines had been engaged and the red signal had been delayed.  Again, anti-aircraft guns had fired after the "All clear" signal had been issued. A remedy was being sought.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Air operations: policy as to attacks on the German Fleet.

3. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War cabinet that the R.A.F. flight over Heligoland and Wilhelmshaven on the previous day (see Minute 1) had been carried out by three Blenheim aircraft. Their task had been to look for enemy naval forces. A number of vessels had been seen between 12 noon and 2 P.M., including one Battle Cruiser steaming North, two Battle Cruisers at anchor, and a number of Destroyers and Submarines.

The First Lord of the Admiralty asked what instructions there were at the Air Ministry for ordering an attack on the German Fleet in the event of its concentration being reported by our reconnaissance aircraft, as had happened in this case.


The Chief of the Air Staff understood the position to be that it was left to the discretion of the Air Ministry to order such an attack if the target was favourably placed and not within a heavily defended area. In this particular case he had not, himself, been informed of the detailed results of the reconnaissance until that morning. He undertook, however, to investigate the action which had been taken by the Air Staff on their receipt at the Air Ministry.

After further discussion the War Cabinet agreed :--

(1) To invite the Chief of the Air Staff to report to the War Cabinet on the method of ensuring the immediate transmission of valuable information obtained by reconnaissance, and for taking any immediate action which might be called for.

(2) To confirm that it should be left to the discretion of the Air Ministry to order attacks on the German Fleet if a suitable target offered itself in favourable conditions, e.g., an attack which was not likely to results in losses to our own air forces disproportionate to those inflicted on the enemy.



The Naval Situation. 

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 85th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

4. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet that two German merchant vessels had been captured--the Oldendorf of 5,000 tons, loaded with ore, and the Trifels of 6,000 tons, which had been captured by the French.

There had been a number of attacks on German submarines, but with no definite result.

Reports from a number of sources told of a considerable concentration of shipping in Hamburg. Ships were being fitted out, some with ladders, probably to facilitate the egress of troops, other with casks to make them virtually unsinkable.

On the 15th November, the Africa Shell had been sunk 160 miles North East of Lourenco Marques, by an enemy ship reported to be of the Deutschland class. Appropriate steps had been taken by the Naval Staff.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



The Military Situation. 

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 85th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there were no operations to report.

Information tended to show that the troops for an invasion of the Low Countries were still concentrated ready on the Germany frontier. There was a limit to the length of time for which troops could be kept closed up for attack, without relief. If the Germans, therefore, did not stage their attack very shortly, they would probably have to release the tension, and carry out reliefs.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Belgium.

Staff conversations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 81st Conclusions, Minute 5.)

6. The War Cabinet were given certain information about recent developments in the attitude of the Belgian Government.

An account of the discussion is given in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet--

(i) Took note of the discussion ;

(ii) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to arrange for the immediate supply to Belgium of four 3.7-inch A.A. guns.
