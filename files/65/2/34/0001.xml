A Norwegian tanker (8,000 tons), which hadbeen ordered in by the Contraband Control Service, had been struckby a mine off the Humber and was on fire.Referring to the Prime Minister&apos;s enquiry at the previous meeting as to the arrangements for defending shipping in theDowns, the First Lord of the Admiralty said That 4 fighter squadrons were in readiness to intervene if the shipping were attacked.In reply to a question, the Chief of Naval Staff said that ithad not yet been possible to send a diver down to examine theposition in the Clyde where a German submarine was reported tohave sunk.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Situation.(previous reference:WM.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty reported that the experi-ments in connection with magnetic mines had met with success.Two magnetic mines had been detonated by different methods, one in the Firth of Forth and one in the Thames Estuary. Very hopefulresults had also been achieved by aircraft.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the french ambassador had asked whether the Admiralty would issue a full statement about these mines, explaining the^action taken by theGermans, the extent of the damage caused, and what we knew about these mines. The Foreign Secretary said that doubts, possiblyinspired by Germany, had been expressed by certain neutrals,including the Japanese Ambassador, as to whether there wasconclusive proof that the mines were German.In discussion it was agreed that a Memorandum should beissued on this subject, although it would be necessary to considerVery carefully how; much should be said as to our knowledge of how the mines Worked. There was plenty of evidence which we couldprodiiee that the mines had been,sown by Germany.The War CabinetAsked ;.1^;Fir^^-I^rdjof-1^\Admralty to arrange for thepreparation of a Memorandum on the subject of theGerman magnetic mine campaign.

(39)98th Conclusions).The Secretary of State read the draft reply, which was approved subject to the omission of its concluding words, namely;at the earliest possible moment.&quot; It was felt that these worcfejhad they been retained, might have been used later on, in supportof the contention that the despatch of one Division overseas consti-tuted an adequate land effort on the part of Canada.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Prime Minister to send the telegram as approved to Mr. Mackenzie King.

Tanner had formed a new Government.The United States, had appealed to both sides not to bomb opentowns. In a conversation which he (the Foreign Secretary) had had with the Finnish Minister on the previous evening, he had gathered that there was a considerable state of confusion in Finland.The Prime Minister thought that the resignation of theFinnish Government was significant and very likely presaged a surrender to the Russian demands.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 485, dated the 30th November, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, reporting that the United states embassy had waited all night for instructions from Washingtonwith regard to the Note, the text of which had been given to the.Press in Washington the previous evening.

Lord Lothiansuggested that the best counter-propaganda would be for as full information as possible to be given to the United States correspon-dents in London. If there was no objection to publicity, he suggestedthat figures showing the arrival of British shipping in British ports,with particulars of the cargo carried, &amp;c, should be given to theUnited States correspondents. Further, if the demands of militarysecrecy would permit, the aircraft production stories should be denied.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to consult with the Ministers concerned as to the suggestion made by Lord Lothian.Italy. 12.

APPENDIX.Dominion Air Training Scheme.(Minute 5.)Telegram to the Government of Canada.(Most Immediate.)YOUR telegram No. 120 of 28th November.The following from Prime Minister for Prime Minister : Begins: 1. I am very grateful to you for the full statement of your views,which greatly clarifies the position.2. I am satisfied that no question of principle divides us. Our commonapproach to the problem, expressed most clearly in your personal and secrettelegram Of 3rd November, proceeds on the basis that there is no thought on thepart of our Governments or our peoples of stinting or sparing our efforts orresources, and that we are determined to throw ourselves into the war to our utmost capacity.3. There are obviously limits to the efforts of which Canada is capable,as, indeed, there are to the resources of all parts of the British Commonwealth,and our common concern is to put these resources to the best use in the prosecution of the war till victory is achieved.4. I now understand that you consider it essential to publish the opinion ofthe United Kingdom Government that the Air Training Scheme should have priority in Canada&apos;s war effort. This is, in fact, our view^ and we have noobjection to its being made public provided that it is made clear at the same time that we also attach very great importance, both from a military and a psycho-logical point of view, to the presence of Canadian land forces in the theatre ofwar at the earliest possible moment.5. We would therefore suggest that announcement should be in following terms: &quot; The United Kingdom Government have informed us that, consideringpresent and future requirements, they feel that participation in the air training Scheme would provide more effective assistance towards ourultimate victory than any other form of co-operation which Canada can give.At the same time, they would wish it to be clearly understood that theywould welcome no less heartily the presence of Canadian land forces in the theatre of war.&quot;
