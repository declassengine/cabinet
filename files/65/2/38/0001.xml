The air situation.(previous kef erence:W.M. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there was was no special activity to report. One enemy aircraft had been detectedin the Thames Estuary and one in the Firth of Forth on the previous evening, which were suspected of being engaged in mine-laying.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet situation. information regarding the dispositions of the Fleet, and also furtherH.M.S. Nelson, information in regard to the damage sustained by H.M.S. Nelson(Previous by a magnetic mine.   Fifty-two men had been injured, 9 of themReference:        seriously.  A number of compartments were flooded, and there were.M. (39) 103rd a number of leaks in other compartments.   A salvage vessel had conclusions,      been sent from Liverpool to assist in pumping operations, which minute 2.)        were beyond the capacity of Nelson&apos;s pumps.   The Commander-in-Chief did not feel any great anxiety for the safety of the ship.Unlike the case of H.M.S. Belfast, where the effect of the mineexplosion had caused fractures to machinery throughout the ship,the effects of the explosion in H.M.S. Nelson appeared to be local.As soon as the leakage was under control, it was hoped that she would be able to proceed to dock under her own steam.   A strongDestroyer escort would be provided.A British collier bad been sunk by a mine.The steamship Kskdene (4,000 tons), which, as previously reported, had been mined, was still afloat, and it was hoped to gether safely to port.The Manchester Regiment (6,000 tons), outward bound from canada in a convoy, had been sunk as a result of a collision with another ship in the convoy.A German submarine had been attacked in Liverpool Baywithout known result.With reference to the attack made on a U-boat offSt. Catherine^ (reported at the previous meeting), it had been thought that this U-boat was endeavouring to pass eastwardthrough the Straits of Dover. On the previous morning a mine inthe Dover barrage had exploded at the time at which it was estimated that this submarine would have reached the barrage.There was, therefore, good grounds for hoping that she had been destroyed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Magnetic Mines. 3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that consideration(Previous had been given to the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion that the investi-Reference:        gations into the possibilities of rendering ships immune from.M. (39) 103rd magnetic mines should not be confined to scientists employed by theConclusions,      Government.   The Admiralty had reached the conclusion that, atMinute 2.)        any rate for the time being, it would be better not to consult&quot; outside &quot; scientists, on the grounds that the theoretic aspects ofthe problem were known, but that a solution depended on theirpractical application.   A special Sub-Committee of experts hadbeen set up to deal with this particular aspect, as it had been thoughtundesirable in any way to interrupt the work of the experts engaged on the experiments on the sweeping for, or destruction of, magnetic mines.   If, after, say, a fortnight, no satisfactory results had been achieved, it might be necessary to broaden the scope of the investigation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that itmight be desirable to keep &quot; outside &quot; scientists in touch with the[20449] b 2
Naval 4.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War CabinetCommands.       of certain changes in higher Naval appointments, and the reasonsChano-es in       why they had been made.   Admiral Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax had certain Naval     succeeded Admiral Brownrigg as Commander-in-Chief of the Nore;appointments.    Vice-Admiral Royle bad succeeded Vice-Admiral Ramsay as FifthSea Lord and Chief of the Naval Air Services; Rear-AdmiralWatson, Rear-Admiral (Submarines), had been succeeded by Vice-Admiral Horton; Admiral French, the Admiral Commanding the orkneys and Shetlands, who was on the retired list, was beingrelieved by two Flag Officers on the active list.Under the changed conditions of war the Board of admiralty had considered that the above changes, which had been made witha view to intensifying the Navy&apos;s driving power in the prosecution of the war, were necessary. In the case of the Command of theSubmarine Service, for example, Rear-Admiral Watson was not a submarine specialist; and, while in peace-time it was the acceptedpolicy to fill senior technical appointments from time to time withofficers who had not specialised in that particular branch, it was most desirable that in war-time the senior officer of a Service suchas that of submarines should be a specialist. The officers who hadbeen relieved had all accepted the situation in the best possible spirit.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Secretary of State for War said that the situation onthe Western Front remained unchanged.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Finland. 6.

They had not so far swept up any ofthe mines, and they were obtaining all their information from us.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that one of thereasons why the Germans scuttled their ships might be to prevent us from learning the secrets of the antidote to the magnetic minewith which their merchant ships were possibly fitted.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he would follow up this possibility in the case of the prizes which had been brought in.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
Finland. 7.   The Secretary of State for Air said that, in view of theProposed supply manifest desire of the War Cabinet at their last meeting to goof Fighter some way to meet Finland&apos;s request for fighter aircraft, the questionAircraft. had been very carefully examined in the Air Ministry.   The Air(Previous Staff felt that, from the purely military point of view, there was reference:        no case for supplying Finland with fighters, since we had insufficientW.M. (39) 103rd for our own needs.   Nevertheless they appreciated that, from theConclusions,      wider point of view, it would be very desirable to give Finland someMinute 7.)        assistance, and they therefore proposed that 20 Gladiators shouldbe supplied.   The War Cabinet must realise, however, that inmaking this offer we were running a certain risk ourselves.   these aircraft would have to be crated and sent by sea.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that it would benecessary to consider very carefully the route by which these aircraft were shipped, otherwise they might fall into the hands of our enemies.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that whenhe had mentioned this question to Dominion High Commissionersthe previous day, the South African High Commissioner hadimmediately offered to make over to Finland some of the obsolescentfighters which were being purchased by the Union from the AirMinistry. He understood that the Air Staff view was that these aircraft would not be of a sufficiently modern type to compete withthe Russian bombers, but no doubt the War Cabinet would wishto express their appreciation of this offer of assistance by SouthAfrica.In discussion it was explained that, in order to avoid legal difficulties over the supply of munitions to a belligerent Power bythe Government, the supply of these 20 Gladiators to Finland wouldhave to be carried out as a commercial transaction between the manufacturers and the Finnish Government. The aircraft which now belonged to the Air Ministry would therefore have to be made over to the manufacturers. The necessary detailed arrangements would be made with the Finnish Minister by the Air Ministry.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the proposal of the Air Ministry to supply20 Gladiator aircraft to Finland.(ii) Invited the Air Ministry to make the detailed arrange-ments with the Finnish Minister in London for thesupply and shipment of the aircraft, and to consult theAdmiralty regarding the route to be taken by the ships carrying them.(iii) Took note that this transaction would take the form of asale by the manufacturers to the Finnish Government.(iv) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the High Commissioner for the Union of SouthAfrica that the offer of aircraft made by the Union wasdeeply appreciated, and that, if the aircraft in question had been of a suitable type, this offer would no doubt have been gratefully accepted.captured 1,500 Russian prisoners in the same area. There was nofurther news of the reported Russian movement againstSuomussalmi. Press reports emphasised the inefficient adminis-trative arrangements of the Russian troops, who were alleged insome cases to have had no rations for three days.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
Eire.intelligence organisation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 92ndConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Minister without Portfolio gave the War Cabinet an account of the stage reached in the enquiry he had been asked to conduct into the arrangements for Intelligence in Eire, and endedby saying that he would shortly submit a final Report. A record ofthe Minister&apos;s statement is given in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.The First Lord of the Admiralty expressed his gratitude forthe very thorough investigation which had been carried out by theMinister.The War Cabinet took note of the Interim Report madeby the Minister without Portfolio.Italy.(previous reference:WM. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 10.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegrams Nos. 369 and 370, dated the 1st December, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome. The former reported the account which Sir Percy Loraine had given, in reply to a question by count ciano, of the state of opinion in the United Kingdom as regardsthe war. The latter recorded a conversation which Sir percy loraine had had with the Polish Ambassador in Rome. the ambassador, who a month ago had been suspicious of the ulteriormotives of the Italian Government, had now reached a morefavourable conclusion.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Turkey.Probable atti-tude in theevent cf an invasion of roumania byTJ.S.S.R.(previous reference:WM. (39) 85thConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 790 from Angora, dated the 2nd December, recordinga conversation between Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and theTurkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. The latter thought anattempt by the Soviet Government to seize Bessarabia quite possible,and did not anticipate resistance by Roumania. If Roumania didnot resist, he expected the matter would not go further, in which case,according to the Minister, not much harm would have been done.The matter would be worse if Roumania resisted. He intendedto keep Moscow in doubt as to the Turkish attitude in the eventof a Russian threat to Roumania. Even over Bessarabia he didnot think that Russia could move without previously taking stepsto ascertain the Turkish attitude. In the event of Turkey being-approached in this way, he would at once consult His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.On the other hand, the Roumanian Minister in London, whom he (the Foreign Secretary) had seen the previous day, was of theopinion that the Turks would consider themselves threatened if russia attacked Bessarabia.The Foreign Office inclined to the view that Turkey would notconsider her interests vitally affected by an invasion of Bessarabia,but would do so if a Russia invasion threatened the mouths of the danube or Roumania&apos;s Black Sea ports.The Foreign Secretary said that, if possible, he would attemptto get an indication of the Turkish Governments view from theSecretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Office, who was at presentin London.
The Far eastern situation.The Tientsinquestion.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 13.)His Majesty&apos;ambassador inChina.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad despatched a telegram the previous night to Sir Robert Craigie,authorising him to reach a settlement of the Tientsin question onthe lines which Che War Cabinet had approved at the meeting mentioned in the margin. His telegram had included the following passage : &quot; The Japanese Government must also agree to the of anti-British activities in North China, which againmight be dealt with in a separate but not confidential exchangeof letters, since Ave must be in a position to announce here toour own public opinion that simultaneously with the solutionof the silver question, we have obtained substantial and necessary concessions from the Japanese.&quot; (Telegram No. 827to Tokyo, dated the 4th December.)This telegram had crossed two telegrams from Sir robert craigie (Tokyo telegrams Nos. 1588 and 1589 dated the4th December), which showed that the discussions with the JapaneseVice-Minister for Foreign Affairs were making progress on the lines which the War Cabinet desired. Altogether the situation was more hopeful than had seemed possible a short time ago.The Foreign Secretary said that he would circulate a record of a discussion which he had had with the Japanese Ambassadorthe previous night. The indignation which the Japanese felt against russia on account of her invasion of Finland might dispose themto reach a settlement with us.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought it would be ofadvantage if Sir Archibald Clark Kerr were in future to spenda considerable portion of his time in Chungking, the present seat of the Chinese Government, and he had so informed him. In doing so, our Ambassador would be following the example set by theAmerican Ambassador.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 5, 1939.
