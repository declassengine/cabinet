The German Air Forces. Evidence as to morale. (Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 4.)

5. The Chief of the Air Staff said that he had made some enquiries, but was not yet able to confirm that more than five German aircraft had been interned as Soesterberg.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 208 from the Hague. It was certain that a number of German aircraft were interned, but the Dutch were being very secretive about the whole matter. They were also being very secretive as to violations of Dutch air neutrality by German aircraft. For example, on the 10th November, six aircraft, believed to be German, had flown over Amsterdam and had been shot at by anti-aircraft guns, but no reports had appeared in the Press.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Poland. Formation and equipment of Polish forces.

6. The Secretary of State for War reported that he had received a letter from the Polish Prime Minister containing proposals for the formation of an armoured division, and up to 7 infantry divisions, of which the majority would be formed in France but one or two in Canada. He had asked that we should provided certain items of equipment and also hutted accommodation and training staff for personnel which might come to this country to train before proceeding to Canada.

The War Cabinet was informed that the Polish Prime Minister had also interviewed the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, and that the question of the utilisation of Polish personnel had been discussed at these meetings. In the discussion which ensued on the policy to be adopted in this connection, the following were the principal points which emerged:-

(i) The Poles were very anxious that their forces should retain their identity and not be incorporated in French or British units. They wished to conclude a formal agreement with us on this matter.

(ii) They would like to be represented on the Supreme War Council, although they apparently would not press this point. They were very anxious, however, to have a representative with the Anglo-French Permanent Military Representatives in London.

(iii) There would be great political value in reconstituting a Polish Army which would fight alongside the British and French forces and thereby keep in being the entity of the Polish nation as one of the original Allies.

(iv) The formation of Polish Divisions in Canada which had been proposed by the Polish Prime Minister, would be of importance from the point of view of opinion in the United States. But the Canadian Government was understood to feel some doubts about this proposal.

(v) The Polish Naval units which had escaped and joined the British Navy were of a high quality, and it was probable that Polish troops would fight equally well. Officers and N.C.O.s were lacking, but there were some 80,000 Poles now in France.

(vi) The policy of the French was to provide the Poles with manufacturing facilities in France with which they could make the necessary equipment for their forces, using polish labour. They proposed to equip the Polish formations on a somewhat lower scale of armament than in the corresponding French formations.

(vii) It would no be possible for us to provide the equipment for an armoured formation and the supply of any equipment at all would present some difficulty, but there was no reason why the formations should not be constiuted   
It- would: be -desirable- to -co-&apos;-. matter-. with, the. French/ baiwith the Polish proposals was- of the importance, of thecmr policy in thisy long delay in dealingo be deprecated, in viewfactor.-War Cabinet agreed ii) that the Military Co-ordination Committee should examinethe various proposals and requests submitted to service departments by the Poles, and should consider thegeneral policy to be followed in respect of them;(2) that j following the examination referred to in (1) above,discussions should be initiated with the French with aview to concerting an agreed Anglo-French policy in thismatter;(3) that the attention of the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should be drawn to the proposal for the constitu-tion of Polish formations in Canada. *Size of theBritishEspadlioaasy(previous reference:w\M.:(89) 72ndConclusions,Minute 4.)(previous reference,;.-&apos;;WM. (89) 54thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Secretary of State for War said that, in a recentconversation, M. Reynaud had pointed out that, whereas 1 in every-8 of the French population was at present mobilised the corres-ponding proportion in this country was only I in every 40. Frenchindustry was languishing owing to the absorption of man-power inthe armed forces of the country. He (Md Reynaud) had spoken ina most friendly way, but had suggested that hostile propagandawould doubtless make considerable capital out of our despatchingonly TO divisions to France by next spring. The French would liketo demobilise and return to industry all men over 85, and it had beensuggested that, if we called up our younger men, they would be readyto provide the equipment which we at present lacked.It was generally agreed that this comparison between the proportions of the French and British populations under arms was likely to be exploited to the full by hostile propaganda. If heavy casualties occurred in the land forces^ it might cause seriousdissensions between ourselves and the French.XTheFirst Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to the recent-forecasts from the Ministry of Supply, which showed that we shouldhave sufficient equipment for only 15 divisions by the end of thefirst year of war/ This reduction from the original forecast of20 divisions was most disquieting. He could not believe that wecouldjiiot. do: better ;than^ this, &quot;The Secretary of State for - War said that he hoped to have&quot; very

The Secretary of State for War drew the attention of theForces. War Cabinet to the fact that the pay of the Dominion forces, whichRates of pay. would shortly be leaving for service overseas alongside troops fromthe United Kingdom, was on a very much higher scale than thatof the British soldier. There had been considerable trouble in theGreat War over this disparity between the rates of pay, and hesuggested that Dominion Governments might be approached on thismatter.In discussion it was pointed out that this disparity had alwaysexisted in the past. In any case the rate of pay of the Frenchsoldier was far smaller than that of the British soldier. The view was generally expressed that this disparity was inevitable.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.Ftataii.Negotiationswith Russia.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 69thConclusions,Minute 8.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 182, dated the 13th November, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;8 Minister, Helsingfors, reporting that the Minister forForeign Affairs had that afternoon informed him that the Finnishdelegates were returning from Moscow that evening. He had saidthat the Finnish policy was one of willingness to make concessions to the U.S.S.R. provided that these did not prejudice either the neutrality or the independence of Finland. The Finnish Govern-ment was, however, determined to consent to no concession beyond that point. The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not anticipateanything worse than a week of angry utterances in Moscow.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Quality of armed forces.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that^inthe courseof his interview the previous day, General Sikorski thePoliXprime Mister, had expressed the lowest appimpn of theSoviet Army He S said that they had two good divisions, butSSf f^tihesetheir forces weteof the poorest quality, beingdeficient in morale, equipment and officers.The War Cabinet took note of ^the above statement.wmmisto.^.Proposal for a trade Agree-ment.(previous reference:    v&quot;r.;i.

The War Cabinet had under consideration a Note by theFirst Lord of - the; Admiralty covering-the; Report of aCdmhjitlee of officials on the Issue of - - Warnings;- against the Discussion of confidential Matters in Public Places (Paper W.P. (G.) (89) 87)&quot;.Mr. Douglas, the Chairman of the Committee, said that,generally, the Committee had found that the Departments and defence Services had dealt comprehensively and adequately with thequestion of preventing the leakage of secret information and thediscussion of confidential matters in public places. But the review which they had conducted had been useful in enabling them to closeup some gaps, and in giving the Services and Departments anopportunity of exchanging suggestions. Some further action hadbeen set in train, but not much more was now required.As regards the general public/the Committee considered thatthe Ministry of Information was the appropriate Department todeal with this matter, working in close collaboration with theSecurity Service.The Minister of Information said that his Department wouldbe happy to accept the recommendations of Mr. Douglas&apos;sCommittee. He informed the War Cabinet that the Ministry ofInformation&apos; had the following arrangements in hand: . (i) A propaganda film was in preparation, and it was hopedthat the draft scenario would be ready the following week.A notice in the form of a rhyming admonition about theneed for reticence was being thrown on the screen in allcinemas in the country that week,(iii) Arrangements were being made for the further display of appropriate posters of a more decorative character.The B.B.C. had been in consultation with M.I. 5 (security service) about a script which had been prepared by thelatter. The B.B.C. were anxious that this should bespoken over the wireless by some eminent person in oneof the Defence Services. It was hoped that the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff might be prevailed uponto give the broadcast.The War Cabinet-Approved the Report of the Committee on the Issue ofWarnings against Discussion of Confidential Matters in public Places (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 87), and, in particular,endorsed the recommendations for future action containedIn paragraph  0, of which the following is a summary : (i) That the Defence Services, being the best judges ofliiieli kjcj - i v -L , 11 d In 3 . s, beleft lc jzz   ) f      &quot; &apos;        &apos;i    zszzz In vtha-&apos;. h&apos;:..&quot;&apos; .-, h - h- &apos; Ghhhxsh-d&apos; &apos;-&apos;..--&quot;        v .(ii) That future action by the Civil.can   &quot; ;       d*r ny 3iifcai(ii)(iv)kzlzi i/ib  5th&apos; \., zi u J v&apos;]zJ

The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the War Cabinet a brief account of the discussions which he had had with M. Reynaudduring the previous two days. The main object of his discussions had been to ensure closer touch between the British and FrenchTreasuries. There were a number of financial matters on which he hoped to persuade the French to take an equal share with us. Hethought that it was more likely that we should reach a settlement by an approach on broad grounds, rather than by a number of individual approaches on particular subjects.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that M. Reynaud hadbeen aggrieved at the extent to which we had found it necessary to restrict imports of French goods. The goods concerned were mostlyarticles of luxury, and we therefore had little choice in the matter.He was hopeful, however, that he might be able to reach anagreement with the French whereby, if we agreed to some relaxation in regard to the importation of French goods into this country, theFrench would be willing to provide franc exchange for the payments made to our troops in France.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,November 15, 1939.
