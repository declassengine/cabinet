The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 114thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that 24 bombers had carried out a sweep of the Horns Reef on the previous day to locateand attack enemy warships. Visibility had been bad and no enemy vessels had been sighted.   All aircraft had returned to their base.A second force of 12 bombers had located a German naval force,consisting of 1 battleship, 1 cruiser, 3 destroyers and 1 submarine,8 miles North of the entrance to the Jade River. An engagementlasting-for 40 minutes had taken place, during which our aircraft,had encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire and had been attacked byabout 20 Messerschmitt Fighters. It seemed reasonably certainthat 4 enemy fighters had been shot down. Owing to low cloudsour aircraft had had to fly low and it had therefore been impossibleto bomb the enemy warships. Five of our aircraft were missing,one having been shot down and 2 having collided in the air. Asixth bomber had crashed on its return to base. The total casualties were 33 killed and missing and 3 wounded and injured.In reply to a question, the Deputy Chief of the Air staff said that the bombers engaged in the action on the previous day had carried armour-piercing bombs. This type of bomb was not likelyto be effective unless it was dropped from a height of at least,000 feet; moreover, experience had shown that our own aircraft might be destroyed by the explosion, if bombs were dropped froma low altitude.The Secretary of State for Air said that a further sweep by5 bombers had searched the area between Terschelling and Sylt,but without result. A reconnaissance of the seaplane bases in daylight had disclosed that the Germans were not using balloons.The standing patrol over enemy seaplane bases at Borkum and Sylthad been maintained during part of the night. Five bombs hadbeen dropped on seaplanes believed to be in the vicinity of Ran turn.The First Lord of the Admiralty expressed his admiration ofthe resolute operations which had been carried out by the RoyalAir Force, more particularly the bomber patrols over the enemy&apos;sseaplane bases, which were effectively hampering mine-laying operations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether the germans were likely to employ counter-measures, if we continued to send our patrols over the enemy&apos;s seaplane bases.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff doubted whether theGermans would find it any more easy to intercept aircraft at nightthan we did. It would be interesting to see if the Germans were able to develop any effective method of making contact.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Naval 2.

It had now been learnt that, in addition to those previously reported, the following ships had been sunk by the Admiral GrafSpee : S.S. Tairoa (7,983 tons) on the 3rd December. ...S.S. Streonshalh (3,895 tons) on the 26th November.The Commodore of the convoy containing the A thel Templarand the Inverlane had reported that the ships had been torpedoed.Two destroyers had been sent out to carry out a submarine hunt,and H.M.S. Kelly had struck a mine. There had been no casualties and H.M.S. Kelly was returning to harbour with tugs in company.Shipping The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that shipping losses wereSituation. assuming serious proportions and it was imperative that every(Previous possible step should be taken to maintain the flow of trade, notEeference: only by building new ships and chartering neutral tonnage, butW.M.

Another magnetic mine had been successfully exploded near(Previous the place where H.M.S. Nelson had been damaged. .

(39) 114thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that it seemed certainthat the Graf Spee had suffered considerable damage and had been hit between 50 and 60 times. She still had fighting power, but mustbe very short of ammunition. H.M.S. Cumberland had joined the cruisers on guard off Montevideo and H.M.S. Exeter was probablyproceeding to the Falkland Islands. ...The First Lord proposed to make a recommendation forthwith to His Majesty for some recognition of the gallant action fought byCommodore Harwood and the Captains of the three ships under his command.The Secretary of Stale for Dominion Affairs hoped that asuitable tribute would be paid to the New Zealand personnel serving in H.M.S.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the abuse of counter Norwegian territorial waters had now come to a head with theMeasures sinking of one Greek and two British ships inside the 3-mile limit,against the He considered that this action on the part of the enemy made itabuse of necessary that we should, in our own interest, claim.and make useNorwegian of a similar latitude, without delay.territorial waters by theGermans.(previous reference:W.M.

The ships would not be sunk, but would be taken asprizes.   He was ready to accept the fact that such action would undoubtedly provoke a violent protest from the Norwegians, butconsidered that such protests could be satisfactorily disposed of by reference to diplomatic channels.The need for prompt action was increased by a report whichhad just been received from the Naval Control Service Officer atBergen that the Norwegian Government were proposing that shipping should be convoyed by the Norwegian Navy withinNorwegian territorial waters. If this were to happen, it wOuldmean that north and south traffic to and from Germany would beable to pass without hindrance. It was also reported that Luleawas now frozen up.The Lord Privy Seal said that we were at present enjoying aconsiderable measure of goodwill with the Scandinavian countries as a result of our action towards Finland, and he thought that weshould exploit the situation by action on the lines proposed by theFirst Lord.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had had discussions with the First Lord as to his two earlier proposals.The present suggestion was new to him, and he would be glad ofthe opportunity to examine it in greater detail before expressingany final opinion on it. It was necessary to consider the effect which such action would have riot only in Norway, but in other neutral countries. Further, our agreement with Norway in respectof chartered shipping could be terminated by that country subject: to certain conditions of notice.The Minister without Portfolio, while supporting the FirstLord&apos;s proposals in principle, pointed out that there were at least two stretches of the Norwegian coast where the traffic normallypassed outside of territorial waters, and &apos; where captures might perhaps be made. He asked whether the proposal applied to neutral ships with cargoes to Germany or only to German ships.The Chancellor of the Exchequer likewise foresaw strong objections from the neutrals if we seized neutral ships in norwegian territorial waters. Our action would be easier to justify, if weseized only German ships as a measure of rough justice to an enemywho had broken all the rules.
Consideration was given to a suggestion that we should prepare the ground for such action by giving publicity to the sinkings in norwegian territorial waters of which the Germans had been guilty.It was generally felt, however, that such action might rob us of theadvantage of springing a surprise and precipitate the institution of a convoy system by Norway.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of this discussion.(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty- to circulate aMemorandum setting out his proposals for considerationby the War Cabinet at their Meeting on Monday, the18th December.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat there was nothing of importance to report from the western front.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Supply ofMunitions.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 113thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for War said that severe fighting-had taken place in the extreme North, where the Russians were reported to be attacking in great force. There was a rumour thatthe Finns were abandoning Salmijarvi, the nickel mine area. Therehad also been considerable fighting on the Finnish Eastern frontier,and a success had been claimed by the Finns at Tolvajarvi, north of Lake Ladoga. No report had been received of the situation inthe Karelian Isthmus, where it was believed that the russians were up to the Mannerheim Line.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that accordingto our Military Attache the Finns were doing very well, their mainanxiety being that they might run short of ammunition. Reasonablydefended, it should be possible to hold the Karelian Isthmusindefinitely.  In his view the danger was from bolshevisation inside.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the viewof the Finnish Minister in London was that conditions were sufficiently good in Finland to make it improbable that the Finnswould fall easy victims to bolshevisation.The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat a telegram had been received from our Military Attache in sweden asking for a long list of articles of equipment for the useof the Swedish Volunteer Force in aid of Finland.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that the Air Ministry-had examined the possibility of supplying obsolete or obsolescentaircraft to Finland. The type in question the Gauntlet wouldbe definitely inferior to the opposing Russian types, but nevertheless it had been ascertained that the Finns would be glad to have these aircraft. These aircraft had already been promised to South africa and it would be necessary to consult the Union Government.Meanwhile, it would be three weeks before the twenty Gladiatorscould reach Finland from this country. A proposal had accordingly been made to the Swedish Government that they should at oncerelease twenty Gladiators from the Swedish Air Force, to be replaced by the Gladiators from this country as soon as these were ready(telegram No. 202 to Stockholm).The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he wouldmake immediate enquiries into the possibility of diverting, to

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 352, dated the 14th December, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Oslo, reporting that the Naval Attache hadreceived reliable information that a portion of the consignment of italian aircraft forwarded to Finland had been sent by rail acrossGermany and assembled at Malmo in Sweden, and that a portionhad been flown to Finland and had refuelled at Munich. between a hundred and twenty and a hundred and fifty 30-mm. guns hadbeen supplied to Finland by Germany a f eAv days before the outbreakof hostilities between Finland and the U.S.S.R. Finland had also received a hundred thousand rifles from Czecho-Slovakia, whichhad been sent via Narvik. The previous day (the 13th December,1939) the Naval Attaches informant, who was an agent for theBofors Company in Norway, had received information from Germansources that two hundred and fifty 20-mm. guns with ammunitioncaptured in Poland were available and ready to be sold to Finland,Sweden and Norwajr.The Secretary of State for War said that this informationentirely contradicted that received from His Majesty&apos;s minister in Finland, who had been informed by the Secretary-General ofthe Finnish Foreign Office that day that, while it was true thatcertain consignments had arrived (which he described as insig-significant), Germany was making even greater difficulties in regardto the transit of arms across Germany. The Secretary-Generalanticipated that Germany would shortly place an embargo on the transit to Finland of the most important supplies of arms.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was likely that Germany was pursuing a double policy stoppingcertain consignments of arms ostentatiously and, at the same time,surreptitiously giving indirect assistance to Finland.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Scandinavia. 8.   In connection with the discussion recorded in Minute 7Possible above, the Secretary of State for War drew attention to telegramdevelopments. No. 226, dated the 14th December, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s(Previous Minister in Finland expressing the view that the only hope ofBef erence: extricating Finland from her present danger was by immediateW.M.

Everything, he thought, now depended on the extent towhich Ave and others could give effective help to Finland. It was,in his view, worth taking a certain risk to do this.   He hoped in finland at least a proportion of the twenty-eight Gauntlets whichwere now destined for South Africa. He would, however, point outthat South Africa had recently taken on a further commitment in accepting responsibility for the defence of Kenya,The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the above statement.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to enquire whether the Union Government would agree toa proportion of the 28 Gauntlet aircraft sold to them,being diverted to Finland.
the course of the day to circulate a paper, which he had undertaken to prepare, analysing the developments which might take place in scandinavia. After a preliminary discussion by the War Cabinet,this paper, he suggested, should be referred to the Chiefs of staff committee for an appreciation of the strategical implicationsinvolved.The War Cabinet :-Agreed that the Memorandum by the Foreign secretary should be considered at the Meeting of the War Cabinetto be held on Monday, the 18th December, 1939.The Balkans. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionAttitude of to telegram No. 1230, dated the 14th December, 1939, from HisItaly. Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, in which Sir Percy Loraine reported(Previous various interviews which had a bearing on the Italian attitude to reference: the Balkans. The information contained in this telegram mightW.M. (39) 115th be summarised as follows : Conclusions, The New R,oumanjan Minister had stated that Germanymute 2.) had given some assurances to Italy that she did not contemplatemilitary intervention in the Balkans. The Roumanian minister had, moreover, derived the impression from Count Ciano that italy did not feel able to associate herself with the Balkan blocbecause, from the point of view of her relations with Germany,three of the Balkan States (namely, Turkey,- Roumania and greece) were &apos;&apos; too highly coloured&apos;&apos; (doubtless by their particular relations to the Allies arising out of guarantee, ortreaty); but that Italy would regard with favour successfulefforts by the Balkan States to achieve solidarity among them-selves. Count Horodysky, who had just returned fromHungary, had formed the impression that Italy did not contemplate any move in the Balkans, but that she took very seriously her position Balkan Power.    The YugoslavMinister in Rome had informed Sir Percy Loraine that he was apprehensive of a possible Italian request for the passage of italian troops across Yugoslavia to Hungary, presumably forHungary&apos;s protection. All these indications strengthenedSir Percy Loraine&apos;s view that a false move on our part inBalkan affairs might prove disastrous.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention alsoto telegram No. 730, which he had sent at 1 p.m. the previous day(the 14th December, 1939) to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome.At a later stage of the meeting, the Secretary of State said thathe had just received a telegram in reply from Sir Percy Loraine(No. 1229 dated the 14th December, 1939). The main points this  latter telegram were as follows : If the preparatory measures in Greece and Turkeyadvocated by the French military representatives were decided upon, it would be preferable to tell Count Ciano confidentiallywhat we had in mind. That would be risky enough; but itwould be even more risky to wait until the Italian Governmentdiscovered these preparations, especially as there were con-tinuous indications in Rome of Italian suspiciousness about our eventual aims in the Mediterranean. Assuming that itwas absolutely necessary to take these preparatory measureshe suggested that he should be authorised to speak to count ciano in the following sense : The promise to exchange views with Italy before theformation of a Balkan front holds good, but the Allies
TheNetherlands.ProbableGermanintentions.(PreviousE ef erences:W.M. (39) 93rdConclusions,Minute 10,and 101stConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 252, dated the 14th December, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, The Hague, in which Sir Nevile Bland reported the substance of a private conversation which had taken place theprevious day between M. van Kleffens, the Netherland Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, and the local correspondents of the ManchesterGuardian and the Chicago Daily News, who particularly asked thatthe source of this information should not be disclosed.M. van Kleffens had drawn attention to a report emanating from an American journalist alleging that there weredifferences of opinion in Netherland Government circles on thequestion whether the Netherlands should or should not defend themselves against possible German invasion. He had statedmost emphatically that no such dissensions existed, and thatthe Government and Government circles were unanimously agreed that the Netherlands would defend themselves vigorouslyagainst an invader. If correspondents persisted in sendingsuch reports, he would be forced to expel them from thecountry. In the event of an invasion, the Netherlands wouldfight against all comers except such as were specificallyappealed to for assistance. In reply to a question, M. vanKleffens said that &quot; a Power interested in the maintenance of dutch neutrality &apos;&apos; would be requested to send help if theNetherlands were invaded. Finally, M. van Kleffens expressedthe view that, if an invasion occurred, it was most unlikelythat the Netherlands alone would be tbe victims. Accordingto reports which he had received from Germany, the german air Force did not consider the Netherlands a suitable base forair operations.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff agreed that, from the airpoint of view, the Netherlands did not offer much advantage toGermany except in the South-West corner near Flushing, fromwhich it would be possible for them to operate their short-range bombers and fighters against this country.feel it necessary to make some preparations for such aneventuality. Even if the clanger of German aggression inthe Balkans has lessened since the matter was last taken up with the Italian Government in mid-September last,the danger of Soviet aggression has increased, in viewnotably of Soviet aggression in Finland. The measures now contemplated do not include the movements of allied troops or munitions to the Balkans; and, if it becomes necessary later to contemplate such movements, our promise to consult Italy in advance will be kept.Sir Percy Loraine added that he could not foretell count ciano&apos;s reaction to such a communication, but it was possiblethat the speech which he was to make on the 16th December,1939, would offer some clue.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
War Cabinet 11.   The War Cabinet agreed : m an^ments. That the Meeting of the War Cabinet to be held onMonday, the 18th December, 1939, should be held at10-30 A.m. instead of 11-30 a.m.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 15, 1939.
