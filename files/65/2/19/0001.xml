The Air Situation. (Previous Reference W.M. (89) 84th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said there had been little air activity, as weather had been generally unfavourable.

An attack on what was thought to be an enemy submarine had been made by an aircraft escorting a convey, and destroyers had been directed to the spot.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement

The Naval Situation. (Reference: W.M. (39) 84th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a British tanker of 794 tons had been mined near the Tongue lightship.

Efforts to tow in the halves of the Norwegian tanker, which had broken in two after being torpedoed by the U-41, had failed.

There had been a few attacks on submarines by British and French forces; and the French were confident that their destroyer Sirocco had achieved a successful result.

(Previous Reference : W.M. (39) 59th conclusions, minute 2.)

 There had been no further news of the German submarine whose operations off Gibraltar had been reported at the meeting referred to in the margin; nor had there been any further sinkings in that area. It was possible, therefore, that the attacks on that submarine had been successful.

It had not yet proved possible to examine the U-16, which was stranded on the Goodwins.

A party from a British destroyer had succeeded in boarding the Italian ship to which he had referred the day before, and on which 40 Germans were believed to be travelling. The Captain of the Italian ship had refused to surrender the Germans on the ground that he was within Portuguese territorial waters, which he inter-preted as extending for six miles from the shore. Although we did not recognise any extension of territorial waters beyond three miles, it had been thought better not to press the matter as so little was at stake.

A flotilla of motor torpedo boats was returning from Malta to this country, passing through French rivers and canals. They had been overtaken by a gale in the Mediterranean the day before.One had unfortunately sunk, and the remainder had had to seek. shelter in Sardinia and Corsica. They would resume their voyage when the weather moderated.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement

The military situation. (Previous Reference:W.M. (89) 84th conclusions, Minute 8.)

The Secretary of State for War said that one more German Division had been located m the Aachen Area. The latest estimate was as follows: -

Divisions.

Western Front 90

Poland 25

Central Germany 19

Total 134

There were no military operations to report.

The war cabinet took note of the aboce statement.
Bofors Guns. (Previous Reference : W.M. (39) 75th conclusions, minute 10.)supply from Belgium

The secretary of State for the War said that the Belgians were about to deliver 19. Bofors guns direct to the British Expeditionary Force in Franc. These guns had been manufactured by Belgian sub-contractors for the Bofors firm, and were part of our original contract with the firm. The Belgian firm had also informed us that, if we could supply them with the forgings, which they normally obtained from Sweden, they would be able to supply us with finished barrels, at the rate of one per day.

He was asking the Ministry of Supply to examine this possibility at once.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Poland. Representation at Inter-Allied meetings. (Previous Reference : W.M. (89) 84th conclusions, Minute 6.)

5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs again referred to the desire expressed to him by the Polish Prime Minister that Poland should be associated with the Supreme War Council, or, if that was not possible, that Poland should have a representative withthe Anglo-French Permanent Military Representatives in London.

A Meeting of the Supreme War Council had now been fixed to be held in London the following day, and, if General Sikorski first heard of it from the newspapers, he might feel slighted. The Foreign Secretary therefore suggested sending a message to General Sikorski in the course of the afternoon, telling him that we were considering the question of closer military liaison with the Poles,and informing him at the same time that M. Daladier would be in London on the ensuing day.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that the question of military liaison with the Poles was to be discussed that afternoon at a meeting of the Military Co-ordination Committee.There were no Polish forces in this country other than those attached to the Navy. At the moment, it was undesirable that we should be committed to any arrangement which might give the Poles access to the very secret discussions which we were having with the French, and, in any case, it would be necessary to obtain French agreement. The question of giving them the necessary liaison in matters of supply was different, and could probably be arranged without difficulty.The Minister without Portfolio explained that during the last war only Great Britain, France and America had been represented permanently on the Supreme War Council. Other countries, such as Belgium and Roumania, had been called in only when the situation specially concerned them.

The Prime Minister thought that the case of Belgium was a very useful precedent.

The War Cabinet agreed-

(i) To invite the Prime Minister to mention, during the interview which he whould have with General Sikorski that afternoon, the fact that M. Daladier would be visiting London on the ensuing day.

(ii) To invite the Military Co-ordination Committee to consider,in connection with the other requests made by the Polish Government, the request that that Government should have a representative with the Anglo-French Permanent Military Representatives in London 
Poland German ? against the Poles.

6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that General Sikorski had informed him that the German authorities in occupied Poland were treating the Poles with great harshness. In areas which had been Polish for 1,000 years Poles were being required to evacuate their homes at 24 hours&apos; notice, only being permitted to take with them 50 kilog, of baggage. The areas so evacuated were being resettled by Germans from the South Tyrol and the Baltic States. In other areas Poles were being turned out of their homes to make way for Jews. The dispossessed Poles were being driven to take refuge in the marshes and the forests. Many leading Poles had been shot. General Sikorski had added that the Polish Government intended to publish a series of White Papers telling the world what was happening.

The Secretary of State for War said that our White Paper on the German concentration camps had gained one day&apos;s publicity only; what was really required was t hat publicity on such questions should be maintained continuously.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would draw General Sikorski&apos;s attention to the importance of this consideration.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Turkey. Probable attitude in the event of an invasion of Roumania.

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 736 dated the 14th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, in regard to Turkey&apos;s attitude in the event of Roumania being attacked by the U.S.S.R. The main points in this telegram were as follows:-

Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was convinced that there were only two eventualities which would induce Turkey to move, namely, (a) any development of a direct threat to her interests or (b) a move by Bulgaria against Roumania. The Turkish Government were extremely anxious not to be involved in hostilities against the U.S.S.R. and it was this consideration which would influence them if we asked for the passage of warships through the Straits. The Ambassador doubted whether the Turks would agree to such a request, unless and until they were convinced that war between themselves and the U.S.S.R. was inevitable, or at least essential to their own safety. They would not be likely to be moved to any extent by the seizure of Bessanabia by the U.S.S.R., either with or without Roumanian acquiescence, but if the U.S.S.R. went further, these problems would at once present themselves.

If Bulgaria were to move against Roumania, it might be possible for Turkey to carry out against Bulgaria her obligations under the Balkan Pact without coming into conflict with the U.S.S.R.

The general conclusion reached by the Ambassador was that the possibility of our coming to the assistance of Roumania against the U.S.S.R. depended on our warships being permitted to pass through the Straits, and that such permission would only be given if the action we were taking was in defence of Turkey as much as in defence of Roumania.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added that the views expressed in the foregoing telegram were being carefully studied in the Foreign Office and it might be necessary for him to bring up this telegram again for discussion by the War Cabinet.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.


Germany. Internal situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 78th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 854. Saving, dated the 15th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, in which Sir Ronald Camphell reported having been informed by M. Coulondre, the former French Ambassador in Berlin, that, according to his information, depression in Germany was growing apace; for example, the German delegate to the meeting of the Council of the International Chamber of Commerce recently held in Amsterdam had said to the French delegate, "Germany cannot and must not win this war." M. Coulondre did not believe in a popular rising in Germany, and thought that it was only the Army which could depose Herr Hitler. He did not think however that the Army would do this yet.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Germany. Possible development of policy. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 79th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 852, Saving, dated the 14th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador; Paris, reporting that he had been informed by M. Coulondre, the late French Ambassador in Berlin, who appeared to have friends in Germany with whom he was still in touch, that, according to his information, the Germans have, or rather had, four plans for the prosecution of the war :-

(i) A plan favoured by Marshal Goering and General Milch for a concentrated air attack from Germany against great Britain in the hope of rendering us impotent for some months to come whilst we were repairing the ravages. The Germans were prepared to lose 60 per cent of the aircraft employed. This plan had been dropped for technical reasons.

(ii) The same as (i) but the attack to be launched from the Netherlands, after that country, had been reduced andthe necessary air bases prepared.

(iii) A land offensive against the Allied front through Belgium and Luxembourg,(iv) The same as (iii) but through Luxembourg only.

M. Coulondre agreed that it was idle to speculate about Herr Hitler&apos;s intentions, and thought that we could only rely on the Allied High Command to be ready for all eventualities. He endorsed the view that Herr Hitler&apos;s weak spot had always been his inability to take quick decisions, though when he did take them he went for his objective like a screak of lightning.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Russia. Proposed Trade Agreement. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 84th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

10. The Secretary for State for Foreign Affairs said that, since the meeting of the War Cabinet held on the previous day, he had made enquiries to ascertain what the present position was in regard to the negotiations for the expansion of Anglo-Soviet Trade. The Soviet Ambassador had stated that he hoped to make a communication within the course of the next few days. The Foreign Secretary had, however, been informed by Sir Stafford Cripps, of whom he had also made enquiries, that it was unlikely that we should receive a reply for some considerable time. The latter believed that this delay would be due to two causes: First, the Soviet Government were making a careful study fo the proposals put forward by the Board of Trade. Secondly, it was likely that they would prefer not to proceed with their negotiations with us until a settlement had been reached on their difficulties with Finland, since those difficulties were being represented to the Soviet public as largely due to support given by the country to the Finns
in their opposition to the proposals put forward by the Government of the U.S.S.R. Sir Stafford was convinced, however, that the Soviet Government did not wish this delay to have the effect of wrecking the prospect of securing an enlarged trade agreement with us. No doubt their commercial arrangements needed review in the light of the changes recently agreed upon as regards Soviet trade with the Baltic countries, quite apart from the problems arising from the Soviet occupation of Eastern Poland.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that no doubt it appeared reasonable to the Soviet Union to take advantage of the present situation to regain some of the territory which Russia had lost as a result of the last war, at the beginning of which she had been the ally of France and Great Britain. This applied not only to Baltic territories, but also to Finland. It was to our interests that the U.S.S.R. should increase their strength in the Baltic, thereby limiting the risk of German domination in that area. For this reason it would be a mistake for us to stiffen the Finns against making concessions to the U.S.S.R. In general, it should be our policy to secure as much support as possible in this war from the U.S.S.R. China and the U.S.A.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that we had been extremely tolerant in our relations with the U.S.S.R., and he agreed that it was in our interest to continue this policy. As regards Finland, while, of course, the Finns should not be encouraged in opposition to any reasonable demands made by Moscow, he was not prepared to press them to make concessions on questions which they themselves regarded as vital to their national independence.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Roumania. Proposed chartering of barges. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 13th Conclusions, Minute 10, and W.M. (39) 16th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

11. The Minister without Portfolio drew attention to a telegram, No. 730, dated the 15th November, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Bucharest. The effect of Sir Reginald Hoare&apos;s telegram was that, provided he received authority within two days, he would be able to charter 90 grain barges of a total capacity of some 100,000 tons, and 19 tug boats, totalling 5,600 horse-power. The price for chartering the barges and tugs for one year would be about £54,000. He pointed out that the barges were at present under charter to the German State Grain and Foodstuffs Purchasing Department, who wished to renew their charter, so that we should be depriving the Germans of an existing means of transport. He recalled the following decision of the Cabinet taken on the 12th September:-

"(v) That the British Minister at Bucharest should .... be authorised forthwith to charter all available oil barges and rail tanks in Roumania."

The present offer only affected grain barges, but on the previous evening he had learnt that the Germans intended to convert grain barges into oil barges. He strongly recommended that the proposal of the British Minister should be approved.

In the course of discussion the War Cabinet were informed that it was not known whether the barges would be sea-going vessels. In any event, acquisition of these Danube barges would prevent them falling into German hands and would increase our economic pressure.

The Home Secretary reminded the War Cabinet of the experience of the last war, in which there had been a great demand for barges for a variety of uses. We had gone so far as to construct barges made of concrete.


The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, provided these Danube barges were sea worthy, they might be used as ammunition ships, thus releasing ordinary shipping for commercial purposes.

The War Cabinet:-

Agreed that authority should be given forthwith to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Bucharest ot charter the barges and tug-boats referred to above.

roumanian oil supplies. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 50th Conclusions, Minute 8, and W.M. (39) 69th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

12.  The Minister without Portfolio reminded the War Cabinet that, on the first of the two occasions referred to in the margin, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and he had been invited to keep an eye on the question of the German supplies of oil. They hoped within the next day or two to submit a comprehensive report on the whole subject. 

A matter had, however, arisen in connection with Roumanianoil, on which they would like to have an immediate decision by the War Cabinet.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 13th Conclusions, Minute 10 (i).)

Roumania was one of the largest possible sources of German oil supplies and, at the meeting referred to in the margin, the War Cabinet had therefore decided that steps should be taken to purchase as much Roumanian oil as possible. When the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and he had begun their inquiry, a plan for carrying out this decision through the agency of the private companies under British and French influences had been in full operation and, until the previous week, they had been given to understand that there was every prospect of the plan succeeding.

The previous Saturday, however, they had learnt that this plan was not likely to be as successful as had been hoped. The amounts actually bought were comparatively small. Only about 180,000 tons had been purchased for shipment to this country this year, together with about 140,000 tons for France, making 320,000 tons in all. There had since been some improvement, but a total of only 351,000tons had been reached.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 18th Conclusions, Minute 10 (iii).)

On investigation they had found that the reasons for this comparative failure were partly political and partly financial.

The financial reasons were connected with the War Cabinet&apos;s decision that all payment should be made ih blocked sterling; and also with the rate of exchange for lei allowed by the payment agreements. A week or two ago there had been negotiations between the Treasury and the Roumanian Minister as to Glearing arrangements, as the result of which fresh proposals by the Treasury, affecting oil purchases, had been forwarded by courier to Bucharest by the Roumanian Minister.  No answer hab. yet been received.

The political difficulties were due mainly to Roumania&apos;s fear lest she might annoy Germany to the point at which she would be invaded, but also to raise the price the oil.

In order to surmount these difficulties, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and be had arranged with the Departments concerned (the Ministry of Economic Warfare, the Petroleum Department and the Treasury) that Mr. Bridgeman, the head of the Oil Department of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, should proceed at once to Bucharest, accompanied by a financial expert. These officials, who, it was hoped, would be able to start on the following day, would, in conjunction with the British Minister, have it as their main object to elicit an immediate reply to the Treasury proposals for revising the Clearing arrangements and, if necessary, to recommend how these proposals should be modified in order to obtain the purchase, on the most reasonable terms possible, of the maximum amount of oil. The officials concerned
were to make contact with M. Wenge, the French expert. As soon as their mission was accomplished they would returns home and would be replaced by a permanent expert, who would be attached to the British Minister and would assist with future purchases.

The Foreign Office were at present drafting instructions for Sir Seginald Hoare, so as to secure the greatest possible co-operation, not only from the Government of Roumania, but also from the King of Roumania, whose help was of the utmost importance. These instructions would be based on the assumption that the object was that laid down by the War Cabinet, namely, to purchase as much as possible of Roumanian oil, with the object of preventing it going to Germany.

Sir Reginald Hoare, however, had, warned the Government, as had also M. Wenger, that they could not press the Roumanian Government beyond a certain point. Roumanian would have to be allowed to send a certain amount of oil to Germany, just as Denmark had been allowed to send a certain amount of food to Germany, in order that we might obtain our own requirements.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and he had at firsthoped that it would be sufficient to tell Sir Reginald Hoare that-

" While our policy must be, by purchase or otherwise, to divert as much oil as possible from reaching Germany, our action must be adjusted at all times to the international political situation."

The Foreign Office, however, were now insisting that they must give the Minister some idea of what was in the mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the amount of oil per annum that Roumania could be allowed to send to Germany.

After discussion with the Ministers concerned, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and he had come to the Conclusion thatthe Foreign Office might inform Sir Reginald Hoare semi-officially that the figure which His Majesty&apos;s Government had in mind wasone not exceeding a million tons a year.

This was the actual amount imported by Germany from roumania during the last year before the war. It was 3/4 million tons less than the maximum figure imported by Germany from Roumaniain any of the last four years. It was 1/4 million below the average figure for the last four years. It was also the figure arrived at independently by M. Wenger. It was much less than the amount which might be secured by Germany according to the estimates contained in the Report by the Secretary for Mines (W.P. (39) 90), which varied from 800,000 tons to 1,600,000 tons as a maximum in the first six months of war, or 2,000,000 tons to 4,000,000 tons as a maximum in the first year of war. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and he felt that, however, before this figure was mentioned by the Foreign Office to Sir Reginald Hoare, the War Cabinet ought to have knowledge of it.

The Minister for Economic Warfare suggested that the figure of 1 million tons a year was emphaticafly not one which should be communicated to the Roumanians. The Foreign Office ought to make it clear in their instructions to Sir Reginald Hoare that the figure was for his guidance only.

The Secretary for Mines thought that it might be difficult to persuade the Roumanians to ration their oil exports to Germany so severely. If they could be persuaded to adopt this figure, however, so much the better.

The War Cabinet-

Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform Sir Reginald Hoare that 1 million tons a year was the figure in the mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government as the amount of oil which Roumania might be allowed to export to Germany per annum.
