The Air Situation .

(Previous References: W.M. (59) 90th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that the Royal Air Force had experienced a difficult time during the previous twenty-four hours.

From dawn on the previous day enemy aircraft had been active off the East Coast from the Orkneys to Kent. The wireless interception service had confirmed that there had been an abnormal amount of activity during the morning. Two or three enemy aircraft had been sighted over the Orkneys; one had flow along Scapa Flow, and one had been seen over Cromarty Firth and Invergordon. No bombs had been dropped.

Shortly before 11 A.M. a Dornier 17 had been intercepted by our Fighters East of Deal, and had been brought down into the sea ten miles North of Cape Gris Nez. The wreckage had been salvaged, but there had been no survivors. At about the same time an aircraft of the Field Force Component had shot down a Heinkel 111 off Boulogne.

There had been further enemy activity in the evening over Harwich and the Hunter. Two flying-boats which flew over Harwich were reported to have dropped two large objects in the entrance to the harbour.

An enemy seaplane had been engaged by anti-aircraft fire in the neighbourhood of Hull without known results; Fighters had been despatched but, as had been the case on the previous day, our defence had been handicapped by fog.

Bull Sand Fort, at the mouth of the Humber, had been very boldly machine-gunned in the dark at 6.30 P.M. by an enemy aircraft flying at 200 feet, and one man had been wounded in the fort; the aircraft had landed on the water and had then taken off again, after having apparently released a number of mines. Anti-aircraft fire had been opened later without result.

A report-not yet confirmed-stated that shortly before midnight an enemy aircraft had been laying mines from a height of 3,000 feet between Dover and Calais.

Three members of the crew of the German aircraft which had been engaged after appearing over the Thames Estuary on the 20th November had been picked up on the previous day by a destroyer 20 miles East of Orfordness.

Two aircraft had been picked up on the previous day by a destroyer 20 miles East of Orfordness.

Two aircraft from Bomber Command had successfully carried out a leaflet-dropping raid on the previous night from a base in France.

An aircraft of Coastal Command had made an attack on a submarine, with unknown results, north-east of Kinnaird&apos;s Head.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 90th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet of the present situation of the Fleet.

As reported the previous day, H.M.S. Belfast had been damaged by a mine, but she had been successfully docked.

H.M.S. Gipsy had been struck by a mine on leaving Harwich harbour on the previous night and severely damaged. She was now beached.

S.S. Geraldus (2,490 tons) had been mined off the mouth of the Thames. Her crew had all been picked up.

The Japanese S.S. Fianona was reported to have been damaged off Deal, though whether by a mine or by collision was not yet clear.

Six or seven British trawlers (250 to 300 tons each) had been attacked by the enemy submarines with gunfire, and sun off North Ireland.

[20376]

  
According to a signal from another ship which had picked up some survivors, S.S. Darino (1,300 tons, Ellerman Line) had been torpedoed.

S.S. Ada, a Norwegian ship which had left St. Thomas, West Indies, was reported to have been destroyed by fire after having been shelled by an unknown man-of-war on the 20th November South-East of Iceland.

H.M.S. Jaguar had been bombed by an enemy seaplane, but had not been damaged.

Attacks on enemy submarines had been continued, but there was nothing to report.



(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 89th Conclusions, Minutes 4.)



Enemy prizes included the S.S. Eilbek, which had already arrived in the Clyde, and S.S. Borkum, which was due to arrive on the 2nd December. S.S. Bertha Fisser (4,000 tons) and S.S. Teneriffe (5,000 tons) had both been scuttled - 32 and 45 survivors have been picked up respectively. These ships had been scuttled before the special instructions discussed at the meeting referred to in the margin had been received by our intercepting forces.



The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Magnetic mines.

(Previous References: W.M. (39) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 2, and 88th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

Proposed statement as to shipping losses.

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the latest information as to the use by Germany of magnetic mines. There was no doubt now that they were being dropped from aeroplanes. He informed the War Cabinet of the steps being taken to find an effective counter to these mines, and of the plans which were being devised to ensure that our shipping was not held up by this new menace, which, he had no doubt, would be overcome in due course.

The First Lord said that it was a matter for consideration whether, in view of the uneasiness resulting from the large number of sinkings by German mines in the last few days, he should make a short statement on this matter in the House that afternoon. Assuming that the losses in the last week of November were the same as in the first three weeks of November, our losses since the outbreak of war were as follows:-



                                  Tons

September ...   ...   ...   ...   160,000

October   ...   ...   ...   ...    80,000

November  ...   ...   ...   ...    45,000

                                   ______ 

                                   285,000



After allowance was made for gains from new construction and capture, our net loss of shipping was 46,000 tons out of a total 21 1/2 million tons of shipping.



The Minister without Portfolio suggested that a useful comparison might be drawn between the present shipping losses and those sustained in the Napoleonic Wars.

The Prime Minister thought that it would be preferable to defer a statement to the following day, when Parliament would be prorogued.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

       
The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 90th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said that there was no change in the situation on the Western Front.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Weekly Reports.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 84th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

5. The War Cabinet took note of the following reports :-

(a) Weekly Report No. 11 by the Secretary of State for War (Paper W.P. (39) 132):

(B) Weekly Report No. 11 by the Secretary of State for Air (Paper W.P. (39) 130).

Roumania.

Purchase of barges.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 85th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

6. The Minister without Portfolio recalled that the War Cabinet, at the Meeting referred to in the margin, had given authority for the chartering of barges on the Danube. Certain cases had now arisen in which chartering could not be effected, and it would be necessary to purchase the barges in order to prevent their use by Germany. He therefore asked that the War Cabinet should sanction such purchases in Principle, subject to the conditions specified below.

The War Cabinet--

Agreed that the authority already given for the chartering of barges on the Danube should, in principle, be regarded as covering purchase in cases where chartering could not be effected, provided--

(a) that the price was considered reasonable by our representatives in the Danubian countries concerned and by the Government Departments concerned:

(b) that the Government Departments concerned considered that, in depriving the Germans of these barges, we were obtaining value for money:

(c) that no agreement should be made involving payment in United States dollars without express authority.

Scandinavian Countries.

Assistance in the event of Russian and/or German aggression.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 67th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

7. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefs of Staff committee on the Assistance to Scandinavian Countries in the Event of Russian and/or German Aggression (Paper W.P. (39) 133).

The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Foreign Office had asked the Chiefs of Staff for their views on the military implications of giving an assurance of support to the Scandinavian countries in the event of aggression by Russia or Germany. In a previous Report (Paper W.P. (39) 107) the Chiefs of Staff had recorded the view that the despatch of a small expedition to Scandinavia would be a practicable proposition, but, on a reconsideration of the problem, they had reached the conclusion that, once British troops had landed in Norway it might be difficult to limit our commitment. While therefore the Chiefs of Staff adhered to their view that the despatch of a small expedition would be practicable, they considered that it would be undesirable, and they were unable to recommend it. In view of the assurance which had already been given to ("A") Norway in respect of German aggression; it was for consideration whether a further communication should be made to the Norwegian Government explaining that the extent of our support must be limited to Naval action.

[20875]

 
The Lord Privy Seal said that he would be inclined to wait until Norway asked for information as to the form which our assistance should take before making any further communication.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would like to give the point further consideration.

The War Cabinet agreed--

(1) To approve the recommendations in Paper W.P. (39) 133.

(2) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to give consideration to the point raised at "A" above, and to advise the War Cabinet.



Belgium.

Pursuit of German aircraft over Belgian territory.

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 866, Saving, dated the 20th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, reporting that the French Government, at the request of General Gamelin, had instructed M. Bargeton, the French Ambassador at Brussels, to inform the Belgian Government that, in view of the numbers of German aircraft which were escaping from French pursuit aircraft by flying back to Germany over Belgian territory, orders had been given to the French Air Force to continue their pursuit of German aircraft over Belgian territory. These instructions had been carried out by M. Bargeton on the 19th November. The Belgian Government, Sir Ronald Campbell gathered, were a little nervous at the prospect. Sir Ronald added that the French Authorities did not at present propose to violate Belgian territory in regard to German aircraft approaching France over Belgium.

The Chief of the Air Staff asked whether similar instructions should be issued to British aircraft in France, particularly to those which formed part of the Field Force Component which were subordinate to Lord Gort, and therefore to General Gamelin. When a few days previously he had been informed of the orders proposed to be issued by General Gamelin, the Air Ministry had at once taken up with the Foreign Office the question whether similar order should be issued to Royal Air Force units in France.

The War Cabinet took note:-

(a) of the issue, by direction of the French Government, of orders to the French Air Force to continue their pursuit of German aircraft over Belgian territory:

(b) that the question whether similar instructions should be issued to Royal Air Force units in France was under discussion between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Air.



The German Air Force.

Evidence as to efficiency.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 84th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the War Cabinet certain information received from a secret source which in the past, had proved reliable relating to the efficiency of the German Air Force. Particulars of the information are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.  
Contraband Control. Treatment of Soviet ships.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 6.)

10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister for Economic Warfare (Paper W.P. (G.) (89) 94) in which the question was raised of the policy to be adopted towards Soviet ships by the Contraband Control authorities.

The Minister for Economic Warfare said that it was surprising that no Soviet vessel had hitherto entered any of our Contraband Control bases. Russian trade was, however, irregular and it was diminishing at the present time. Nevertheless, the question raised in his Memorandum might call for decision at any moment. It was to be expected that any request to the Soviet authorities for a guarantee that a cargo would not be allowed to reach Germany, would be flatly rejected, and might provoke a violent reaction on the part of the Soviet Government. In such a case was it the desire of the War Cabinet that the Contraband Committee should institute their normal enquiries, and, should those enquiries support the presumption that some or all of the cargo was destined for Germany, would be committee be at liberty to order the seizure of the cargo? Or would the case have first to be brought to the notice of the War Cabinet?

A decision not to demand the usual guarantees in the case of Soviet vessels would amount to discrimination in favour of the Soviet and would give rise to difficulties with other countries. One possible way of avoiding a clash with the Soviet, while not differentiating too openly in their favour, might be to "go through the motions" of demanding guarantees and making enquiries--but not in the end to seize the goods.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that it would be objectionable to discriminate openly in favour of Russia. On the other hand, he was anxious to avoid any serious dispute between this country and Russia.

The Prime Minister thought that the same treatment ought to be accorded to Russia as to other neutral countries. If we adopted a stiff line the Soviet Government might realise that, if they were to be treated as neutrals, they must act accordingly.

Proposed trade negotiations with Russia. 

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 84th Conclusions, Minute 11).

Seizure of German exports: possible use by Germany of Russian shipping.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 90th Conclusions, Minute 8.)



The President of the Board of Trade said that he had no views whatever on this subject. According to M. Maisky, the authorities at Moscow had been too busy to apply their minds to it.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the Ministry of Economic Warfare ought to be on their guard against the possibility of Germany making use of Russian shipping in order to escape the consequences of the previous day&apos;s decision to make their exports subject to seizure on the high seas.

The War Cabinet agreed as follows:-

(i) General approval was given to the proposals of the Minister for Economic Warfare, under which Soviet vessels would receive the same treatment at the hands of the Contraband Control authorities as other neutral shipping. In certain circumstances, therefore, their cargoes would be liable to seizure, with a view to their being sent to the Prize Court.

(ii) Subject to (i) above, the Minister for Economic Warfare was invited to instruct the Contreband Control authorities to avoid as far as possible, action likely to lead to a serious dispute with the Soviet Government. One method of avoiding such a result might be to spin out the process requesting guarantees making enquiries,&amp;c

 
(iii) The Minister was invited to keep in touch with the Foreign Secretary in regard to any case which appeared likely to give rise to serious difficulty.



India and Burma (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill.

Proposed re-introduction.



11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India and Burma (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 101) in which he asked approval for the re-introduction early in the following Session of the India and Burma (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill.

The Secretary of State for India and Burma explained that except for four amendments, the Bill had already been approved by the Cabinet, and passed by the House of Lords. Only one of these amendments would be controversial, namely, a clause by which it was proposed to amend the Schedule to the 1935 Act, under which sources of revenue were assigned to the Central and Provincial Governments respectively. Under this Schedule taxes on income other than agricultural income were assigned to the Central Government, while the Provinces were assigned taxes on any profession, trade, calling, or employment. The Government of the United Provinces had, however, passed a Bill which, though nominally a tax on employment, was in effect a heavily graduated tax on income, such as it had never been intended to bring within the scope of the Provincial Governments.

The Bill had been referred to the Governor-General, who had not yet given a decision on it, but was quite clear that consent must be withheld. He was equally clear, however, that it was desirable to amend the Schedule to the 1935 Act so as to make clear the intention of Parliament in the matter. It was proposed to secure this by a clause under which no tax on a profession, trade, &amp;c., should exceed 50 rupees per annum in the case of any individual tax-payer.

It was generally agreed that it was very desirable that the matter should be dealt with by legislation as proposed, and not merely by the Governor-General withholding his assent, so long as there was any possibility of arguing that the Bill which had been passed by the United Provinces Government was intra vires.

The War Cabinet:-

(1) Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for India and Burma to re-introduce the India and Burma (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill early in the coming Session, incorporating the new clauses mentioned in his Memorandum (W.P. (G.) (39) 101).

(2) Agreed that the Bill should be submitted to the Home Policy Committee before re-introduction.



Burma and the War.

Dominion Status as the goal of Constitutional advance.

(Previous Reference W.M. (39) 70th: Conclusions, Minute 10.)



12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 109), to which was annexed the draft of a Statement to be made by the Governor of Burma, to the effect that he was authorised to say on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that in their judgment, the natural issue of Burma&apos;s constitutional progress was the attainment of Dominion status.

The Secretary of State for Burma referred to the earlier statement made by the Governor as a result of the decision of the War Cabinet at their meeting referred to in the margin. The Prime Minister of Burma, was now asking whether this statement meant that the goal for Burma as for India, was Dominion status. The Governor assumed that this was so but he (the Secretary of State) had asked him not to say anything in amplification of his earlier statement until he was in a position to speak with the full authority


 of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Memorandum which he (the Secretary of State) had circulated, contained his reasons for the opinion that Burma had, in fact, already been promised Dominion status, and for the conclusion that in spite of certain misgivings, we ought not to hesitate to say so explicitly. Even if, under the Statute of Westminster, the meaning of the phrase "Dominion Status" was different from that attaching to it when it had first been used in connection with India and Burma, it was impossible to use different words now without arousing general suspicion. He agreed with the Governor of Burma that, unless we were able to give an answer in the sense suggested, it would be assumed that we were trying to escape from our pledges.

The Lord Privy Seal said that, though the Burmese were not in the least suited for the Dominion Status, there was no escaping the conclusion that they had been told at the time of the separation, and that we were therefore committed to regarding Dominion status as their constitutional goal.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that it lay entirely with the British Government to decide when and how conditions were such as to justify and particular stage of constitutional advance. We could not promise Burma Dominion status in the sense that she would be accepted as, in every sense, an equal partner with the other Dominions of the Commonwealth; but we could promise that we looked forward to the time when Burma would be a self-governing community equal in status with the other members of the Commonwealth.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreed that it was important from the point of view of our relations with the Dominions that we should not in this matter promise more than it was in out power to give, namely, the status of a self-governing Dominion.

The Prime Minister pointed out that there were important differences between the existing Dominions. For example, Eire and Newfoundland did not occupy the same important place in the Commonwealth as the four great Dominions.

The First Lord of the Admiralty urged that it was important when discussing Dominion Status to remember that equality of status did not mean the same thing as equality of power or function.

The War Cabinet accordingly:-

Invited the Secretary of State for Burma to communicate with the governor of Burma, authorising him to make a statement in the terms of the Draft appended to his Memorandum W.P. (G.) (39) 109



India and the War.

The general situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 78rd Conclusions, Minute 1.)

In the course of the discussion on the two previous items, enquiries were made as to how the Indian situation was developing.

The Secretary of State for India said that the Governors generally were taking over the Provinces in which the Congress Ministries had resigned, with the exception of Assam, where it was possible that an alternative Ministry might be formed. There had been no special developments in the general situation, and he had not expected any for some little time, as public opinion was at the state of examining recent events, and had not yet formed any definite conclusions.

The Lord Privy Seal suggested that it would help members of the War Cabinet if telegrams dealing with the more important
