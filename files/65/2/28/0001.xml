 been either captured by us, or scuttled to avoid capture, to the extent of over 30,000 tons. Relatively these losses outweighed those sustained by our merchant navy. The German ship Borkum, already reported to the War Cabinet as captured, had been sunk by a German submarine on the 23rd November. The Prize crew and the German crew had been saved, although a number of the latter had been killed by shells from the submarine.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements.



Naval and Air Operations.

"Hot pursuit": action to be taken if the Deutschland should enter neutral waters.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 93rd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the statement which had been made at the Cabinet on the previous day that orders had been issued to the Commander-in-Chief that, if the Deutschland took refuge in Norwegian waters, she was to be engaged under the doctrine of "Hot pursuit." The question had arisen whether similar orders should be given to our Air Force, and he had asked his legal advisers to investigate the matter. It was doubtful whether the doctrine of "Hot pursuit" would be accepted in International Law, although this country had maintained it. The doctrine implied that a ship had been engaged outside territorial waters, and that the action was not broken off because she entered territorial waters. He did not wish to put obstacles in the way of effective action, but the War Cabinet would wish to give full consideration to the effect of such action on neutral and world opinion. He, personally, thought that the Germans would always take any action which suited them, Whether or not they had any excuse for doing it, but action by us in neutral territorial waters would certainly be seized upon by the Germans as justification for further breaches of neutrality on their part, which might be harmful to the Allies.

The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed with this statement of the position. At the same time, he thought it would be intolerable if the British Navy had to stand aside while the Deutschland, after having sunk the Rawalpindi, crept down the Norwegian coast inside territorial waters.

The War Cabinet accepted his view, but thought that a different situation would arise if the Deutschland took refuge in say, Bergen harbour. In that event, the Norwegian Government were under an obligation to intern her, unless she left within 24 hours, except in case of damage.

The Secretary of State for Air said that aircraft had been given orders not to enter neutral territorial waters in search of the Deutschland, but that, if she were sighted from outside territorial waters, she was to be attacked, provided that civilian lives were not thereby endangered.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in issuing the order to the Commander-in-Chief, the Admiralty had not taken into consideration the possibility of the Deutschland entering a neutral harbour. He suggested that the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, in consultation should issue amplified instructions in the light of the discussion which had taken place.

The War Cabinet:-

Took note of the above discussion and invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air to consult together with a view to issuing amplified instructions in the light of the discussion.


The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89)93rd Conclusions, Minute 8.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said that one more German division had been identified in the Düsseldorf area and that there appeared to be one less in the Saarbücken area.

The Secretary of State gave the War Cabinet certain information regarding troop movements to the Middle East and the transfer of certain units from the Middle East to France. Accommodation was being arranged for the Australian and New Zealand troops in the Middle East, and discussions were in progress concerning the financial implications. In the last war, the Dominions had paid for all accommodation, with the exception of that provided in the United Kingdom.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Dominion Air Training scheme.

(Previous Reference:W.M. (39) 65th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

5. The Secretary of State for Air referred to a Memorandum which he had already circulated, but which had not yet been considered by the War Cabinet, dealing with the Dominion Air Training Scheme (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 105). During the last few days the original scheme had been modified in the direction of more advanced training being carried out in Australia and New Zealand and less in Canada. These modifications had been made to meet the wishes of Australia and New Zealand. They would not affect the co-operative nature of the scheme since a considerable number of pupils from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand would still be trained in Canada; and the total eventual output of pilots would remain unchanged. They would, however, result in some saving of dollar expenditure.

On the 24th November strong representations had been received from our Mission in Canada, supported by the United Kingdom High Commissioner, that, owing to the imminent departure from Canada of the Australian Air Minister, authority should be given to them to sign an agreement ad referendum with the other Dominions concerned. The Secretary of State for Air said that he consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and in view of the urgency of the matter a telegram had been despatched authorising the initialling of an agreement, subject to the reference to the War Cabinet of the following two points:-

(i)Our overall financial arrangements with the Canadian Government.

(ii) The Priorities of Canada&apos;s war effort.

Mr. Fairbairn was arriving by air in this country the following week en route for Australia. The Secretary of state proposed that an announcement should be made that an agreement ad referendum had been initilled.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had agreed to the immediate initialling of an agreement, subject to the reservation of the points referred to above, because it seemed desirable not to give the impression that Mr Fairbairn was leaving Canada without some agreement having been concluded. The financial considerations were important. We should have to find about $140,000,000 over three years to cover the contributions of Australia and New Zealand. There were however two disturbing features. First the Canadian Government now wished to deduct the expense of their contribution in the scheme from the loan which they were raising on our behalf in Canada. He felt strongly that Canada should bear their full share of the Air Training Scheme. They were in quite a different position from Australia and New Zealand, who could not possibly provide the necessary dollars themselves. The

[202?4]


 other point was Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s attempt to tie up the whole question of Canada&apos;s contribution with that of a satisfactory price for Canadian wheat.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 48rd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that Mr. MacKenzie King on a previous occasion had attempted to give Canada&apos;s air contribution priority over her contribution in land forces and to include us to give countenance to this priority. He was now repeating these tactics, and we should probably have to take a firm line. The matter was a purely domestic one, which Mr. Mackenzie King must settle on his own responsibility without involving the United Kingdom Government.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.



Poison Gas.

Publicity regarding retaliatory measures.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 79th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Sir Campbell Stuart had inquired whether there would be any objection to the inclusion in propaganda disseminated in Germany of statements to the effect that, if the Germans were to employ gas, we should regard ourselves as free to retaliate in any manner we thought fit.

The Prime Minister said that he thought that there was strong objection to such action, since it would certainly be alleged by the Germans that we were merely preparing the way to use gas ourselves. This was exactly the tactics which the Germans themselves employed on such occasions.

The War Cabinet agreed:-

That no reference should be made in propaganda disseminated in Germany to the possibility of British retaliation in the event of the employment of gas warfare by Germany.



Propaganda in enemy countries. Status of Sir Campbell Stuart&apos;s organisation.

7. The Secretary of State for War said that Sir Campbell Stuart had asked him to consider whether his organisation could be designated by the title "M.I.9." There were obvious difficulties about this suggestion; in the first place the organisation was under the Foreign Office and not the War Office; further the War Office had little information regarding the staff or the scale of activities of Sir Campbell Stuart&apos;s organisation, though there was some reason to think that the latter overlapped to some extent with existing M.I. divisions.

The War Cabinet agreed:-

 to take that the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs made by Sir Campbell Stuart that the title of his organisation should be changed.



Broadcasting Stations in France.

Proposal to close Fécamp.

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that on security grounds the Air Staff were anxious that the broadcasting station at Fécamp should be closed. The question had been raised by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, who had reported that M. Daladier and General Gamelin were both anxious to close the station, but that difficulties were being raised by certain French Ministers. Sir Ronald Campbell had reported that, if he could be instructed to inform M. Daladier that the question had been considered by the War Cabinet, who took a serious view of the matter, this would be sufficient to turn the scales, and lead to the closing down of this stations.

 No 1160, dated the 25th November, 1939, reporting that Count Ciano had informed the United States Ambassador that he was entering a formal protest against our new blockade measures, but that the United States Ambassador had formed the impression that this action was being taken as ostentatiously as possible, probably as much for home consumption as for its effect on opinion in Germany:

No. 1166, dated the 24th November 1939, in which Sir Noel Charles reported that Count Ciano had that evening informed him that, while the interference of our blockade measure with Italian Shipping was recognised as legitimate, the delays imposed and also certain vexations measures were having the worst possible effect in Italy.

The Secretary of State added that Signor Bastianini had taken much the same line at a recent interview, and he felt that the whole question of our contraband control in relation to Italy required the most careful handling.

The Minister for Economic Warfare doubted whether the Italians had much grounds for complaint since the contraband control authorities had exercised great forbearance with them. He agreed, however, that it was essential to deal with the Italian complaints in a sympathetic manner. He had prepared the draft of a reply to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Rome which he would communicate to the Foreign Office.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Seizure of Exports from Germany. Draft Order in Council (Previous Reference : W.M. (39) 90th Conclusions, Minute 8 (iv).)

11. The War Cabinet had before them (1) the draft of an Order in Council, prepared by the Minister for Economic Warface in counsultation with the Attorney-General, the Foreign Office, the Procurator-General and the Admiralty, to give effect to a decision to seize exports of German origin and ownership on the high seas, (2) a commentary on the draft Order prepared by the Attorney General (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 116).

The Attorney-General proposed the following minor drafting alterations:-

(1) Second recital, line 2 : After the words "merchant vessels" insert the words "British," Allied and neutral." This was desirable in order that the same wording should be used in both the second and third recitals.

(2) Third recital, line 4 : For the word "laws" substitute the word "obligations."

The War Cabinet approved the above drafting alterations.

The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested the omission of the recital at the head of page 2:--

"And whereas it is His Majesty&apos;s intention to exercise this right without risk to neutral ships or to neutral or to non-combatant life in strict observance of the obligations of humanity":

on the ground that it might prove impraticable to exercise our rights under the Order without risk to neutral ships and lives.

The War Cabinet were informed that it has been thought desirable from the point of view of concilating out opinion to follow as nearly as practicable in this respect the wording of the Order in Council of the 11th March, ?, which contained a recital to the same effect. This recital ? helpful in establishing our ? the Prize Court.


The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that this recital should be deleted, unless, after consultation with the Legal Advisor to the Foreign Office, he was satisfied that there were strong reaons for its retention.

The War Cabinet adopted this suggestion.

The Minister for Economic Warfare stated that the draft Order had been communicated to the French and Polish Governments. The French Government were anxious that the proposal should be published simultaneously in both countries probably on Tuesday, the 28th November, It was not thought necessary to delay publication until the reply of the Polish Government had been received.

The Minister for Economic Warfare alos stated that he proposed forthwith to telegraph instructions to our Representatives in all neutral countries to reassure the Governements of those countries that it was our intention to bring the provisions of the Order in Council into force gradually and with Leniency, and with as much consideration for neutral susceptibilities as was compatible with the attainment of our objective. The administrative arrangements for enforcing the Order were well advanced.

The War Cabinet :--

(1) Approved the Reprisals Order in Council in the form of the draft annexed to Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 116, subject to (i) the decision of the Foreign Secretary whether the first recital on page 2 should be deleted or not; and 

(ii) the drafting ammendments mentionned by the Attorney-General, and any other minor drafting alterations that might be found necessary.

(2) Took note that it was contemplated that the necessary Order would be submitted to His Majesty in Council on Monday, the 27th November, 1939, for approval.

(3) Agreed that arrangements should be made to ensure similutaneous publication of the reprisals proposals in France and in this country probably on Tuesday, the 28th November, and that in view of its importance, the Privy Council Office should arrange for the insertion of the Order in Council in the London Gazette.

(4) Authorised the Minister for Economic Warfare to instruct our Representatives in all neutral countries to reassure the Governments of those countries that it was our intention to bring the provisions of the Order in Council into force gradually and with Leniency, and with as much consideration for neutral susceptibilities as was compatible with the attainment of our objective
