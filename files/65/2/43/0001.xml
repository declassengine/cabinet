The air situation.(previous reference:      1W.M. (39) 108thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that, apart from two attacks on submarines, there had been very little air activity on theprevious day. One submarine had been successfully attacked offthe North-west of Scotland by an Anson, which had dropped twobombs. The other attack on a submarine had been made by aSunderland off the South-west coast of Ireland, and though oilpatches had been seen, the attack was considered to have beeninconclusive. Two Destroyers accompanying a convoy had continued the attack within five minutes, but there had been no obvious result.The Prime Minister said that the Lord Mayor of Birminghamhad interviewed in Edinburgh one of the German pilots taken prisoner after a raid on the Forth. This pilot had said that20 aircraft had left Germany for the raid, but 16 of them had turned tail as soon as they met the anti-aircraft fire of our defences.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 108thConclusions,Minute 2.)(previous reference;.W.M. (39) 102ndConclusions,Minute 2.)(previous reference:W.M. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 2.)&quot; 2. The First Lord of the A dmiralty informed the War cabinet of the dispositions of the Fleet in northern waters.There had been the following sinkings of British ships on theprevious day : S.S. Brandon (6,668 tons), outward bound in ballast,torpedoed in convoy off Fastnet. jS.S. Korea (751 tons) mined off Cromer.S.S. Merrow (1,088 tons) mined off Ramsgate.It was suspected. that there had been a second submarineoperating in conjunction with the one off the north-west coast ofScotland which had been sunk by our aircraft. A hunt for thissubmarine was in progress.One of the blockships had been successfully sunk in position inthe North Channel of Scapa Flow.There were rumours emanating from Copenhagen, which hadthe support of the French Naval Attache there, that theDeutschland had reached Germany a few days ago. It waspossible that she had slipped through our patrols in darkness, buton the other hand these rumours might have been put roundintentionally by the Germans to induce us to relax our precautions.There was no more news of the Admiral Scheer.In answer to a question, the Chief of Naval Staff said that areport had been received about a week ago that enemy destroyers had been seen making off at high speed about dawn from theneighbourhood of the Humber. It was possible that they had beenlaying mines, but we had no confirmation that German destroyers were fitted for the laying of magnetic mines. Some of the mineslaid further out from the coasts might well have been laid by destroyers.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 108thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.[20466]b 2
Finland.Invasion by .S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 108thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for War said there was no confirmation of the report that the Russian troops had reachedSumma. So far as was known, the present line in the KarelianIsthmus ran from the mouth of the Vuoksi river, along the southside of the Vuoksi lake, and thence through Kiviniemi andUusikirkko. The Russians were keeping up their pressure north of Lake Ladoga, but there was no confirmation of the report thatthey had cut the railway at Lieksa. According to a Finnish report,there was one Russian army operating in the Karelian Isthmus,and three north of Lake Ladoga up to the Arctic. The latterseemed improbable, however, owing to the inadequacy of the railway facilities to keep such a large force supplied.Little credence was given by the General Staff to the press reports of Finnish casualties from poison gas. It seemed more likely that any such casualties had been caused by high-explosivefumes only. It was difficult, however, to obtain reliable information from Finland.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Balkans.Attitude ofTurkey in theevent ofthreatenedSoviet aggres-sion againstRoumania.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 108thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that at an interview the previous afternoon be had addressed a number of direct questions to M. Numan Menemencioglu, the Secretary-General of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in regard tothe attitude of the Turkish Government towards Roumania in varying circumstances. The questions which he had put and the answers which he had received might be summarised as follows : (i) Question: What would be the attitude of Turkey in theevent of Soviet aggression against Bessarabia ?Answer: The object of Turkey was to avoid takingsides in a dispute between the U.S.S.R. on the one handand the United Kingdom and France on the other. she would not go to war on account of Bessarabia.(ii) Question: Would Turkey consider the seizure ofBessarabia by the U.S.S.R. as an action &quot; for consulta-tion&apos;&apos; under the provisions of the Anglo-turkish treaty ?Answer: This would depend upon the circum-stances of the moment. (The impression given byM. Menemencioglu was that Turkey would only considerthat such Soviet action called for consultation under theTreaty, if the general situation was one likely to lead towar between Turkey and the U.S.S.R.)(iii) Question: Did Turkey expect to be consulted by theU.S.S.R. if the latter decided to seize Bessarabia?Answer: No.(iv) Question: Was the U.S.S.R. likely to continue her attacksouth of Bessarabia ?A answer: Such action could not be excluded. It was likely, however, that the Soviet would not go beyondBessarabia unless they intended to seize the Dardanelles,and were therefore bent on war with Great Britain. Itwas to the obvious interest of Germany to endeavour toembroil the U.S.S.R. with the United Kingdom.(v) Question: What view did Turkey take of the recentrequest of the Roumanian Minister in London thatGreat Britain should make it clear that her guarantee to Roumania covered aggression by the U.S.S.R. as wellas by Germany ?
Answer: This request created a new situation andthe moment for it had been badly chosen. Even if wewere to give such a guarantee, it would not add weight to the security of Roumania.(vi) Question: Was Roumania likely to put up an armeddefence for Bessarabia ?Answer: Roumania&apos;&apos;s resistance would be likely tobe perfunctory if she thought that Soviet aggressionwould be confined to Bessarabia. If, however, shebelieved that the Soviet had more extensive designs,Roumania would resist to the utmost of her power.(vii) Question:  What would be the attitude of Turkey if theU.S.S.R. went beyond the mouths of the Danube?Answer: The decision to be taken by Turkey inthat event would depend largely upon the attitude of bulgaria, but in principle she would regard such action by the U.S.S.R. as a threat to the vital interests ofTurkey., (It was clear from the above reply that turkey would in all circumstances defend the Straits.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in thelight of the information so obtained as regards the attitude ofTurkey, he proposed to address a telegram to His Majesty&apos;minister. Bucharest, so that it might be in his hands before the arrival there of M. Tilea on the following Monday. It would,however, be necessary first to consult the French Government. Thegeneral lines of the proposed telegram would be as follows : His Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful considera-tion to the proposal made on the 7th December, 1939, with greatemphasis and urgency by M. Tilea, the Roumanian minister in London, that His Majesty&apos;s Government (and presumablyalso the French Government) should state publicly that theguarantee already given to Roumania applies to aggression bythe U.S.S.R. as well as to aggression by Germany. A public statement of this kind would extend the scope of the presentobligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the FrenchGovernment, and it is therefore necessary for both governments to consider whether they are in a position to carry out such further obligations. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel thegreatest sympathy for Roumania in her present difficult situation, and they would greatly deplore it if, in the absenceof a categorical guarantee by ourselves and the French Govern-ment of assistance against Soviet aggression, Roumania wereto appeal to Germany for assistance. Roumania should realise that, if Germany were to give her support, she wouldmake her pay dearly for it in the long run. Moreover,Germany would without hesitation abandon Roumania at anytime as part of a bargain with the U.S.S.R. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have closely examined the circumstances in whichit might be possible for them to give a guarantee such as thatasked for by the Roumanian Government, and, in the light ofthe political and strategical situation, they have reached theconclusion that they could do so only if they were assured both that Turkey would go to the assistance of Roumania and alsothat Italy would co-operate in such a policy. At the presenttime, His Majesty&apos;s Government have no reason to suppose that these conditions would be satisfied. It is possible that theRoumanian Government may themselves have made an approach to Turkey and Italy, and, if so, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be glad to learn the nature of the repliesreceived.   If both Turkey and Italy were prepared to declare
war against the U.S.S.R. in the event of aggression againstRoumania, a new situation would be created, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would at once consider, in consultation with theFrench Government, how they could themselves render aid to roumania. Unless and until such a situation arose, aguarantee by Great Britain of the kind asked for would merelyraise false&quot; hopes. It was doubtful also whether such aguarantee would have a deterrent effect upon the U.S.S.R. ifthey had already decided to seize Bessarabia.The Prime Minister said that the draft reply contemplated no action by ourselves unless Italy as well as Turkey were preparedactively to co-operate. It did not deal with the situation whichwould &quot;arise if Italian neutrality were assured, if active assistance by Turkey were forthcoming, and if the Soviet carried theiraggression beyond the mouths of the Danube.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that thedraft reply should be modified in this respect and should make itclear that we should consider that a new situation had arisen ifTurkey were to go to war with the U.S.S.R. in support of Roumania,and if, at the same time, we were assured of Italian neutrality.The Chancellor of the Exchequer inquired whether, in view ofthe discussions to be held on the following Monday (11th December,1939) between the British and French Chiefs of Staff in regard to... General Weygand&apos;s plans in the Balkans, it was likely that theFrench Government would before that meeting express an opinon as to the communication to be sent to Bucharest.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that theFrench Government might take this attitude.   In that event itwould be necessary to send some interim reply to Sir ReginaldHoare for transmission to M. Tilea on his arrival at Bucharest.Turkish attitude        The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadtowards    ,      discussed also with M. Numan Menemencioglu the attitude of theBulgaria. Turkish Government towards Bulgaria.   M. Menemencioglu had agreed that, in view of the recent mutual withdrawal of troops from the Turco-Bulgarian frontier, it would be of advantage togo one step further and to embody this arrangement in an exchangeof Notes between Turkey and Bulgaria. He had also expressed himself favourably disposed towards a suggestion that the frontierwithdrawals should be followed up by an agreement by whichBulgaria would undertake to consult with Turkey, if she were toreceive threatening demands from the U.S.S.R. In general,M. Menemencioglu was of the opinion that, if the U.S.S.R. haddesigns on the Straits, she would require for her security thehinterland of Bulgaria and would certainly seize it, whether ornot in the meanwhile she made some temporary arrangement with bulgaria.Turkish attitude On the subject of Italy M. Menemencioglu had said that Turkey: towards Italy. would welcome rather than dislike the participation of Italy inthe formation of a neutral Balkan bloc, but he felt that Italianinclinations should be allowed to show themselves in this direction,and should not be pushed. This was also Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s view.At the time of the seizure of Albania, Italy had been regarded by turkey as a potential disturber of the peace of the Balkans, butmatters had changed since the development of the Soviet threat,and Italy was now regarded as more interested in securing thetranquillity of the Balkans than in disturbing the peace.The War Cabinet agreed : (a) that subject to (b) below, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should address a telegram to His Majesty&apos;minister, Bucharest,  on the lines indicated by the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the discussion as summarised above, subject to the incorporationtherein of the amendment suggested by the PrimeMinister;(b) that prior to the despatch of the telegram referred to in(a) above, the concurrence of the French Governmentshould be obtained and that, if this were not possible before Monday, the 11th December, 1939 (the date onwhich M. Tilea was due to arrive in Bucharest), atelegram in general terms only should be sent to HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Bucharest.Turkey. q    In connection with the discussion recorded in Minute 5Result of visit above, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that at anto London of interview the previous afternoon, M. Numan Menemencioglu, theM. Numan Secretary-General of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, hadMenemencioglu. expressed the keenest regret at having failed in his visit to London(Previous to secure the objects which he had most at heart.   ImmediatelyReference: prior to that interview he (the Secretary of State) had received aW.M. (39) 99th message from the Chiefs of Staff Committee on the progress of conclusions, discussions in regard to the supply of armaments and had alsoMinute 10.) had a short talk with Mr. Waley of the Treasury in regard to thefinancial and commercial discussions. In the light of the informa-tion so obtained, he had begged M. Menemencioglu not to take toogloomy a view, and had said that he was not entirely without hopethat both in regard to the subject of armaments and on the financialand commercial issues, it might be possible to make some further progress before he (M. Menemencioglu) left London. M. Menemen-cioglu had assured the Secretary of State that his failure tosecure definite results through his visit in no way affected thegeneral attitude of Turkey towards us. Turkey was very happy to have established so complete a general accord of views with thiscountry. The same afternoon M. Menemencioglu had paid a callon Sir Alexander Cadogan, who had gained the impression thatthe latter still did not exclude the possibility that he might beable to initial some agreement before leaving London.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled a preliminary discussion as to whether we should make an agreementwith the French Government by which we and they bound ourselvesnot to make a separate peace with Germany. When he had firstdiscussed this matter with Sir Eric Phipps (our former ambassador in Paris), the latter had felt that a proposal by us on these linesmight be embarrassing to the French Government, and M. Corbinhad also been non-committal on the subject.The Foreign Secretary said that, having again considered thematter, he now thought that such an agreement would be of value.In a sense, the matter was academic, since the French and ourselveswere bound to stand by one another. Such an agreement would,however, be useful from the point of view of anti-German propa-ganda. The only difficulty which he foresaw was that it might be embarrassing to the French Government in dealing with their internal political situation. He was, however, inclined to recom-mend that we should put the question to the French Government.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that such an agree-ment would have added value if announced on the morrow of some definite event, and that it might lose some of its effect if announced during the present period of inactivity.France.Proposed Anglo-French agree-ment against aseparate peace.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 107thConclusions, VMinute 12.)
The Lord Privy Seal thought that New Year&apos;s Day might be asuitable occasion for announcing such an agreement, and suggestedthat the Prime Minister might raise the matter with M. Daladier.The War Cabinet agreed : That the Prime Minister should ascertain fromM. Daladier : (i) whether the French Government would be favourably disposed to making a formal agreement by whichthe British and French Governments would eachbind themselves not to make a separate peace withGermany;(ii) if so, when, in their opinion, would be the best moment to announce such an agreement.U.S.S.R. 8.   The Minister without Portfolio drew attention to a GermanAlleged giant of broadcast in English to this country on the 3rd December (reportedtransit facili- in Daily Summary No. 78 prepared by the Ministry of Information)ties between to the effect that goods traffic between Germany and Roumania viaGermany and former Polish territory now occupied by the U.S.S.R. was beingRoumania,        resumed that day.The War Cabinet agreed- That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should address a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Bucharest,asking him to ascertain whether in fact communication between Germany and Roumania had now been resumedvia Polish territory now occupied by the U.S.S.R.United States ofAmerica.Proposed Anglo-Americanexchange ofinformationregarding mili-tary and navaldevices.9. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had beeninformed by the United States Naval Attache that the United StatesAdmiralty were anxious to be furnished with particulars of ourasdic methods of submarine detection, and, for their part, were willing to give us particulars of their own weapons for dealing withthe same danger. We believed that they had no weapons of specialvalue for this purpose. Mr. Joseph Kennedy, the United states ambassador in London, now in America, had been informed thatwe should be prepared to give the United States particulars of ourAsdic in return for their special bomber sight. He proposed,therefore, to make no reply to the United States Naval Attache forthe time being.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.AircraftSupplies.Proposals for purchase in italy and theUnited States.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 74thConclusions,Minute 5.)Purchases in italy.10. The Secretary of State for Air put before the War cabinet certain proposals, for which he desired authority, for the purchaseof aircraft in the United States.He first reported the stage reached in the negotiations for thepurchase of aircraft in Italy. Further information was beingawaited before final decisions could be taken, but the Italians wereoptimistic as to what they could supply and as to dates for delivery.The sum of  6 millions in respect of aircraft had been includedin the estimate recently conveyed to the Italian Government of 20 millions for probable British purchases of all kinds in Italy
(Previous during 1940.   As soon as full information was available, he would reference:        report further to the War Cabinet.W.M. (39) 108thConclusions,Minute 8.)Purchases inthe U.S.A.XA continuation order had already been placed for 600 Harvardtrainer aircraft, which would be used both in this country and inCanada for the Air Training Scheme. The cost would be$22^ millions and deliveries would start with small numbers inMay 1940, rising to 25 in August and 50 a month thereafter. Over300 machines of this type (not included in the 600 mentioned) hadalready been delivered to the RAP. and had given satisfaction.A continuation order had also been placed for 200 LockheedHudson (General Reconnaissance) aircraft to cost $20 millions.Delivery would be from February to October 1940. This type of machine was already doing valuable work in the Coastal command and had proved itself an excellent aircraft.An improved type of Hudson (Lockheed 32a) would be in production next Summer with more powerful engines, which wouldgive it a maximum speed of 311 miles per hour as against the246 miles per hour of the present model. An option had alreadybeen taken on the first 200 of these machines, and it was proposedto confirm the order at a cost of  30 millions. Delivery would begin in June 1940, at the rate of 20 a month.It was proposed to order 50 P.B.Y. 4 long-range flying-boats ata cost of $85 millions. One boat of this type was already givingsatisfactory service with the Coastal Command. Delivery would run from August 1940 to March 1941.Subject to confirmation of early delivery, it was proposed to order 120 &quot; Republic &quot; fighters at a cost of f 7J millions. these would have a speed at critical altitude of 320 miles per hour.Delivery would run from May to December 1940.Finally, it was proposed to order 300 Douglas A. 20 light&quot; attack &quot; bombers, which would be particularly valuable in helping to meet Army requirements, at a cost of $21-6 millions. Deliverywould begin 14 months from the date of the&apos;contract and wouldthen be rapid.Information was being obtained as to the possibility of securingsupplies of Curtiss Hawk fighters, and unless the French were making extended use of this type of machine, it might be desiredto place an order.The purpose of placing these American orders was to provideus with much needed equipment in 1940-41, and to provide againstthe risk that production in this country might be impeded by thedestruction of our aircraft factories.The Chief of the Air Staff explained that the flying-boatfactory at Rochester was peculiarly vulnerable, and that productionof flying-boats was being delayed because a new type which wasbeing produced had failed.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air said that the totalcost of orders for aircraft in the U.S.A. placed and contemplated would thus be approximately $110 millions, which would be inaddition to the even larger sums required for machine tools and materials for the production of aircraft in this country, and to our requirements in Canadian dollars. He had discussed the formidablefinancial problem which this presented with the Chancellor of theExchequer, who had agreed to tihe orders being placed as contem-piated, subject to the assurance which he (the Secretary of Statefor Air) was very ready to give, that he would examine very carefully the dollar requirements of the Air Ministry for machine tools and raw materials in connection with the programme for bringing our rate of production up to 2,550 machines per month,[20466] c
and that he would postpone entering into any commitments forthese materials for so long as was consistent with the due executionof that programme. t. &apos;He had also consulted the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,who agreed with the proposals from the Foreign Office point of view.In regard to co-operation with the French in purchases in theUnited States, the Secretary of State for Air explained that theFrench had placed their order for Curtiss fighter aeroplanes without consultation with us, and that they were very largely interested inthe purchase of engines. He wanted authority to proceed at once with placing the orders which he had mentioned, as considerable delay would be involved in using the joint purchasing machinery.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his record of inter-departmental discussions showed a proposed purchase of 120Douglas aircraft and a consequent reduction in the total sumproposed to be spent; but that, subject to the clearing up of thispoint, he agreed with the proposals as described by the Secretary ofState for Air. There were obvious disadvantages in purchasing the completed article from America, as distinct from buying tools andraw materials, as this meant that we were paying out dollars for american labour and also that at the finish, when the aircraft hadbeen worn out, we had nothing to show for our expenditure. he must also remind the War Cabinet of the very serious dollar position(Previous with which the country was faced.   When they had first consideredReference: what was involved in accepting the programme of producing 2,550W.M. (39) 23rd aircraft per month and maintaining 55 divisions, he had found it conclusions, necessary to point out that this might well involve us in very seriousMinute 6.) difficulties in regard to dollar exchange by the end of the second year of the war. Under that programme he had contemplated an expenditure of $200 millions in the United States of America onmachine tools and raw materials. We now had to face an additional expenditure of $ 110 millions for the purchase of aircraft, and had also to carry the burden of the Canadian Air Training Scheme.We were thus faced with an extremely difficult task. He had beenvery glad to receive an assurance from the Secretary of State forAir that he very much hoped to secure some reduction in the rate at which dollar expenditure would be incurred for machine tools and raw materials for the long-range production programme, andon this understanding he was prepared to recommend the acceptanceof the proposals now put forward.The First Lord of the Admiralty stressed the very gi*eatadvantages from the point of view of naval operations of securingthe earliest possible delivery of the long-range flying boats which itwas proposed to buy in the United States of America.The Prime Minister said that, as the Chancellor of theExchequer advised acceptance, he imagined that the War cabinet would be ready to approve the proposals put forward by theSecretary of State for Air, despite the serious strain on our dollar resources which they would involve. What weighed particularly with him was that purchase of these aircraft might help to shorten the war. In that event we might not have to complete the purchaseof the machine tools, &amp;o, contemplated under the long-rangeprogramme. Further, an. indefinite increase in our capacity for producing war materials would prove an embarrassment after thewar; VThe War Cabinet :-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to report to theWar Cabinet regarding the placing of orders for thesupply of aircraft from Italy, as soon as the necessary information was available..
(ii) Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for air to place orders in the United States for the supply of aircraft as set out at &quot;X&quot; above, subject to thefollowing : (a) that the Chancellor of the Exchequer  and theSecretary of State for Air should consider further the number of Douglas aircraft to be included inthe order;(b) the assurance given by the Secretary of State for Airthat he would examine the dollar requirementsof the Air Ministry for machine tools and rawmaterials, and would do his utmost to ensure that,in planning the long-range programme of 2,550aircraft a month, commitments were postponed for so long as was consistent with the dueexecution of that programme.aircraft production.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 74thConclusions,Minute 5.)11. In the course of the discussion on Minute 10, reference was made to the position in regard to aircraft production in thiscountry.The Secretary of State for Air gave the War Cabinet certainparticulars in regard to our production and the French production.The discussion on this matter is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet (i) Took note of the statement made by the Secretary of Statefor Air.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to include in his nextquarterly statement a comparison between the Britishand French figures of aircraft production, together withan estimate of the production which the French were likely to attain by the Spring of 1940.War cabinet arrangements.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 8thConclusions,Minute 18.)12. The Prime Minister outlined to his colleagues certainrevised arrangements in regard to Meetings of the War Cabinet atthe week-ends, arrangements for Meetings during the christmas recess, and arrangements in regard to War Cabinet businessgenerally.These proposals met with the general approval of the WarCabinet, and the Prime Minister undertook to circulate aMemorandum setting out the revised arrangements.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 9, 1939.
