The Secretary of State for Air said that a standing patrolSituation. had been maintained over the German mine-laying aircraft bases at(Previous Borkum, Norderney and Sylt from 4 p.m. to midnight the previous reference: night.W.M. (39) 112th        Eight   Whitleys   were   employed,    relieving   each   otherConclusions,      successively, and spending two hours each over the objective.Minutes l At Borkum the base was found active, and lights were on in and 2.) the harbour and its vicinity.   Three bombs were dropped by thefirst aircraft, and four by the second, among the lights in the harbour, which would be used by aircraft in taking off.There was no activity at Norderney.At Sylt three bombs were dropped on the flare paths atHornum and Rantum seaplane bases. Our aircraft, which flew ata very low height, were heavily engaged by pompoms and machine-gun fire, but, although one was slightly damaged in the wing, thei&apos;ewere no casualties.As a result of this operation, it was believed that no mine-layingtook place during the night.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 112thConclusions,Minute 3.)(previous reference:W.M. (39) 109thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet of certain fleet dispositions.The following ships had been sunk :  The King Egbert (4,535 tons), carrying coal from the Tyneto Constanza, mined off Happisburgh lightship.The Marwick Head (496 tons) mined off Yarmouth.The Lord Lloyd, an armed trawler, had attacked a german submarine near the Kentish Knock lightship with promising results.Attacks had also been made by destroyers on the submarinewhich it was believed had crossed the Loop at Plymouth, but therehad been no definite result.The Dover barrage had now been completed with the laying ofthe minefield off Folkestone.There had been a report that the Deutschland had passed through the Kiel Canal, in a westerly direction, on the 4th December.Precautions were nevertheless being maintained in the Atlantic.There was a report of a force of German small craft movingWest, off the coast of Holland, and steps were being takenaccordingA.One aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm had struck a barrage balloonwire near Southampton and had crashed, with the loss of four lives.A merchant ship of 7,000 tons, steamship Eumceus, wasstranded off Dublin, and efforts were being made to get her off.A report had been received that two German submarines hadbeen seen, late at night, alongside a German merchant vessel inVigo harbour. Details of this report would be forwarded to theForeign Office, so that representations could be made to the SpanishGovernment.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Tne 3.   The Prime Minister referred to the criticism in the morningS.S. Bremen. papers of the escape of the Bremen, and of the refusal of the(Previous Admiralty to give any further details.    The similarity of the reference: attacks in the different papers indicated that the press had agreedW.M. (39) 112th among themselves to press for further information on specific points.Conclusions, Although the criticism was unfair, he thought that it would be minute 3.) difficult to leave the matter as it stood.   There was considerable[20488]b 2
ignorance about the rules of warfare, and he thought it would bedesirable to issue a fuller explanation than had up to the presentbeen given as to why the Bremen had not been stopped.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that, unless theBremen had been armed as an armed merchant cruiser, which, asfar as they knew, she had not, the submarine was debarred fromtorpedoing her. This prohibition applied, even if the Bremen weredefensively armed. The submarine would be quite unable to detectthe presence of guns on board, and, therefore, could only have proceeded by coming to the surface, and trying to stop the shipby firing across its bows. The submarine was, however, in enemy waters, and such a proceeding would have been impracticable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the general public, as a whole, were unaware of the facts, and were puzzled toknow wiry the submarine had not torpedoed the Bremen as shepassed.   He thought a further explanation would be very useful.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thought it wouldbe wise to emphasise that the submarine was acting under generalorders. This would dispose of suggestions that it had refrained from torpedoing the Bremen out of fear of attack by German air-craft. If the Bremen had been torpedoed, it would have given theGermans justification for the whole of their submarine campaign.He thought that, if a further explanation of the incident weregiven, the opportunity should be taken to link it up, and drawcomparisons, with the brutal methods of sea warfare employed bythe Germans.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed, but thought that itwould be unwise to base our explanation on the idea that we wouldnot descend to the methods employed by the Germans, as we mightlater on be driven to do so in other directions.The Secretary of State for War thought that we were not making nearly enough capital out of the ruthless behaviour of theGermans towards our own and neutral shipping. We ought tobuild up our case continually, both in our own country and abroad,so that when we decided to take any retaliatory measures theywould be regarded on all sides as a logical outcome of the Germanbehaviour. As things stood at present, we had allowed the public,and the world in general, to assume that the German methods of warfare were normal, and only to be expected, whereas we oughtto drive it home continually that they were contrary to internationallaw, and barbarous. The attack on the Yorkshire, for example, inthe course of which the submarine Commander had taunted the survivors in their boats, had been allowed to pass almost unnoticed.We should only get the world to adopt our view by ceaseless repetitive-tion of the facts.The War Cabinet agreed :  To invite the First Lord of the Admiralty to issue a further statement to the Press, dealing with the escape of theBremen, explaining that the British submarine was acting under general orders issued by the Admiralty for the observance of international law, and drawing comparisonsbetween our own behaviour at sea, and that of the Germans
MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 112thConclusions,Minute 4.)WeeklyReports.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 105thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report on the Western Front.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.5. The War Cabinet took note of Weekly Reports by the secretaries of State for War and Air (W.P. (39) 156 and 154).Finland. g    j&quot;he Secretary of State for War reported that the RussiansInvasion by had carried out heavy attacks in the Karelian Isthmus, but hadU.S.S.R. suffered severe losses.   It was reported that the Russian aircraft(Previous were machine-gunning their own troops to prevent them retiring.Reference:        Their main effort had been directed in the neighbourhood of Taipale.W.M. (39) 112th Three chemical battalions were said to be operating on this front.Conclusions,      North of Lake Ladoga the Finns claimed to have made importantMinute 5.)        captures of material at Tolvajaeiwi.   The Finns were also reportedto have bombed the Murmansk railway.   There was no confirmation of the report in the Times of a serious Finnish reverse west ofSuomussalmi.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the russian advance towards the Gulf of Bothnia was unlikely to affectoperations in the Karelian Isthmus, though it might possibly cut the railway communication to Sweden. Conditions in Finland atthe present time were extremely difficult for military operations.Movement, except on skis, was practically impossible, and theRussians were not trained to work on skis. Deep snow would stop the use of tanks. The very low temperature made even the operationof automatic weapons very difficult.Supply of The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to munitions. telegram No. 345 from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Oslo. The(Previous Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs had stated that, accordingReference:        to the German Minister, the German blockade against the UnitedW.M. (39) 112th Kingdom and France was not intended to apply to traffic to Finland,Conclusions,      at least so far as traffic overland via Norway was concerned.Minute 5.) The War Cabinet was informed that the arrangements for the shipment of the 20 Gladiator aircraft were proceeding satisfactorily.They were to be routed through Bergen. The possibility of sendingmore aircraft to Finland was discussed, and it was suggested thatobsolete aircraft would be of some value, in view of the inefficiencyof the Russian Air Force, even though the performance of suchaircraft was below that of the Russians. Very vulnerable targetsalmost certainly existed in the large Russian concentrations in theKarelian Isthmus.The Secretary of State for Air undertook to examine what couldbe done in this matter.The War Cabinet :-(1) Took note of this discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to examine thesuggestion that obsolete aircraft should be supplied to finland.
scandinavian countries.possible developments.(previous reference:WM. (39) 112thConclusions,Minute 11.)7. In connection with the preceding Minute the Secretary ofState for Foreign A fairs drew attention to the following telegramson the subject of German collaboration with Russia in the invasion of Finland : Oslo Telegram No. 346, in which the Norwegian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs was reported to have expressed his conviction that Russia was not acting in collusion withGermany as regards Finland, but that their negotiations had referred only to the Baltic States. He did not anticipate a russian movement against Norway, and had been informed bythe German Minister that if the Russians did invade eitherNorway or Sweden, Germany would not adopt a passiveattitude.Stockholm Telegram No. 221, in which a well-informedSwedish industrialist was reported to have said that Swedenwould probably give the fullest possible support to Finland,though not necessarily by a formal declaration of war against russia. In this event he thought Germany would not intervene in Sweden, but if the Russians penetrated beyond Finland,Germany would occupy Southern Scandinavia.The view was expressed that, if the Russians penetrated intoNorthern Scandinavia, a partition of the whole territory between russia and Germany on the Polish model was very likely. On theother hand, it would be to our advantage if we could obtain a foot-hold on the Norwegian coast. There seemed little chance of the scandinavian countries combining to intervene actively on the sideof Finland in view of their overwhelming fear of Germany. Thebest chance of inducing them to do so would lie in doing what wecould ourselves to help Finland.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.DominionAir training scheme.Formation and financing of squadrons ofthe RoyalCanadianAir Force.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G.) (39) 148), submitting draft telegrams for transmission to the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner in Canada for the guidance of Lord Riverdale and the HighCommissioner in negotiation with the Canadian Government.The Chancellor of the Exchecpi,er explained that in telegramNo. 810 of the 9th December we had been asked to accept theprinciple that Canadian personnel trained under the Scheme should,on the request of the Canadian Government, be organised into unitsof the Royal Canadian Air Force for service in the field.It would be easy to arrange that any Dominion personneltrained under the Scheme should at once carry some emblemdistinctive of the Dominion from which they came; and it wouldalso be easy to organise Royal Air Force squadrons at a later stagecomposed entirely of Canadian pilots; but the further proposal thatthe trained pilots of Canadian origin should be used to formsquadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force raised two difficulties.First, the Canadians could not provide ground staff for the squadrons concerned and serious administrative difficulties wouldresult if a squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force were to be organised with ground staff from the United Kingdom; the same principle would also have to be conceded to the other Dominions, andin the result more than 50 per cent, of the squadrons of the RoyalAir Force would be called Dominion squadrons, because their pilotswere of Dominion origin, although by far the greater part of theirpersonnel would be from the United Kingdom. The seconddifficulty was financial; we could not ask the Canadian Governmentto carry any larger burden of Air Force expenditure than was
involved in their expenditure of 350 million dollars over three years on the Air Training Scheme. On the other hand, we could not abandon the principle that a Dominion unit must be paid for bythe Dominion concerned.To meet these two difficulties a scheme had been worked outwhich was summarised in the draft telegrams appended to his memorandum. It was calculated that the expenditure which canada contemplated incurring on account of the Training scheme would be roughly equivalent to the cost of equipping and maintain-ing 15 squadrons (this did not include the excess expenditure involved in the payment of Canadian as distinct from British ratesof pay, but Canada had already agreed to bear this in any case),It was, therefore, proposed to organise this number of royal canadian Air Force Squadrons with Canadian pilots trained underthe Air Training Scheme and that Canada should also provide theground personnel for these squadrons, either sending them here for training or releasing them from the Air Training Scheme astrained men were sent from here to replace them. This could besecured without any undue drain on United Kingdom man-power.The United Kingdom Government would actually provide thepounds or francs for expenditure on these 15 squadrons in thiscountry or in France, but they would be treated as if they werebeing paid for by the Canadian Government, because of theexpenditure that that Government was incurring on account of theAir Training Scheme for the benefit not only of their own pilots,but also of those from other parts of the Empire. This would preserve the principle that Dominion units should be paid for bythe Dominion concerned.The Secretary of State for Air and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs said that they concurred in these proposals.The War Cabinet agreed : To approve the proposals set out in the Memorandum,&quot;W.P. (G.) (39) 148, in regard to the formation of unitsof the Royal Canadian Air Force and the consequentialfinancial arrangements, and authorised the despatch oftwo telegrams to the United Kingdom High commissioner in Ottawa as in the drafts annexed to that Memorandum.Far eastern situation.(previous reference erences:W.M. (39) 96thConclusions,Minute 8, and104thConclusions,Minute 11.)Sino-JapaneseMilitarySituation,December1939.9. The War Cabinet had under consideration an appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff on the present Sino-Japanese MilitarySituation (W.P. (39) 152), which was introduced by the Chief ofNaval Staff.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressed his&apos;agreement with the conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff from thepolitical aspect. In particular, he shared their view that noarrangement between Russia and Japan was likely to free anysubstantial portion of the forces which Japan maintained in manchuria and Korea and in Inner Mongolia. He referred to recent telegrams (Nos. 871, 872 and 883) which had been receivedfrom His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington setting out theviews of the United States Government. He had also recently hada conversation with the Australian High Commissioner in london on the Far Eastern situation in which these telegrams had beendiscussed. No doubt Mr. Bruce would keep his Government fully informed of the situation. The United States Government agreed with our view that any substantial measure of agreement between russia and Japan was improbable owing to the fundamental clashof interests between the two nations; but it was worth noting thatthe conclusion of any such agreement would put Wang Ching Wei,the head of the Japanese puppet Government, completely out of
court, since his leadership was based primarily on his opposition toCommunism.The War Cabinet Took note of the Appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff onthe present Sino-Japanese Military Situation (W.P.(39) 152).Seizure ofEnemyExports.The case ofthe S.S.Sanyo Mara.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 112thConclusions,Minute 8.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thesteamship Sanyo Ma.ru was still at Rotterdam and would no doubtremain there until further orders were received from the JapaneseEmbassy in London, as a result of the representation which theyhad made to us that this ship should be exempt from control. TheSecretary of State gave the War Cabinet certain particularsreceived from a secret source in regard to the cargo of this vessel.The circumstances of this case were certainly suspicious, but he asked that the War Cabinet should not reach a decision until all the relevant information was available.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Germany.Probablemilitaryintentions.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 101stConclusions,Minute 9.)supreme war Council:proposed meeting.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 107thConclusions,Minute 8.)Balkans and theMiddle East.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 112thConclusions,Minute 6.)11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet particulars received from a very secret source regarding&quot;the possible development of German policy. Particulars of theinformation in question are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.12. The Prime Minister said that it had been his intention that, if the discussions between the Chiefs of Staff and general gamelin in regard to the Balkans proved difficult, a meeting of theSupreme War Council should be held at the close of his forthcoming visit to the Western Front. It appeared, however, from thepreliminary statement made by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff at a meeting of the War Cabinet on the previous day, thatno fundamental divergence of view had emerged during the discus-sions between the Chiefs of Staff.The First Lord of the Admiralty considered that it would bea wasted opportunity if no meeting of the Supreme War council were held during the Prime Ministers visit to France.General agreement was expressed in regard to the desirabilityof such a meeting.The Prime Minister agreed with the views expressed. He con-sidered that there should be a general tour d&apos;horizon both ofmilitary and political subjects, and he hoped, therefore, that itwould be possible both for the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence and for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to be present at the meeting.The War Cabinet agreed : That arrangements should be made for a meeting of theSupreme War Council to be held in Paris early in thefollowing week, at which this country would be represented by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 13, 1939.
