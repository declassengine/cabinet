The Shipping Position. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 78th Conclusions, Minute 10, and 88rd Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The War Cabinet had before them the following Memoranda relating to the shipping position:-

Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping on the Present Causes of Delays to Shipping (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 86).

Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 95).

Note by the Minister of Shipping giving an Analysis of Importing Capacity. (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 89).

The Minister of Shipping stated that the shipping difficulties experienced at the outset of the war were gradually being overcome, and the First Lord of the Admiralty had been most helpful in regard to the hastening up of convoys and other matters. Nevertheless, the present position was not a happy one. The demands of Departments were very great and could not be met quickly. 11 million tons of good would have to be imported in foreign vessels, if the suggested programme of 47 million tons for the first year of war was to be realised. He hoped that the Norwegian Agreement would be ratified the following week. Under this Agreement, the Norwegians undertook to find 200,000 tons of shipping by the end of the following March.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had made arrangements for daily East Coast convoys and for a faster convoy from Gibraltar. Instructions had also been issued in regard to the relaxing of unnecessary restrictions, and the Admiralty were taking all possible steps to ease the position.

Some discussion ensued as to the form of the analysis of importing capacity given in the Minister&apos;s Paper, W.P.(G.) (39) 89.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he would have expected the analysis to start from the different types of tonnage (liner, tramp, tanker, &amp;c.), available to us from all British and foreign sources. On this basis a calculation could have been built up of the total carrying capacity at our disposal. Instead, however, the Memorandum began by stating that our normal import programme of 59 million tons weight could be reduced to 47 million tons weight. The reasons for this reduction were not given. Again, the figure of 11 million tons, given on page 3 as the total import to this country in the next 10 months in foreign ships, was a residual figure obtained by deducting, from the total imports required in the next 10 months the amount of such imports to be imported in British vessels. While the position in the next few months would be pretty tight, there could be no question of our being starved into surrender, and he would have preferred to have seen a longer view taken, and a plan built up covering the next year&apos;s shipping operations.

Sir Cyril Hurcomb explained that the method chosen had been to take a normal year, in which our import programme was of about 59 million tons weight, and to examine that total in the light of the more important war-time considerations; e.g., the necessity for conserving our available resources in gold and foreign exchange. On a number of assumptions a 20 per cent. cut, yielding a figure of 47 million tons weight per annum, had not been thought unreasonable. If such a programme could be achieved, this country would not go short of anything essential to the efficient conduct of the war. The amount of British tonnage available had been calculated, but it was necessary to assume some proportion of normal imports by neutral ships. He emphasised the provisional character of any estimate made at the stage. As the war progressed, date of the kind suggested by the First Lord would become available and a more complete picture could be drawn.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was inclined to ? with the manner in which the Ministry of Shipping had


ration, -that &quot;figure^challenge the figure aHotted $^hiPI. ....   -The Minister that his Departmtehtcould manage oh the 19 * 8 million tons allocated to &quot;them. &quot; &quot;Turning to. page, 3 of the Memoraiid^Exchequer said that the fact that our imports in September and october had been ho more than 5,niillioh; tons seemed to him tojustify the calculations which followed. After two months&apos;experience of war, we had found ourselves nearly 3 million tons&quot;behind the clock.&quot; ,The Prime Minister entirely agreed with this view. Theessential thing was to get 42 million tons of imports into the country during the next ten months.; He did not think there was any need to question the assumption on which the Departments&apos; figures hadbeen based. The Departments would naturally be only too glad ifthe first year&apos;s actual figures exceeded 47 million tons. In practice,however, there was likely to be great; difficulty in reaching such a figure.   :Among the points to which attention was called in theremaining course of the discussion were the following: (1) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a comb-but hadbeen carried out of the shipping requisitioned by theAdmiralty. As soon as barges could be made available,he hoped to release certain ships in Alexandria harbour and Devonport, now used for storing ammunition. Hewas also considering whether he could release a numberof the cargo ships now in use as armed merchant cruisers, and was trying, to make some reduction in hisdemands on cargo shipping.(2) The War Cabinet were reminded that appreciable reliefhad been given to the tanker position in 1917: hyimporting oil in the double bottoms of &quot;ships.   Thequestion was now under consideration whether this method could again&apos; be employed:   The last 20 years,however,^ had seen the introduction of new methods of constructing hulls, and it. was not certain that theproposal would now be practicable.- (3) The question was raised whether&apos; some relaxation could beallowed in the Plimsoll line requirements.   The WarCabinet were&apos;&apos;:&apos;&apos;&apos;ihfo&apos;rm^;:lui hat this matter was nowgoverned by an International Cbhvention, but it was thought that it should be possible to obtain some-. easement in this matter, at any rate, as regards voyages;-;:;:GJitt;safe..waters. -had, of cdnrce, very liLS:; e &apos; yyo cyaco, tact some o ^normally czzL&apos;zlzrje.1 on ,3lie Jndiati&apos;&apos;and.

(5) Foreign owners and foreign seamen were reluctant to come to belligerent ports. This imposed an additional handicap on the chartering of neutral tonnage. Pressure might have to be applied to the Governments concerned if we were to secure our tonnage requirements. An alternative method would be to hold out inducements to foreign owners, e.g., specially favourable rates of insurance.

(6) Italian ships were arriving in ballast. It was a somewhat difficult political question whether effective pressure could be applied to the Italian Government in order to induce them to send their ships with cargo. The fact that the Minister of Supply was negotiating certain purchases in Italy at the present time might be a useful lever in our hands. A representative of the Ministry of Shipping was in Rome at the present time. His negotiations with the Italian Departments were being conducted in conjunction with the French.

The Minister of Economic Warfare said that he was anxious to obtain the use of Italian shipping for cargoes of iron-ore from Northern Spain.

(7) Considerable difficulty was being experienced in the chartering of Greek tonnage. A good deal of Greek shipping was now trading on safer routes, but greek ships were still available from time to time on the market for chartering. In the preceding week 11 Greek ships had been on the market. In general, Greek owners were asking higher rates than the Ministry of Shipping were prepared to approve. The Ministry of Shipping&apos;s maximum rate was now 60s. In addition to this, the Greek owners could not be induced to offer firm rates. This fact remained that other countries, including Eire, were prepared to pay higher rates than we thought right, and were securing the ships.

It was believed that the Greek Government were encouraging their shipowners to demand high rates, in the hope of increasing their taxation yield.

(8) A suggestion was made that, as in the last war, British ships trading between foreign ports should be diverted to our own service.

The Minister of Food suggested that discretion might be given to his Department to charter ships at prices slightly above the official rate.

Discussion ensued as to whether pressure could be put on the Greek Government to give us " most-favoured-nation" terms. Reference was made to a report from our Ambassador at Athens that the position of Greece in regard to foreign exchange was well-nigh desperate. The War Cabinet were informed that a proposal was under discussion in the Foreign Office under which this country would make "political" purchases in Greece to the value of some £3 million. The scheme for purchasing Greek tobacco had also been revived, although there was little prospect that such tobacco could find a market in the country.

It was argued that it was unreasonable that we should confer these benefits on Greece without securing our own desiderata in return.

The War Cabinet invited the Minister of Shipping:-

(a) To examine in the light of the above discussion, what further steps could be taken to ameliorate the shipping position, and to report again to the War Cabinet.

(39) 83rdConclusions,Minute 1.)The available supply of feeding-stuffs.Publicannouneementof the position.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by a Meetingof Ministers, submitting proposals on the policy to be adoptedregarding feeding stuffs for livestock, together with a draft announcement on the subject to be made by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland(Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 97).The Minister of Food said that he and his colleagues, after considering the matter in the light of the latest information as tothe Shipping position, had concluded, as explained in the openingparagraphs of their Memorandum, that the supply of imported feeding stuffs for the rest of the winter season would only be halfof normal requirements. Subject to a reservation on two specific points, the Ministers who had met all agreed that an announcementof the position and df the Governments policy should be made onthe lines proposed by the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretaryof State for Scotland.It was generally agreed that the draft announcement was a first-rate document, which would serve its purpose admirably. Itwas worded so as to take the producers into the confidence of theGovernment, and, while not concealing the difficulties, it laid themain emphasis on encouraging them and the public generally, byone device, or another, to play their part in keeping up theproduction of very valuable foods.Considerable discussion ensued on the paragraph in the draft announcement which suggested-that -the supply of imported feeding.stufis likely, to be -available.^,yellucJ8dA - -IdwaAfeltthat the mention of 50 per cent, was Unnecessarily alarming,although the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries pointed outthat, if the full seriousness of the position was not announced, theGovernment^ - dicIck d&apos;x&apos; weAd As inc sacsd&quot; 1 atsr; *dA ddd t - -r AarA, &quot;3 3 ce Ci23 amauncs-snsA; as drAAl -d A ;o a . *r X    A ^.-.,..,0&quot;ell*Sly^^dA- :&apos;)-dd.announcement ^(n^gH^^PfP^p^restriction on the use of cereal- &apos;&apos; 1d&quot;&apos;&apos;    -      1 &apos; 1     1 v d,-- ..,,--.1-;--;-..;.;.        .......
feeding stuffs for fat cattle. After a full discussion, it was agreed that the announcement, as drafted laid sufficient emphasis on the need for economies in the feeding of fat stock. It was felt, however, that the second sentence of the first paragraph on page 9 should be amended to read as follows:-

"Pig and poultry producers are accordingly advised to plan their production programmes for the next twelve months on the basis that the proportion of their feeding-stuffs derived from imports will be reduced by at least one-third as compared with the normal pre-war quantities."

The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries suggested that he should be left, discretion as to the precise date on which the announcement should be made, as he wished to devote a few days to preparing the ground, so as to secure the best publicity for it. It was agreed that this would be the best course; but it was felt that care should be taken, not only to secure good publicity, for the actual announcement of policy, which would concern chiefly the professional producers, but also that a stream, of propaganda should be kept up directed to the  general public, to prevent their being unduly alarmed in their capacity as consumers and in order to stimulate the production of pigs and poultry by backyard methods.

The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that he would consider how best to carry on this form of propaganda, in consultation with the Minister of Information.

The rationing of livestock feeding-stuffs.

The War Cabinet then discussed the Ministers&apos; recommendation that the inquiry into the possibility of instituting a system of rationing livestock feeding-stuffs should be carried forward as quickly as possible with a view to the submission of specific proposals.

The Minister of Food pointed out that any machinery with this end in view would be particularly difficult to operate. The feeding-stuffs would be passed by the Ministry of Food to the merchants and it would be for the Ministry of Agriculture to devise machinery for assessing the requirements of individual stock owners. These would vary both with the amount of livestock, in itself a variable factor, and also with the amount of feeding-stuffs in the possession of individual owners. It was, however, the view of the Agricultural Ministers that it would be impossible to secure a restriction of feeding-stuffs to particular classes of stock without a system of rationing. The matter was now being investigated by an inter-Departmental Committee, with, a view to consideration by the Ministers concerned.

Cereals used for beer, whisky and gin.

The Minister of Food explained that the Committee had considered the possibility of restricting supplies for breweries and distilleries. At the present time the Cereals Control Board were not releasing imported cereals for use in either, but breweries were buying barley in the home market. Similarly, distilleries of malt whisky were buying barley in Scotland.

If the bulk of beer brewed was to be maintained, economies in cereals used by brewers could not be effected without reducing the gravity, which, if the revenue was not to suffer, involved raising the duty.

If the distilleries engaged in the production of grain whisky could not obtain supplies, they would have to close down. Complicated technical and important financial questions were involved and the Committee had therefore made arrangements, as a first step, for an inter-departmental committee of officials to work out the facts with a view to facilitating a decision on policy. This technical Committee was expected to be able to report by the end of the next week.&apos;


Control ofhome-grown wheat supply.(previous kef erence:W.M.

He asked &quot;that&apos;&apos;-gin-migm^sb:-j^e included in the inquiry.This was agreed to.The Minister of Food pointed; out that the War Cabinet had authorised him at the meeting referred to in the margin to bringthe home-grown wheat snpplyAipderlo^tl^pt W-m. &apos;* &quot;vJew^to securing that a larger proportion of itshould be turned into flour for human consumption. In view of the grave shortage, he would have liked to recommend that the merchants should be required to send all thatthey purchased to the flour mills. But he had&apos; come to the conclusionthat it would give a bad appearance to make so drastic an order, andit might even result in a reduction in the amount of wheat coming to market, as it might make fanners reluctant to dispose of their stocks. He accordingly proposed that the proportion should be fixed for the present at two-thirds. This was agreed to.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries pointed out that farmers were having great difficulty in disposing of the surplus oftheir potato crop, which was only fetching 15s. per ton. Potatoescould be used successfully as an ingredient in bread-making,, and hesuggested that every effort should be made to use this potato surplus to ease the wheat shortage.The Minister without Portfolio quoted the Report of theLeague of Nations Committee on Nutrition (page 93) to show thevalue of the potato as a food rich inj calories and in starch, whichwas particularly suited to take the place of sugar and cereals in the modern European diet. These facts should be brought to public attention, particularly in view of the potato, surplus. Me suggestedthat Sir Edward Mellanby, Sir John Orr and other experts might.weU be consulted with a view to propaganda for educating thepublic. -Further discussion ensued, from which it appeared that it was generally desirable that potato-growing and the use of potatoes asah article of diet should be encouraged^The War Cabinet agreed- :., -y(i) To authorise fife,.Minister, of; Agriculture and ^Fisheries.      and the.
