9k1 HThe shipping position.(previous references:WM. (39) 86thConclusions,Minute 1,and 97thConclusions,Minute 4.)import programmes.1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping giving an analysis of the shipping availablefor importing supplies into the United Kingdom in the first year of the war (W.P. (G.) (39) 126).The Minister of Shipping said that we were unquestionablyshort of shipping. Neutrals were hanging back, and efforts topurchase additional tonnage had up to now not been very successful.At the Minister&apos;s request, Sir Cyril Hurcomb then gave aresume of the Ministry of Shipping&apos;s provisional import programmes.The Ministry of Food programme was as followsCereals (which had first priority)SugarOil-seeds and nutsMeat        ............Dairy ProduceOther items (in which fruit, coffee, tea andcocoa figured largely)        ...      ...      ... 3 million tons per annum.111-521-5-8Total (in million tons)19-8The tonnage for meat was specialised and could not be veryeconomically used for other purposes, and the French might makedemands on us in this respect. If the war ceased to be static orthere was bombing of back areas, the French would require a reserve of foreign meat.The Minister without Portfolio observed that the French,during the last War, had used ships with refrigerated space for storage, as they were apt to be very short of storage space. Thisshould be watched.The Ministry of Supply programme, which totalled 23,900,000tons, included the following items : Million tonsIron-ore  ...Scrap pig iron and steelNon-ferrous ores and metals (lead, copper,chrome and other metals essential to munitions pi-oduction)Other minerals (including phosphate rock andsulphur)Timber (including pit-props)Wood pulp and esparto grassTextiles (wool and cotton)Chemicals, hides, rubber, &amp;c.per annum.over 6over 2fover 2^nearly 6^41-4aboutThe total import programme was as follows : Commodities controlled by the Ministry ofthe  Ministry  ofFoodCommodities  covered  bySupply programmeMiscellaneous items, tobacco, pottery, paperBalances (unallocated) ...19-823-92 11-2Total470
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the outstanding points in the Minister of Shipping&apos;s Memorandum (and in hisformer Memorandum, W.P. (G.) (39) 89) appeared to be thefollowing : million tons.(1) Total of import programmes for first year ofwar 47 million tons (of which 42 million tonsremain to be imported in the 10 monthsNovember 1939 to August 1940)     ......      47(2) Gross tonnage of ocean-going British shipping available ...       ...       ...      ...       ...        9^(3) Estimate of commodities to be imported inBritish vessels in the 10 months November1939 to August 1940............      31Requiring to be imported in neutral vessels inthe same ten months&apos; period ...       ...       ...      11The lesson to be drawn was, as the Minister of Shipping had said in the concluding paragraph of W.P. (G.) (39) 126, that &quot; thereis urgent need for removal of every avoidable cause of delay to shipping and for every economy in our internal consumption.&quot;Means of The First Lord of the A dmiralty suggested that the Warobtaining Cabinet should devote further attention to possible measures forincreased obtaining increased tonnage.   Appendix II to W.P. (G.) (39) 126tonnage. showed that the Ministry of Shipping were taking or consideringcertain measures to make the most of our tonnage resources, but it seemed to him that the last word on this matter had not been said.He hoped that a further enquiry would be made into all the itemsdealt with in that Appendix.(1) The First Lord drew attention to the estimate on page 3 of w.P. (G.) (39) 126 that there were cargo liners of acarrying capacity of 670,000 tons at present trading permanently between foreign ports. Prima facie, this appeared to be indefensible in present circumstances.We had not scrupled to commandeer trawlers, and he saw no reason why we should hesitate to take action inthe case of these liners also. Sir Cyril Hurcomb saidthat steps were gradually being taken to bring thisshipping into direct trade with the ,United Kingdom.It would, in any case, be a matter of five or six months before this shipping, and the shipping on Dominionregisters, could be made available for our own use.(2) On the suggestion that the Plimsoll Line requirements should be relaxed, Sir Cyril Hurcomb explained&apos; that both shipowners and seamen would be very much adverseto this, particularly at the present time of year.(3) The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that concreteships should be built, as this need not interfere with thebuilding of shipping by normal methods; but theMinister of Shipping pointed out that it was, in his view, very doubtful whether such ships could be builtsatisfactorily, and the Minister without Portfolio saidthat the experience of the last war had been verydisappointing.(4) On the suggestion that surplus tankers should be adapted for carrying other forms of cargo than oil, Sir CyrilHurcomb said that steps were being taken to modify newtankers now being built so that, before they were launched, they could be simply and economically alteredfor the carriage of ore or grain, if at the time this should prove desirable.
22&apos;3Chartering ofneutraltonnage.(previous references:W.M. (39) 86thConclusions,Minute 1,and 92ndConclusions,Minute 2.)(5) It was suggested that neutral, and in particular UnitedStates ships, might be willing to help us with the longhaul of goods to ports in safe areas, where transhipmentcould be arranged.(6) On the suggestion that Italian shipping should be persuaded to carry goods for us, Sir Cyril Hurcombexplained that, in connection with, the general com-mercial negotiations now going on in Rome, we werehoping to arrange for Italian ships to bring ore to thiscountry from Mediterranean ports.(7) On the suggestion that economy could be secured by therouteing of shipping, the Minister of Shipping referredto the steps which were being taken, to bring grain tothis country by the short haul across the North Atlantic.It was hoped also to secure shipping economies byimporting iron-ore from Spain rather than from more distant sources, but difficulties were being encountered in the trade negotiations with the Spaniards, who were unwilling to sell us ore unless we would also take theiroranges. The President of the Board of Trade said thatit was hoped to bring these negotiations to a satisfactoryissue.(8) As regards possible reductions in the amount of merchantshipping required for Admiralty purposes, Sir CyrilHurcomb said that the Admiralty representatives hadbeen most helpful in recent discussions on this point,but that it still appeared that the reduced demands ofthe Admiralty for the essential needs of the service would reduce the country&apos;s importing capacity by some400,000 tons. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said thatthis should not be taken as the final amount, and hewould be very glad to see if the Admiralty requirementscould be reduced still further.Sir Cyril Hurcomb said that, since the magnetic mine campaignhad started, the Greeks had ceased to offer their ships to us. the crews were now unwilling to come to this country. He had discussed the position with Greek owners, who were prepared tobe helpful but for the attitude adopted by their own Government who insisted that Greek ships should be manned by Greeks. Theyhad also been unhelpful on the question of bare charters. Hethought that strong pressure should be brought to bear on the GreekGovernment to adopt a more reasonable attitude.A further suggestion was that the Greek Government shouldrequisition Greek shipping and charter it to the Ministry ofShipping. An arrangement on these lines, which would enable theGreek Government to make a profit, seemed more hopeful.It was agreed that the Foreign Office should be invited tobring further pressure to bear on the Greek Government in connec-tion with negotiations for the purchase of Greek tobacco and other commodities.With regard to Danish shipping, Sir Cyril Hurcomb said thatthe Danish reply was that they had none to spare. They were nowrouteing their ships northabout, which added one month on to thelength of each voyage. Danish ships would be more willing to tradein the Mediterranean.Asked about the willingness of neutral ships to sail in convoy,Sir Cyril said that, although the neutral Governments would not commit themselves, he felt sure that if individual masters were asked by the naval officers at the ports whether they would sailin convoy their answer would be &quot; Yes.&quot; It was agreed that thispoint should be taken up. All Greek shipping chartered to us was ordered to go in convoy.
It was generally agreed that the survey showed that we mustbe prepared to face a reduction in the efficiency of our shipping services.Allocation of Discussion ensued as to the machinery for allocating theavailable available shipping between Departments.shipping. Qyrii Hurcomb said that there were constant Meetingsr between the Ministry of Shipping and the Departments concerned,daily and weekly, at which the main import programmes for thefirst year of war, of which he had given details, were discussed.He would shortly be in a position to circulate monthly statementsshowing the use made of shipping in the preceding month.Reference was made to the Ministerial Priority Committee onImport Programmes, which had recently been appointed. The view,however, was expressed that it was also necessary to have some body which would review the broader aspects of the programmes of thevarious Departments.The Lord Privy Seal agreed with tihis view, and thought thata survey of the whole position was required : otherwise each department would continue its existing programme and confusionmight be caused, if at a certain stage it was found that shippingwas not available to implement the whole programme.The President of the Board of Trade expressed his anxietyas to the position of the export trade. There were certain commodities-commodities as to which he felt particular concern. He instanced cross-bred merino wool, iron and steel products, copper products, and timber for all purposes, including timber for packing-cases. Onall these items, which formed part of the Ministry of supply programme, our exporting trade was meeting with serious and increasing difficulty in obtaining its requirements. He thought thatthe British exporting industry had been deprived of its rawmaterials to a greater extent than the British armaments industry,notwithstanding the fact that our export trade was one of our essential weapons of war.Sir Cyril Hurcomb said that Australian sales of merino woolhad been badly held up for a time, but considerable quantities were now on their way to this country.It was also stated that the Materials Priority Sub-Committee,under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Supply, reviewed demands not only from Departmentsbut also from the export trade, and for the home trade. some doubt, however, was expressed as to the principles upon which thisCommittee acted in making allocations as between Service and civil needs.It was also suggested that further consideration should be givento the methods by which home consumption could be reduced inorder to provide space for supplies for the armament programme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had given directions amonth ago that, with a view to furthering the steps taken toimprove our export position, an organisation should be set up todetermine the aggregate imports involved by the actual production programmes and consumption requirements, and that each Depart-ment had been instructed to appoint a senior official to act as liaison officer with the organisation in question and to take immediate steps to furnish the necessary information. The information so obtained should provide the material necessary for a survey to relate the Departmental programmes to the shipping tonnage available from time to time as well as to the needs of the home tradeand of the export trade.
Diversion ofShipping.(previous references:W,M. (39) 57thConclusions,Minute 11,and 97thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet had before them the following papers on the Diversion of Shipping : (i) Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (39) 138).(ii) Memorandum by the Minister of Transport (W.M. (G.) (39)122).(iii) Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (39)134).The Minister of Transport said that, as indicated in the6th paragraph of his Memorandum (W.P. (G.) (39) 122), he sought the authority of the War Cabinet, first, to direct the Port and transit Organisation to follow the general policy in regard todiversion set out in his Memorandum and, secondly, to authorisePort Emergency Committees in case of emergency to require for limited periods imports to proceed to their destination by road,rail, canal or coastwise transport at their absolute discretion.As regards the first point, the Chiefs of Staff recommended apolicy on the same lines as that for which he requested authority.As regards the second point, and in reply to a question by theChancellor of the Exchequer as to the possibility of such actiongiving rise to considerable claims for compensation, he explainedthat he proposed that the power should be exercised only if it were essential, and in a great emergency, in specific ports at specifictimes, and in circumstances in which he would be prepared todefend his action in Parliament. He was afraid that it would notbe possible for him to accept tihe limitation suggested by the Ministerof Shipping in the concluding paragraph of his memorandum .P. (G.) (39) 134, that such powers should be exercised only inregard to goods either owned or controlled by Government Depart-ments. The Minister of Shipping said that he did not wish topress this point.In regard to paragraph 4 of his Paper, the Minister ofTransport informed the War Cabinet that the Committee referredto had already visited Bristol, Glasgow and Liverpool and had seenrepresentatives of neighbouring ports in those areas. An interimreport suggesting lines for immediate action would be ready shortly.The survey showed that 70 to 80 vessels could be handled fordischarge overside (50 of them at the Tail of the Bank). Inparagraph 31 of the main report circulated in W.P. (G.) (39) 122,The Prime Minister said that he thought that the discussion which had taken place had been of great service, and that it wouldbe an advantage if he himself were now to make an examination,in consultation with the Ministers concerned, of the whole position.It would be of assistance to him in this connection if the Chancellorof the Exchequer could expedite the survey which was being carriedout under the aegis of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.The War Cabinet agreed : (i) To invite the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to examine the position in the lightof the discussion which bad taken place, with particular reference to the problems of allocation involved.(ii) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to bring;further pressure to bear on the Greek Government toreach a. settlement in regard to the chartering of Greektonnage as part of the negotiations for the purchase of greek tobacco and other commodities,(iii) To invite the First Lord of the Admiralty to pursue thesuggestion that masters of neutral ships should be askedindividually by the Naval Officers at the ports to joinour convoys.
a pool of 250 barges and 25 tugs was recommended, but this could probably be reduced to 140 barges and 17 tugs. Broadly speaking,however, discharge would have to be in coasters and not in barges,because if no more ships could be accommodated in a port, therewould probably be no more room for barges. Moreover, it was easier to discharge into coasters than into barges in rough weather. he expected that this Committee would recommend (i) the purchaseor charter of 200 small Dutch coasters, refers&apos;ence to which was madein paragraph 62 of the main report, and (ii) the building of as many new coasters as possible up to 100 either at home or abroad,with the suggested capacity of 700 tons with a draught not exceeding11 ft. 6 in.He understood that discharge facilities on the West Coastwould be improved (i) by a relaxation of existing lighting restrictions in dockareas on the West Coast (this was being dealt with by another Committee);(ii) if power were given to the Port Emergency committees to require goods to leave the port by any particular formof transport (this was one of his main recommendations);(iii) if the Departments, particularly the Ministries of food and Supply, could investigate the possibility of improving the administrative machinery in their PortAgency arrangements; and(iv) by a review by the Customs and Excise of the existing arrangements for clearing.The Minister of Shipping said that he supported the recommen-dations made by the Minister of Transport. He had been able tocharter some Dutch vessels, but the Dutch were very unwilling tocome forward. He had also placed orders for certain shallow-draught coasters.  It was difficult to get barges.Some discussion ensued on the question of bringing pressure tobear on the Dutch, whose coasting vessels in peace time had been seriously encroaching on United Kingdom coastal trade. It seemedintolerable that these vessels should be allowed to take our tradewithout interference in peace time, but should withdraw at the firstrisk of danger. Few were actually laid up in British ports, and itwould, therefore, not materially affect the position if we exercisedthe right of angary which we had exercised during the latter stages of the Great War. It was suggested, therefore, that the threatmight be used that restrictions would be placed after the war onDutch coasters plying between our ports.The Prime Minister pointed out that this threat must bediscreetly worded, since otherwise we should commit ourselves notto discriminate against them after the war if they did assist us inregard to coastal traffic.The Secretary of State for Air, who had left the meeting, left a Note to the effect that he regarded the Report in the Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (W.P. (G.) (39) 122) as most valuable.The advice of the Air Staff was that all possible measures shouldbe taken to improve the facilities for the ports on the West Coast.If the enemy became desperate, they might well plan continuous and heavy attacks on the East Coast ports, and it would be well to bearin mind that it was by no means impossible that London, Hull andNewcastle would be out of action for weeks at a time. The AirStaff did not regard such possibilities as remote, and it would be well to make our plans with that contingency in mind.The War Cabinet agreed (i) that diversion of shipping should be governed by theprinciples laid down in the Report of the Chiefs of StaffW.P. (39) 138) and the Memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (W.P. (G.) (39) 122);
(ii) that the Minister of Transport should be empowered, incase of emergency, to authorise a Port Emergency Committee to require for limited periods imports toproceed to their destination by road, rail, canal, orcoastwise transport at their own discretion;(iii) to invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toconsider, in consultation with the Ministry of shipping and Ministry of Transport, whether any steps could betaken to bring pressure to bear on the Dutch to releasetheir small coastal motor craft to help in meeting theneed for small craft for coastwise shipping.german shipping in neutral Ports.Proposals forChartering.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 86thConclusions,Minute 2.)3.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : Memorandum  by  the  First  Lord  of  the  Admiralty.W.P. (G.) (39) 96.Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping.  W.P. (G.) (39)125.The Minister of Shipping said that the main conclusion reached in his paper was that it would be inexpedient at the present time toallow any general relaxation of our position in international law asregards the employment of enemy shipping. He thought the whole position should be further examined in detail in relation to thecircumstances of particular neutral countries. There were more german vessels in Spanish ports than in the ports of any otherindividual country, and it was for consideration whether it wouldbe desirable to put pressure on Spain in this matter.The First Lord of the A dmiralty agreed with this view, but pointed out that the tonnage resources of the Allies could be substantially increased if the employment of the German tonnage in neutral ports were permitted.The Minister without Portfolio remarked that this expedienthad been adopted in the Napoleonic wars.The War Cabinet :-(1) took no decision on the proposal to charter  german shipping in neutral ports;(2) agreed that the proposal should be borne in mind.The food position: sugar and Meat.(previous references:W.M. (39) 83rdConclusions,Minute 1, 93rdConclusions,Minute 4,and 97thConclusions,Minute 4.)Sugar suppliesandconsumption.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Report of the ministerial Sub-Committee on Food Policy of the Home PolicyCommittee on Sugar Supplies and Consumption and the MeatPosition (W.P. (G.) (39) 129), together with a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (G.) (39) 133).The Lord Privy Seed thought that, whilst the issues raisedshould be considered together, he would for convenience take themone by one. Since the War Cabinet had discussed the question of rationing at the end of October, the position had definitelydeteriorated and the futui&apos;e was more uncertain than had then been contemplated.The sugar position had deteriorated for three reasons. First:At the present time, the total consumption of sugar was about20 per cent, above the pre-war level. The Minister of Food had made appeals to the public to reduce consumption voluntarily, but these appeals had had no effect. Secondly, the quantity of sugarAvhich it was assumed in October would reach this country had not,in fact, arrived. It was now clear that the supplies from Queens-land and other distant parts of the world would only be lifted after[20456] c
considerable delays. The third factor was the exchange difficulties.Nevertheless, owing to the difficulty of lifting the Australian sugar,we had been thrown back on obtaining supplies from Cuba.Sugar rationing, It was clear that we must rely for as long as possible on ourand the purchase Empire and home-grown sugar supplies. If we were to do sc. theof foreign sugar, rationing of sugar must be introduced early in the New Year. Had(Previous it been decided in October last to ration sugar, the domestic rationReference.:        could have been one of 16 ozs., but now all who had considered theW.M. (39) 63rd  problem were satisfied that it would not be safe to start rationingConclusions,      with a larger domestic ration than 12 ozs. per head per week, andMmute 10.)      a ration for manufacturing purposes equivalent to 8 ozs. per headper week.   The problem had been exhaustively considered both bythe Official and Ministerial Sub-Committees on Food Policy and,that  morning,  by  the  Home  Policy   Committee.    There  wasunanimous agreement that sugar must be rationed on the basisrecommended in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report and that, as regardsthe domestic ration, we should begin with a ration of 12 ozs. in thehope that it might be found possible to increase the ration to 16 ozs.at a later date.   The Minister of Health would explain why he favoured the purchase of more Cuban sugar so as to enable a 16-oz.domestic ration to be more quickly realised.The Minister of Food endorsed the statement made by the lord privy Seal. When the decision to ration butter and bacon had been implemented, steps had been taken to ensure the completion of registration for sugar, and there would thus be no delay in intro-ducing the rationing of sugar.The Prime Minister enquired the reasons for the abnormalconsumption of sugar.The Minister of Food replied that in the main it was due to the sugar being hoarded, both by the retailers and by the general public.He thought that the retailer would, after rationing started, be anxious to dispose of his hoarded sugar in order to turn over hismoney as quickly as possible. To the extent that this happened theposition would be eased.The Minister of Health said that the cut proposed was a largeone and represented an overall reduction of about 7 ounces in theaverage weekly consumption of sugar per head of the population.As sugar was a cheap food, the reduction in the domestic rationwould fall most heavily on the manual workers, and to this reduction must be added the reduction in the ration for manufac-turing purposes. The effect of rationing sugar would merely be toswitch over the demand to other foods, notably wheat and margarine.Man was a heat engine, and, in order to sustain his energy, he mustbe adequately fuelled. It would be necessary, therefore, to replace the cargoes of sugar by cargoes of wheat, or possibly margarine.It was most important that we should, as quickly as possible, supply the public with a ration of sugar of the amount to which the publicwas accustomed, namely, 16 ounces per head per week. If, owingto the long haul, it was difficult to lift the supplies from Queensland,this made it all the more necessary to purchase and lift the Cubansugar as quickly as practicable. On these grounds, he urged thepurchase of 400,000 tons of foreign sugar rather than the300,000 tons favoured by the other members of the Home PolicyCommittee.The Prime Minister enquired whether it was certain that, ifthe consumption of sugar was reduced, it would be necessary to make up the deficiency by importing wheat to an equivalent amount.The Minister of Health said that this was certain when such large amounts were being dealt with. The whole question had beengone into exhaustively in the Great War. when it had been
The Meatposition and meat Eationing.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 63rdConclusions,Minute 10.)scientifically determined that, in order to maintain the energy and working capacity of persons in different walks of life, it wasnecessary that they should consume certain minimum quantities of essential foodstuffs. It had been scientifically demonstrated and experience had shown that attempts to reduce food rations belowthese minima had invariably been folknved by loss of efficiency.The Minister without Portfolio reminded the War Cabinetthat the Mixed Committee of the League of Nations on Nutritionand the Committee on Nutrition in the Colonial Empire had drawn attention to the bad effects on health of a high level of sugarconsumption. For this reason he favoured the Committee&apos;srecommendations.The Lord Privy Seat observed that whether the proposed sugar ration was too small or too large was immaterial because it, in fact,represented the maximum ration which in present circumstances itwas considered safe to adopt at the outset.The First Lord of the Admiralty enquired why it wasconsidered necessary to maintain the large reserve of from 250,000to 300,000 tons of sugar.The Minister of Food explained that this reserve was necessaryto meet distributive requirements, particularly in any grave crisisor emergency.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it was difficult for him to resist the imposition of sugar rationing, if the other membersof the War Cabinet favoured that course. At the same time he wasnot satisfied that the state of our sea transport justified the rationing of sugar, and he regretted that it was thought necessaryto introduce it.The Prime Minister thought that all must regret the necessityfor rationing sugar, but his mind would be easier if in this matterwe took the safe and prudent course. If supplies of sugar turned out to be larger than was now anticipated, so much the better. Hisown view was that, having regard to the shipping, exchange and colonial difficulties, we should accept the recommendations in w.P. (G.) (39) 129, including the purchase of 300,000 tons of foreignsugar.The Lord Privy Seal said that if rationing were not introduced,the country might be faced with a serious shortage of meat.Further, it was difficult without rationing to carry out the policyof controlling home-produced meat, which was necessary in theinterests of the Minister of Agriculture^ policy for encouraginghome production. In the absence of such a policy excessiveslaughtering would continue and the risk of a shortage would bestill further increased. The public were ready for a system ofcontrol and were, indeed, much more interested in fair distributionthan worried at the inconvenience of a rationing system. The Sub-Committee of Ministers had therefore suggested that a decision should be taken now on the general principle, but that it should beleft for later decision what the actual amount of the ration shouldbe.. To make their proposal clearer they wished to amendrecommendation (3) on page 6 of their Memorandum, to read asfollows : That meat rationing should begin not later than the5th February, 1940, but that the amount of the ration shouldbe reserved for determination at a later date.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that in his opinion thecase for rationing had been made out only by the adoption ofarbitrary assumptions as to the need for building up a reserve and[20456] ^ d
for providing supplies for the French, and as to probable diminution-tions in home and imported supplies. He did not consider thatthe case had been properly made out, and he thought that theadoption of rationing would be used as an argument to prove thesuccess of the German campaign against our trade.The Lord Privy Seal explained that tihe French had co-operated with us very helpfully both in the matter of meat purchases andin the case of wheat. The Committee had therefore thought it very important that we should go as far as we could in helping them.Sir Henry French said that the ration was expected to amountto 20 ounces as against 16 ounces in the Great War.The Minister of Food explained that he was going to take overthe purchase of all home-produced livestock from the 15th January,1940, and would have to devise some suitable machinery for passingit on to the butchers in accordance with the needs of their customers.Registration without rationing-would make it possible to estimate the needs of districts, but rationing was necessary to make possible a fair allocation as between individual shops.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that it hadbeen well known for some time that in the event of war theGovernment intended to become the buyers of all livestock forslaughtering at a guaranteed price, and if there were to be anyabandonment of this policy, it would be regarded as the breakingof a pledge and slaughterings would become even heavier. It wasalso generally agreed that the system of Maximum Prices could notbe worked for any length of time and there had, in fact, beenwidespread abuses under it, which were demoralising the country-side. There was no glut of meat at present and prices had, in fact,hardened somewhat since the removal of the Maximum Prices Order;if the market were left free, there was no knowing to what levelprices might rise, more particularly if there were any diminutionin imported supplies by the sinking of a few ships. The rightpolicy, therefore, was to take control of the market while it was still possible to do so at a reasonable level, and this was the objectof the Committee&apos;s recommendations.In answer to questions, the Minister of Food explained thatit was not proposed to pool home and foreign supplies in allocatingmeat to butchers. The ration was to be based on price and notweight, because this had been proved, by the experience of the:great war, to be the best basis. A figure could not be fixed now because it was impossible to say either what quantities of meat would beavailable or how prices would stand in the future, but with thesetwo factors in mind a definite proposal would be put to the WarCabinet in the New Year. ,    ,,. ,The War Cabinet agreed&apos; To accept the recommendations contained in paragraph 11of W.P. (G.) (39) 129, subject to verbal amendments to paragraph (i) in regard to sugar, and to paragraph (iii)in rega,rd to meat. The recommendations as accepted bythe War Cabinet are as follows : I. (i) Sugar.. That sugar should be&apos; rationed as fromthe 8th January, 1940 (the date on which bacon and butter are being rationed), and that the sugar ration should be 12 ozs. per head per week for domestic consumption, manufacturers being supplied with approximately 50 per cent, oftheir normal requirements, which is equivalentto a ration of a further 8 ozs. per head per week for the population.
The Pood 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report from thePosition: Wheat Ministerial Sub-Committee on Food Policy of the Home Policyand other Committee, on Supplies of Wheat and other Cereals (W.P. (G.) (39)Cereals. 132).(previous reference:W.M. (39) 86thConclusions,Minute 3.)Measures for building up areserve stock ofwheat.The Lord Privy Seal said that, as explained in the Memo-randum, the Ministerial Sub-Committee were of the opinion thatthe reserve stock of wheat should be built up as quickly as possibleto 13 weeks&apos; supply. This was the lowest level touched in the last war, and must be regarded as the bare minimum, but it would inany case take until the end of March to reach this level. This wason the assumption that the Minister of Shipping would makeimporting capacity of 880,000 tons per month available for theimport of cereals, by giving absolute priority to this form of import and by giving priority within the field of cereals to the importationof wheat for human consumption. They had considered whether to extend the rate of extraction of flour, but had decided tha.t thiswas a measure only to be taken in a grave emergency, more particu-larly as it would involve a reduction in the supply of offals for animal feeding stuffs.The question of alternative supplies from France was discussed.The Minister of Food said he was trying to extend this source ofsupply, but it was to some extent limited by loading facilities. Theintention was to replace the wheat loaned to us by the French bywheat landed at Marseilles, imported perhaps from Roumania.The Secretary of State for War said that he had not previouslyheard of the difficulty referred to in paragraph 7 of W.P. (G.) (39)132 about men for threshing. The Lord Privy Seal explained thatin the course of the Food Policy Committee&apos;s enquiry it had become apparent that, if an emergency arose in which it was desirable topress on with threshing the home crop, every skilled man wouldbe required, and, though the numbers might only amount to a few(ii) That the arrangements should be based on theacceptance of column 5 of the Table to Appen-dix I, namely, foreign purchases of sugar of300,000 tons, and rations of the amount mentionedin (i) above.(iii) That it should be noted that the decision in (i)above need not be announced before the27th December.II. (i) Meat. That consumers should register withretailers of meat during the week beginning the1st January, 1940.(ii) That the scheme for the control of livestock and home-produced meat should be brought intooperation on the 15th January, 1940.(iii) That meat rationing should begin not later thanthe 5th February, 1940, but that the amount ofthe ration should be reserved for determinationat a later date.(iv) That it will not be necessary to make any announce-ment in regard to (i) and (iii) above until after christmas; the decision in regard to (ii) abovehas already been announced, without mention,however, of any specific date,(v) That the French tonnage requirements for the shipment of frozen meat should be further examined by the Minister of Shipping, inconsultation with the Minister of Food.
hundreds, it might well be impossible without them to utilise ouremergency reserves. The Minister of Agriculture pointed out that many of these men were Reservists or Territorials.The War Cabinet agreed : (i) that a reserve of 13 weeks&apos; supply of wheat in the mills and granaries should be regarded as a minimum;(ii) to approve the measures taken by the Minister of Food inconjunction with the Minister of Shipping with a viewto achieving this position by the end of March 1940;(iii) to note that the rate of extraction of flour had alreadybeen raised from 70 per cent, to 73 per cent, and to approve keeping in reserve as an emergency measureany further rise in the rate of extraction;(iv) to approve the policy indicated in paragraphs 8 (ii) and 10of W.P. (G.) (39) 132 as to the balance of importanceto be attached to the import of wheat and of animal feeding stuffs;(v) to invite the Secretary of State for War to consult withthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries with regardto the release of skilled men from the Army for threshingthe Home Wheat Harvest for the period up to the31st March, 1940.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.December 6, 1939.
