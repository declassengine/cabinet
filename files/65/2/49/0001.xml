rThe Case ofthe S.S.Sanyo Maru.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 114thConclusions,Minute 8.)Seizure of 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heEnemy Exports, had gone into this matter very fully since the Meeting of the WarCabinet held that morning, and had endeavoured to find a courseof action that would achieve our object, whilst doing as little harmas^ possible to our relations with Japan. He suggested that anofficial in the Foreign Office should see an official in the JapaneseEmbassy somewhat informally and should inform him (a) that the Sanyo Maru must anyhow come in to the Downsfor examination :(b) that, since the date when the assurance was given that the examination would be for a limited category of goodsonly, we had received secret information that the cargocontained &apos;&apos; secret naval goods &apos;&apos; :(c) that we thought the cargo might contain dangerous itemsdestined for enemy agents :(d) that we should like an assurance that the naval goodsmentioned in the manifest were bona fide intended forthe Japanese Navy and that they would not be unloadeden route to Japan, and that the unshipment of them would be watched :(e) that, subject to assurances being received on these points,we proposed that the cargo should be released.At the same time, we should point out that this was a much wider concession than we had anticipated when we said that wewould subject the ship to a merely formal examination, since, when we had given this promise, we had not realised that the cargoconsisted of thousands of tons of German goods. Normally, underthe Order in Council, these goods would have been stopped for examination.The Foreign Secretary said that, if the Japanese could promise that the goods were intended only for the Japanese Navy, he thoughtthat we ought to accept that assurance. We claimed to interferewith German goods as such, and if we were to interfere with thiscargo on the ground that it was consigned to the Japanese Navywe might be led into all sorts of complications.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that we hadreceived information causing us to regard this particular cargo with considerable suspicion, and that there were grounds for suspectingthat it might be used to our detriment. Japanese assurances insuch a matter were not sufficient. He favoured informing theJapanese that the ship would have to be properly examined, butthat we would do our best to expedite the examination. the damage caused to Japan would be only one week&apos;s delay. (TheForeign Secretary interposed that a thorough examination wouldtake from two to three weeks.) Merely to examine the cargo was a concession, as we were entitled under the Order-in-Council to seizeit all. If we adopted the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion for dealingwith this question, it would make a breach in the whole principleof the seizure of enemy exports. Further, he doubted whether the examination of this cargo would affect our relations with Japan.It would be unfortunate if neutrals gained the impression thatthey had only to adopt a firm attitude in order to evade the Order-in-Council.Sir Frederick Leith-Ross agreed generally with the line ofaction suggested by the First Lord. He thought that the Ministryof Economic Warfare should inform the Japanese Embassy that,in view of the complexity of the manifest, it would be necessary forthe Sanyo Maru to be sent into port for examination. They shouldalso be told the reason of our change of attitude and it could be suggested to them that, if they could help us in finding consign-ments of particular interest to us, this would enable us to deal withthe ship much more rapidly.[20493] b 2
The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that action onthese lines would give the impression that we were proceeding onthe ground that we were uneasy about some of the consignmentswhich were addressed to the Japanese Navy. The Japanese mightsajr that this was discriminatory action and, to be consistent, weshould have to proceed to examine particular goods that might begoing, for example, to Italy. Such a course might lead to gravepolitical difficulties. It was, of course, very difficult to predict the degree of trouble that might ensue. There was no doubt, however,that the Japanese would be seriously annoyed, and he would prefernot to risk complications over this question before other matters had been settled.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, he explained that by his suggestion (c) he intended to suggest to the Japanese thatthere was a possibility that dangerous goods had been planted upon them by the Germans. If some of these consignments were bowi fidegoods for the Japanese Navy, they might quite well be referred toas &quot;secret naval goods&apos;&apos; and be quite harmless. We would notbe on strong ground if we stopped goods which were genuinelyintended for the Japanese Navy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if we told a repre-sentative of the Japanese Embassy that we suspected the nature ofsome of the cargo, we might be questioned as to what we expectedto find.   What would be our answer?Sir Frederick Leith-Ross said that the legal position underthe Order-in-Council was that any ship conveying German goods which sailed after the 4th December might be required to dischargesuch goods : these goods would then be placed in the Prize court and could either be requisitioned for use by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, detained, or sold, but the Order-in-Council provided that thegoods could be released at any time if the Court was satisfied thatthey had become neutral property before the date of the Order or with the consent of the proper Officer of the Crown.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, if weseized the cargo of the Sanyo Maru, the Japanese would probablybe very unpleasant to us. This might result in our building upa mountain of trouble out of all proportion to any benefit obtainedfrom a thorough examination of this particular cargo.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there was no doubtthat we would be within our rights in seizing this cargo. Thequestion was whether we should make a concession on grounds ofpolicy. He did not think that this case was one of grave dangerso far as the cargo itself was concerned.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thequestion was one of proportion. The scheme for seizing enemyexports had only just started and we had agreed to a policy ofeasement in the early stages. Later we might not be so tendertowards Japan. Even assuming that this particular consignmentcontained an element of danger, the risk of letting it through wasnot immense. On the other side we had to run the risk of upsettingthe whole of our political relations with Japan.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that if the SanyoMaru was allowed to proceed, any information regarding her whichmight come to light at a later date should be watched carefully.There was always the possibility of stopping her either at Gibraltaror Aden.The War Cabinet agreed : That Sir Frederick Leith-Ross should inform M.. Okamotoas follows : (a) That the steamship Sanyo Maru must come in to theControl Base to be examined.
The balkans and the middle east.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 112thConclusions,Minute 6.)2.   The War Cabinet had before them (a) A draft record of a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff andGeneral Gamelin at General Gamelin&apos;s Headquarterson the 11th December, 1939 (W.P. (39) 159) :(6) A Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff containing their comments on the draft Resolutions proposed by general gamelin (W.P. (39) 160).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the meetingof the Chiefs of Staff with General Gamelin had disclosed a closeridentity of view between the French and British Staffs than hadbeen expected. In discussion, two fresh points had emerged. First,the French thought we might be forced by the action of the enemy to intervene in the Balkans as early as next spring. The french were therefore anxious to utilise the 111 Divisions comprised inthe Armies of Roumania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey to buildup a Balkan front against the possibility of an enemy drive in thesouth-east. Unless this front were constituted beforehand, theArmy of each country would be overrun in turn. Secondly, the roumanians, Greeks and Yugoslavs had all apparently asked for[20493] b 3(b) That we had received information stating that shecarried some consignments of secret goods of a navalcharacter. V/e must therefore request an assurance that such goods are consigned bona fide for theJapanese Navy, and that there is no possibility oftheir transhipment or transference to enemy hands.(c) That this procedure can be justified on the following grounds (i) we are entitled to stop all goods of Germanorigin shipped after the 4th December;(ii) our undertaking to operate the control as lightlyas possible in the early stages obviouslycannot cover goods which are intended to beused against our interests.(d) That, provided the Japanese Embassy can give us the assurances asked for, we will be ready to pass theship through our Control, in accordance with the promise already made; this, however, is a much wider concession than we had anticipated when we gave this promise. Apart from the information given above, we now know that this ship is carryingthousands of tons of German goods openly consignedfrom a German consignor. Under the instructions given to the Fleet, these consignments would normally have been stopped, but we feel bound by our promise and will therefore release the ship.It must, however, be understood : (i) that if the manifest shows consignments ofGerman origin, other than those notified tous, a new situation will have arisen and weshall regard it as our duty to send the shipinto port for detailed examination;(ii) that in any future case, we may require detailedevidence of payment and must be free toexamine the cargo fully before we give any undertaking to release goods of Germanorigin;(iii) that we propose to enforce strictly the provisionsof the Order-in-Council as from the1st January, 1940.
Allied assistance and the French were in touch with the Staffs ofthese countries. What these contacts were worth, however, it was difficult to determine.; The discussions with General Gamelin, at which general weygand also had been present, had been very frank and cordial,and at the end General Gamelin had handed over some draft resolutions on which he suggested the Chiefs of Staff shouldcomment before submitting them to the War Cabinet. the comments of the Chiefs of Staff on these Resolutions were containedin W.P. (39) 160.The War Cabinet then examined the draft Resolutions and the comments of the Chiefs of Staff paragraph by paragraph.Resolution I. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff emphasised that,Comment l. before any considerable forces could be sent to the Balkans, the neutrality of Italy must be completely assured; that is to say, she must have adopted an attitude from which she could not subse-quently withdraw. It was the subsequent maintenance of forcesin the Balkans which presented the most difficult problem, ratherthan their initial despatch. The maintenance would fall largely on us, and the French were inclined to underrate the probleminvolved.Resolution III. Most of the troops now stationed in the Middle East wereComment 3. there to meet the contingency of Italian aggression. Until this possibility had been entirely eliminated, practically no troops couldbe spared from the Middle East, and any forces sent to the Balkanswould therefore have to be at the expense of the Western Front.Even the preparation of bases would be at the expense of forces atpresent destined for France. But in the immediate future weshould have no resources at all with which to intervene in the balkans.Comment 4. The French contemplated the despatch of French personnel todevelop bases in Turkey and Greece, but the Chiefs of Staff did not wish to go further than to bring pressure to bear on Greece and turkey to develop their own ports and communications with theirown personnel. He agreed, however, that it might be advantageousfor them to receive some Allied advisers to assist them.Comment 6. As regards the supply of armaments to the Balkan countries,it had already been agreed to allot to Turkey 100 anti-tank gunswhich had previously been intended for the troops in France. any additional armaments supplied would likewise be at the expenseof the Western Front.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it essential toemphasise that any assistance given to these countries should bemade jointly by the French and ourselves, and that the whole ofthe obligation should not fall upon us.Approach to As regards the question of an approach to Italy, the Chief ofItaly, the Imperial General Staff said that there was some divergence ofopinion between General Gamelin and General Weygand. general weygand favoured proceeding with preparations and pointing out to Italy afterwards that the defence of the Balkans against bolshevism was in accordance with traditional Italian policy.General Gamelin apparently appreciated that the matter wouldhave to be handled more delicately, and this was, of course, also theBritish view. General Gamelin, however, did not accept the contention that the French were under an obligation to keep Italyinformed of any action which the French and ourselves might take to build up a Balkan front. The real problem was whether it would, be better to approach Italy now, or to wait until it was clear that1 the enemy were intending to make a thrust in the Balkans.   His &apos;own view was that it would be better to make no approach now,since a false step now might be fatal. It should be realised, however,that the French were already in touch secretly with certain of the balkan Staffs.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was quite impossible to foresee how the situation would develop in the balkans. We had, therefore, to do everything in our power toprepare for any contingency in that area. On the other hand italy was at present moving slowly but satisfactorily in our direction,and we ought to avoid any action calculated to rouse her suspicionsor to excite her hostility. He recalled that our Ambassador in Romehad been informed by Count Ciano on the 16th September that france had undertaken to consult Italy before taking any stepsto build up a Balkan front against Germany. They had given this assurance to Italy before we had done so and it was strange tofind General Gamelin disclaiming any knowledge of such an assurance (telegram No. 893 from Rome of the 16th September).The Foreign Secretary also informed the War Cabinet of a conversation between a Polish Diplomat and Count Ciano, the upshot of which Avas that Count Ciano had stated very heatedly that,if either side asked Italy whether she was on their side, Italy would join the opposing side without hesitation. The Foreign secretary said that in his view it would be premature to make any approach to Italy at this juncture, as a preliminary to conversations with greece, Roumania and Yugoslavia. There was no reason, hoAvever.Avhy we should not go ahead forthAvith with any necessaiy prepara-tions in Turkey, Palestine and Egypt.Salonika. The discussion then turned on the desirability of developing a base in Salonika. It was recalled that the Chiefs of Staff had consistently advised against undertaking an expedition to Salonikain view of the very bad campaigning conditions in that area.The French, hoAvever, had always been keen on the idea. Fromthe naval point of view, the defence of Salonika was unimportant,since it would be possible to close the gulf by a minefield beforethe Germans could possibly reach the port. If the Italians joined our enemies and attacked down through Albania and Greece, then a force at Salonika would be of military value as a link between the Greekson the left and the Turks in Thrace. It was suggested that, ifSalonika and its hinterland were not held, our sea communications with the Dardanelles would be liable to interruption from enemy aerodromes established on Greek territory Avithin 50 or 60 miles ofthe entrance to the Straits. It was pointed out, however, that therewere aerodromes in Bulgaria which could be used for this purpose.It Avould be seen from the record of the conversations withGeneral Gamelin (W.P. (39) 159) that General Metaxas had already authorised General Papagos to get in touch with the Frenchregarding possible collaboration in Salonika. Such contacts could perhaps be made secretly Avithout full Staff Conversations, but itwas generally agreed that we ought to be particularly cautious inregard to Greece, as to which country Italy Avas likely to be particularly susceptible.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence drew attention to paragraph 13 (a) (i) of W.P. (39) 160, in which the Chiefs ofStaff apparently recommended the development of a base at Salonika.He enquired whether they had in mind that these preparations should be put in hand now.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed that therecommendation as worded was perhaps misleading. What theChiefs of Staff had in mind was only the preparation of plans andof the necessary base units and reserves of stores, which couldbe held ready elsewhere, to be sent in when required. If, however,it were possible to get the Greeks to improve the port facilities;and communications on their own account, so much the better.Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained that the conversations Chiefs of Staff were in favour of the French continuing the contacts with Greece, which had already been made with the Greek, Roumanian and roumania and Yugoslav General Staffs, provided that this could be achievedYugoslavia. without upsetting Italy. They did not, however, intend that fullStaff conversations should be undertaken.
The Prime Minister observed that in view of the Frenchassurances to Italy, to which the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had referred, the fact that the French were already in contact with the Balkan Staffs might possibly give rise to an awkward situation.Possible The next point to be discussed was the possibility of main-diversion of taining, at any rate during the next year or so, a strictly defensiveforces from the attitude in the West and developing our strength with a view to western front, operations in South-East Europe. There seemed little prospect ofany big Allied offensive in the west in 1940. In land forces, theGermans outnumbered us, and had the advantage of interior lines.Further, whereas the Germans had only to defend their frontierwith France, we had to be ready to defend the whole of the eastern frontier of France, from Switzerland to the sea. This involvedlocking up a large number of troops behind the Belgian frontier.The position would be eased if the Belgians built really powerfulfortifications on the line Givet-Namur-Antwerp.The Prime Minister suggested that we might explore with theFrench the idea of strengthening our defences behind the Belgianfrontier to such.an extent that they would be virtually impregnable.We might then offer to take over more of the French line, and thusrelease French divisions for use in the Balkans if the need arose.No doubt the French would prefer to have as many British troopsin France as possible, and to send their own troops for service inthe Balkans. Before we finally undertook this fortification of the franco-Belgian Frontier, however, it might be as well to make one more approach to the Belgians. We could tell them frankly that,if they did not put their house in order, we should concentrate on building fortifications behind the Franco-Belgian border and thatwe should stay behind them and leave Belgium to its fate if theGermans invaded the Low Countries.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed that it wouldbe preferable to use French divisions in the Balkans, though we might have to provide most of the maintenance facilities. Ingeneral, however, the maintenance of French troops was on a lessgenerous scale than that of British troops.He emphasised again that British intervention in the Balkansin the Spring of 1940 could only be made at the expense of theWestern Front, unless some of our forces in the Middle East were released by the final disappearance of Italy as a potential enemy.In any event the preparations which we should make would only bedirected to ensuring the security of the Straits, by concentratingour efforts on supporting Turkey. If we tried to support the otherBalkan countries, there was a danger of both weakening ourselves on the Western Front, and failing to provide an effective measureof assistance to the Balkan countries other than Turkey.The Prime Minister suggested that the essence of the matter was as follows : (1) Unless we made some preparations now, we should be unable to take any effective steps to stop an enemyoffensive in the Balkans in the Spring, if such an offensive took place, in which case the Balkans wouldprobably be almost completely over-run.(2) We could not, in any case, intervene effectively unless weA&quot; I were assured at least of Italy&apos;s benevolent neutrality.(3) On the other hand, we could not at the present time expect to obtain any assurance from Italy as to what herattitude would be, and, subject to the advice.that mightbe given by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome, it.might be premature to make an approach to her on thesubject.
(4) Our policy should, therefore, be to go ahead with prepara-tions for intervention in the Balkans, so far as this could be done without in any way antagonising Italy.This was the dominant consideration which should govern all action by the Allies in the Balkans.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed that our Balkan policy must be guided by theprinciples enunciated by the Prime Minister at A,&quot;and, in particular, that the dominant consideration which should govern Allied action in the Balkans shouldbe to take no steps which would antagonise Italy,(ii) Approved the broad lines of the Chiefs of Staffs&apos; Memo-randum on Conversations with the French high command (W.P. (39) 160), subject to the general prin-ciples enunciated by the Prime Minister.(iii) Agreed that the above Conclusions should form the basisof discussions on Balkan policy with the French at theforthcoming Meeting of the Supreme War Council.(iv) Invited  the  Foreign  Secretary  to  obtain  Sir  percy loraine&apos;s views, if possible by Monday next, as to Italy&apos;sprobable reaction to the measures which the FrenchGovernment proposed should be taken in the near future.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 14, 1939.
