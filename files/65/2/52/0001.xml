The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 117thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that offensive airpatrols against enemy seaplane bases had been carried out duringthe night of the 16th-7th December, and from dusk until 9 p.m. onthe 17th December. Some anti-aircraft fire and searchlight activityhad been encountered, but there was nothing special to report. Anumber of enemy raids had been plotted on the 16th December off theEast coast.   The raids had not been intercepted.A German submarine had been attacked on the 16th Decemberoff Aberdeen.  No damage had been observed.During the morning of the 17th December German air attacks had been made on a number of merchant ships off the East coast.A small motor vessel and a trawler were reported to have been sunk.Ten survivors had been picked up.At dusk on the same day further bombing attacks had beenmade on merchant vessels off the East and South-East coast. none of the vessels had been hit. It had also been reported that mineshad been dropped by one enemy aircraft off the Humber Estuary.The Secretary of State for Air observed that these bombing attacks on our merchant ships appeared to indicate that the war onour shipping was entering a new phase.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 117thConclusions,Minute 2.)The AdmiralGraf Spee.Sinking of aGerman cruiserby H.M.SubmarineUrsula.Air attacks on merchant ships.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the AdmiralGraf Spee had blown herself up on the previous evening about miles to the south-westward of Montevideo Harbour in 4 fathomsof water. She had transferred the majority of her crew to thesteamship Tacoma before sailing. The internment of the Tacomahad been demanded, on the grounds that she had become a Navaltransport. She ha,d left Montevideo half an hour after the A admiral.Graf Spee, and her whereabouts were not at present known.The Minister without Portfolio thought that the whole incidenthad been very well and efficiently handled both at home and by themen on the spot.There was unanimous agreement that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should be requested to send a message of congratulation and appreciation to the British Minister inMontevideo.Continuing, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that reports had been received that some 20 German ships had broken out from neutral ports, presumably with the intention of returning toGermany. Suitable patrol lines had been established to interceptthem if possible.H.M. submarine Ursula had reported sinking a Germancruiser of the Koln class in the Heligoland Bight on the14th December. The cruiser had been escorted by six destroyers.It seemed probable that this was one of the ships attacked and;damaged by H.M. submarine Salmon, on the 13th December. TheSalmon reported that she had secured three hits on enemy ships,and from the wreckage which she had found after surfacing, itappeared not unlikely that she had sunk one of the German ships.Four destroyers and two mine-laying destroyers had carriedout an anti-submarine sweep in the Thames Estuary and the twomine-layers had subsequently laid a mine-field off Borkum.The First Lord gave a list of the merchant ships which had been attacked by German aircraft, as previously mentioned by theSecretary of State for Air. He agreed that these air attacks on merchant ships constituted a new departure on the part of theenemy. The action included not only bombing but also machine-gunning, which could only be attributed to spite, directed as it was against unarmed merchant sailors.[20505a]b 2
A channel of a width of 1 mile had now been swept throughthe minefield opposite the Tyne. One magnetic mine had beenexploded in this area.The First Lord described the circumstances in which thecollision between H.M.S. Bar-ham and H.M.S. Duchess had takenplace. The heavy loss of life had been due to the fact that theDuchess had immediately capsized.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Military 3    The Secretary of State for War informed the War cabinet situation. that the latest reports which were not yet confirmed stated that(Previous the Finns had had a big success North of Lake Ladoga and had reference: cut up three Russian Divisions. Other successes which the FinnsW.M. (39) 117th claimed were the recapture of Suomussalmi and Tolvajaervi and conclusions, to have taken thirty tanks. The morale of the Finnish Army was minute 5.)        said to be excellent.Fierce fighting was said to be going on round Salmijaervi, andit was uncertain who was in possession of this place, nor was itknown whether the nickel mines had been destroyed, as reported inthe Press. Owing to the conditions it was very doubtful whetherthe Russian advance across the middle of Finland would meet with success.The First Lord of the Admiralty observed that, if the Sovietshowed real military weakness, we might have to alter our estimateof the strategical situation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that, if russia proved militarily ineffective, this might be of great relief and advantage to Germany. He agreed with the Lord Privy Sealthat we ought to make every possible effort to assist Finland tomaintain the struggle and was very grateful to the Secretary ofState for War and the Secretary of State for Air for what hadalready been done.The Lord Privy Seal thought that this might turn out to bethe decisive moment of the war and suggested that the three defence ministers should meet to consider what further measures could usefully be taken to assist Finland in regard to supplies of arms,munitions and other supplies.The War Cabinet adopted this proposal.Weekly Resume(No. IS) of theNaval, Militaryand air situation.shipbuilding programme.4. The War Cabinet briefly considered the Weekly Resume(No. 15) of the Naval, Military and Air Situation (W.P. (39) 163).The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to the statement at theend of paragraph 18 which gave the shipping other than tankersnow under construction as being 729,000 tons. He said that thefigure previously mentioned had been 1 million tons. In the last war we had constructed tonnage totalling If millions in a year,and the Americans had achieved the remarkable total tonnage of2\ millions in a single year. He was therefore disturbed that ourbuilding programme was not higher, particularly when it wascompared with the formidable figure of sinkings shown in para-graph 16, namely, a total loss of British, Allied and Neutral ships,since the beginning of the war, of 646,910 tons. He considered thatour shipbuilding efforts should be substantially increased.The Minister without Portfolio agreed that this was a mostimportant matter, but understood that the whole subject was to be reviewed shortly by the War Cabinet.
B.B.C. news bulletins.Reports ofshipping losses.(previous reference:WM. (89) 117thConclusions,Minute 4.)British pvopa-:ganda abroad.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that a Memorandumon the subject was being prepared by the Ministry of Shipping forconsideration by the War Cabinet later in the week.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements andof W.P. (39) 163.5. In the course of discussion the First Lord of the A dmiraltydrew attention to the highly prejudicial effect on public morale ofthe announcements relating to shipping matters in the B.B.C. news bulletins, e.g., that mentioned in his Memorandum W.P. (G.) (39)156. He was about to circulate a Memorandum suggesting thatmerchant shipping losses should only be announced once a weekand should be accompanied by a statement of our gross mercantiletonnage.The Secretary of State for War also referred to the deleteriouseffect of the weekly broadcast attacks on the Government by theLeaders of the Labour Opposition. Another harmful example ofour propaganda had been mentioned to him by General Wavell, whosaid that the only British film which had so far reached Turkeyincluded a commentary on the sinking of H.M.S. Royal Oak and,as an illustration of conditions on the Western Front, a picture ofBritish Tommies baling water out of their tents.The Minister without Portfolio said that, by contrast with the morning papers, there was considerable room for improvement inthe manner in which news was presented by the evening newspapers.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Canada.Arrival of theFirst Canadiantroop convoy.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 117thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that hehad witnessed the arrival of the first Canadian troop convoy on theprevious day. It had been a most impressive sight as the giantliners, with their destroyer escort, had steamed past the cheeringbattleships and cruisers. Large numbers of Canadian and UnitedStates pressmen had been present, and many photographs had beentaken. He suggested that, although the publishing of photographsof our warships was now forbidden, this occasion might be treatedas a special case, as he felt sure that it would have the best possible effect at home and abroad if it could be given wide publicity.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that the maximumpublicity should be given, provided that national interests were notthereby prejudiced, and undertook in particular to examine whetherthe photographs of the arrival of the convoy could be publishedwithout detriment to security.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Dominion AirTrainingScheme.Formation and financing of squadrons ofthe royal canadian AirForce.(previous reference:WM. (39) 113thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. In the course of his statement on the Air Situation theSecretary of State for Air drew attention to the announcementfrom Ottawa in that morning&apos;s newspapers that the Agreement inregard to the Empire Air Training Scheme had been signed at Ottawa early on the previous day. The War Cabinet wouldremember that we had been asked to accept in principle thatCanadian personnel trained under the Scheme should, on the requestof the Canadian Government, be organised into units of the royal canadian Air Force for service in the Field, but that in view ofthe practical difficulties and of the financial considerations involvedin this proposal we had made the alternative suggestion containedin the telegrams to Lord Riverdale and the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Ottawa annexed to Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 148. Ineffect it was estimated that under these alternative proposals thenumber of Royal Canadian Air Force Squadrons would, in practice,be limited to 15.
Lord Riverdale had telephoned to the Secretary of State inthe early hours of Saturday, the 16th December, to say that he was having very great difficulty with Mr. Mackenzie King, and thatit would be necessary to accept the agreement as it stood and to devise a reply more acceptable to the Canadian Government thanthe one he had sent on the 9th December to the letter received on that day from Mr. Rogers, the Minister of National Defence.He asked for permission to agree in principle that all Canadiantrainees would go into R.C.A.F. units if the Canadian Govern-ment so requested, subject to the proviso that the details and method of applying this principle should be worked out sub-sequently by an inter-Governmental Committee.This formula which would be incorporated in a letter wasnot, however, satisfactory from our point of view, and the Secretaryof State for Air had instructed Lord Riverdale that he must standfast on the following alternative :  &quot; On the understanding that the numbers to be incorporated-rated at any time would be the subject of agreement betweenthe two Governments, the United Kingdom government accepted the principle, as being consonant with the intentionof paragraph 15 of the Memorandum of Agreement, that theUnited Kingdom Government, on the request of the canadian government, would agree to the incorporation of Canadianpupils, when passing out from the Training Scheme, into unitsof the Royal Canadian Air Force in the Field.&quot;On Sunday, the 17th December, Lord Riverdale had informed the Secretary of State for Air that, after much discussion with theCanadian Prime Minister, he had signed the Agreement with the alteration of the wording of the formula &quot;subject of agreement. . . . &quot; to read &quot; subject of discussion To this alterationhe (the Secretary of State for Air) had taken strong exception,but the difficulty was that Lord Riverdale had actually signed theAgreement, In these circumstances Lord Riverdale was againcommunicated with by telephone (on the 17th December) and invitedto write to Mr. Mackenzie King saying that the United KingdomGovernment assumed that the &apos;&apos; discussion &apos;&apos; envisaged in his letterto the Prime Minister would necessarily cover such questions as.the number, composition and organisation of the R.C.A.F. units to be eventually formed having regard to all the circumstances.They also assumed that the term &apos;&apos; discussion &apos;&apos; implied that agree-ment would, of course, be reached between the two governments on these points. Lord Riverdale, however, replied that the sending of such a letter to Mr. Mackenzie King at this juncture would belikely to spoil the greatly improved atmosphere of the last few days and might even put the agreement itself in peril. He stronglydeprecated such a letter being sent and declared that both he andAir Chief Marshal Sir R. Brooke-Popham had interpreted &quot; dis-cussion &quot; as meaning &quot; agreement,&quot; and this was the case withthe Canadian Prime Minister also.In these circumstances Lord Riverdale was informed that theletter reed not be sent to Mr. Mackenzie King and that we shouldrely on the interpretation of the word &apos;&apos; discussion &apos;&apos; which he had indicated. It was to be hoped that the outcome would be satis-factory, but in any case it should be noted that practical difficulties would in all probability prevent the formation of a larger numberof units of the R.C.A.F. than we in fact contemplated. TheChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs had been kept in touch with developments.The Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and the Secretary of State for Air had sent telegrams to;Mr. Mackenzie King expressing gratification at the signature ofthe Agreement.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that he had notsent any congratulatory telegram. What had brought matters toa head was Mr. Menzies&apos; statement which no doubt had been highlyembarrassing to Mr. Mackenzie King. So far as he, the Chancellorof the Exchequer, was concerned, he had not agreed that Canadacould insist on unlimited units of the R.C.A.F. being provided atthe expense of the United Kingdom tax payer.The Secretary of State for Air thought that in the end all would turn out right. A statement on the agreement for the Press wasbeing prepared and he proposed that the statement should be agreed with the Treasury before publication. In considering this matterregard should be had to the very great and real effort that Canadawas making in this and many other ways to help us to win the War.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that Mr. Crerar wasreturning to Canada without any agreement on the Wheat questionhaving been reached.The War Cabinet (a) Approved the action taken in regard to the signature ofthe Dominion Air Training Scheme Agreement.(b) Took note of the assurance given by Lord Riverdale thatthe Canadians interpreted the expression &quot; subject ofdiscussion between the two Governments&quot; as havingprecisely the same meaning as the expression &quot; subjectof agreement between the two Governments.&quot;(c) Invited the Secretary of State for Air, in consultation with.the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to prepare and issue to the Press an explanatory statement regarding those parts of the Agreement which could be made publicwithout detriment to the national interest.Co-operation ofthe Union ofSouth Africa.Proposal fromGeneral Smutsto dispatchtroops and air squadrons toKenva.08. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (G.) (39) 149) on thesubject of a proposal made by General Smuts to send, in the nearfuture, a brigade of Union troops and several South African air squadrons as a, precautionary measure to Kenya.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theUnion High Commissioner had come to see him, and had shown him a telegram from General Smuts, dated the 7th December, 1939, acopy of which was attached to the Memorandum, in which general smuts made the above proposal, apparently as a result of aconference with the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, and afterthe receipt of full intelligence reports from Nairobi. -No information was available to show what in these intelligencereports might have led General Smuts to consider the despatch ofthese forces necessary; and, indeed, it was possible that the realmotive underlying the offer was keenness on the part of general smuts that South Africa should take some share in the war.Our policy in Africa, and the Middle East generally, was basedon our desire not to provoke Italy, and for this reason there did notappear to be good grounds for encouraging the sending of land forces from the Union of South Africa to Kenya. SouthernRhodesia and the East African Colonies might also hesitate to welcome these troops if no active operations were in sight. Forthese reasons it was proposed to reply to General Smuts with atactful refusal of this part of his offer.On the other hand, there was a good deal to be said for the move of air squadrons to Kenya, where they would not only relieve the Southern Rhodesian Squadron to go to Egypt, but would bewell placed themselves for a subsequent move to the Middle East,if South Africa ever agreed to such a course. It was proposed,therefore, to accept this part of the offer, and to arrange for the move to take place as soon as accommodation could be prepared.
It had been thought right to make it clear to the South African-Government that the present proposals could not in any way effect the low priority which had been allotted to the equipment whichthey had asked us to supply for their forces. The opportunity had also been taken to tell General Smuts of our proposal to form an african Division from East and West Africa.A copy of the proposed reply was attached to his Memorandum.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor Air expressed their agreement with the line of action proposedby the Dominions Secretary.The War Cabinet :-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs set out in his Memorandum W.P. (G.)(39) 149, and authorised him to reply to General Smuts onthe lines of the aide-memoire attached to that Memo-randum.Finland. 9.   The Secretary of State for Air informed the War cabinet supply of that the 20 Gladiators would leave this country for Finland on theaircraft. 24th December.   In the meanwhile, it had been suggested to the(Previous Swedish  Government  that  they  should  supply  Finland  withReference: 20 Gladiators forthwith, accepting the 20 from Great Britain in w.M. (39) 117th replacement.Conclusions, The Chief of the Air Staff said that the original FinnishMinute 6.) request had been for 30 Gladiators, and the Finnish Minister had asked him whether the extra 10 could now be supplied. The Finnish minister had also produced a list of British volunteers who wishedto join the Finnish Air Force and he had asked whether there wasanyone on the list suitable for carrying out selection duties. He(the Chief of the Air Staff) had promised to give the Finnish minister an estimate of the value of the individuals on his list, but had pointed out that the matter had political implications.The Secretary of State for War said that he had informedM. Gripenberg that there would be no objection to his accepting the offer of service for ambulance work in Finland of Britishconscientious objectors.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the Union Government had agreed to divert to finland the Gauntlet aircraft sold to them. The Union Govern-ment hoped, however, that the Air Ministry would do their best toreplace these aircraft in some way, at a later date.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said that theGauntlets, although not quite so modern as the Gladiators, were equally suitable for operation in Finland at the present time of year.The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office had found it possible to release some further equipment for Finland,including a number of 4-5 Howitzers.The War Cabinet agreed (i) To request the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,after consultation as regards publicity with the. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to thank general smuts for his offer to divert to Finland the Gauntletssold to the Union Government, which we gratefullyaccepted; and to say that we hoped to be able at a later date to replace the Gauntlets in question,(ii) That wide publicity should be given to the generous actionof the Union Government in the matter, provided thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saw noobjection to this course.
0Italy.Statement by italian PressAttache in tokyo.10. The Minister without Portfolio drew attention to telegram No. 1637, dated the 16th December, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, in which Sir Robert Craigie reportedthat the Italian Press Attache in Tokyo had given to the Press onthe 12th December, 1939, an interview which ha,d been published byAsahi, in which he was reported to have said that, while Germanydid not yet regard Italian armed assistance as necessary, Italy wasnone the less always on the side of Germany as a, loyal party to theGerman-Italian military alliance, and that, if armed assistance toGermany became necessary, Italy would move at any time.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, that he hadalready given instructions that Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s telegram shouldbe passed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, for such action ashe might think appropriate.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Balkans.(previous reference:WM. (39) 115thConclusions,Minute 2.)RelationsbetweenBulgaria and roumania.The Balkans.Attitude ofItaly.   ;(previous reference:W.M. (39) 116thConclusions,Minute 9.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the situation in the balkans&apos; (W.P. (39) 165).. The Secretary of State for Foreign A. flairs said that he had circulated this paper in order to give the War Cabinet a generalpicture of the situation in the Balkans, and it called for no decision at the moment. Everything pointed to the policies of the balkan countries, as also to our policy in that area, being dependent uponthe attitude of Italy and Turkey. Among the Balkan countriesthemselves, the position of Bulgaria was at the moment ofparticular importance. The War Cabinet would recollect thatM. Numan Menemencioglu, the Secretary-General of the turksh foreign Office, proposed to break his journey to Turkey at Sofia inorder to discuss the situation with Mr. Rendel. M. Menemencioglufelt that it would be very difficult for Roumania herself to give any direct promise to Bulgaria on the subject of the Dobrudja, in view ofthe risk that such action would encourage Hungary to insist on herterritorial claims in Transylvania. He accordingly proposed todiscuss with Mr. Rendel the possibility of persuading Roumaniato authorise Turkey to promise Bulgaria satisfaction on thisquestion at the end of the war.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that itwas clear from telegram No. 1243, dated the 16th December, 1939*from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, that it would be necessaryto proceed with the utmost caution in the matter of Staff Conver-sations with Greece, Roumania and Yugoslavia. It would, hethought, be useful if during the forthcoming meeting of the supreme war Council he and the Prime Minister were to discuss thisquestion with the French Government and to endeavour to agreewith them upon a classification showing respectively those measureswhich we could safely take without informing Italy, and those whichwe could not. He did not anticipate any difficulty in reaching agreement with the French on this matter. The more he studiedthe problem, the more averse he was, however, from our giving any encouragement to the French Government to embark on staff conversations behind the backs of the Italians.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that it would be useful for this matter to be raised by the Foreign Secretary while in Paris.The War Cabinet took note that this matter would beraised at the forthcoming Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil.[20505]c
Turkey.Visit of M.Menemencioglu.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 112thConclusions,Minutes 12-and 13.)13. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that prior toleaving for Paris M. Numan Menemencioglu had called on him atthe Treasury and had expressed great satisfaction at his reception in this country and on the outcome of his visit. It remained nowto be seen how far M. Menemencioglu would succeed in persuading the French Government to satisfy Turkish requirements. It wouldbe necessary for ourselves also to discuss with the French Govern-ment the proportion in which our two countries were to share theexpenditure involved in the large purchases of sultanas, nuts, &amp;o,which had been agreed upon. Our proposal was that the french should contribute  700,000 as compared to an expenditure of 1,300,000 by ourselves. The latter figure included, however, acertain amount of expenditure which we had already undertaken to incur in Turkey before our negotiations with M. Menemencioglu.It was clear that the bargain between the Minister for economic warfare was strictly limited to chrome, the Turkish Governmentrefusing at present to bind themselves not to dispose of otherTurkish commodities to Germany. As regards the gold to be delivered to Turkey under the Gold Loan, M. Menemencioglu had insisted that delivery should take place at Ankara and had beenaverse to the gold being transported in a Turkish warship. it seemed clear that we should have to make arrangements for thetransport either the whole way by sea or overland by Marseillesand. thence by sea. In general, he (the Chancellor of theExchequer) considered that the result of the negotiations could beregarded as fairly satisfactory.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatM. Menemencioglu had spoken in much the same terms on his finalcall at the Foreign Office. He had expressed the greatest gratifica-tion at the help given by the Minister for Co-ordination of defence in the matter of anti-tank guns, and he had said that he hopedthat, if the French Government agreed to afford similar assistance,it would be possible for him to sign the necessary Protocol bringing the Suspensive Clause to an end.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Scandinavia.The existing situation andthe PossibleResults of theRussianInvasion off inland.(previous references:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 6, andW.M. (39) 116thConclusions,Minute 8.)14. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (39) 16%on theSituation in Scandinavia and the Possible Results of the RussianInvasion of Finland.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thepurpose of his Memorandum was to afford the War Cabinet anopportunity for a general discussion on the situation which had arisen in Scandinavia as a result of the Russian invasion of Finland.He did not envisage that the War Cabinet would be able to take any immediate decisions on the action which we might or mightnot take, as this must largely depend on military and strategicalconsiderations. He therefore had in mind that, after a preliminary discussion of the broader issues involved, the War Cabinet should refer the question to the Chiefs of Staff for their advice as to themilitary steps which they considered feasible after examining theproblem from the technical point of view.The Foreign Secretary drew particular attention to thefollowing points in his Memorandum : (i) The two alternative possibilities as set out in paragraph-2,viz. : (a) an early collapse of Finland, which might result inthe Russians going on to make demands onSweden; or(b) an effective resistance by the Finns, which mighttempt the Russians to put some of the blame onSweden and to demand her complete neutrality.
(ii) The situation, as described in paragraph 7, which might arise between Germany and Sweden, in the event of theSoviet Government making unacceptable demands onSweden as a result of exasperation at Swedish unofficialhelp to Finland, and consequently arousing the anxietyof Germany about the possibility of a stoppage of swedish iron-ore supplies,(iii) The difficulties which would confront us from the military point of view (as described in paragraph 8) shouldGermany feel it necessary to intervene in Sweden inorder to safeguard her supplies of iron-ore from the threat of a Soviet invasion.The First Lard of the Admiralty said that he by no means took a pessimistic view of possible developments in Scandinavia,resulting from the present conflict between Russia and Finland.It was possible that the war on the Western Front might intensify;but if, on the other hand, it were to expand and extend to norway and Sweden, he sa.w no cause for alarm. Indeed, he considered thatwe had everything to gain by the war spreading to those countriesso long as we retained our command of the sea. The existingneutrality of Norway and Sweden was a source of embarrassment to us, and of considerable advantage and profit to Germany. Inparticular, the deeply indented Norwegian coast, with its shelteringcorridor of territorial waters, extending the whole way from north to South, was in present circumstances a serious hindrance tous. If, however, Germany attempted an overlordship of scandinavia, it would give us the opportunity to take what we wanted, and this, with our sea power, we could do. There wereislands where we should be able, at will, to establish sea and air bases. If Narvik, with its supplies of iron-ore, were to fall, it wouldhe to us and not the enemy an operation which, he suggested,should be studied in detail in advance. If land operations became necessary, it would be perfectly feasible to land British and french troops in Norway, wmere the mountainous nature of the country,which excluded the use of tanks and similar mechanised equipment of which&apos; we were short, might even be an advantage to us. we might, at a later stage, even be able to establish air bases in thesouth of the peninsula, and so intervene in the Baltic.For these reasons the First Lord considered that we hadeverything to gain and nothing to lose by the drawing of norway and Sweden into the war. So many political and strategicalconsiderations, however, were involved that he suggested that theycould be more conveniently reviewed in the first place by theMilitary Co-ordination Committee than by the War Cabinet as awhole. He therefore proposed that the broader aspects of theproblem should be examined by Lord Chatfield&apos;s Committee with aview to exploring the political possibilities of the action which itmight be considered desirable to take in Norway and Sweden, andthat, when this had been done, the conclusions of this Committeeshould be referred to the Chiefs of Staff Committee to report on the praticability, in the light of the strategical and technical aspects,of giving effect to the desired policy. The matter would thenultimately be brought before the War Cabinet for a decision.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had been anxious about therecent drift of political opinion in Sweden and Norway. Hereminded the War Cabinet of the strong and helpful influence which our Ministers in those countries had been able to exert inour favour during the last war, and asked whether it might notbe possible to take similar action in Oslo and Stockholm now.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that Norway and sweden found themselves very much in the same position as belgium and the other smaller neutral countries, in hoping, fervently, thatthey might escape being drawn into the war, and. in framing theirpolicy accordingly. If, however, the point came when the policyof &quot; sweet reasonableness &quot; failed, he felt that they would surely
turn to us, rather than to the Germans, realising, as they must,,that we should leave them alone at the end of the war.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed. norway and Sweden were going through a stage of inner conflict, hoping that the storm would pass over them without breaking. Meanwhile,it should not be supposed that our representatives at Stockholm andOslo had not been active in promoting our interests. He mentioned that the French Ambassador had recently been to see him to ask whether&apos; we could not do more by way of supporting Finland,Norway and Sweden. He (the Foreign Secretary) had replied thatwe were at one with the French in regarding it as our primeinterest to encourage and fortify those countries. The difficulty was that the French were apt to think that words were as effective as deeds. He hoped to have an opportunity of discussing the matter with M. Daladier in the sense of the views expressed by the WarCabinet in the present discussion.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary indicated that the netbalance of the changes which had taken place in Sweden had resulted in a stronger Government. It had to be realised, however,that the Scandinavian countries were all obsessed with a passionatedesire that we should stop the War with Germany. Russia, in theiropinion, was the real danger.At this stage he was not, perhaps, prepared to go the wholeway with the First Lord in believing that it would be to our benefitto involve Norway and Sweden in the war at once, though heentirely agreed with his estimate of the advantages which we wouldderive if the war should happen to extend to those areas.He was in favour of having the question examined by theMilitary Co-ordination Committee, and the Chiefs of Staff, on the-lines suggested by the First Lord, but thought it would be desirablethat the meetings of the former should be attended by a ForeignOffice representative.The Secretary of State for War said that the essence of ourproblem in helping all these small countries was to be measured by our ability to supply them with arms.The Minister without Portfolio said that the more we could do to help the Finns and to stiffen the attitude of Norway and sweden, the easier would it be for us to deal with the problem ofthe stopping of ore supplies from Narvik to Germany, and thiswould be a sure way of shortening the war.The War Cabinet took note of the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (39) 164) on thesituation in Scandinavia and the possible results of the Russianinvasion of Finland, and agreed (1) To invite the Military Co-ordination Committee, with theadvice of a Foreign Office representative (a) to explore the political possibilities of the actionwhich it might be considered desirable andfeasible to take in Norway and Sweden, in thelight of the possible results of the present Russianinvasion of Finland as set forth in W.P. (39) 164;(b) after considering as in (a) above the general policywhich should govern our action, to invite trie-Chiefs of Staff Committee to report on the.strategical and technical practicability of sucha policy.(2) To report the results of (1) above to the War Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,December 18, 1939.
