The First Lord of the Admiralty said that two of our destroyers had been in collision and had sustained a certain amountof damage. The mine-layer Adventurer had struck a mine, andBlanche, one of her escorting destroyers, had also been mined and seriously damaged. It was hoped that the former ship would bebrought safely back to harbour, but the latter had sunk.The First Lord mentioned a report from neutral sources whichhad reached the French, according to which it appeared that a totalof 33 German submarines had been lost, were several days overdue,or had been badly damaged. It Was interesting to note that this total of 33 exactly coincided with the number of; submarines whichthe Admiralty assessed as being destroyed, possibly destroyed or seriously damaged.The German merchant ship Mecklenburg had been stopped byone of our cruisers North of Iceland, but, in spite of very roughweather, the crew had scuttled their ship and taken to the boats.Fifty-six survivors had been picked up. Eight&quot; German ships had sailed from Vigo, and the French Navy were taking steps to inter-cept them. A British merchant ship which had run aground hadnot yet been re-floated.The Captain of a Norwegian vessel reported that he had been stopped by the Deutschland 600 miles north-east of Newfoundlandon the 4th November.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.3. The Secretary of State for War said that one more division hand been identified in the Aachen area. There now appeared to bea total of 59 divisions North of the Moselle.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference erence:W.M.

source that there were between 15 and 20 German aircraft at Soesterberg. The majority  were said to be dese?, and the crewe had been interred. The fact was being kept out of the Netherland press. 

The War Cabinet-

Invited the Secretary of State for Air to make further enquiries into this report.

The Netherlands. The grant of asylum to Queen Wilhelmina, the Government and the ex-Kaiser in the event of a German invasion.

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 197, dated the 11th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, The Hague, asking whether, in the event of German invasion of the Netherlands, we should be prepared to grant asylum in this country to Queen Wilhelmina and her family and to the Netherland Government. No approach had been made to him on this question, but he was anxious to be able to give an immediate answer if the question were asked.

The War Cabinet agreed-

That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform His Majesty&apos;s Minister, The Hague-

(a) that, if the question were put to him officially, he was authorised to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to grant asylum in this country to Queen Wilhelmina and her family and to the Netherland Government;

(b) that, as regards the ex-Kaiser, we should greatly prefer that arrangements should be made for him to find asylum in Sweden, but that, if this were to prove impracticable, we should in the last resort be prepared to receive him and members of his family in this country.

Italy. Anglo-Italian trade relations. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 78th Conclusions, Minute 7, and 55th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 1119, dated the 10th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Chargé d&apos;Affaires, Rome, in which sir Noel Charles reported having learnt privately from quarters which had nothing to do with officialdom, and were obviously actuated by genuine friendship for us, that there was a feeling of irritation and disappointment in Italian official circles, both at our slowness in making purchases in Italy and at our delays in dealing with their complaints about our contraband measures. Sir Noel Charles urged that a special endeavour should be made to maintain Italian goodwill by hastening the steps under consideration to expend our trade with Italy, and the paying more regard to their demands, where reasonable, on the subject of contraband control.

The Secretary of State added that he was taking up with the Departments concerned the questions raised by Sir Noel Charles, on which it was, on general grounds, very important to meet the Italian point of view so far as possible.

The Secretary of state for War that he was advised by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that the Italians had a gun suitable for use against tanks and against low flying aircraft. This would be of value to us. He would take up the matter at once with the Ministry of Supply and the Treasury.




The Secretary of State for Air said that, as the result of discussions which had taken place, he hoped to see the Chancellor of the Exchequer later in the day and to reach a definite decision on the question of the immediate purchase of air material from Italy.

The War Cabinet-

(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to draw the attention of the Departments concerned to telegram No. 1119 from His Majesty&apos;s Chargé d&apos;Affaires, Rome.

(2) Recorded the view that the considerations urged in that telegram were of great importance.

The Far Eastern Situation. Japanese expansion and opinion in the United States.(previous reference: W.M.(39) 68th Conclusions,Minute 6.)

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 747 dated the 10th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, in which Lord Lothian reported that feeling against Japan was quite likely to demand intensification of economic pressure against that country when the question of a reversal of the recent denunciation of the trade-treaty came before Congress next January. If Japan began to expand outside the China sea zone in which her supremacy was recognised by the Washington treaties, there would, Lord Lothian considered, be a powerful movement to stop her. He did not believe that public opinion would now stand aside if the independence of the Philippines were challenged by Japan. If, however, Japan left the Philippines alone and concentrated on British possessions(other than Australia and New Zealand) and the Netherland East Indies, the reaction of American public opinion would be far slower. But partly because the Central Pacific was now regarded as a kind of American preserve, partly because the expansion of Japan overseas would eventually threaten the Monroe Doctrine and partly because a war with Japan Would probably not involve sending abroad vast armies of conscripts, he (Lord Lothian) thought that long before Japanese action threatened Australia or New Zealand, the United States would be at war. This probability was probably enhanced by the fact that the Army and Navy, and a great many publicists, though not yet public opinion, recognised clearly that the present form of American security and the Monroe Doctrine was in the long run just as dependent upon the British, as on the American, Navy.

The War Cabinet, took note of the above statement.

Air Pollcy. (Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 77th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

10. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on Air Policy (paper W.P. (39) 118).

The Chief of the Air Staff explained that the Chiefs of staff had in preparation a further Paper dealing with Air Policy if had in preparation a further Paper dealing with Air Policy if Germany invaded Holland but the Belgians did not call on the Allies for assistance. This Paper would be circulated to the War Cabinet in the course of day.

After a short discussion the War Cabinet agreed :-

(i) To invite the Military Co-ordination Committee, in consultation with the Chief of the Air Staff to examine our plan for air attack on military objectives in Germany
