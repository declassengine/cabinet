The Air Situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet that no detailed account had yet been received from the French of their successful attack on German raiding aircraft the previous day, in which the Press had reported a total of 9 German aircraft as having been brought down. The French only claimed officially to have shot down 4, but he would try and obtain further details.

The Royal Air Force had carried out a number of reconnaissances over North-West Germany on the previous day. During one flight photographs of the Siegfried Line from Heinsburg to Geldern had been taken, and 5 destroyers and 2 cruisers had been seen anchored 1 mile south of Borkum. Another photographic reconnaissance had been carried out of the Munster-Rheine area without opposition. A balloon barrage 8 miles north-west of Rheine had been seen, which was disposed in the form of a ring at an estimated height of 6,000 to 7,000 feet. Many barges had been seen on the River Rhine heading downstream, mostly in the stretch Duisburg-Hamborn. A reconnaissance of the area north of the line Munster-Borkum, accompanied by 3 Hurricanes, had located many aircraft dispersed on the Kamen aerodrome. Of 2 aircraft on another reconnaissance, one had made a forced landing in France and the other was missing.

Leaflets had been dropped by balloons over Germany on the night of 4th-5th November.

Normal Coastal Command activity had been carried on. A considerable number of enemy aircraft had been observed over the centre of the North Sea and off the coast of Holland. It was quite possible that these were engaged on meteorological work.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Naval Operations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the first outward-bound convoy for Scandinavia was leaving that day under escort to Bergen. A 52-ship Atlantic convoy had arrived safely in home waters and had split up for dispersal to home ports.

The report of the presence of 2 cruisers and 5 destroyers in all off Borkum, to which the Secretary of State for Air had referred, had been delayed in transmission to the Admiralty and, in consequence, it had not been possible to take steps to attack these vessels.

Aircraft had reported 2 ships&apos; lifeboats full of men about 60 miles east of Great Yarmouth the previous afternoon. Destroyers had been sent to investigate.

There had been air attacks on the 5th Minesweeping Flotilla and the Polish destroyers and a German aircraft had flown over the Shetlands, but no damage had been sustained. It seamed as if the Germans received very early information of the movement of our ships into the North Sea.

Information had just come in that one of our destroyers was at that moment attacking a submarine.

There had been no attacks on trade during the previous day, though on the 4th November a Norwegian tanker had been stopped by a U-boat which had demanded oil. This had been refused, but no hostile action had been taken by the submarine. A German ship of 7,60? tons had been captured in the South Atlantic. She had been sighted 300 miles south-west of Freetown by aircraft from the Ark Royal.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
Security of Fleet Bases. Scapa Flow (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 63rd Conclusions, Minute 3.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet that he had now completed his study of Admiral Drax&apos;s Report on the circumstances of the sinking of the Royal Oak and of the condition of the defences of Scapa Flow, together with the comments of the Second and Fourth Sea Lords upon the Report.

Considerable discussion took place on the facts elicited in this enquiry, and on the terms of the statement which should be made by the First Lord in the House of Commons. Details of this discussion are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.  There was general agreement that the First Lord&apos;s Statement should be made on Wednesday, 8th November, as originally proposed, and that it should follow the general lines agreed at the previous discussion in the War Cabinet.

The First Lord undertook to read the draft of his Statement to the War Cabinet at their next meeting.

The Military Situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 3.)

4. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.

It had become evident that the minor roads in France would not stand up to the strain of heavy mechanical transport during the coming winter. In consequence, the Government of India had been approached, and had agreed to send four Animal Transport companies to relieve the situation. These would be the first Indian troops to go to France, and their arrival would be opportune evidence of the Imperial contribution.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



The Air Strengths of Great Britain, France and Germany. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 7.)

5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on the Air strengths of Great Britain, France and Germany (Paper W.P. (39) 102).

The discussion on this Paper is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet agreed:-

(1) To take note of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (39) 102).

(2) To invite the Secretary of State for Air to submit the following further Papers to the War Cabinet:-

(a) beginning on the 1st January, 1940, quarterly statements giving particulars for the ensuing six months on the same lines as those given in W.P. (39) 102:

(b) a statement showing what percentage of the total capacity of the aircraft industry would be devoted to the construction of the new heavy bombers (the Halifax and Manchester Classes) when these types were in full production:

(c) detailed analyses showing-

(i) the total production of aircraft of each main type (e.g., fighters, bombers, trainers, &amp;c.), between the 1st April, 1939, and the 1st October, 1939, and the purposes to which the aircraft in each of these main types were put;

(ii) a similar statement in respect of the anticipated total production of aircraft between the 1st October, 1939, and the 1st March, 1940;
