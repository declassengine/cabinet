The Chief of Naval Staff informed the War Cabinet thatno attacks had been carried out against British ships, althoughfive German submarines were believed to be at sea.The report mentioned the previous day that the S.S. Coulmarhad been attacked East of Halifax, Nova Scotia, had since proved to have been without foundation.A report had been received that a German armed merchantmanwas in the Gulf of Guinea.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.3. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat a Coastal Command aircraft had sighted a merchant vesselresembling the description of S.S. City of Flint at 12-45 hours on theprevious day, south-west of Bremanger Island on the norwegian coast. This information had been passed to two of our cruisers.The Chief of Naval Staff said that the cruisers had been sentto points off the Norwegian coast, where it was thought that theCity of Flint might be forced to leave Territorial Waters, but shewas not discovered until midnight (2nd-3rd November), when shewas found by H.M.S. Glasgow inside Territorial. Waters under the escort of a Norwegian minelayer. The Admiralty felt that therewould be grave objection to taking any action against the City&apos; ofFlint while in; Territorial.Waters, and escorted by a Norwegianvessel. As she had then reached a point where it would be possiblefor her to continue her journey to the Skager Rack without having to go outside Territorial Waters, orders&apos;had therefore been issued to call off the hunt. The matter had been reported by telephone tothe Foreign Office late the same night.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that this information had at once been passed on by the Foreign Office tothe United States Embassy. He endorsed the action of theAdmiralty in taking no steps against the City of Flint. It would now.be for the United States Government to lodge such objectionas they ihight wish..The Chief of Naval Staff, said that the Admiralty felt thatsome announcement in the Press was desirable. After some discussion it Was agreed; that a brief announcement should be made,confined to stating the facts that the City of Flint had been sightedwithin Territorial Waters, and that she could so proceed until-ehlierMTook note of these statements and authorised  theAdmiralty to&apos;&apos;&apos;iss^^JDom^vnique to theD -a:

The Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister without portfolio gave to the War Cabinet certain highly secret information on the subject of Roumanian Oil Supplies, the details of whichhave been placed on the Secretary^ Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprevious day he had been informed by Dr. Benes that the GermanGovernment had proposed to the Prague Government that PresidentHacha and one of his colleagues should proceed to Berlin, wherethey would be asked to sign a pact of fellowship and friendship with Germany, in return for which the Polish territory of Teschenwould be restored to the Czech Protectorate. President Hacha had consulted Dr. Benes as to the line which should be taken, and hehad replied that the German Governments offer should foe refused.This might indicate the difficulties now being experienced by theGerman Government in Czecho-Slovakia.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Balkans.Plan for theformation of a neutral bloc.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams, dated the 2nd November, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara :-No. 704, reporting that he had been informed by theSecretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Office that the. Roumanian Government had submitted to the Turkish Govern-meht a proposal for the establishment Of a Balkan pact of neutrality in the present conflict, the pact to include the BalkanEntente, Bulgaria, Hungary and Italy.No. 705, giving the basis of &quot;the/Roumanian governments plans as follows: -complete neutrality in existing, conflict;non-aggression between members of the bloc withmaintenance of.:&apos;exi&apos;stihg-.Mobligatibns^ :of^mutual. assistance: ^between:-certainlparticipants (i.e., con-tinuance o  Balkan EMei ^e);(c) in the event of aggression from outside on one memberle btherc &quot;arxld bW&amp;: 11 cz-italy that.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 174, dated the 2nd November, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Helsingfors, reporting that he had beeninformed that afternoon by the Director-General of the FinnishForeign Office that M. Molotov&apos;s speech had contained no surprisesand had accurately reflected the Soviet Government&apos;^ proposals;The discussion which had ensued between the Director-Generaland Mr. Snow might be summarised as follows : -The Finnish Government noted as a further favourablesign that M. Molotov had abstained from specifying by nameany particular naval base in Finland. On Mr. Snow asking whether this was the question on which the Minister forForeign Affairs had informed him that no adjustment was insight, the Director-General had given a strong indication thatthis was so. The Director-General agreed that, althoughM. Molotov&apos;s action had been unusual, his speech had notessentially affected the- possibility of an agreement being reached; and he confirmed that the Soviet demands were atpresent as follows :-(a) a new frontier in the Karelian isthmus;the demilitarisation of each side of the new frontier;the cession of the Finnish portion of the Kolapeninsula;a naval base at the outlet of the Finnish Gulf;the cession of islands in the Finnish Gulf.u-W.The Soviet Government had indicated that they woulobject to Finland fortifying the Aaland Islands, provided thatin this matter Finland acted alone. The Director-Generalpointed^ out to Mr Snow that proposals (a) and (6) afooveinvolved the abandonment of carefclly-prepared and veTyvaluable Finnish defence works, and woulS for this reason besubject to strong military and popular objection. tK wasno objection to proposal (c), and proposal (d) had already been; discussed;..

&quot;ifcssThe Prime Minister thought that&apos; it was significant- that inthe account of M. Molotov&apos;s speech published in Pravda no referencehad been made to. the passage relating to Finland.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said&apos;that&quot;he-had.no definite information regarding the attitude of Germany towardsthe Finnish-Soviet dispute, though there was reason to believe thatGermany was providing transit facilities for the passage to Finlandof war material from Italy and Yugoslavia. He agreed that itwould be of interest to know the real nature of Germany&apos;s intentions in this matter, and he proposed to ask Mr. Snow to submit a reportin the light of such information as was obtainable in Helsingfors.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Relaxation of(Sonteols amiESestoPiisMoms.Attitude of thePress.9. The Lord Privy Seal raised the question of the relaxation of controls and restrictions in the light of the growing volume ofcriticisms directed against the Government&apos;s activities. The WarCabinet also had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofInformation on the attitude of the Press to the activities of theCivil Departments (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 65).The Lord Privy Seal said that he had discussed the questionof controls and restrictions with a number of representative people.His impression was. that people were in general willing to acceptcontrols if they were convinced that they were justified; but thatthey were not at present satisfied as to the Governments policy ona number of points. They did not, for example, understand theneed for the commandeering of buildings; they had questioned theneed for rationing coal, while miners were still unemployed; andthere had also been criticisms of a number of economic controls, onthe ground that the people administering them were not altogetherimpartial owing to their business affiliations. It was true thatthe Minister of Supply had very quickly put matters right wheninstances of this last kind of complaint had been brought to hisnotice, but he (the Lord Privy Seal) thought that the time had cometo carry out a survey to enable the various Departments to satisfy themselves whether the various controls which they were operatingwere necessary under the conditions actually existing. The result would make it possible to issue a general statement giving a broadpicture of the Government&apos;s policy. It was necessary to give thepublic the impression that the position was being watched and that departments were not letting controls run on without regard tochanging circumstances.In the general discussion which ensued, the following were themain points put forward :-(1) In a number of cases control had already been relaxed, e.g.,in regard to the rationing of coal.(2)&apos; The whole purpose of the control of:food prices, was to keepdown the cost of. living.  In-spite of all-that had Iressaid about &quot; pools,&quot; there had in fact bs3a nzvg owofood commodities pooled (margarine and dried fruit),and the Ministry of Food were already considering- - -       - w** (P*3srwas&quot;assssseaire wwifeMK4te-.v&apos;* .jeusfe*&apos;*m_____ . ,\- .. ii-1      ...   ,-fi.    -   ...........-.  ....  i , ..----
that by reducing consumption in this way, they were making sacrifices which would help us to win the war.

(4) It was desirable to present to the public in one statement a picture of all the relaxations which had been effected.

(5) There was a strong case for a Ministerial Inquiry into the controls, but it by no means followed that the Inquiry should be undertaken by a new War Cabinet Committee. In view of the regular meetings of the Home Policy Committee, the Economic Policy Committee and the Civil Defence Committee, there was not much ground left for a new Committee to cover.

(6) On the other hand, it was undesirable to announce that a survey of controls was intended. This would be taken as further evidence of incompetence on the part of Government Departments.

(7) In the present temper of the Press, it could not be expected that any relaxation of particular controls, or any general modification of policy, would be allowed to redound to the Government&apos;s credit. Any changes introduced were more likely to be fastened upon as proof of "bureaucratic incompetence" or "Whitehall muddle" in the past.

(8) One cause of the discontent in Press circles, and of the attacks on the Government, was the absence of real war news. To the extent that good stories were available, the attacks on Government Departments might be expected to die down.

(9) On the other hand, it was pointed out that some of the cheaper newspapers were devoting daily space as a regular feature to alleged examples of "muddle."

(10) The attitude of the Press might perhaps be partly due to annoyance at the loss of advertisement revenue, as controls and pooling inevitably led to a decrease in the advertisement of particular brands of the articles concerned.

(11) It was suggested that the fundamental cause of the attacks was the absence of good relations between the Government and the Press. It had become the deliberate policy of many newspapers to seize every opportunity of disparaging the Government, and space was not accorded to replies to attacks made on Government Departments.

(12) No doubt the misstatements in the Press had little permanent effect on public opinion. The real danger lay in its effect abroad. The attacks now being made on the Government had become the daily provender of the German Press and the German wireless. The German public was thus led to believe that we lacked the means or the heart to carry on the war to a conclusion, and that our Government, being incompetent at home, were certain to be incompetent in the field. A similar effect was produced in neutral countries. We could not afford to allow this state of affairs to continue.

The Minister of Information thought it was important to distinguish between legitimate criticism and mere jeering. Legitimate criticism was sometimes useful to the Government itself. It was doubtful, however,whether we could tolerate any longer the derisive criticism which held the Government up to "public contempt" at home and abroad.

The Prime Minister said that the Press attacks which the War Cabinet had been discussing amounted to a mass-produced and artificial agitation, which bore no relation to any spontaneous &apos;feeling of indignation in the country. The explanation of so unpatriotic a

The only means by which the Government could deaLwifch the situation were,first, that the charges made by the Press must be demonstrated to befalse or exaggerated; and secondly, a patriotic appeal must be madeto the newspaper proprietors. While this would probably have some immediate efect, he doubted whether it would last long.The Prime Minister added that he thought that the press campaing against the Government was purely commercial and hadno Party origin.The War Cabinet agreed-(i) To invite the Lord Privy Seal to consult with the individual ministers concerned as to the position in regard to the controls and restrictions now in operation and the case for any relaxation thereof. The Lord Privy Seal&apos;senquiry would be largely of a fact-finding character, andmight be expected to form the basis for a statement of theposition in Parliament.(ii) That this enquiry should not restrain any Minister fromaction to terminate or modify a control if, in his view,such action was called for.(iii) To invite the Prime. Minister to consider the best methodof approaching the newspaper proprietors with a viewto securing a cessation of the present Press campaign against the Government, bearing in mind especially theharmful effect of this campaign upon opinion abroad.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,November 3, 1939.
