The Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff gave the War Cabinet an account of the visit whichtJhey had paid to General Gamelin that day. In the course of thisvisit they had discussed the position in the event of Germanaggression against Holland and Belgium.A discussion ensued regarding the Naval, Military and Airaction which it might be necessary for this country to take in theevent of a German invasion of either of these two countries. Inparticular, discussion took place in regard to the Air policy to beadopted in this contingency, and it was agreed that this mattershould be the subject of discussion with the French, probably atthe Supreme War Council, at an early date.The War Cabinet again considered the question of StaffConversations with the Belgian Government, and authorised theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to despatch a telegram toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels, instructing him to representto the Belgian Government the urgent need for such Conversations,in view of the fact that the recent trend of events pointed to thepossibility of an imminent attack by German forces on Hollandor Belgium.A full account of the discussion, together with the detailedConclusions reached by the War Cabinet, is recorded on theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Protection of 2.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty suggested that a largerCentre of measure of protection against some outrage by subversive or hostileGovernment. elements should be provided for the centre of Government inWhitehall. There was a considerable number of enemy agents stillat large in this country. It would seem prudent to establish militarypickets and patrols in Whitehall and Downing Street.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe had been considering the problem that very afternoon. It wouldbe difficult to prevent an act of violence taking place, unless aconsiderable force of armed police were always available. Eventhen the police might be unable to prevent violence, but should beable to apprehend the perpetrators. He was not in favour of usingmilitary forces for this purpose, as reinforcements could alwaysbe brought to the threatened point at short notice, if necessary.There was general agreement that some steps should be takenin accordance with the suggestion of the First Lord of theAdmiralty.The War Cabinet :-Took note that the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity was examining the provision of a greater meansof armed police protection for vital Government centresin Whitehall.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I,November , 1939.
