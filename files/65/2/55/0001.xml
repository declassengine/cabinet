India and the 1.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumWar. by the Secretary of State for India (W.P. (G.) (39) 154) covering : Questions raised (a) a letter from Mr. Jinnah to the Viceroy, dated the 5thby Mr. Jinnah November ;on behalf of the (6) the draft of a reply from the Viceroy to Mr. Jinnah.All-IndiaMoslem League.        The Secretary of State for India said that, as explained m the(Previous Memorandum, the only point on which he and the Viceroy had not reference: at first been in complete agreement was as to the answer to be givenWM. (39) 91st to Mr. Jinnah&apos;s first question.   The Viceroy had, however, nowConclusions, stated that he preferred the draft reply proposed by him (the minute 13.) Secretary of State for India).The following points emerged in discussion : (1) Now that the Congress Ministries had resigned, theadministration of the Provinces had reverted to a basissimilar to that which had existed before the Minto-Morley reforms. The general situation in Indiacontinued to be peaceful, but there was some risk of aserious communal clash taking place, owing toMr. Jinnah&apos;s precipitate action in calling for a day ofrejoicing over the disappearance of the congress ministries.(2) A standing offer was already open to the Congressex-Ministries, so that they could return to office at any moment, if they so decided. The ex-Ministers had.however, placed themselves completely under the domina-tion of the central caucus of the Congress party.(3) On the Avhole, the constitutional position was more hopefulthan might appear. There were already one or two&quot;breaches in the dyke.&quot; In Assam a new provincial government had taken office. It had not yet met theLegislature, but there was some hope of its securing a small majority. At the Centre the Viceroy had already received one or two &quot; feelers &quot; from Mr. Birla. Therewere also strong differences of opinion within theCongress Party, although these differences were not known to the public.(4) Under Section 93 of the Act of 1935, it was necessary toreport the position to the Parliament at Westminstersix months after the assumption of sole charge by theProvincial Governors. Unless, therefore, the positionmaterially improved, Parliament would have to beinvited in April next to pass resolutions continuing inforce the Proclamations in virtue of which theProvincial Governors had taken charge. The congress party might conceivably think it good tactics to arrangefor disturbances to break out shortly before that date.The War Cabinet Approved the draft reply to Mr. Jinnah attached toW.P. (G.) (39) 154.Civil Defence 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the CivilMeasures. Defence Committee on the State of Public Opinion as regards CivilState of Public   Defence Measures (W.P. (G.) (39) 159).Opinion. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that the membersof the Civil Defence Committee were concerned at the increasingtendency, reflected in the Press, to regard the Government&apos;s policyin regard to Civil Defence measures as unnecessary and even to takethe line that there would be no air raids and that the sooner lifecould return to normal the better.    The Committee thereforeT205281 b 2
suggested that the hypothesis on which the Governments policy had been based, should be reviewed by the Chiefs of Staff, so thatthe Government could then announce that they had reviewed their civil Defence Plans as a whole, and that an examination of allthe factors involved led to the conclusion that there was no case for modifying the policy previously adopted.They had also in mind that some Civil Defence plans, e.g., theprovision of hospital beds and fire-fighting arrangements, were basedon a quantitative calculation as to the possible results of air raids,and that it might be useful to have an up-to-date calculation on these points. WThe Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Staff agreed with the Report of the Civil Defence Committee. Nothing had yethappened to give any adequate grounds for modifying the assump-tions made before the war. There had so far been no experience indealing with heavy sustained air attacks on the scale previously envisaged, and, if attacks took place, there was no assurance thatthey could be completely prevented, especially if they took place at night. They fully realised that the precautions were a great burden on the country, but their existence might be one of the reasons whyheavy attacks had not materialised, and it would, in their view, bea grave mistake to relax them. Tbey considered it very important that steps should be taken to counter the spirit of false optimism,as suggested by the Civil Defence Committee, and that the Pressshould be induced not to give the impression that the defences wereperfectly capable of dealing with the much heavier attacks whichmight yet eventuate.In discussion the view was very generally expressed that it wasnot necessary to refer this matter to the Chiefs of Staff, moreparticularly as the Air Staff had already given as their opinion that nothing had happened to modify the assumptions made before thewar. There might be grounds for thinking that indiscriminateattacks on the civil population, as distinct from attacks on military objectives, were not very likely, or at least that we were likely toreceive some warning of them as war grew more intense. But,whatever the probabilities, it was clearly necessary to assume thatattacks involving the civil population might be made, and to frameour plans accordingly.During the course of the discussion reference was made to anumber of specific civil defence measures.Construction The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that the state ofof shelters. public opinion was making it more difficult for him to secure thecompletion of essential programmes of shelter provision, even invulnerable areas, such as the Medway towns. There were difficultiesin securing steel or reinforced concrete, but his more immediateconcern was the lack of enthusiasm in the matter.The First Lord of the Admiralty stressed the great importanceof proceeding as rapidly as possible with the provision of shelters.They would be particularly valuable in case of sudden attack,while the moral effect of a strong push to complete the shelterprogramme might help to stem the drift of evacuated personnel backto the dangerous areas.Evacuation of The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that the Civilschool children. Defence Committee feared that the Christmas holidays mightaccentuate the tendency for children to drift back. Their general view, however, was that, if it could be made generally known thatin the Government&apos;s view the need for evacuation remained as before, it might be possible to stabilise the existing position. about one-third of the children evacuated from London had returned, butindividual difficulties had now been largely adjusted, and the onlytrouble to be feared was the tendency to complacency encouraged bythe press. It was very different in the North, where in some casespractically all the children had returned to their home towns.
Reference was made to the suggestion that parents should, nowbe asked to give a voluntary undertaking to keep their childrenwhere they were, in order to obviate the great difficulties of planning school accommodation for entirely unknown numbers ofchildren both in the country districts and in the towns; but it was-generally felt that, if parents were required to commit themselvesin this way, it might encourage them to bring their children backat once.Evacuation of The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that, althoughbusiness firms, there was no question of Government control in this matter, he wasbeing pressed to give advice, and in particular to say whether, inthe Governments opinion, the assumptions which had been adoptedin regard to the danger of air attack were still valid. He had inmind to reply that nothing had happened to invalidate them, butthat each business must use its own judgment as to the best course to adopt. It was generally agreed that this was the right line to take.Emergency The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that steps werehospital already being taken to enable existing hospitals to take in more civilaccommodation, cases in the accommodation which was being reserved for air raidemergencies, but that he would very much like, if possible, to reducethe programme of emergency hospital provision by means ofextensions formed of huts, more particularly in view of the greatshortage of timber and the claims on the restricted supplies forother services.It was agreed that this possibility should be examined on its merits and that it was not necessary to obtain further advice fromthe Chiefs of Staff as to the number of air raid casualties to beexpected.Evacuation of In answer to a request for information as to his recent interviewGovernment with the Staff side of the National Whitley Council, Sir HoraceDepartments. Wilson said that the Staff side representatives had stressed the inconvenience falling on Civil Servants as a result of the policy of evacuation and had referred to the lack of danger in London. Hehad told them that there was no ground for complacency and thatthe policy of evacuating non-essential staffs had been fully considered and that the Government proposed to proceed with it.They had been sorry to hear this, but had not made any serious objection.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that he thoughtthat the Civil Service Staffs would accept the Governments policyin this matter so long as they were strictly consistent in carryingit out and. were careful to replace staff evacuated as non-essentialonly by staffs whose work was clearly of a more essential character.The Prime Minister said that he had in mind, when speakingin the New Year, to take as his principal theme that we wereapproaching a grimmer phase of the war, and that we should prepare ourselves accordingly, and he suggested that his colleagues should take the same line. This would seem to be the best way ofdealing with the difficulties to which the Civil Defence Committeehad drawn attention.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs agreed that the wishes of the Committee would be met if steps were taken in this way tomake the Governments attitude clear beyond question. He saidthat it would be particularly helpful if emphasis could be laid onthe need for the completion of civil defence preparations which werenot being pressed on as quickly as possible.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved generally the Report of the Civil DefenceCommittee (W.P. (G.) (39) 159), subject to the modifica-tion that it was unnecessary to ask the Chiefs of staff to review the assumptions on which the nature and scale of Civil Defence preparations were based.
(ii) Took note that the Prime Minister proposed to deal withthis matter in his speech in the New Year, and invitedMinisters, in their public speeches, to emphasise the needfor continuing our Civil Defence measures and com-completing Civil Defence preparations,(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, in consul-tation with the other Ministers concerned, to re-examinethe programme for the erection of temporary emergencyhospital accommodation, with a view to its reduction.lighting restrictions.Second Reportof theMinisterialCommittee.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 55thConclusions,Minute 12.)3.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers :  Second Report of the Ministerial Committee on lighting restrictions (W.P. (G.) (39) 147).Memorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty(W.P. (G.) (39) 110).The Lord Privy Seal said that the Committee&apos;s Report was oneof a periodical series. It had been found possible in the light of experience to make several important relaxations. The country was now divided into two zones : a coastal zone (extending for a distance of 50 miles to the West of the East Coast), and an inner zonecomprising the remainder of the country. A small Interdepart-mental Committee had been appointed, charged with the duty of ensuring that in the coastal zone lighting was brought up to the permitted standards (which had not been the case hitherto), and, asregards the inner zone, of arranging for further relaxations of the lighting restrictions in individual cases. A good start had beenmade and he hoped that substantial results would be achieved. Asregards street lighting, the Home Secretary&apos;s experiments had proved successful and a start on the new system of diffused street lighting, which was equivalent to the light of a starlit night, hadbeen made in Central London the previous evening. The experi-ments in regard to the lighting of shop windows had also provedsuccessful, and a modified form of lighting was now permitted. Itwas also clear that there had been a considerable lack of uniformity in the practice of Chief Officers of Police in the administration of lighting restrictions, and arrangements had been made for the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland to improve matters in this direction. The Committee were in favour of all permissiblemodifications being introduced as rapidly as possible, but they thought that this should be done without publicity of any kind. Afurther report would be submitted by the Committee at a later date.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that the conclusionsdid not go nearly far enough to secure a rational system of wartimelighting. In his opinion tihey were based upon a military fallacy,since air attack by night could not be directed against particularobjectives. If the Germans were to decide on terror bombing oflarge built-up areas, it would be possible for them to locate such areas, even under blackout conditions, just as the Royal Air force had in Germany. The question was not how to relax precautions,but how to remove an unnecessary burden imposed on our national life, a burden which had caused heavy casualties through accidentsin the streets and had led also to a grave diminution in the produc-tion of munitions. It was important also to pay regard to thegeneral gloom caused by the black-out which exhausted the strengthof the people for meeting the resistances which would be required as the war proceeded.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Staff had given the Ministerial Committee good evidence to show why ingeneral the present lighting restrictions were essential.  Every effort
lhad, however, been made to meet the points raised by the FirstLord, and these efforts would be continued. It must be rememberedthat Germany was completely blacked-out, and so also was Francewith the exception of Paris.The Prime Minister said that while a higher standard of lighting was permitted in Paris, it must be remembered that within five minutes of the receipt of an air raid warning, lights of everydescription in Paris were extinguished.HI The Secretary of State for the Home Department said thatas regards factories, there was no reason why the black-out shouldhave any bad effect at all, since factories were encouraged to employ a higher standard of internal lighting than in peace time, once they had completely blacked-out their external lighting. the lighting restrictions had, however, affected adversely industrialoutput in such establishments as shipyards, docks, and marshalling yards. As regards these, substantial relief was being afforded bythe Interdepartmental Committee to which the Lord Privy Sealhad referred. Very substantial progress had already been madeby that Committee both in the coastal and in the inner zones.The Minister without Portfolio said that as a member of the ministerial Committee he had felt it impossible to reach a differentconclusion in view of the technical opinion expressed by the AirStaff. While it was true that Paris was less blacked-out thanLondon, it must be remembered that it was much further fromthe frontier, and therefore had a considerably longer period inwhich air raid warnings could be given.The War Cabinet :-Approved the Conclusions set out in the Second Reportof the Ministerial Committee on Lighting Restrictions(W.P. (G.) (39) 147).PostalCensorship.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 98thConclusions,Minute 11.)Proposals forExtension.4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Note by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence covering a Memorandum bythe Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Censorship(W.P. (G.) (39) 139 (Revise)).The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that therecommendations made by the Censorship Committee arose from the representations of the Treasury that steps should be taken toprevent evasion of the Defence (Finance) Regulations. Theproposal that a world-wide postal censorship warrant should beissued did not imply that world-wide postal censorship was to be instituted, but would enable the Censorship Authorities, subject tothe safeguards stated in the Memorandum, to impose censorshipwithout delay. This would be particularly useful for the purposeof test censorships. As the War Cabinet would see from his coveringNote, the whole question of the Postal and Telegraph CensorshipOrganisation was at present under examination by a specialCommittee which would report to the War Cabinet.Sir Horace Wilson said that this examination was being carriedout by Mr. Stevenson, Managing Director of Woolworth&apos;s, assisted by representatives of the Treasury and the War Office, and had as its object the reduction of postal delays.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essential toobtain control of individuals who might be transmitting dollarsecurities to the United States in evasion of the Defence (Finance)
Regulations. It was of course important for the export trade thatno additional avoidable delays should be imposed on mails, but thepresent proposal was only to examine mails between the London area and New York, and it should be possible to ensure that the mailsexamined did not have to wait for a later boat. As regards&apos; theproposal to issue a world-wide warrant, there would be no publicityuntil such time as censorship was applied to a particular mail.The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that a world-widewarrant would, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of Statefor the Dominions, enable censorship to be imposed on mails to EireAvith a minimum of delay. This might prove of importance inconnection with the investigation of the leakage of information from Eire.It was pointed out that the mail to Northern Ireland wouldalso have to be examined, and that at the most it would only bepossible to &quot; dip &quot; into these mails.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was concerned at the effect of postal delays on the export trade. he realised that most of these delays were caused by shipping difficulties and not by the censorship, but he viewed with apprehension anyproposal which might increase them. He would therefore like theWar Cabinet to reconsider this censorship of the American mails,if it should prove in practice that it caused additional delays.Brigadier French said that there ought not to be any additionaldelay. The Post Office would sort out mail from the London areaaddressed to New York, and the Censorship would concentrate on financial letters from the E.C. district.The War Cabinet: Approved the recommendations of the Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Censorship in W.P. (G.) (39)139 (Revise), Avhich were as follows : (a) That mails between the United Kingdom and theUnited States of America should be subjected tocensorship forthwith, to a degree necessary to ensurethat the Defence (Finance) Regulations are not beingevaded.(b) That similar action should be taken in regard to mailsbetween the United Kingdom and Canada, thequestion of whether such mails are censored in thiscountry or in Canada being determined in consulta-tion between the Dominions Office, the Governmentof the Dominion of Canada and the Controller of postal and Telegraph Censorship.(c) That in connection with (a) and (6) above, a world-widepostal censorship warrant should be issued, on theunderstanding that censorship should not be appliedto mails betAveen the United Kingdom and theDominions (other than Canada) without the agree-ment of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,and between the United Kingdom and foreigncountries (other than the United States of Americaand the countries for which postal censorshipwarrants have already been issued*) without theagreement of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs..* These are detailed in the Annex to Paper W.P. (g.) (39) 139 (Revise).
The air situation.(previous erence:W.M. (39) 120thConclusions,Minute 2.)Question of preventing air attacks onfishing vessels.5. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat on the previous afternoon a routine reconnaissance of 12Blenheims had been despatched to sweep an area in the South-east of the North Sea. A formation of mine-sweepers had been observedNorth-west of Horns Reef. An escort vessel had opened fire on our aircraft.   Four 500-lb. bombs had been dropped near the ships.Five other mine-sweepers had been seen towing paravanes80 miles West of Sylt, and six bombs had been dropped. our aircraft had encountered heavy and accurate fire from pom-pomsand anti-aircraft guns.Aircraft had been despatched for patrol of enemy seaplanebases from dusk onwards on the previous evening, but bad weather conditions had developed and caused a suspension of the patrolsystem. Some bombs, however, had been dropped on lights on thewater at Hornum, near Borkum New Harbour, and in WesterlandBay, Sylt. Searchlights had been turned on and anti-aircraft firehad been encountered.Nine unidentified aircraft had been reported at heightsvarying from 1,000 to 15,000 feet over the following areas : Hornsea,Lincolnshire Coast,Lowestoft,North London,The Wash.Weather conditions over England had been very bad, and the patrolssearching for the enemy had failed to find them.Consultations had taken place between the Admiralty and theAir Ministry as to the action which should be taken to deal withthe German air attacks on our fishing trawlers. As a result a patrolby Blenheim Fighters had been carried out both during the morning and afternoon over the fishing-fleet areas off the Norfolk coast.Several trawlers had been seen but no enemy aircraft.The usual routine patrols and reconnaissance had been carriedout by Coastal Command. Shortly after noon a Hudson on patrolhad sighted a man on a wooden raft 70 miles East of Buchanness.A cargo vessel, Gronland, had arrived about the same time andpicked him tip.An aircraft on the line patrol across to Norway had sightedand reported a raft with six men on board 150 miles East by north of Newcastle. On receipt of this report a destroyer had been dispatched by the Naval authorities to rescue the men. An aircraft had been detailed to help the destroyer in finding the raft. this had been successfully accomplished and the men had been recscued by the destroyer.One of our aircraft escorting a convoy off the mouth of the tyne had observed four bombs fall close to a trawler near the convoy. Our aircraft, an Anson, had climbed higher and had thenseen a Dornier 17 making off to the South-East. A patrol of our fighters had arrived shortly afterwards and had gone in pursuit.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it was clear thatthe Germans were not enjoying the same freedom of action in theair over the North Sea as formerly. In this connexion he mentioned that a very complete liaison had been established between the AirMinistry and the Admiralty for the conduct of operations over theNorth Sea.[20528]
The Naval 6.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed his colleaguesSituation. that a large German warship, thought to be the Deutschland, had(Previous been seen passing North through the Great Belt at 4-30 p.m, on reference: the previous day. The vessel might either have left harbour for w.M. (39) 120th a short reconnaissance patrol or be intending to attack theConclusions, Norwegian convoy. The First Lord gave particulars of the disposi-minute 3.)        tions taken to guard against the latter possibility.A parachute mine had been observed to fall North-East of lower Hope Point (Thameshaven).   It was estimated that therewould be only 3 feet of water over it at low water.The German policy of attacking trading vessels had continued.The steamship Listor (Swedish), a vessel of 1,300 tons, had been sunk on the 16th December by torpedo in a position 140 miles Eastby North of the Tyne.The steamship Mars (Swedish) (1,900 tons) had struck a mineand sunk on the 20th December, one mile South-East of Blyth.Fifteen men had been saved (three injured) and seven were missing.The steamship Dosinia (British) (a tanker, 8,000 tons) hadbeen mined off the Happisburgh Light on the 21st December, but had not sunk.The anti-submarine trawler Arctic Explorer had attacked a submarine on the 20th December in the entrance to Kirkwall withfive depth charges. Three hours later Fleet Air Arm aircraft had reported sighting a large submarine on the bottom at that point.The spot was being watched by anti-submarine trawlers, and a destroyer.The hunt had been continued until dusk on the 20th Decemberfor the submarine which had been reported by the destroyerKhartoum as having fired a torpedo at her in the approaches tothe Clyde on the 19th December. No reports of success had beenreceived.A report from secret sources stated that the Admiral Scheerhad left Wilhelmshaven on the 12th December for a long cruise,that the Leipzig had a hole in her bottom and also in the forepartof the ship caused by torpedoes, and that three destroyers damaged by mines were in Wilhelmshaven. Portions of two torpedoes, eachcontaining a large electric motor, had been recovered from the seabed near the two forward holes in the hull of H.M.S. Royal Oak.The British ship Cristales (5,389 tons) had reported at 4-45 p.m.on the 20th December, that she was firing at a submarine in aposition 180 miles West of Freetown. A destroyer had been sent from Freetown. The presence of an enemy submarine in thisneighbourhood had not, however, been confirmed.The First Lord said that he felt sure that his colleagues wouldbe touched to hear that ten truck-loads of toys had been receivedfrom France as a Christmas present for the children of Britishsailors who had been drowned.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Finland.Invasion by :s.s.r.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 120thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that informa-tion had been received that the Finns had counter-attacked withsome measure of success in the Kuolajarvi sector. Russian prisoners captured were stated to be very ill-clothed and in a low state ofmorale.   The position in this area seemed more hopeful.
Sweden.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 118thConclusions,Minute 14.)8. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed theWar Cabinet of a telegram which he had received from the SouthAfrican Minister in Stockholm. Dr. G-ie was far from optimisticas to the future prospects of Sweden, in the light of possible developments which might result from the Russo-Finnish war:The Cabinet took note of this statement.War Cabinet 9.   The War Cabinet agreed :-Arrangements.That their Meeting on the following clay should be at11 a.m.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 21, 1939.
