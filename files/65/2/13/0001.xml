The Air Situation. (Previous Reference: WM (39) 78th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that a flight over South Germany had been carried out the previous night by aircraft to drop leaflets and observe the blackout. One aircraft had not returned.

There had been considerable German aircraft activity off the East Coast the previous day. One enemy aircraft had passed over the Straits of Dover, and another had made an extended circuit westwards as far as Bristol, thence to Liverpool, finally crossing the East Coast on its return above Middlesbrough. It had flown at about 16,000 feet in or above heavy cloud. Conditions had been favourable to the enemy and unfavourable for the operation of our own fighters.

A Dornier flying-boat had been brought down by Coastal Command aircraft east of Newcastle. One enemy aircraft had carried out reconnaissance over the Shetlands.

Seventy miles east-south-east of the southernmost point of Norway a Coastal Command patrol had attacked a U-boat which was apparently holding up a Norwegian merchant vessel, but it was not thought that any damage had been inflicted.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

German Air Force. Information obtained from prisoners.

2. The Secretary of State for Air gave the War Cabinet a summary of information obtained from the interrogation of German Air Force prisoners. They apparently considered that our fighter aircraft were more than a match for any of the German bombers, including the Heinkel III, and were of the opinion that aircraft operating over this country should be escorted by fighters. Their orders were to make good their escape if attacked by A.A. or fighters. Many reconnaissances were apparently being carried out by volunteers rather than as part of a normal routine. A high proportion seemed to be senior N.C.O.s who had served in the Condor Legion in Spain. One and all insisted that the German Air Force would never bomb open towns, indeed, their insistence was so marked as to rouse suspicions. Generally speaking, their morale was high, and though a few might not have much sympathy with the Nazi Party, all were ardent supporters of Hitler. The food in the German Air Force seemed to be ample. When first captured they appeared apprehensive of the treatment they were likely to receive, probably owing to German propaganda.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that it had not been our experience that Germans always turned for home when attacked by A.A. or fighters; but they frequently came in at a very great height and made their reconnaissances by diving at a fast speed over their objective.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The Naval Situation (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 78th Conclusions. Minute 2.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave details of the movements and dispositions of the naval forces in home waters. An enemy reconnaissance had just been reported approaching the Firth of Forth.

S.S. Ponzano had been attacked with gunfire by a U-boat off Cape Finisterre but had escaped, two French destroyers having gone to her assistance. One of the five German ships in Vigo had slipped out and had been captured.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

  
The Military Situation (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 78th Conclusions. Minute 8.)

4. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that there had been an increase of one in the total number of German Divisions on the Western Front. One Division had been moved from the Saar to Aachen and two from the ? towards Holland.

A highly confidential report, which our General Staff regarded as reliable, had been received from a Dutch General Staff Officer, purporting to describe the assistance which Holland would ask us to give in the event of her being invaded. This would include three Divisions: Artillery and Searchlights, and Fighter and Reconnaissance Aircraft to operate from Dutch aerodromes, which would be placed at their disposal. The Dutch General Staff would ask that these British forces should be placed under the command of the Dutch General Staff.

The Secretary of State for War said that it would of course, be out of the question to comply with these requests if they were made. He added that information had been received that the Dutch were ploughing up their aerodromes in East Holland and that they had withdrawn their A.A. guns behind the New Holland water-line.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements.

Poison Gas. Transport of equipment to France. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 32nd Conclusions. Minute 17.)

5. The Secretary of State for War said that the War Cabinet had on the 30th September authorised the War Office and the Air Ministry to despatch their respective requirements of gas equipment to France. The Royal Air Force requirements, which were comparatively small and of a different category from those of the Army, had been sent by air. The Army requirements, which included a very large quantity of shells and large numbers of Lievens projectors, could only go by Sea. The French had specially allotted FÃ©camp as the port of disembarkation for this purpose, and refused to give us any other port. The handling of this material would have to be carried out by special personnel wearing gas-masks and gloves. These operations would inevitably attract attention in France, and might reach Germany, who would make the most of it for purposes of propaganda. This, he felt, was a risk which we must accept, having regard to the vital importance of our Army being equipped with gas for defensive purposes if required.

The War Cabinet agreed:-

To authorise the Secretary of State for War to make the necessary arrangements for the despatch of supplies of  

gas and equipment to France, on the understanding that every possible precaution should be taken to prevent observation.

Prisoners of War. Requests by Press for photographs and interviews.

6. The Secretary of State for War said that this matter had recently been examined by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (D.C.O.S. (39) 39), who had recommended that representatives of the Press should not be allowed access to prisoners of war. He had received repeated applications from the Newspaper Proprietors Association for permission to interview and take photographs of prisoners of War. In view of the growing discontent in the press, he suggested that it would be desirable tp consider whether anything could be done to meet their demands.

The Netherlands and Belg? Peace appeal by Queen Wilhelmina and King Leopold. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 78th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

12. The Minister without ? reported that he ? received replies from all the Dominions concerned, with the exception of the Union of South Africa in regard to the text of the reply to be despatched to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and King Leopold of the Belgians in answer to their peace appeal.

The Commonwealth of Australia and the Duminion of New Zealand concurred in the terms of the reply and wishes to be associated with it. The Canadian Government also concurred int he substance of the reply except as regards paragraph ?, which Mr. Mackenzie King considered was too exclusively directed to conditions in Europe and was open also to the objection that the only statements referred to were those made by United Kingdom Ministers. Mr Mackenzie King had accordingly suggested the following redraft of this paragraph:-

The immediate occasion and decision to enter the war was Germany&apos;s aggression against Poland. But this aggression was only a fresh instance of German policy towards her neighbours. The larger purposes for which my peoples are now fighting are to secure that Europe may be redeemed from the perpetually recurring fear of German aggression so as to enable the peoples of Europe to preserve their independence and their liberties, and to prevent for the future resort to force instead of to pacific means in settlement of international disputes. These aims have been amplified and enlarged on a number of occasions, including statements made by my Prime Minister in the United Kingdom in the House of Commons on the 12th October and by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Lords on the 2nd November.

The War Cabinet agreed-

(1) To accept the amendment to paragraph 6 suggested by the Government of Canada, subject to any minor drafting amendments which might be agreed upon between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister without Portfolio.

(2) That these Ministers should be authorised to deal with any comments which might be received from the Government of the Union of South Africa, Unless, in their opinion, they were of sufficient importance to require further reference to the war Cabinet.

Submarines Alleged Soviet sale to Germany (Previous Reference W.M. (39) 54th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 221, dated the 9th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Budapest, in which Mr. O&apos;Malley reported having learnt on high authority that the Government of the U.S.S.R. were selling 50 submarines to Germany to be delivered some in the Baltic and some in the Black Sea. He had telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, asking whether he had any information bearing on this subject.

The First Sea Lord said that the Admiralty had no information on the subject, apart from the report that 14 Soviet submarines, had passed throught the Kiel Canal to the North Sea on the night of the 12th October, ? which had been communicated in the War Cabinet at the meeting noted in the ? and ? previous unconfirmed report of the ? of 40 Soviet submarines to Germany

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

  
? Secret Session? in the House of Lords.

14. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that on the Wednesday, the 15th November, 1939, Lord Arnold proposed to ? in the House of Lords the question of holding a Secret Session. It was obvious that if there was to be a Secret Session in the House of Lords, there would need to be one in the House of Commons also. The matter would have to be discussed by the War Cabinet early in the following week, and his colleagues might like to reflect on it in the meantime.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Livestock Control.

15. The War Cabinet had before them a Note (W.P. (G.) (39) 83) by the Lord Privy Seal covering an extract from the Conclusions of the 15th Meeting of the Home Policy Committee, making certain recommendations in regard to proposals by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Food, for livestock  control (H.P.C. (39) 93 and 94).

The Case for the introduction of the proposed scheme of livestock control was discussed. At the present time, under the system of the partial control of livestock marketing by Maximum Price Orders made by the Ministry of Food, all sales of fat stock for slaughter were made through livestock markets and direct sales of such animals from the farm were prohibited. This system had never been intended to be more than an interim arrangement pending the introduction of full control and it was rapidly breaking down. The urgency of the position was due to two main causes. First, the farmers believed that purchase at a guaranteed price was linked with meat rationing, and, on hearing that meet rationing was not to be introduced, they had assumed that the Government were not going to implement their pledge to give a guaranteed price. Secondly, there was fear of a shortage of feeding stuffs. The result was that the markets were crammed and prices had fallen catastrophically. If measures were not taken at an early date, our stock reserves in the country would be seriously depleted. Control was necessary in order to deal with this. The scheme provided for the purchase at fixed prices of livestock at markets by auctioneers acting on the authority of the Ministry of Food.

After purchase, the stock would be handed over to approved slaughter houses, whence the meat would be transferred to Wholesalers&apos; Associations which would distribute it at prices (in accordance with the Orders ruling at the time) to retailers&apos; groups. If power was taken by the Minister of Food to buy, it was necessary for him to have power to sell, as otherwise he might have stock left on his hands after purchase. This involved the control of slaughter houses so that, if necessary, surplus stock could be slaughtered and put in storage or diverted to meet needs elsewhere.

It was argued by the Minister of Food that it was not possible to carry out this scheme without a reduction in the number of slaughter houses from about 16,000 to about 600. The scheme had been worked out by Sir Francis Boys (who had been Meat Controller in the Great War), who was convinced that it would not be possible to operate it without this reduction. The scheme had originally provided for 437 slaughter houses. This number had been increased to about 600, a figure which had been agreed with the National Federation of Butchers&apos; Associations, which was satisfied to the adequacy of this number. It might be that in certain cases a market would be on the perimeter of an ares served by a particular slaughter house but this could not be entirely avoided in any scheme. Broadly speaking the number proposed was designed to cover conveniently the whole of the country. Any considerable increase  in the number would vitally affect the arrangements already made for the organisation of the scheme and      
would cause delay. He hoped that the local tribunals, which he intended to establish to investigate complaints arising from the scheme would help to mitigate grievances.

Discussion then ensued as to whether so drastic a reduction was necessary. It was explained that the majority of slaughter houses were, in fact, no more than a butcher&apos;s back-yard, in which perhaps no more than one beast, a week might be killed. This very large number could not be regulated without a very extensive staff of inspectors and a complicated organisation. Even then it was doubtful whether control could be made effective, since private transactions could, and no doubt would, be carried out between the farmer and the butcher. Further, under the present system, there was considerable wastage of offal and blood, which were important for the country&apos;s food supply, and for cattle foods. He argued that concentration of the slaughter houses would also effect economies in transport, as the distribution of meat, even though the carry might be longer, could be done in bulk, and would therefore be more economic.

On the other hand, it was argued that the suppression of so many small slaughter houses would be bound to lead to very considerable complaints all over the country, on the ground that it was depriving individuals of a least part of their livelihood. This would be represented as a further example of the Government&apos;s unnecessary interference with individual liberties, and it would be better to let the existing system function. Doubts were expressed in connection with certain details of the scheme-for example, whether an economy in transport would in fact be effected. It was further suggested that full control of slaughter houses might be postponed until the introduction of meat rationing.

The Minister of Food and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries were both of the opinion that, if these small slaughter houses were not closed, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stop a large measure of illicit traffic, involving wide-spread evasions of the law which would place the honest farmer and butcher at a disadvantage.

It was pointed out that it was most desirable that attention should be paid to the public presentation of the measures proposed, and that, in particular, attention should be called to the advantages which would be derived from the by-products produced at the centralised slaughter houses, which were being wasted under the present system.

The War Cabinet agreed:-

(1) That the Minister of Food should be authorised, in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland, to institute at the earliest possible date a scheme of live-stock control in the manner indicated in the Conclusions of the 15th Meeting of the Home Policy Committee (H.P.C. (39) 15th Meeting, Conclusion 1) (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 83, and that an immediate announcement should be made to this effect.

(2) That, in view of the strong objections which might be urged against the immediate and drastic restriction of the number of slaughter houses, the Minister of Food should consider closely whether this restriction could be modified or alleviated.

(3) That as from the date on which the scheme was operated, the Ministry of Food should be authorised to purchase live-stock from farmers in the ? described in H.P.C. (39) 94 at prices agreed with the Agricultural Departments and the Treasury.
