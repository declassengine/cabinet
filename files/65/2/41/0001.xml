The Ah;Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 105thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat enemy reconnaissance aircraft had been active over the north sea on the previous day, and that several had been reported in thevicinity of the Orkneys.In the afternoon a Heinkel had crossed the coast near Ports-mouth and had left it later near Orfordness. These aircraft, flyingsingly, had been difficult to intercept and had eluded our Fighters.A Hudson aircraft of the Coastal Command had attacked aDornier 115 miles West of Lister. As the enemy had broken off the engagement and had appeared to be in trouble, it seemed doubtfulwhether he would have been able to reach his base.Two Whitley aircraft had carried out a leaflet-dropping raidon the previous evening over Bremen and Hamburg respectively.Pilots had reported intense cold. Both aircraft had returnedwithout incident, though anti-aircraft fire had been experiencedover Hamburg.The Secretary of State for Air said that he would take stepsto have further details of the flights over Germany on the previous day published in the Press, without reference, however, to the factthat they had been engaged in dropping leaflets.. The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The german air Force.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 84thConclusions,Minute 5.)Self-SealingPetrol tanks.2. The Prime Minister enquired as to the self-sealing petroltanks with which certain German aircraft were said to be equipped.The Chief of the Air Staff said his information was that theywere very efficient. They were not, however, as yet installed in all german aircraft and there were none in, for example, the Messer-schmitt 109. The great value of a self-sealing petrol tank was fully recognised, and other methods of attaining the same object werebeing actively developed in the Royal Air Force.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during his recent visit to France he had examined one of these tanks in a Dornierwhich had been shot down. It appeared to be made of what lookedlike big black mattresses. Outside, there was a coating whichlooked like leather; the centre consisted of a gelatinous composition,and the inside appeared to be made of some kind of fibre. He had seen the places where the gelatinous composition had oozed through and sealed the bullet-holes. They were undoubtedly heavier than our own metal tanks. Apart from their practical advantage, he understood that they were of great psychological value to the pilotin the confidence which it gave him that his petrol would not catchfire. The technical experts in France had been favourably impressed with the good workmanship which was evident in the constructionof both the engine and the airframe of the Dornier.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.3.   The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that the Commander -in-Chief had transferred his flag to the Warspite.The First Lord and the First Sea Lord had gone to the Clydeto confer with the Commander-in-Chief about the situation andw f  m 105th disposition of the Fleet until we had devised a satisfactory methodof sweeping the magnetic mine.   Decisions would also be taken the naval situation.(PreviousReferenceConelusions,Minute 2.)H.M.S.

Meanwhile, rumours were spreading! ^U4571 ^ 2
Magnetic mines.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 104thConclusions,Minute 3.)General report.about the damage which she had sustained. A report had recently-been received from the Home Security War Room of an aircrafthaving crossed Inverness-shire on the 24th November. This seemedto indicate that the mine in question had probably been laid by anenemy aircraft and not by a submarine, as had at first been supposed.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence was perplexed thata mine exploding at a depth of 120 feet should have blown a hole5 feet in diameter. He would have expected a less localised formof damage.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that it was thought thatthis was due to the peculiarly strong construction of the Nelson.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs mentioned thatthe Chiefs of Staff had decided that it would be unwise to informthe Dominion Prime Ministers about the damage sustained byH.M.S. Nelson. In view, however, of the probability that the news of this would leak out through the United States of America, he considered it advisable to let the Dominion Prime Ministers into our confidence at once.The. Prime Minister was reluctant to take this step in theabsence of the First Lord of the Admiralty. After further discussion, it was agreed that the information should be includedin the Chiefs of Staff daily summary for the Dominions on thefollowing morning.Continuing, the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff mentioned thata new feature in the sowing of mines by German aircraft was thatthis was now being done by day instead of, as formerly, by night.There was also a report that enemy aircraft had flown overScapa.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether it would bepossible to ensure that it was safe to use Scapa as a Fleet anchorage.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that, as soon as devicesfor sweeping the magnetic mines could be put into operation, safechannels could be swept without difficulty. It would also be possibleto ensure safe anchor berths for ships at places such as Scapa andthe Clyde. It would, however, be a much more difficult and lengthyoperation to clear large ai-eas, and it would therefore not be safe forthe Fleet to use their customary exercise areas in the Forth or at scapa for some time to come.The Prime Minister asked whether it would be possible toprevent aircraft from dropping mines at Scapa by the use ofballoons.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff thought that it would only bepossible to deter German aircraft from dropping mines by theinfliction of heavy casualties.A Greek ship had been mined off the Foreland carrying a cargo of German coal from Antwerp to Greece. The Secretary of Statefor War suggested that the Admiralty communique should emphasise the point that this German cargo had been sunk by aGerman mine.A fi shing trawler had been mined off Yarmouth.The Norwegian convoy had been shadowed to the north ofBergen.A trawler had attacked a U-boat South-East of the Orkneyswith hopeful results.The destroyer Jersey had been torpedoed or mined off the coast of Norfolk. She was not in danger of sinking and was proceeding to harbour under her own steam.
(previous reference:W.M. (39) I03rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Steamship Eskdene, which had been mined but was still afloat(as reported at the previous meeting), had been located by aircraft and one of His Majesty&apos;s ships had been sent out to assist the tugsin finding her.The German ship Ussukuma had been intercepted byH.M.S. Ajax off South America. The warning message authorised by the War Cabinet had been transmitted, but the crew appeared tohave taken steps to scuttle the ship as soon as the cruiser wassighted, and, in spite of the efforts made by a boarding party fromthe cruiser, the ship had sunk. The passengers and crew had beenpicked up and were being sent to the Falkland Islands.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 105thConclusions,Minute 3.)Finland.Invasion by .S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 105thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nochange on the Western Front.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.5. The Secretary of State for War said that, according to information from the Finnish General Staff, the Russian advance was slower than had been expected. They claimed to have captured3,000 prisoners and 60 tanks, and that Finnish casualties had beenslight.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Finland.Supply of aircraft and munitions.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 104thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Secretary of State for War invited attention to telegram No. 203 from Stockholm, which referred to the raising of a volunteer force in Sweden which would be officered by personnel from the Swedish Army, who would be given special leave for thepurpose. It was anticipated that a force of some 8,000 men wouldbe ready to proceed to Finland in about two weeks&apos; time. Theywere, however, deficient in munitions and had appealed for any warmaterial which we could spare, particularly anti-tank weapons(guns, rifles and mines), Mills grenades, revolvers, aircraft andbombs. Emphasis was laid in the telegram on the heartening effecton Sweden which would result if we were able to meet their require-ments in any way.The Lord Privy Seal asked whether the French had beensimilarly approached. He suggested that it was desirable to exploit the situation to our advantage as far as possible by expressing ourgreat interest in Sweden&apos;s integrity, by pointing out the practicalhelp which we were rendering to Finland, and by suggesting thepossibility of Sweden obtaining arms from Italy.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence asked whether itwould be to our advantage, from the point of view of the general military situation, to help Finland with munitions with a view toholding up the Russian advance.The Chief of the Air Staff said that we were not in a positionto provide any effective assistance.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thought that it wouldtake the Russians a long time to over-run Finland, particularly at the present time of year. The main danger, however, was thattlhe country might be bolshevised, which would lead to its collapse
from within. Referring to the reports that the Italians had sent50 aircraft to Finland, he enquired whether it was really certainthat these machines had arrived.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would try to obtain confirmation on this point.The Secretary of State for War said that the Swedes were reported to be supplying fighters to Finland which they hoped thatwe would replace.The Minister without Portfolio asked whether Spain was ina position to send arms to Finland or Sweden.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, contraryto certain statements which had been made, it appeared that Spainhad no surplus arms available.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldhave a talk with the Swedish Ambassador, in the light of thediscussion which had taken place.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.DominionAh&apos; training scheme.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 105thConclusions,Minute 6 and annex.)7. The Secretary of State for Air referred to the telegramfrom Mr. Mackenzie King which had been read to the War Cabinetthe previous day. If Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s alterations were accepted, the draft Statement to be issued on behalf of the UnitedKingdom Government would read as follows* : &quot; The United Kingdom Government have informed us that,considering present and future requirements, they feel thatparticipation in the Air Training Scheme would provide more effective assistance towards our ultimate victory than any other form of military co-operation which Canada can give. At thesame time, they would wish it to be clearly understood thatthey would welcome no less heartily the presence of Canadianland forces in the theatre of war at the earliest possible moment&quot;He had discussed the matter with the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, and he recommended that Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;sproposals should be accepted. He had accordingly prepared a draft telegram (a copy of which is annexed to these Conclusions) which,if the War Cabinet agreed, could be despatched to Mr. mackenzie king at once.The Prime Minister said that the War Cabinet should be aware of telegram No. 791 from the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Canada reporting a conversation which he had had with Mr. Skelton, the Permanent Under-Secretary for external affairs at Ottawa. Mr. Skelton&apos;s evasive reply to the HighCommissioner^ inquiries about the despatch of a second canadian division overseas had confirmed the suspicion that the modificationsproposed in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s telegram were designed to makeit easier for him to use the Statement to be issued on behalf ofthe United Kingdom Government in regard to the Air Training-Scheme as an excuse for refraining from sending a second divisionoverseas, at any rate in the near future. At the same time, theHigh Commissioner gave it as his own opinion &quot; that if Canadianpublic opinion realised that the Canadian Government werewavering in their original intention of the despatch of a second division, the Government would be turned out of power at once.&quot;He felt, however, that the essential thing was to tie the canadian government down at once to the Air Training Scheme.* The additions desired by Mr. Mackenzie King pre in italics.
He (the Prime Minister) felt that this advice was sound andthat we should, therefore, accept the modifications proposed byMr. Mackenzie King, in spite of our knowledge of what lay behind them.The War Cabinet was in general agreement with this view.The War Cabinet agreed : To approve the despatch of a telegram to the PrimeMinister of Canada in the terms of the draft of which acopy is annexed to these Conclusions.8.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : (a) A Review by the Chiefs of Staff of Military Policy in theMiddle East (WP. (39) 148).(b) A Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff stating their viewson French proposals for Allied policy in the balkans and the Middle East, which had been communicatedthrough the medium of the French Permanent military representatives (W.P. (39) 149).Balkans and theMiddle East:Military Policyand Anglo-FrenchDiscussions.(previous references:WM. (39) 99thConelusionsiMinute 5,and 100thConclusions,Minute 10.)Long-term The Chief of the Air Staff said that the first of these papersMilitary Policy contained the Chiefs of Staff&apos;s recommendations for our long-termin the Middle policy in the Middle East. Broadly speaking, these might beEast- summarised as the limited reinforcement of Egypt and Palestine,and the development of administrative facilities in those countries and in India so as to allow the concentration of additional forces,should the situation demand. The Chiefs of Staff did not contem-plate an early concentration of Allied forces in Thrace or Anatolia,but they thought that the Turks should be pressed to develop their communications, ports and aerodromes. Such development wouldbe in the common interests both of Turkey and.of the Allies andmight be secured without resort to. formal Staff conversations.French Policy The second paper (W.P. (39) 149) raised a more urgent issue,in the Balkans. It was plain from the views communicated by the French Staff that french policy in the Balkans was now at variance with that whichthey had previously agreed with us. The War Cabinet had recentlyconsidered the implications of the activities of General Weygandin the Middle East, and had agreed that steps should be taken through the diplomatic channel to ensure that these should be kept in line with the previously agreed policy of the two Governments.It appeared, however, from Paris telegram No. 410 that M. Daladierwas moving towards the policy advocated by General Weygand.The Chiefs &quot;of Staff proposed to visit Paris at the beginning of thefollowing week in order to discuss the whole question of allied military Policy in the Balkans and the Middle East with general gamelin, and it was therefore essential for them to have someguidance as to the line that they were to take in these discussions.Broadly speaking, the French were in favour of a forwardpolicy in the Balkans and contemplated the despatch of allied forces to that area in the early spring. They advocated immediatenegotiations to prepare for such an expedition, and were apparentlyignoring the danger that Italian suspicions would thereby bearoused. The administrative difficulties of an Allied expedition tothe Balkans were skated over by the French, who would certainlyrely on us almost entirely for their transportation and supply. Wehad not, in fact, the resources for any such expedition. The Chiefsof Staff had consistently advised against stirring up trouble in the
Balkans. Italy was slowly moving towards the Allied camp, andprecipitate action on our part might drive her in the opposite direction. Moreover, Turkey had, so far, shown herself mostunwilling to start Staff conversations with the Allies. It was, ofcourse, possible that the action of our enemies would bring the warinto the Balkans, and in that case we should have to do what wecould, little though this might be, to carry out our obligations to turkey. We did not, however, wish to commit ourselves to militaiyaction on a large scale in this area.The Chief of the Air Staff then referred to paragraphs 12-14in W.P. (39) 149, in which reference was made to the SuspenseClause in the Anglo-French-Turkey Treaty. After further discussion that morning the Chiefs of Staff wished to modifyslightly the flat refusal, which they recommended in paragraph 13,to the Turkish demands for additional anti-tank guns. They would prefer that the last sentence of this paragraph should be re-wordedto read as follows : &apos;&apos; In these circumstances we are unable to meet the Turkishdemands, and we feel that, even if this means that theSuspense Clause must remain in operation, we should onstrategical grounds in present circumstances refuse to releaseto the Turks any further equipments of a type which we sobadly need ourselves. If, on political grounds, however, it isessential to make some gesture, the most we could afford wouldbe a token delivery for training purposes.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that the fear of Russia rather than of Germany was at the present timedominant in the Balkans. The attitude of Italy and Turkey wereunknown factors. The advice of the Chiefs of Staff was that weshould avoid taking overt action which might have the effect ofthrowing Turkey or Italy into the wrong camp; and he endorsedtheir views that the Italian situation required delicate handling.He reminded the War Cabinet that we and the French were pledged to inform Signor Mussolini before we took any forward action inthe Balkans. He had asked our Ambassador in Rome* to endeavourto find out Signor Mussolini&apos;s views on the general Balkan situationthrough Count Ciano. He would also take steps to obtain theTurkish views on the matter. He welcomed the proposal that a token delivery of anti-tank guns should be made to Turkey,although, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, the retention orremoval of the Suspense Clause was not a matter of very greatimportance. If vital Turkish interests were threatened, the Turks would act, whatever the precise position under the Treaty.He informed the War Cabinet that he had received a Note fromM. Cambon which indicated that General Gamelin had now swungfurther towards Marshal Weygand&apos;s views, and was likely at hisMeeting with the Chiefs of Staff arranged for the following week to urge an even more forward policy than that which the French hadalready communicated.The Prime Minister observed that there was some obscurity asto the precise intentions of the French. Suppose that Russia, withthe connivance of Germany, brought pressure to bear on Roumaniato cede Bessarabia, either by force of arms or by adopting the sametactics as in the case of the Baltic States : the Roumanians would presumably not be able to resist a Russian invasion, and, if Turkeyrefused her assistance, Roumania would no doubt make terms withRussia. Did the French in such circumstances intend to launch an expedition in the Balkans against the Russians ?In discussion, it was pointed out that the objectives proposedby the French for Allied intervention in the Balkans were stated on* P.O. telegram to Rome, No. 709.
page 10 of W.P. (39) 149. It was clear that action to prevent enemyaccess to the resources of Roumania was contemplated by the french as at least desirable.The view was generally expressed that our chief interest lay inthe security of the Straits, but that, if Turkey took up arms to oppose a threat to her western frontiers, we should have to come toher aid. Any operations further to the north, designed to hold up an enemy advance, would be quite out of the question.We could, in any case, do nothing at all to stop a german advance through Yugoslavia unless Italy were on our side. Suchaction on the part of Germany, however, seemed unlikely, owing tothe probability that it would drive Italy definitely on to the side ofthe Allies. It was possible, of course, that after Russia had obtained possession of Bessarabia, either by force or by threats,Germany might undertake an invasion of Roumania by passing through Hungary. This, however, would be a big commitment for germany, and she would be bound to weigh very carefully thepolitical repercussions of such action before she undertook it.It was impossible to know whether Turkey would declare war on Russia if she tried to obtain possession by threats of the mouthsof the Danube and the Black Sea ports. It was probable that russia would sound Turkey before embarking on such a course. If,however, the Russians did take such action, regardless of there actions of Turkey, and if Turkey in consequence declared war on her, we should have to join in. There could be no doubt that russia had designs on Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, and would exploitthese to our serious embarrassment if open hostilities broke out.This was a situation which it would be in our interest to avoid ifpossible.Attitude of The discussion then turned on the probable attitude of Italy.Italy.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence drew attention tothe French proposal on page 22 of W.P. (39) 149 that &quot; discussions should be entered into with Italy with the object of securing herconsent, if possible, or at any rate some clarification of the attitudeshe may adopt, if the proposed intervention takes place.&quot; TheChiefs of Staff were of the opinion that we could do very littleindeed to help Turkey if Italian neutrality was not assured, but theFrench envisaged the sending of an expedition even if Italy shouldbe hostile. No doubt Staff Conversations with the Turks would bevery likely to rouse the antagonism of Italy. On the other hand, ifwe made no previous plans at all in collaboration with the Turks,and if subsequently there was an- enemy attack in the Balkans, weshould be in a very bad position to resist it. Would it be possibleto hold any secret conversations with the Turks without arousing-Italian suspicions ?The Prime Minister pointed out that the instructions sent toSir Percy Loraine to take soundings in Italy were based on thehypothesis of Russian aggression only. The French, however,envisaged a combined German and Russian attack. It seemedquestionable whether Italy would take exception to any action bythe Allies which was directed against Russia alone; they might not look askance at Staff conversations with the Turks on this basis.The possibility of a combined Russian and German move, however,was a different question. Personally he did not think that theGermans were likely to attack in the south-east, since the Germanpeople had been told all along that German efforts would be directedprimarily against Great Britain. A diversion in the south-east would probably rouse serious misgivings among the German people.On the other hand, Signor Mussolini would be very susceptible toany action on our part designed to meet the contingency of german attack in the Balkans in view of his personal engagements toGermany.[20457] c
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that theItalians would doubtless realise that any move by Russia in the balkans would be likely sooner or later to involve Germany as well.It seemed very doubtful, therefore, whether Signor Mussolini wouldbe prepared to commit himself in any way, even if the issue was confined only to that of Russian aggression.It was generally agreed that in these circumstances the attitudeof Italy must remain a very uncertain factor. It would be desirable for the Chiefs of Staff to emphasise this point very strongly in their discussions with the French High Command.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence then drew attentionto the Chiefs of Staff comment on the French proposals, containedin paragraph 3 on page 20 of W.P. (39) 149, for immediate staff conversations with the Turks. If Russia alone made an attack inthe Balkans and brought Turkey into the war in consequence, weshould be in a most disadvantageous position, since Germany would only have one front on which to fight. If Germany also attacked inthe Balkans, there would inevitably be some diversion of effort fromthe West to the East. If we were contemplating the movement oftroops from the Western Front to support Turkey, we should haveto inform the Turks how long these moves would take. The french would also have to realise that an expedition in the Balkans wouldinvolve a reduction of our effort in the West. It would further benecessary to increase the strength of our Naval forces in the eastern mediterranean. This would reduce our security in home waters,unless the French would undertake to move some of their naval forces from the West to the East of the Mediterranean.It was agreed that it would be desirable for the Chiefs of staff to bring these considerations to the notice of the French.Some discussion then took place as to the desirability inprinciple of undertaking any operations in the Balkans, even at alater date, when our resources might allow us to do so. It waspointed out that the Turks had never asked for the assistance ofAllied forces in Thrace, and presumably this would cover a fortiorithe despatch of an Allied expedition to the North, for example, intoRoumania through the Black Sea ports. In these circumstances itwould be better to maintain a strictly defensive strategy in the balkans and to concentrate on holding the Straits and the line ofthe Euboean channel.On the other hand, it was argued that we had certain obliga-tions under Article 2 of the Treaty to co-operate with Turkey in holding Bulgaria in check. Moreover, if the Germans did attack in the South-east, it was most probable that they would come down on a broad front. We should be in a very awkward position if they reached the Aegean seaboard, since they could then undertake sub-marine and mine-laying operations against us in those waters. Itwould therefore be most desirable to hold Salonika as a bridgeheadto prevent the enemy reaching the seaboard.At the present time, however, we had admittedly to face thefact that the Germans had a great military preponderance, andthat we had not sufficient forces to hold Salonika against a deter-mined attack. An attempt to do so might result in a disaster.Moreover, the problem of finding the necessary shipping to supportlarge forces in the Balkans might well prove an insuperable difficulty, at least for a considerable time.It was generally agreed that our objective in the Balkan theatrewas correctly stated in Comment 8 by the Chiefs of Staff on page 11of W.P. (39) 149, namely :-&quot; To keep the Straits in the hands of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish coalition in any event, and, if possible, to deny theenemy access to the Aegean.&quot;
AConversations Further discussion then took place as to the line which the with the French Chiefs of Staff should take in their conversations with the French.High Command. High Command on the whole subject- It was agreed that theFrench proposals raised questions of the highest policy and werein fundamental disagreement with British views. It would almost certainly be necessary to resolve these differences of opinion at aMeeting of the Supreme War Council. In these circumstances itwould be better for the conversations of the Chiefs of Staff to be primarily exploratory in character. The line they would takeshould be in accordance with their comments contained in w.P. (39) 149, but they should indicate that they were not in aposition to come to any definite conclusion without further referenceto the War Cabinet. It was possible that there was a divergence of opinion between General Gamelin and General Weygand, butit would clearly be desirable to obtain some further indication ofthe real policy of the French Government.The War Cabinet agreed : (i) To invite the Standing Ministerial Committee on military co-operation-ordination to examine the Chiefs of Staff Review ofMilitary Policy in the Middle East (W.P. (39) 148) andthe recommendations for our long-term policy contained therein, and to submit their recommendations to the WarCabinet.(ii) To authorise the Chiefs of Staff to take the Memorandumon Policy in the Balkans and the Middle East (W.P. (39)149) as their basis in the forthcoming discussions Aviththe French, bearing in mind the points brought outin discussion of this Paper in the War Cabinet, and inparticular &quot; A &quot; above,(iii) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to takesoundings of the Turkish Government, to ascertain their probable attitude in the event of various contingenciesreferred to in the course of discussion; and in particular,of an attempt by Russia to dominate the mouths of the danube.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs dreAV attentionto telegram No. 99, dated the 6th December, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister to the Holy See, reporting that the CardinalSecretary of State had asked whether a proposal by the Pope fora Christmas truce would be favourably received by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. A similar request had been addressed to the Frenchand German Representatives at the Holy See. Mr. Osborne had indicated that the proposal appeared to involve great difficulties.The Prime Minister said that one of the difficulties inherent in the proposal was that, if a truce were agreed to for thesetwo days, what answer was there to proposals that it should befurther extended ?The War Cabinet agreed :  That the Chiefs of Staff Committee, should be asked tosubmit a report on the proposal by the Vatican that a truceshould be arranged to cover the 24th and 25th December.The Vatican.Suggestion for aChristmastruce.[20457]D

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad learned that the French Government were sending a strongdelegation to Geneva consisting of four leading personalities. Inthe circumstances, he thought that it would be well if Mr. R.

The view heldby all whom he had consulted favoured the latter course.The War Cabinet agreed That no communication should be made to the norwegian government regarding the extent to which we should be ina position to give support to that county in the event of aggression either by the U.S.S.R. or by Germany.France. 12.
