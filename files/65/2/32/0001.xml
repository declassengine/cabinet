The Air Situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 97th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

 1. The Secretary of State for Air reported that an offensive sweep by 12 Blenheim fighters had been carried out on the previous day, directed against, the German mine-laying aircraft based at Borkum. Our aircraft had arrived at Borkum about half an hour before dark and had dropped down out of the clouds to a height of 1,000 feet. 3 seaplanes seen on the slipways had been heavily machine-gunned, and there could be little doubt that the great volume of fire brought to bear on them would have effected serious damage. It was believed that the production of this type of seaplane used for mine-laying was on a very limited basis, probably not more than 5 a month. The squadron had been hotly engaged by the anti-aircraft defences and ships, but all had returned safely.

 A few fighter patrols had been sent up during the morning when unidentified aircraft had been plotted approaching the Firth of Forth. No interceptions had been made, however, and the raids had not materialised.

 Intensive searches continued by Coastal Command aircraft for the Deutschland, and bomber dispositions in the North of Scotland were being maintained.

 Air escort had been provided the previous day for four hours for the submarine Triad, which was in difficulties off the coast of Norway.

 The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



The Naval Situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 97th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

 2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet that a German vessel had been heard on the previous afternoon speaking 40 miles South of our Cruiser Patrolling Line. This had been followed at 4 P.M. by a message on the German wireless reporting that a British Cruiser of the "London" Class had been torpedoed by Captain Prien, the U-boat Commander who had sunk the Royal Oak at Scapa. This message had caused anxiety as cruisers of the "London" type were in the area from which the message had come. A signal was therefore sent to the Commander-in-Chief which resulted in a disturbing message from the Admiral commanding our Cruiser Squadron to say that he was out of touch with H.M.S. Norfolk ("London" Class). Later in the evening, however, the Norfolk reported her position, and the fact that an explosion had occured alongside her at 2.40 P.M., which she had attributed to a bomb dropped through a gap in the clouds by a high-flying aircraft, thereby showing that she was unaware of having been attacked by a U-boat.

 This incident had brought home the risk which we were running in keeping the Fleet tied to an area where German U-boats were present, and had caused the Admiralty to review the general position. It was quite possible that the Deutschland might have slipped into a Norwegian fjord and refuelled from a tanker. Instructions had therefore been sent to the Commander-in-Chief not to press too far his desire to capture the Deutschland at all costs. The First Lord described the orders which had accordingly been given.

 A report received that morning stated that H.M.S. Icarus was attacking a U-boat in the locality where the Norfolk had been attacked. Other destroyers had been summoned, and the hunt was continuing.

 The First Lord referred to an incident which he had previously reported to the War Cabinet concerning a U-boat which was alleged to have been seen by a trawler in the Clyde, when the Fleet had been at anchor there. At the time, the report had been disbelieved, but bombs which had since been discharged in the locality had produced a great quantity of oil; and divers had now been ordered to investigate the facts.

Another attack on theFleet might therefore be contemplated.No attacks had been carried out on U-boats.Two ships-one of 1,000 and the other of 3,000 tons-had been mined off the Thames and Yarmouth respectively..A satisfactory clearance had been made from the Port ofLondon and Thames Estuary, 130 ships having sailed from theDowns on the previous day.

tornmmmmmjpssfeM. .   5.  The CMefwf the Air Staff reported that&apos; he hadBequest by by the Polish Air Attache&quot; a message from General SikorPolish Ak for an aircraft to convey Polish agents, to be dropped by parachuteAttache: for a ..at Warsaw, carrying. money and propaganda. The Polish AirBritish aircraft Attache^ was not fully informed as to the details of the proposal,to convey but emphasised that the flight must be carried out before the agents to 2nd December. From the technical point of view it would bePoland. possible for us to supply an aircraft which could carry out the journey to and from Warsaw from France, but weather conditions were bad at this time of the year, and it would be impossible to guarantee that the aircraft would arrive over the right placer in poland. The flight would be a very risky undertaking, andwouldrequire a specially selected aircraft and crew. The Poles had somecivil aircraft of their own which had the necessary range to under-take the flight, but they were apparently anxious that the aircraft should be armed.The Chief of the Air Staff said that he saw no necessity forthe aircraft to be armed, and he had suggested to the Polish AirAttache1 that one of the Polish civil aircraft should be sent toFrance in preparation for the flight, without any further delay,while the project Was being considered in this country. He thoughtit would be much better for the flight to be undertaken by Polishpersonnel, who would have a good chance of reaching safety either in their own or adjacent countries if, owing to weather conditions,the return flight should prove impossible. He suggested that in our reply to this proposal of the Poles we should point out that,, owingto difficulties of weather and navigation, it would be impossible to guarantee the safe arrival of the aircraft at a specified place and date. We might suggest that the flight should be carried out byPolish personnel in one of their own civil aircraft, but offer, as analternative, to provide a British Service aircraft for use by Polishpilots. If the date given, i.e., the 2nd December, was of vitalimportance, the latter course, however, might not be practicable,since preliminary training would be necessary.In the discussion which ensued the War Cabinet was informedthat no approach on this matter had been made through the diplomatic channel, and that the first contact had been made withthe Air Ministry. It seemed probable that the agents to be droppedwere intended to foment a rising in Poland, which might be premature at this stage. This was, of course, a matter for thePoles themselves to decide, but there seemed no reason to encourageit. In view of General Sikorski&apos;s statement that the Polish Govern-ment had good means of communicating with their people in Polandthrough neutral countries, the need fpr sending agents by air wasnot apparent.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to telegraph to Sir Howard Kennard and instruct him to find out moreabout the Polish proposal. A suitable reply on the lines proposedby the Chief of the Air Staff could then be drafted by the ForeignOffice and Air Ministry in consultation. He&apos; thought it important that we should not show ourselves too forthcoming in our answer.*The War Cabinet agreed : that action should be taken by the Foreign Office and AirMinistry in accordance with the discussion recorded above.&apos; * Subsequent to the Cabinet meeting it was learned that the Poles proposedto carry out the flight with one of their own aircraft manned by Polish personnel and merely required certain equipment and assistance from the Royal Air Force.In view of this Information,&apos; the Air Minister, after consultation with theForeign Office, took action to provide&apos; the assistance required and to informGeneral1 Sikorski;

The Secretary of Statethen read Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s latest telegram (No. 120, datedthe 28th November), which is attached to the present conclusions as an Appendix. Attention was called to paragraph 6, which read as follows: &quot; With regard to the possibility of difficulty with France,to which reference is made in your telegram, I may add thatwe had not intended to suggest that the United Kingdom should indicate in the statement the order of preference to be attachedto its own war efforts.&quot;It was pointed out that this argument was irrelevant. Theorder of preference to be attached to the United Kingdom&apos;s warefforts was not in question.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that it might be convenient if the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and he were to consult together with a view to putting forward a recommendation to the War Cabinet as to the reply to be returnedto Mr. Mackenzie King.The War Cabinet agreed to this course.PMsmi. 8.   The Secretary of State for War said that, according to amThreat of Soviet unconfirmed report, the U.S.S.R. had concentrated 350,000 men, aaggression.(previous reference erence:W.M: (39) 97thConclusions,Minute 7.)large number of aircraft, and 750 tanks along the Soviet-Finnishborder. The Finns had 466,000 men under arms, and were inpossession of a strong line. They were plucky people, and it looked as though they intended to fight.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention toram No. 478, dated the 28th November, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, which was to the following effect: &quot;According to the official Soviet broadcast that evening,the Government of the U.S.S.R. had sent a reply to the finnish government claiming that the Finnish Government, by denyingresponsibility for the incident on the Karelian frontier, were trying to mislead public opinion and to escape responsibilityfor their actions; at the same time they were insulting theRed Army by suggesting that the incident might have been dueto some mistake wmimitted by the hotter?

 Government should move back their troops for a distance of 25 kilometres, since this would bring them to the suburbs of Lehingrad. The note concluded by stating that as the foregoing hostile act of the Finnish Government was incompatible with the terms of the Finnish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and as the Finnish Government refused to withdraw their troops as an earnest of their intentions, the Soviet Union could not be the sole party to observe the Pact. Accordingly, the Soviet Government no longer regarded themselves as bound by that Pact.

 "Sir William Seeds reported at the same time that it has been announced on the Soviet wireless at midnight that two further incidents had occured on the Finnish-Soviet frontier, the first a clash between patrols, during which two Finnish prisoners were captured, and the second the firing of two shells by Finnish artillery near a Soviet frontier post. In both cases responsibility was claimed by the wireless announcer to lie with the Finns. Soviet papers appearing on the evening of the 28th November published an order issued by teh Commander of the Leningrad Military District instructing troops to fire back in case of further provocation by the Finnish forces."

Censorship of Outward Mans. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 94th Conclusions, Minute 11, and 36th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

 11. The War Cabinet had under consideration Memoranda by the Minister for Economic Warfare (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 118), and by the Minister of Information (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 123).

 The Minister for Economic Warfare said that the examination of mails on neutral ships outward bound from European ports was an essential part of the scheme for stopping German exports, since valuable information regarding those exports would be obtained thereby. Inward bound mails were already examined, and no further legal consideration arose. He was informed that the censorship machinery in the United Kingdom was ready to undertake examination, but the organisation in the Mediterranean would have to be reinforced. In view of the probable reaction in Italy, examination at Gibraltar would have to be somewhat perfunctory at the start.

 The Minister of Information strongly supported the proposal. Propaganda of a most pernicious type, which was being sent out to neutral countries, would be intercepted. The examinations would


have to be carefully magged, and?in this connection he asked theWar Cabinet to decide whether more harm than good might notbe done by stopping propaganda addressed to theUnited States.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed with theMinister for Economic Warfare as to the importance of the proposal.At the same time the War Cabinet should be under no illusionsas to the likely reaction of neutral countries, and in particular ofItaly. Only a few days previously the Italian Ambassador had spoken to him strongly about interference with mails. He would therefore like to obtain the views of our Ambassador in Borne asto the probable Italian reaction and as to the means by which thedecision could be applied with a minimum of friction with theItalians. He also suggested that he should enquire from our ambassador at Washington whether German propaganda destined for the United States should be intercepted. The diversion ofinward mails had given rise-to many complaints, some of themjustified, and he felt, therefore, that the scheme should not beapplied until machinery was ready to work it both smoothly and rapidly. He would like to be certain on this point before thedate of application was decided. Neutral opinion would be lessdisturbed if examination were carried out sufficiently quickly toallow mails to continue their journey on the same boat.The Minister for Economic Warfare agreed that mailsexamined at Gibraltar ought to go on in the same boat, sincesailings were infrequent. In Great Britain, it might be more acceptable to neutrals if the ship and its cargo were released andmails forwarded later.In subsequent discussion, it was agreed that the examinationof outward mails was of the highest importance, but that due regard must be paid in its working to the susceptibilities of neutral countries. It might be well to delay the application of the schemeto mails from Italy, owing to the effect of the mine campaign onItalian opinion. The proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to consult our Ambassador in Rome was, therefore,welcomed.The War Cabinet :-(i) Agreed in principle that mails on neutral ships outward bound from Europe and diverted to ports in GreatBritain or Northern Ireland or to ports . in theMediterranean and Red Sea should be submitted to afull and thorough examination.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to informHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome of the intentionof His Majesty&apos;s Government to examine mails outward bound from Europe and of the importance which they attached to this step, and to ascertain his personal opinion of the probable Italian reaction, and his suggestions for methods of applying the decision so asto make it more palatable to Italian sentiment.       &apos;(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to-ascertain from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington the probable reactions of United Statesopinion to interference by the Allies with german propaganda sent through mails and destined for theUnited States. .y4)o&apos; toa &quot;-bbv(iv) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for War and-the Minister for economic Warfare in consultation to decide^-(a) The date from; w-examined., b.

The War Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 121) covering the report of a discussion in the Home Policy Committee on the possibility of amending the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts. The Committee had agreed to recommend the War Cabinet to authorise the HomeSecretary to announce that he would consider the possibility of provisional legislation, m consultation with the Trade UnionCongress and representatives of employers and other interests.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Home Secretary only askedfor permission to embark on discussions, and that the War cabinet were not being asked to accept the principle that the rates of benefit should be increased unless the discussions led to agreement. Thegeneral view of the Home Policy Committee was that the Chancellorof the Exchequer would be in a stronger position in resisting anygeneral demand for increases in benefits, wages, &amp;c, if he were ableto surrender weak positions which were difficult to defend. On that basis it had been agreed that the rates of Unemployment assistance should be increased. Workmen&apos;s Compensation was different, inthat it was not based on need and did not involve any direct charge on the State; but the existing system embodied grievances whichwould have been remedied before long, if there had been no war.The case for amending legislation had been pressed as strongly fromthe Government as from the Opposition side in the House ofCommons, and if it were not possible even to say that, as the RoyalCommission could not continue its work, discussions were proceeding to find some temporary solution, the result would be a difficult political situation and bad feeling among the workers. Onthe last point, he was voicing the opinion of the Minister of Labour.On the other hand, the Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland had told the Home Policy Committee that theywere agreeable to discussions being initiated, but had expressed theview that it would be difficult to differentiate between WorKmen&apos;compensation and Health Benefits and other similar payments, andhad urged that any increase in compensation rates should beconsidered in relation to possible reactions on such other social service benefits. The Secretary of State for Scotland had also referred to the burden which would fall on industry, if the rates of workmen&apos;s Compensation were to be increased.The Secretary of State for the Home Department said thatthe employers&apos; side of the Royal Commission were quite clear that,under war conditions, they could not find time to continue its work.The Trade Union side had put in 400 pages of evidence, and fromthe employers&apos; point of view, much time and labour would berequired to reply to this evidence.. He (the, Secretary of State)was,however, anxious to keep open the possibility that the RoyalCommission might be restarted, if agreement on provisional legisla-tion were not possible, as one way of keeping the issues alive. he pointed out that the existing scales of w orkmen*s. Compensationwere very difficult to defend in relation to other scales.. after allowing for the employers&apos;/, right:.in:.case of permanent disablementto. commute tfcallowance payat[20423]&apos;cases, wastoe maximum$3$. per week, whereaswmseft.
under the scheme for war injuries to civilians a man with a wife and two children would draw 46*. Qd. per week. There were othermatters, such as nystagmus and rehabilitation, that might well beconsidered in discussions such as he was suggesting, but obviouslythe main structure of the Acts could not be considered until theRoyal Commission could resume its work.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, faced with a longand critical war, he looked with alarm at any proposal for increases in benefits for which the Government was responsible. increases in Workmen&apos;s Compensation would be at the expense of theemployers, but employers were already pleading that they couldnot afford the increased contributions which would be necessary if Old Age Pensions were to be raised. The Minister of Pensionshad pointed out to the Home Policy Committee that it was unlikelythat a small increase in WorkmenV Compensation would be acceptable to the workers, and that the grant of a small increase,unjustified at present by any increase in the cost of living, would lead to irresistible pressure for something more. A substantial increase on the other hand would certainly give rise to demands for a review of the rates of civil compensation and this, in turn,to claims for better rates of war pensions. He (the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer) entirely agreed with the view expressed by theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury to the Home Policy Committeethat we should be lucky if we were able to get through the warwithout a reduction in the standard of our social services. Weshould deal with all such services together, and take the line thatimprovements were out of the question in view of the strainresulting from the war. Unemployment Assistance stood by itself,as the scales had to be fixed to provide for the maintenance of people who had no other resources whatever and it therefore followed that,if prices changed, the scales must be changed also. The old age pensioners had the next strongest claim; but Workmen&apos;s Compen-sation was in no way related to need and the claim that rates shouldbe increased did not arise in any way out of war conditions. Hewas, therefore, strongly opposed to authorising any discussions thatmight lead to an increase in the rates of compensation.He proposed to deal with the matter in the House of commons by stating the essential facts of our financial effort, contrasting the burdens placed on the wage-earner in Germany with the positionof the wage-earner in this country, and emphasising that all alikemust share in the burdens imposed by the war. He would explainhow matters stood in the matter of Old Age Pensions and say that,as regards Workmen&apos;s Compensation, while consideration of other points such as the problem of nystagmus might well proceed, it wasnot possible at the present time to consider any suggestions thatwould involve increases in the rates of compensation.These views met with considerable support, and in. the courseof further discussion it was urged that people generally were very ready to accept the view that sacrifices were necessary all roundand that it was not practicable in war time to increase expenditureon the social services; also that any increases in the rates of workmen&apos;s Compensation would certainly lead to demands for increases in other fields, e.g., Service pensions.The War Cabinet agreed :-(1) That the recommendation of the Home Policy Committee(H.P.C. (39) 18th Conclusions, Minute 1 (a)), viz. :&quot; that tee War Cabinet should authorise the HomeSecretary to make an announcement in the Houseof Commons that he would consider, in consultationwith the Trade Union Congress and representativesof employers and other interests, whether any
255 9.10.08(89).provisional legislation for amending the Workmen&apos;compensation Acts such as may be practicable under war obnditi^ns can be formulated, on the under-standing that this would he without prejudice tofcbe recommendation of the Royal Commission asto the principles to be adopted in permanent legisla-tion and that the prospect of early legislationdepends on a Slope,that substantial agreement onthe provisional proposals may be reached. Any such statement should be in sufficiently general terms tocover other points besides benefits, for example,nystagmus &quot;should not be accepted.(2) To invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer to deal withthe matter in his statement to the House of commons that evening on the general lines indicated by him inthe course of the discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,November 29, 1939.[20423J p
APPENDIX.Cypher telegram from the Government of Canada, dated November 28, 1939.-(Received November 29, 5-41 a.m.)(No. 120. Immediate.)YOUR telegram No. 111. Following from Prime Minister for your PrimeMinister: Begins: 1. I am much obliged by your observations on the two points whichit was indicated the Canadian Government regarded as an integral part of anagreement on the joint Air Training Scheme.2. The position of the Government of the United Kingdom, as indicatedin your telegram and in communications from the United Kingdom High Com-missioner, has been considered by our Cabinet to-day.3. As regards the necessity which we have been emphasising for some weeks of reaching conclusions on general financial and economic requirements before it could be determined how the Air Training Scheme would fit into the arrange-ments, we have noted your conclusion that there is no reason to suppose that amutual and reasonable satisfying agreement will not be reached.4. As regards the question of priority of the Military efforts, there appearsto be some misunderstanding of our position. Your telegram indicates that your government understands that what is desired is an assurance that the canadian government&apos;s views as to preference of effort are primarly for ourselves to decide.We, of course, recognise that we, like the other Governments of the Common-wealth, must assume the primary responsibility for the nature and the extent ofthe contribution we are to make to the joint war effort. We also believe, however,that it is essential to consult with our associates in the conflict, and it was forthis purpose that from the outset we requested the opinion particularly of theGovernment of the United Kingdom as to what would be the most effective formour effort could take, and as far as conditions permitted we have adopted themeasures proposed.5. After a programme largely based on the recommendations of the UnitedKingdom Government has been drawn up and was being put into force, yourtelegram of the 26th September was received suggesting as an addition to theprogramme the Air Training Scheme as being of vital and decisive importance.In our reply we indicated that we agreed that Canadian co-operation in thisscheme would be particularly appropriate, and probably the most effective military co-operation-operation which Canada could furnish, and we would, therefore, be preparedto accept the scheme in principle and in the light of the scheme to review the plans already made for military and economic co-operation. We have on several occasions since indicated our view that an essential factor in ouir acceptance ofthe Air Training Scheme would be an indication by the United Kingdom GOvern-ment of its view that the proposed effort was most essential military action that canada could take. On the 14th November, at a meeting between the war committee of the Cabinet and Captain Balfour and Lord Riverdale, it was stated that as it was on the strong [ ?] advice of the United Kingdom Govern-ment as to the vital necessity and decisive effect of this project that we had agreed in principle to undertake so great a task, we considered it essential tothe agreement which we hoped to be able to reach that the United KingdomGovernment would be prepared to have it made known that considering presentand future requirements they felt that participation in the Air Training scheme would provide more effective assistance than any other form of co-operation which Canada could give. It was entirely understood by the United KingdomGovernment Representatives that this was an essential factor in our concurrence in the scheme. c:-.
