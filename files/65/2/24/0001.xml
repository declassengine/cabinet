The Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 88th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there had been two raids by single German aircraft the previous day between noon and 1.30. One aircraft flying at a height between 20,000 and 27,000 feet crossed the coast at Brighton, passed over London and flew out down the Thames. A second raider had been identified off Clacton, but did not cross the coast. Anti-aircraft guns had been in action in the Thames Estuary and at Dover. Both the aircraft had been intercepted by fighter patrols, and some hits were observed though neither had been brought down.

In the evening between 6.30 and 9.0 P.M. a number of enemy aircraft were active off the East Coast from Felixstowe to Margate. They had not been intercepted. An analysis was made of the areas in which they had apparently been operating, and the Admiralty, had been immediately informed in view of the possibility that they, might have been engaged in mine-laying from the air.

H.M.S. Boadicea had been attacked 60 miles east of Cromer the previous morning; one bomb was dropped near her.

One enemy aircraft flew over Scapa during the morning. It was engaged without result by anti-aircraft fire.

A propaganda raid over Hamburg and Bremen had been carried out the previous evening. Slight anti-aircraft fire had been encountered. Both aircraft concerned had returned.

A sweep over an area in the North Sea had been carried out the previous afternoon by bombers, but no suitable objectives had been found.

A Heinkel 111, which was carrying out a reconnaissance made at a regular hour each day in the Dover area, had been intercepted and shot down that morning.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W,N, (89) 89th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported the forthcoming movements of the Fleet, and the action being taken to combat the German mine-laying. The Admiralty doubted whether mines could be laid from aircraft, though such an operation would be possible if parachutes were used. As an immediate measure it had been decided to try the effect of abandoning convoy on the East Coast and allowing ships to sail independently. All navigational lights would be extinguished so that U-boats would have no leading marks by which to lay mines at night. Shipping would, of course, have to anchor during the hours of darkness. It was believed that the delays involved in anchoring at night would be less than the time saved in not having to wait for convoys, and that the net result would be to improve the turn round of shipping. The abandonment of convoy would release light craft for anti-submarine operations.

Some discussion took place on this proposal. It was pointed out that if deliberate air attacks on shipping were started by the enemy, it would be very difficult for the Royal Air Force to give any protection to ships sailing independently. If as a result, heavy air attack was concentrated on our shipping on the East Coast, the plan would have to be reviewed.

The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet that news had just been received that H.M.S. Belfast had been struck either by a mine or torpedo in the Firth of Forth. she was reported to be making her way to harbour under her own steam.

The mine-sweeper Mastiff had been blown up while sweeping in the Thames the previous day. Steamship Arlington Court, leaded with maize, had been sunk on the 16th November 100 miles west of Ushant.

It was reported in the press that steamship Clan Ogilvie (5,800 tons had been sunk off Mozambique probably by a raider. 

[20367]

 


 Evidence obtained from officers of steamship Africa Shell, which had been sunk in the same area, pointed to the presence of a pocket battleship in these waters.

The presence of a U-boat was suspected east of Rattray Head, and hunting operations were in progress.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.



The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 89th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

3. The Secretary of State for War said that there had been an increase of German divisions in the forward area between Luxemburg and Basle, the biggest increase being opposite Luxemburg.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that no definite deduction could be drawn from these moves, which had taken place during the last twenty-four hours. He emphasised that there were serious practical difficulties, particularly in respect of supply and accommodation, in keeping troops closed up in the forward areas for a long period. Experience in the last war had shown that after about three days these difficulties became acute.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Australian Naval Defence.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 89th Conclusions, Minute 7.) 

4. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence informed the War Cabinet of what had transpired at the meeting with Dominion Ministers on the previous day when the question of the despatch of a Fleet to the Far East had been discussed with them. It had been agreed that a revise of the Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper W.P. (39) 125) should be prepared by the First Lord, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and himself in consultation, which cover the questions raised by Mr. Casey about our action in the event of Japanese aggression on the Netherlands East Indies. This paper would be laid before the War Cabinet before it was communicated to Dominion Ministers.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Poland.

Formation and equipment of Polish Forces. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 84th Conclusions, Minute 6.)

5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a report by the Military Co-ordination Committee (Paper W.P. (39) 128), on the formation and equipment of Polish Forces.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence outlined paragraph by paragraph the considerations leading up to the recommendations of the Committee in their Report.

In discussion, the following observations were made:-

(i) Paragraph 2.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had communicated the proposal to form one or two Polish Divisions in Canada to the Canadian Government, after speaking to Mr. Crerar. The Canadian Government had taken no decision. He pointed out that there was a considerable difference between raising Divisions of Polish refugees in France and segregating Polish Canadians in special formations. He was awaiting further information from Canada.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that no mention was made in the Report of the method of financing these Polish units in Canada.

It was suggested that the Poles were prepared to provide the necessary dollar funds from their own resources or from sympathisers in America, but it was agreed that the point should be cleared up with the Polish authorities as seem as possible.

Theagreement should also deal with the chain.of coiraaamd of thePolish units. The provision of equipment would have to bereferred to in somewhat guarded terms in view of our own and French difficulties in this respect.The War Cabinet agreed: (1) To approve the conclusions and recommendations of theMilitary Co-ordination Committee in their .-Report onthe Formation and Equipment of Polish Forces (paper.P. (39) 128), which are reproduced as Annex I to.-..-*.    these Conclusions.(2) To invite the Secretary of State fbr Foreign Affairs toascertain from the Polish Government their proposalsfor financing the formation, equipment, and maintenanceof Polish units in Canada, it being understood that the dollar resources of this country&apos;could hot be madeavailable for this purpose.- (3) To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, after discussion with other Ministers interested, to submit to the War Cabinet for approval, prior to discussionwith the French Government, the heads of an agreement in general terms to govern the further participation inthe present war of the armed forces of Poland.IMsomeHB of access by repre-&apos; .ilgntatives.o  $hePress, oraccredited,representativesof a nenfeslPower,AtJSltwSAAA^IJefeserr-ss:WM (. 3) r/0i&apos;* :Conclusions,(8.

(39) 76thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (paper.P. (G.) (39) 104) by the Military Co-ordihation Committee,dealing with publication of the names of Dominion Service personnelconcerned in any particularly gallant or noteworthy war exploits.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that throughoutthe last war it had been the accepted principle hot to publish the names of personnel who had taken a prominent. part in anyparticular action either by sea, on land or in the air, except in caseswhere the official announcement took the form of an award of adecoration or of a mention in despatches. The Military Co-ordina-tion Committee were strongly of opinion that this principle shouldcontinue to be observed throughout the present war, not only asregards United Kingdom but also as regards Dominion service personnel. The Committee recognised that the matter was one inwhich each Dominion Government was entitled to take its ownline, but they recommended that the Dominion Governments shouldbe informed of the practice which the United Kingdom proposed tofollow, and should be invited to conform.The Secretary^ of State for Dominion Affairs suggested thatthe existing principle with which he entirely agreed, was based onthe importance (a) of preventing information finding its way to the enemy;. and(b) of not setting up invidious comparisons between equallydeserving and gallant members of the same Service.There was no question but that the Dominions must accept our ruling as regards any of their personnel serving in the UnitedKingdom Forces. The real difficulty would arise after theDominions&apos; own forces had been in action, when there might bea desire to give publicity to their exploits in ways not in accordancewith our practice. :The War Cabinet agreed : (i) That a.departure from the existing,,principle; would\ fee- detrimental to Service, efficiency; ..^^^?sts^;&apos;&apos;of;&apos;:^i0United Kingdom Services, therefore, tin u &apos; dp ,be adhered:to.:      af- &apos;: :&apos; pda-dd-daAapppp ^;dr;&apos;.;&apos;pd(ii) That as regards the Dominion Car Aces, \dio aatta was one in. which each Dominion Goveraaaeaat aco sntw^its own-line, but^that Mjiffim&amp;j&amp;ft

The King&apos;s speeches on the forthcoming Propagation and Opening of Parliament.

(Previous Reference W.M. (39) 89th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

9. The War Cabinet were informed that His Majesty The King had suggested that a more specific reference to the co-operation of the Dominions should be included in his Speech on the Opening of Parliament. It had been proposed that this might be achieved by transferring the sentence dealing with the Dominions from the King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation to the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.

In discussion, the view was generally expressed that the Speech on Prorogation should stand unaltered, but that the following addition should be made after the conclusion of the first sentence of the Speech on the opening of Parliament.

"My Dominions overseas are participating whole-heartedly and with an effectiveness which is most gratifying to Me."

The war Cabinet agreed:-

That the draft King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament, as revised, should be submitted to His Majesty The King for approval.

War Finance.

Statement as to Savings Certificates and Defence Bonds.

10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the was advised that the time was not ripe to issue long-term loans of the type which would appeal to large institutions. The view taken was that a loan of this character should not be issued until the big payments made by the Service Departments had had time to reach the reserves on such institutions.

In the meantime, however, it was desirable to make an appeal to people of small means, and he proposed to make an announcement on the matter that afternoon.

In the first place, the existing series of National Savings Certificates would be withdrawn and a new series substituted. They would be issued at 15s.; interest would accumulate slowly in the earlier, but more rapidly in the later years. Repayment would be at the rate of 17s. 6d. after five years, and at 20s. 6d. after ten years. Interest on these certificates would not be subject of Income Tax.

There was, however, a total limit of holdings of £500 worth of Saving Certificates by any one person. He proposed to issue Defence Bonds, bearing interest at 3%, in £5 units, with a provision that up to £1,000 of these Bonds might be held by any one person. These Bonds would be repaid in seven years&apos; time, with a premium of 1%. It was true that the sums obtained in this way would not be very large but it was desirable to make an early start.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.



War Cabinet Arrangements.

12. The Prime Minister said that on Thursday next the House of Commons was meeting at 12 noon. It was therefore proposed that the Meeting of the War Cabinet on that day should be held at 10 A.M.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

I may remind the house that in the last war, as a measure of justified reprisal for subsnariie attacks: 0^1merchant ships, exports of German origin or ownership were ttiade subject to-seizure on the high seas. The many, violations of international law and thtruthless brutality of German methods have decided us to follow a similar coursenow, and an Order in Council will shortly be issued giving effect to this decisionNovember 21, 1939.
