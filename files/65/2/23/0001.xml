The Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 88th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there was little activity to report.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.



Air Operations: Policy as to Attacks on the German Fleet.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 87th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

2. The Chief of the Air Staff said that in connection with the reconnaissance of the German Fleet carried out on the 17th November, he had been invited, at the meeting referred to in the margin to report to the War Cabinet on the method of ensuring the immediate transmission of valuable information obtained by reconnaissance and for taking any immediate action which might be called for. Reconnaissance aircraft had instructions to report valuable information immediately, and it was clear from an analysis of the signals which had been received in connection with this particular reconnaissance that there had in fact been no delay in the transmission of information.



(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 1.)

The Chief of the Air Staff recalled that during the discussion by the War Cabinet on the 30th September, following on the loss of 5 of our bombers in an attempt to engage enemy warships in the Heligoland Bight on the previous day, some apprehension had been expressed as to whether the continuance of attacks on German warships, close to their bases, constituted the best use of our resources. He had subsequently issued a directif to the Air Officer, Commanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command, that, as a general principle, the striking forces should restrict their attacks on warships to those at sea, and should not attempt to attack ships in heavily defended areas. The Air Officer, Commanding-in-Chief, had not considered that an attack on the warships, reported on the 17th November, would be covered by his directif, and no bomber force had therefore been sent out. In any event, there would not have been time to carry out an attack before dark.

Continuing, the Chief of the Air Staff said that circumstances had now changed in our favour since this directif to Bomber Command had been issued. He thought that the time had now come when it should be modified, so as to permit operations of a type at present excluded, provided that the circumstances generally were favourable. Details of the type of operation proposed are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The First Lord of the Admiralty strongly supported the Chief of the Air Staff&apos;s suggestions.

The War Cabinet--

Approved the proposals outlined by the Chief of the Air Staff, which were in conformity with the conclusion recorded by the War Cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin, namely, that it should be left to the discretion of the Air Ministry to order attacks on the German Fleet if a suitable target offered itself in favourable conditions, e.g., an attack which was not likely to result in losses to our own air forces disproportionate to those inflicted on the enemy.



The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M.(39) 88th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty repeated, for the benefit of the members of the War Cabinet who had not been present, the statement which he had made at the meeting referred to in the margin in connection with the German mining operations. He added the information that the counter-mining experiments carried out with depth charges on the previous day appeared to have given hopeful results.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 88th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

5. The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that a German motorised Division, previously thought to be in the Aachen district, had now been identified at Dusseldorf.

There had been an increase in the extent of the Dutch inundations, which now completely severed the island of South Beveland from the mainland.

Reports now indicated that the Greek Army had completed its demobilisation.

There seemed to be considerable military activity in the South East Ukraine, but no particular significance was attached to this.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Weekly Reports.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 81st Conclusions, Minute 4.)

6. The War Cabinet took note of the Weekly Résumé (No. 11) by the Chiefs of Staff (Paper W.P. (39) 129).

Australian Naval Defence.

7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on Australian Naval Defence (Paper W.P. (39) 125).

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that his Memorandum (Paper W.P. (39) 125) had originally been intended as a private communication to Mr. Casey, to reassure him on the naval situation, an to show that there was nothing to prevent the despatch of an Australian force to the Middle East. The Paper had, however, come before the Cabinet in view of certain points of policy touched on, and in particular the statement that our duty to Australia would take precedence over British interests in the Mediterranean.

The Prime Minister thought that the Memorandum went rather further than anything agreed upon by the Government in recent discussions before the war or communicated to the Dominions. The Governement had not been prepared to decide, in advance of the event, whether the Mediterranean should be abandoned to allow of a Fleet to go to the Far East. In this, they had particularly borne in mind the possibility of Italian hostility. They had, however, given the Australian Government the assurance contained in his telegram of the 20th March, but had not gone further in specifying the action we should take. It was, of course, true that the neutrality of Italy altered the circumstances envisaged before the war, and on which that telegram was based.

The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that he had not gone further in his Memorandum than the assurance contained in the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram. He had, however, stated that, in the event of a serious attack on Australia, by which he would imply an invasion in force, we should, if necessary, seal the ends of the Mediterranean and go to the assistance of the Dominions. He did not see that any other course of action would be open to us.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence agreed with the principle expressed by the First Lord. The position was safeguarded in the Memorandum, in that paragraph 4 specifically envisaged Italian neutrality, while the sending of a Fleet to the Far East at the expense of the Mediterranean was limited to the case of a "serious attack." It was interesting to recall that the naval situation now existing was almost identical with that which had been envisaged by the Chiefs of Staff in June 1937 when


 they prepared a Paper in answer to questions raised by the Australian Delegation to the Imperial Conference (C.I.D. Paper No. 450-C).

In that Paper, which, of course, had been handed to the Australian Government, an assurance had been given that--

"the basis of our strategy will lie in establishing at Singapore, at the earliest possible moment after the outbreak of hostilities with Japan, a Fleet whose strength as a minimum will enable it to act on the defensive, and to serve as a strong deterrent against any threats to our interests in the Far East."

It had further been stated that even the intervention of Italy would not affect the principle--

"that no anxieties or risks connected with our interests in the Mediterranean can be allowed to interfere with the despatch of a Fleet to the Far East."



On the other hand we had, since that date, concluded an alliance with Turkey; and in our Military Convention with them, and in our Staff Conversations with the French, we had expressed our intention of doing everything possible to neutralise Italian naval power in the Mediterranean, and to maintain normal traffic through that sea. This made it very difficult for us to give any specific and detailed assurances to the Dominions. They were perhaps rather apt to demand detailed assurances--a fact which was well exemplified by Mr. Bruce&apos;s attitude in the interviews which at various times during last summer he had had with Ministers, including the Prime Minister himself, on this subject.

It was evident that we could not give a 100 per cent. guarantee. Much must depend upon the actual situation when the threat from Japan developed. Either the British Fleet or the German might have suffered lossed, or the British Fleet might be considerably scattered hunting for raiders. It was impossible to say in advance what size of Fleet we would send, or when it could be collected and made ready to proceed to the East. He thought that, if we told the Australians and the New Zealanders that we had every intention of sending a Fleet to Singapore if a serious attack developed, but that a slight risk of raids might have to be undergone, they should not be deterred from sending their forces overseas. After all, the Japanese would hardly allow a decision to invade Australia to turn on the absence of one Division.

The Prime Minister thought that the important point was to prevent the Australians or the New Zealanders from reading more into the Memorandum by the First Lord than it was intended to convey. The question had been exhaustively considered by the Strategical Appreciation Sub-Committee, in April, and their conclusion was that there were so many variable factors which would have to be taken into account, that it would not be possible to say in advance the size of the Fleet we should send to the Far East, or when it would sail. This conclusion was not inconsistent with the idea of sending a Fleet in case of a serious attack on Singapore or Australia. He thought, however, that certain sentences in the Memorandum were not free from the danger of being misinterpreted into an announcement of our intention to send a Fleet to Singapore the moment Japan declared war. It would be necessary to make the Dominion Ministers understand the true situation.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreed that it was most important not to give the Dominions any statement to which we could not subsequently hold. He felt sure that if they were told that the defence of Australia, against real attack would come before our Mediterranean interests but that we could give no specific statement of our actions in advance of the event, they would accept the position, and be satisfied.


The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that, provided his Memorandum was read with previous Papers given to the Australian and New Zealand Governments, and with the Prime Minister&apos;s telegrams it would not be misunderstood. It was important to reassure the Dominions, so that they would consent to the despatch of their forces; and he thought he was right, in present circumstances, in telling the Australians that we should come to their aid in the event of a great invasion--a contingency which he thought extremely remote.

The War Cabinet--

(a) Approved the Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on the understanding that it should be read in conjunction with previous assurances given to the Dominion Governments; and in particular with C.I.D. Paper No. 450-C, and with the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram of the 20th March, 1939, to the Prime Minister of Australia.

(b) Agreed that, in discussion with Dominion Ministers at the Meeting to be held that afternoon, it should be made clear to the latter that the policy laid down in the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram of the 20th March, 1939, still held good; but that the precise action which we should take in any particular circumstances would have to be decided by the Government at the time, in the light of prevailing conditions.

(c) In view of the importance of avoiding any misunderstanding on this matter, invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, on the conclusion of the Meeting with Dominion Ministers to be held that afternoon, to arrange for the drafting of a telegram for despatch to the Australian and New Zealand Governments, explaining the position in regard to this matter.

(d) Agreed that the draft telegram referred to in (c) should be submitted to the War Cabinet for approval before despatch.



Seizure of Exports from Germany.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 88th Conclusions, Minute 3.)



8. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda on the seizure of exports from Germany by the Minister of Economic Warfare and by the Minister without Portfolio (Papers W.P. (G). (39) 90 and 98).

The Minster of Economic Warfare said that Germany was at the present time making great efforts to increase her exports, and that it would be very much to our advantage to hinder her plans so far as we could. Action on our part to interfere with Germany&apos;s export trade might result in an intensification of German pressure on neutrals adjacent to Germany. This might accentuate some of our difficulties in regard to purchase and war trade agreements. In carrying out a policy such as was suggested we should have to be very careful about the attitude of neutrals, e.g., Germany&apos;s coal exports to Italy. We might possibly discriminate in favour of this trade for a time, but in the end we could not maintain such discrimination in the face of the criticism of other neutrals. It would of course be indirectly to our advantage if, by interfering with this trade, we could throw an increased strain on the Germain railway system by forcing her to send coal to Italy by rail.

An essential part on any such scheme was the interception of outward bound mails, which in the last war had provided the great bulk of the evidence for the seizure of goods. It would take some time to establish a completely effective stoppage of German exports, but a beginning could be made at once with the seizure of goods actually shown on ships&apos; manifests as having originated with

  


 German exporters. From the point of view of economic warfare, he had no doubt that the balance of advantage lay in deciding to stop German exports.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he attached great importance to our decision on this point being taken as soon as possible, so that it might be closely related with the mine outrages on neutral shipping of the last few days. Further, the Germans might at any moment declare that certain areas had been mined, and it would be a good point for us if we could come out first with our complaint of the illegality of their action before any such declaration had been made. For these reasons he urged that the declaration had been made. For these reasons he urged that the policy should be announced quickly and a beginning made with stopping exports, even if it took some time to make the scheme fully effective.

The Attorney-General said that, when the Committee over which he had presided had considered the matter, they had concluded that it was possible on legal grounds to justify the action suggested, but that it raised debatable issues. The week-end&apos;s events had changed the position, and, from a legal point of view, it was important to link up any decision that might be reached with the occasion which was held to justify action by way of reprisal. International law in general was not inclined to favour the principle of reprisal, and the attitude of neutral opinion was therefore important. The procedure would be by issue of a Reprisals Order-in-Council which would need to be very carefully drafted. The Prize Court would accept the recital of facts set out in an Order-in-Council, but would reserve the right to consider whether the degree of injury suffered justified the interference with neutral rights.

Sir Alexander Cadogan said that, in a telephone conversation, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had told him that in his view the events of the week-end rendered necessary some action by way of reprisal such as had been suggested. He thought it important, however, that we should be certain of our ground, and he stressed the importance of considering the effect on neutral Powers, particularly on Russia, Italy and Japan.

The Prime Minister read a letter from the Minister of Shipping expressing himself strongly in favour of the action proposed, in the hope that it would deprive neutral shipowners of a profitable trade and encourage them to charter their shipping to us; but urging that effect should be given to it in such a way as to cause the least possible irritation and delay to neutral shipping.

The President of the Board of Trade expressed similar views, and urged in particular that it was important to meet the case of neutrals who had actually bought goods. He thought it would be reasonable to accord generous treatment in respect of transactions which had already taken place.

The Minister for Economic Warfare pointed out that, if the policy of the last war were to be followed, the goods seized would be sold, and, in the case of goods in neutral ownership, the proceeds would be paid out to them, if it seemed that they were not likely to be used in an attempt to continue the export of German Goods. At present, however, there was the added complication of blocked sterling.

The Prime Minister suggested that, in order that an announcement might be made with the least possible delay, he should make a statement in the House of Commons on the following day referring to the outrages committed by the Germans, the recent mine outrages being represented as the culmination of a series of illegalities. He would go on to say that we were considering what measures we
