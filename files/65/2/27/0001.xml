On the previous afternoon, a vessel of 1500 tons had been mixed in one of the channels which had been cleared in the Thames. As the result, shipping in the Thames had been held up. The Channel between the Downs and the Thames had now, however, been cleared; and the North-hound East Coast convoy had started.

The First Lord explained the steps which were being ? to deal with those mines which had been located, and to clear the channels for shipping, and said that a special section in the Admiralty had been set up to deal with this problem.

As regards submarine warfare, a report had just been received that a Dutch tanker of 5,000 tons had been torpedoed off the West coast of Ireland on the 18th November.

There had been no attacks on German submarines.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Magnetic mines.

Suggested retaliatory measures.

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty sought a decision in principle from the War Cabinet regarding a project on which the Admiralty wished to being work, and which might be adopted as a retaliatory measure for the use by Germany of magnetic mines.

A description of the project and a record of the discussion on it are given in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet agreed:-

To authorise the Admiralty, in co-operation with the Air Ministry, to proceed to work forthwith on the project described by the First Lord of the Admiralty, on the understanding that a final decision should be reserved until the project was ready to be put into execution.



The Shipping Situation. Delays caused by magnetic mines.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 91st Conclusions, Minute 3.)

4. The Lord Privy Seal suggested that, in view of the inevitable delays in shipping which would be caused by magnetic mines, it might be prudent to call for a Report from the Departments which would be affected by these delays.

The War Cabinet agreed:-

That the question of the effect of present delays in shipping upon the supply situation should be examined by a Committee of the Ministers concerned, which should be instructed to report to the War Cabinet.



Publicity regarding naval losses.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 7th Conclusions, Minute 12) H.M.S., Belfast.

5. The Lord Privy Seal raised the question whether the Admiralty intended to issue a statement to the Press regarding the fact that damage had been sustained by H.M.S. Belfast, in view of the fact that the news had already been published by the American Broadcasting Companies.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Admiralty rule was to publish losses only and not damage, unless the damage was obviously know to the enemy. As in this particular case, news of the damage to H.M.S. Belfast was well know and since moreover, it now seemed that it would take five or six man ? to repair her, he would arrange for a statement to be issued ?

The War Cabinet ? note of the above statement.

 had an encouraging conversation with the Japanese Ambassador as to the possibility of improving Anglo Japanese relations. Nevertheless, he (the Secretary of State) felt considerable anxiety in regard to the situation.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Germany Internal situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 85th Conclusions, Minute 8.)



9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that His Majesty&apos;s Representative Lima, had reported that he bad been informed by a high Official in the Peruvian Foreign Office that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been informed by the Peruvian Minister in Berlin that internal conditions in Berlin were now extremely bad. He had added that the German delay in launching an attack on the Western Front was due to the wholly unexpected strain on the German War machine caused by the campaign in Poland, and particularly by the difficulties of petrol supply.

The Foreign Secretary also drew attention to telegram No. 871, Saving, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, reporting certain conversations which the Greek Minister in Paris, who had recently returned from Germany, had had with German bankers and industrialists. They had told M. Politis that the German High Command were determined to get rid of the Hitler régime and themselves take over the Government. Sir Ronald Campbell had added that these reports must be treated with reserve.

The Foreign Secretary also gave the War Cabinet particulars received from a secret source purporting to describe recent discussions between Herr Hitler and his Naval, Military and Party leaders. Particulars of this information are given in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.



Peace feelers from Neutral States.

Warning from Paris in regard to Netherlands policy.

10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 870, Saving, dated the 23rd November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, in which Sir Ronald Campbell reported that, according to M. Léger, official circles in Paris considered that the Allied Governments should be extremely wary in their reception of peace feelers received from neutral, and particularly Netherland, sources. They appeared to think that the people of the Netherlands, unlike those of Belgium, had no strong national spirit and would prefer to be politically subordinate to Germany (as they would be in the event of a premature peace) rather than face the consequences of having their country turned into a battle-field. M. Léger accordingly expected M. van Kleffens, whether prompted by Germany or not, to grasp at any and every opportunity to bring the belligerents to engage in open or surreptitious peace talks.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Roumania.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 39th Conclusions Minute 10) Change of Government.

11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a telegram had been received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Bucharest, in which Sir Reginald Hoare had expressed the view that the resignation of M. Bojoiu, Minister of Industry and Commerce, which had since led to the resignation of the Roumanian Government, was likely to weaken effective Roumanian resistance to German economic pressure.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.




German Oil Supplies (Previous Reference W.M. (39) 50th Conclusions Minute 8)



12. The War Cabinet had before them the First Report by the Minister without Portfolio and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence on the action taken and the organisation required to prevent oil supplies from reaching Germany (Paper W.P. (39) 184).

The Minister without Portfolio said that he was not asking the War Cabinet for any decisions as these had been obtained as each point had arisen. The object of the Report was to inform the War Cabinet of the progress made. In going through the Report he drew attention to the following particular points:-

(1) Contraband control of the traffic through the Dardanelles.--If the present arrangements for intercepting vessels in the open sea were to prove unworkable, he would at once ask that further consideration should be given to the suggestions previously been put forward, that the Turkish or the Greek Government should be approached with a view to a suitable base being made available.

The Minister for Economic Warfare suggested that the authority recently given for the purchase of Greek tobacco and the forthcoming negotiations for a War Trade Agreement, might provide a suitable opportunity for an approach to the Greek Government on this matter. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that, if we were making any valuable concessions in the sphere of trade, it might be convenient to raise this matter again with them.

(2) Oil Supplies passing through Italy.--The Minister without Portfolio said that he had just heard that the Shell Company were hoping to buy up the Aquila Refinery, which would enable them to control the destination of its output.

(3) Rationing of oil supples for Neutrals.-- When further information had been obtained as to the quantities of oil crossing neutral frontiers into Germany, it might be necessary to consider plans for rationing the oil supplies of neutrals, particularly in the case of Italy and Switzerland, but definite evidence must be awaited before this could be considered.

(4) Roumania.--When the news was received of Germany&apos;s activities in Roumania, the departure of the British Mission had been expedited. They had arrived on the 20th November, but no report had yet been received. The permanent official to be attached to the Legation at Bucharest for work in connection with oil supplies had left on the 23rd November.

(5) Despatch to the British Minister at Bucharest.--In communicating with the British Legation at Bucharest about the mission on oil matters, the Foreign Office had not actually instructed the British Minister to obtain the support of the King and Government of Roumania as suggested in paragraph 28 of the report. The Minister without Portfolio, to whom the Foreign Office letter was shown before despatch, had agreed that it should be left to Sir Reginald Hoare to decide how he could best support the mission.



(Previous References: W.M. (89) 85th Conclusions, Minute 11, and 21st Conclusions, Minute 5.)

(6) Use of grain barges for oil.--In connection with the chartering and purchase of grain barges on the ground that they might otherwise be converted by the Germans for the carriage of oil, the Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that it was advisable to know definitely whether the barges could be converted in this way. The Minister without Portfolio said that the permanent representative who had just left for Bucharest had been instructed to make definite enquiries on this point.

(7) General Conclusions--While it was premature to prophesy, and it was seen? to say that the picture presented was a favourable one, the estimate of the amounts of oil likely to be resoning Germany from various sources were smaller than those contemplated in the Report of teh Committ presided over by the
