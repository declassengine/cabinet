The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 116thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet thatthere had been only very slight air activity on the previous day.A sweep had been carried out by five aircraft over Texel andHeligoland in search of German warships, but none had been found.Three enemy aircraft had been reported approaching our coasts,but only one had come close. This had been over Flamborough Headat about 1 a.m. that morning, but no Fighter aircraft had been ableto be sent up on account of fog.Similar weather conditions had prevented us from sending ourstanding patrols over the German mine-laying bases.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:WM. (39) 116thConclusions,Minute 2.)The AdmiralGraf Spee.(previous reference:WM, (39)116thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that our D.F. Stations had, on the previous night, picked up a faint wireless message from an enemy vessel in the Atlantic,not far from the Canadian Convoy. This point could have beenreached, so far as distance was concerned, by units of the german fleet reported in the North Sea three days earlier. The greatlysuperior strength of our Naval forces in this area would have made an engagement welcome. It was now thought, however, that therecent sortie of the German Fleet had been to give cover to the mine-laying operation near the Tyne, and that they had now returned to their base.There had been no attacks on our shipping other than by mines.Three British ships had been sunk by mines off the Tyne making a total of ten sunk since the 13th December. It was believed that the minefield of the ordinary, and not magnetic,type had been laid by surface ships at night. Seven of thesemoored mines had been exploded.Two attacks had been carried out on U-boats, with unknownresults.The Cruiser H.M.S. Despatch working alone off the Westcoast of South America had encountered and captured the german armed merchantman Dusseldorf (5,000 tons) and had taken her inas a prize to Antofagasta.The First Lord said that the Admiral Graf Spee had been ordered by the Uruguayan Government to leave Montevideo by11 p.m. (Uruguayan time) on the 16th (2 a.m. the 17th December,G.M.T.). The time had been calculated to allow her to carry outseagoing repairs only. Particulars were given of the British naval forces which would be ready to engage her should she attempt to escape.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theUruguayan Minister had called at the Foreign Office on the previous day and had repeated the reservation expressed by the UruguayanGovernment, who held that the fight had taken place partly inUruguayan territorial waters. In this connection, the foreign secretary mentioned that we had placed on record three weeks agoour disagreement with the contention of the Uruguayan Govern-ment that the River Plate, which was in places 200 miles wide,constituted territorial waters. The opportunity had been takento express to the Uruguayan Minister our gratitude for so promptlyreleasing our prisoners from the Admiral Graf Spee. This navalbattle had, as a matter of fact, fallen very opportunely at a moment when a tactless note from the German Minister had given offence to the Uruguayan Government.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[20504]b 2
Canada.Arrival of1st canadian division.(previous references:W.M. (39) 78thConclusions,Minute 6,and 100thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. In connection with the previous Minute, the First Lord ofthe Admiralty informed the War Cabinet of the time and place ofthe arrival of the first Canadian Division, and suggested that steps should be taken locally to welcome it.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs mentioned, that lord Derby might be prepared to receive the Canadian Contingent,as he had done in the case of 200 Newfoundlanders who had arrived.,on the previous day; and he undertook to make the necessary arrangements.The War Cabinet took note that the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs would set arrangements in train for thewelcome of the First Canadian Division on its arrival inthis country.B.B.C. news bulletins.Reports ofShipping losses.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs emphasised thedesirability of giving full publicity to such successes as our engage-ment with the Admiral Graf Spee and the capture of the german armed merchantman Dusseldorf by HALS. Despatch off the coast of Chile, as an antidote to the depressing accounts of our shipping losses, which bad been unduly advertised in neutral countries.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed. In particular, hedeplored the unrelieved pessimism of the B.B.C. broadcasts, whichunfailingly opened with a long account of ships sunk. He would shortly be circulating to the War Cabinet a letter from theCommander-in-Chief at Devouport describing the demoralisingeffect of these broadcasts. He suggested that it would be sufficientif we were to broadcast our shipping losses once a week.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence agreed, adding thathe was continually receiving similar complaints about the depressingcharacter of the B.B.C. broadcasts.The War Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consult theMinister of Information in regard to the above suggestions.The Military 5.

The Assistant Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatInvasion by no news had been received of the position in Finland sinceD.S.S.R. 0600 hours on the 14th December.  In the South it was believed that(Previous the Russians had now reached the Mannerheim Line, but the FinnsReference: were confident of being able to resist in this sector. Their prospects,W.M.

South.Supply of The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, asMunitions. arranged the previous day, he had seen the High Commissioner for
South Africa in London and that the latter had undertaken to1telegraph to General Smuts to press for the release of some at least of the twenty-eight Gauntlet aircraft for the use of the Finns.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Koraay. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadCounter been giving further consideration to the First Lord&apos;s suggestionmeasures that British destroyers should seize German ships in Norwegianagainst the territorial waters. In view of the Norwegian Governmentsabuse of intention to institute convoys of ships through their waters, it wouldNorwegianterri- be difficult for us to justify this plan on the grounds that thetorial waters. Norwegians were unable themselves to provide efficient protection.(Previous In the event of the War Cabinet deciding to take some such actionReference:        in violation of Norwegian rights, he thought it would be better toW,M. (39) 116th say frankly that we were taking action in retaliation, not for conclusions,      German mine-laying, for we had already taken the appropriateMinute 4.)        retaliatory action against that, but for the ruthless treatment ofour ships in what was proving a cruel and merciless struggle.   Weshould admit that our action was an infringement of neutral rights,but  that  it  was  as  nothing  compared  with  the  completelyunscrupulous manner in which these rights had been violated byGermany.Before deciding on any action, however, he thought that theWar Cabinet should consider the papers which the Chiefs of staff and the Minister for Economic Warfare had been asked to prepareon the stoppage of exports of iron ore to Germany via Narvik. this might mean postponing the discussion until, say, Wednesday, the20th December.The First Lord of the A dmiralty agreed to a short delay in theconsideration of his paper, W.P. (39) 162.After further consideration, the Naval Staff had come to theconclusion that it would be wiser to adopt the alternative plan,which was to lay a mine-field in Norwegian territorial waters, soas to force the traffic out on to the high seas, rather than to sendin our own destroyers. There was, therefore, not the same urgencyin deciding to take action.The Deputy Chief of Staff explained that there were only four points in Norwegian waters at which ships had to show themselves.Everywhere else they were in waters in which they could not be .got at. The Norwegian idea would be to organise convoys to cover the short trip across these points. This they could do with theresources at their disposal.In weighing up the action which we might take, it had to beremembered that the plan of sending in destroyers could not reston the plea of defending our own shipping, as what we wished todo was to intercept ships carrying ore to Germany. In this plan,therefore, there was a serious risk of clashes between our Navy andthe Norwegian Navy in their waters. Such clashes were to be avoided if possible, and, for that reason, the Naval Staff had reached-the conclusion that it would be better to lay mines to force theshipping out of territorial waters, so that we should be able toexercise our rights by intercepting contraband in the usual manneron the high seas.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that there were:many factors to be weighed up in deciding whether it would payus to stop the ore. It was not merely a question of comparing the gain, on the one hand, from depriving Germany of the ore, againstthe loss, on the other hand, from all the various measures which germany might take in revenge. There were a number of otherfavourable factors to be taken into account at each stage in the
argument. For example, if Norway decided to retaliate against us by denying us supplies of aluminium, we could proceed to with-hold vital supplies of other kinds from Norway. Similarly, ifNorway decided to withhold the tanker tonnage which we hadchartered, she could only do so at the cost of her own ruin.The great principle to be observed, however, was that, if we decided to go for the ore, we must do it wholeheartedly. &quot;We should use any and every means to stop the traffic not only from Narvik,but from Lulea and other ports, so as to create a real shortage. by so doing we would shorten the war and save many thousands oflives.The War Cabinet agreed :  To defer consideration of the Memorandum to be circulated by the First Lord of the Admiralty setting out his proposals for action in Norwegian territorial waters,until the papers on the military and economic aspects ofthe problem, which were being prepared by the Chiefs ofStaff Committee and the Minister for Economic Warfarerespectively, were available.Seizure of enemy Exports.The Case ofthe S.S.Sanyo Marti.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 115thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed hiscolleagues of the position in the case of the steamship Sanyo Mam.Since the Meeting of the War Cabinet referred to in the margin, hehad seen the Japanese Ambassador and Sir Frederick Leith-Rosshad seen Mr. Okamoto and carried out the instructions of the WarCabinet.He had found that the Ambassador was perfectly prepared togive the assurances which, we required. Mr. Shigemitsu had under-taken that no part of the cargo would be transhipped en route, andhad volunteered the information that the ship would proceed to japan by the Panama route. He had undertaken to see that the cargo, as it left the Downs, corresponded with the manifest, i.e., hewould order anything which did not appear on the manifest to betaken off the ship. Mr. Shigemitsu said that he and his Govern-ment were surprised at the suspicions which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had entertained. The Japanese Government were not,in fact, giving assistance of any kind to Germany.The Foreign Secretary had replied that he would be frank withthe Ambassador. The fact was that we had. received informationstating that the steamship Sanyo Maru carried some consignments of secret goods of a naval character. Having received this informa-tion, we could not ignore it.   The courses open to us were (1) to search the ship thoroughly from stem to stern;(2) to require an assurance that the naval goods mentioned inthe manifest were bona fide intended for the JapaneseNavy.We had chosen the latter course, as more appropriate to ourfriendly relations. He had also made it clear that we intendedstrictly to enforce the provisions of the Order in Council as from the1st January, 1940.The Ambassador had been pleased by this frankness and had said that he gratefully accepted, on behalf of his Government, theprocedure we had proposed. The Foreign Secretary added thatMr. Shigemitsu&apos;s friendly and apparently sincere attitude duringthe interview had contributed to the removal of some of his doubts.The Foreign Secretary understood that two or three more shipsmight come in to the Downs for examination before the 1st January,which, like the Sanyo Maru, would be carrying German goods
destined for the Japanese Government. These would have toreceive the same treatment as the Sanyo Maru, provided, of course,that they arrived at the Control Base before the date mentioned.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement and agreed (i) that, on the strength of the assurances given by theJapanese Ambassador, the steamship Sanyo Marushould be passed through the Control;(ii) that up to and including the 31st December, 1939.similar treatment should be accorded to other vessels carrying German goods destined for Japan,in the absence of any special reason to the contrary;(iii) that the provisions of the Order in Council should be strictly enforced as from the 1st January, 1940.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,December 16, 1939.
