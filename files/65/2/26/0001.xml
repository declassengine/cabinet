The Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 91? Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State of Air said that a German air raid had been carried out over the Thames estuary on the previous evening. Blenheim aircraft, fitted with special detection apparatus, had gone up in pursuit. The enemy aircraft had escaped into clouds but the working of the special apparatus was reported to have been most satisfactory. A German seaplane had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire in the Thames estuary.

Lerwick had been raided by four enemy aircraft and one of our flying-boats at anchor had been set on fire and destroyed. The base ship Manela had been attacked by a formation of six aircraft, which had been driven off by fire from the anti-aircraft cruiser Coventry.

The previous day had been one of great air activity over the Western Front.

In discussion, attention was drawn to the repeated visits of German aircraft to the Shetlands.

The explanation might be that the Germans were looking for the Fleet or that they were training their pilots in long-distance flight over a route clear of our defences.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Naval Situation.

Magnetic mines.

(Previous References: W.M. (89) 91st Conclusions, Minutes 2 and 3.)

2.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the German mine-laying operations from aircraft had continued, and mines had been seen to drop in a number of places in the Thames Estuary, in one instance above Southend. One of the mines which had been located in shallow water, near Shoeburyness, was uncovered at low water, and Admiralty experts were now examining it. A small collier, a trawler and a Greek ship had been sunk by mines on the previous day and it had been considered necessary to close the Thames. Operations had been undertaken to clear a channel by exploding depth charges, and a destroyer had passed down the channel at high speed without causing any mines to detonate. The outward bound convey had been ordered to sail earlier in the morning.

In reply to a question, the Chief of Naval Staff said that we had developed magnetic mines at the end of the last war. Research during the last ten years, however, had mainly centred on the magnetic torpedo, which was designed to explode when passing under a ship.

Continuing, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that the German ship Adolf Woerman (8,800 tons) which had sailed from Lobito Bay, had been shadowed by a British merchant ship. As a result of this gallant operation, the German ship had been intercepted by the cruiser Neptune. The Adolf Woerman had scuttled herself to avoid capture and 162 persons, including a number of women and children, had been picked up.

Two attacks had been made on German submarines, one possibly successful and one with hopeful results. A further attack on submarines by a number of destroyers was still in progress.

There had been a report, which was not now credited, that a German submarine had penetrated the net defences of the Clyde. During the subsequent search, the destroyer Foxhound had run ashore.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that neutrals had so far borne the brunt of the German mining operations. Taken in conjuction with our embargo on German exports, conditions might well be favourable for persuading neutrals to charter their ships to us, as they would then continue to make profits without risk to themselves. If the neutral crews refused to run the ships we could no doubt find the men to man them.

[20377]

 

 
The Lord Privy Seat suggested that as much political capital as possible should be made in Tokyo as a result of the heavy neutral losses.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed.

Referring to his suggestion (at the meeting referred to in the margin) that a short statement should be made in the House of Commons, the First Lord said that he had now reached the conclusion, the First Lord said that he had now reached the conclusion that it would be better to wait until the end of the month, when the situation with regard to the magnetic mine menace might have taken a more favourable course.

The Prime Minister agreed.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Reprisals for inhumane methods of submarine warfare.

Action to deter German crews from scuttling their ships.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 89th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to the fact, that, as reported in Minute 2, the Adolf Woerman had scuttled herself to avoid capture, notwithstanding that there were women and children on board, thus showing the German reliance on our humane methods of warfare. There was an unconfirmed report that another German ship had scuttled herself in the North Atlantic.

To deter German crews from scuttling ships, the Admiralty proposed to order the following procedure:-

(1) On interception, the ship would be ordered to lower all boats and cast them adrift. This order would be enforced by firing on the ship, if necessary, with a small gun. Such action was considered to be entirely justified by the methods which had been adopted by the Germans. Some modification might, of course, be necessary in rough weather.

(2) A warning signal would then be sent to the effect that, if the ship were scuttled, the passengers and crew would be left to their fate.

(3) If, however, the above orders were disregarded, the survivors would, in fact, be picked up; as it was contrary to the traditions of the Royal Navy to leave men in a sinking ship or in open boats far from land.

The Cabinet agreed to the adoption of this procedure.



The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 91st Conclusions, Minute 4.)

The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that one more division had been identified in Central Germany; otherwise there was no change in the military situation.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Australian and New Zealand Naval Defence.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 90th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on Australian and New Zealand Naval Defence (Paper W.P. (39) 135)

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Paper was a revise of a previous Memorandum (Paper W.P. (39) 125), which had been discussed at a Meeting between Ministers of the United Kingdom and of the Dominions on Monday the 20th November Mr. Casey had said that while he had ? by the original Memorandum, he felt ? of the Paper. This ? the First Lord ?

 

Eire.

Termination of Membership of the British Commonwealth.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 58th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

7. The War Cabinet had before them the following documents:-

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, covering Report of an inter-Departmental Meeting (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 102):

Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers of the Crown (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 79.

It was pointed out that these Papers, which raised very important issues, had been before Ministers for ony a short time. While we were suffering inconvenience owing to the absence of a base in Southern Ireland for our anti-submarine forces, we had obtained control over the U-boat menace in the Western Approaches, and it could not be said that, in present circumstances, the use of Berehaven constituted a vital interest. It might also be an advantage to defer a decision until the report of the Minister without Portfolio on Intelligence Organisation in Eire (see the preceding Minute) had been circulated.

The War Cabinet accordingly deferred consideration of the above Memoranda.



Turkey. Visit to London of the Secretary General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Secretary General of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs was about to pay a visit to London arriving on the 27th November. It was hoped to have some useful consultations with him.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.



Assembly of the ?

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed his colleagues, that as a result of correspondence between Geneva and the various States, Members of the League, no meeting of the ? Assembly would be held for the time being. The L? budget and other routine matters would be settled by correspondence.


The smaller Powers had shown some fear as to the possible consequences of holding a meeting of the Assembly. In particular, the Swiss had no desire for discussion on Swiss soil as to the course and conduct of the war.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Soviet Union.

Proposed trade negotiations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 91st Conclusions, Minute 10.)

10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had seen Mr. Attlee and Mr. Greenwood, who had been much concerned that the Soviet Government had returned no reply to our proposal for the opening of trade discussions. They had suggested that we should send a reminder through the Soviet Ambassador in London.

The Foreign Secretary said that he had consulted the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister for Economic Warfare, who had seen no objection to this course. He proposed, therefore, either that day or the following day, to send for M. Maisky and to enquire of him as to the causes of the delay. The prospect, however, of obtaining any satisfactory response from the Soviet authorities was not very bright.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Arab attitude towards the war.

German propaganda.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 9th Conclusions, Minute 13.)

11. In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was not greatly alarmed by the recent German broadcasts in Arabic. There was no evidence that they had produced any appreciable results in the Arab countries. So far as could be judged, Ibn Saud was staunch in his friendship to us. 

It was reported that some of these propaganda broadcasts had taken the form of promising Turkey the return of all the provinces she had lost in the last war.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Soviet Union, Finland and Roumania.

The Bessarabian question. 

(Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 85 th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had received no news of developments between Russia and Finland. He referred to telegram No. 467 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow reporting a conversation with the Turkish Ambassador in Moscow. The latter had taken the view that the possibility of Soviet action regarding Bessarabia, which he had considered acute a little while ago, was now unlikely so long as the Finnish question remained in suspense. Sir William Seeds agreed that the Soviet Government were showing signs of going slow for the present.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Belgium.

Pursuit of German aircraft over Belgian territory.

(Previous Reference: W.M. )89) 91st Conclusions, Minute 8.)

13. In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff confirmed that the Air Ministry had taken up with the Foreign Office the question whether Royal Air Force units in France should be given orders similar to those received by the French Air Force, namely, to continue their pursuit of German aircraft over Belgian territory.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that prima facie it would be difficult for us to take a different line from the French.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
