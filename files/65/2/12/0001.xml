Poison Gas. Possible use by the Germans of an unexpected form. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 7.)

5. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that deliveries of extension pieces for Service respirators, designed to give protection against arsene gases, had begun, and that 7,320 had been sent to the British Expeditionary Force up to date. A probable delivery rate of 2,000 a day was now forcasted. No demands for these additionnal protective devices had been made by the Admiralty and the Home Office, but the Air Ministry had asked for 40,000. The Chemical Board did not recommend the issue of these devices to any personnel except those serving in France.

The Minister for home Security said that the Home Office had no intention of modifying the civilian respirator so as to make it proof against arsene gases, but were considering the provision of additional protection against arsenical smokes.

The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that he had been given, while in France, one possible explanation of the high degree of protection provided by the German has masks, namely, that they would give immunity against explosive fumes from guns to the garrisons of small, heavily-protected fortifications.

The Secretary of State for War undertook to enquire into this suggestion. He reported that experiments were now being carried on to assess the potentialities of iron pentacarbonyl, as a war gas. This had been suggested as a possible weapon of the Germans.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Canada. Destination of the First Canadian division. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 76th Conclusions. Minute 11.)

6. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had taken the opportunity of a meeting at the Admiralty on the 9th November, which had been held to discuss another question, to broach with Mr. Crerar and his advisers the subject of the destination of the First Canadian Division. They had not been at all in favour of the Division being sent to France instead of completing its training in England. In these circumstances, he thought it would be undesirable to take the matter up with the Canadian Government. 

The War Cabinet were informed that no communication had yet been sent by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to Ottawa on this matter.

The War Cabinet agreed--

That no further action should be taken on this matter, and that the First Canadian Division should be brought to England to complete its training.                                           Italy. Probable development of policy. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 71st Conclusions, Minute 5 ,and 55th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 1110, dated the 8th November, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Chargé d&apos;Affaires, Rome, reporting that the previous evening Signor Gianferrari had called to say that he had been informed by Signor Riccardi, the new Minister of Exchange and Security, that, on Signor Mussolini&apos;s instruction, he was beign appointed official representative in London of the Italian Federation of Industralists. He would proceed as soon as possible to London, where he would establish a permanent office. He would co-ordinate all British industrial purchases in Italy including armaments and would act as a channel through which all Italian negociations would take place with individual firms and suppliers. His status would be that of an unofficial Italian attaché for commercial and industrial transactions directly under the Italian Ambassador. Signor Gianferrari stated that his appointment was to be regarded as meaning that Signor Mussolini was in favour of armament sales


? to Great Britain and was definitely encouraging them. Signor Gianferrari onsidered that this decision meant "quite definitely a new orientation." In marking this report Sir Noel Charles added that he considered the move as one of first-rate importance.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had received a long report compiled from a considerable number of secret sources which all agreed in considering that it would be unwise to expect a break in the German morale until Germany had suffered military reverses.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement. 



The Netherlands and Belgium. Peace appeal by Queen Wilhelmina and king Leopold (Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 76th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

The Netherlands and Belgium. Peace appel by Quenn wilhelmina and King Leopold. (Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 76th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

9. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretapry of State for Foreign Affairs covering the draft of the reply proposed to be sent to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and King Leopold of the Belgians in answer to their peace appeal.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Prim Minister was in agreement with the draft, subjet to the insertion of a few verbal amendments.

The War Cabinet proceeded to examine the draft reply paragraph by paragraph, and agreed upon a number of minor verbal changes. Most of these changes were designed to meet suggestions put forward in consultation with the Dominions High Commissioners in order to make the reply applicable, not only to the United Kingdom, but to the Dominions also. The text as amemded is attached to the present Conclusions as an Annex. 

The War Cabinet agreed: --

(a) that a submission should be made to His Majesty the King, recommending His Majesty to reply to the peace appealreceived from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and King Leopold of the Belgians, in the terms set out in the Annex, to the present Conclusion; 

(b) that the text of the reply proposed to be sent by His Majesty should be communicated to the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, who should be asked that any comments which the Dominion Governments might wish to make should be received not later than the evening of Saturday, the 11th November, 1939;

(c) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should communicate the text of the proposed reply confidentially:--

(i) to the French and Polish Governments;

(ii) to the United States Government for information.





The Shipping Position. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 76th Conclusions, Minute 6)

10. The War Cabinet had before them the following Memoranda by the Minister of Shipping: --

Memoranda relating to the Chartering of Neutral Tonnage (W.P (G.) (39) 60 and 80);

Memorandum in regard to the limitation of the importingcapacity of the United Kingdom (W.P. (G.) (39) (67).

The ? of Shipping stated that a number of factors had contributed to the ?. Among these were the delays attendant upon the institution of the convoy system, the ?

Sir ? Cyril ? said that we hoped to be able to ? milliosn tons eventually in connection with the suggestion that pressure should be brought to bear by refusing bunkers or other facilities, on Greek shipowners who were unwilling to let us use their ships, he said that it would be very useful also if pressure could be brought to bear to secure that Italian ships coming to this country for coal should bring cargoes that we needed instead of arriving in ballast.

The Minister of Shipping was invited to bring to the notice of the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the Foreign Office any instances in which it would de useful if pressure of this kind could be exerted.

The President of the Board of Trade sait that so far the shipping position was not causing any serious difficulties for the export trade with which his Department was primarily concerned. In answer to a question, he said that he had no information as to reserves of coal stored in London were higher than ever - that was why rationing was being relaxed - while stocks in the hands of utility undertaking were low. The position would be restored rapidly if the convoy system were speeded up.

The Minister of Shipping added that the institution of daily convoys would also lead to a great improvement in the French coal position

The food situation and the need for increased shipping facilities. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 63rd Conclusions, Minutes 10 and 11.)

The Minister of Food said that, in the matter of cereals, since the war began we had been consuming twice as much as had been coming into the country. When he had last brought the matter before the War Cabinet, he had had to ask the Minister of shipping to try to make good a deficiency of 850,000 tons of shipping ehich was expected to accrue by the 31st December next. Considerable amounts of additional shipping had been made available since then; but against this must be put additional delays, and the estimated deficiency at the end of December was still only 40,000 tons short of the figure previously given. At the beginning of the war there was 12 weeks supply of wheat in port granaries. The corresponding figure for the 31st December would be 3 1/2 weeks. On the farms there had been 15 weeks&apos; supply at the beginning of the war, the figure for the 28th October was 9 1/2 weeks and this would probably have been reduced to 5 or 6 weeks&apos; supply by the end of the year; i.e, by that date we should have only some 9 to 10 weeks&apos; supply of wheat in the country including considerable quantities on the farms which could only be made available by degrees, as it eas threshed. 

Sir Cyril Hurcomb said that the additional shipping sent to the St. Lawrence to load wheat had not been secured till the end of October, and that it would not ne back in this country by the end of December. At that date our stocks would de at their lowest level and the position would then improve. He estimated that shipping likely to be available in the fiture would be adequate for current requirements, but not to make up all the defiency.

The Minister of Food agreed that, if we were to look ahead as far as the 31st March, a more hopeful picture would be presented.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defense drew attention to the serious position in regard to timber imports and said that he had been advised that unless arrangements could be made for increasing the supply of soft timber the Government building programme and all other building as well, would have to close down as the end of the year ? sewrious effects on the building of munition, factories and of ? . The Minister of Shipping had been able to allocate shipping for only a small portion of the tomber awaiting ?.
Priority organisation.

The Minister of shipping emphasised the difficulty with which he was faced in having to deal with sudden demands for shipping from various departements. This led to a discussion of the need for a statement showing the amount of shipping available for essential imports as a whole, not only in the field of food, but also in that of commodities covered by the Ministry of Supply, and for machinery for allocating the available shipping by a syetem of priorities. The Minister of Shipping said that his Department was already engaged on drawing up a statement to cover the whole field and he hoped that this would be available at the end of the following week. The view was expressed that the question of priorities fell within the scope of the Ministerial Priority Committee under the Chairmanship of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, but that the Departements concerned should at once whether their arrangements for mutual consultation and the Co-ordination of demands could be improved.

The Minister of Food said that, while he appreciated the need for machinery of this kind, he felt bound to urge that, in view of the serious food situation, immediate action should be taken to secure further neutral shipping for food imports, even if it were necessary to pay higher rates than we had so far been prepared to enter.

The Minister of Shipping suggested that this was a matter which he might well discuss in the first instance with the Minister of food.

The War Calbinet agreed --

(1) To invite the Minister for Economic Warfare to arrange for the main Swedish War Trade Agreement (which included the Shipping Agreement) to be signed forth-with the oustanding points being dealt with in a subsidiary agreement.

(2) To invite the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Shipping to consult together with a view to securing more effective liaison between their Departements.

(3) To invite the minister of Shipping to submit to the War Cabinet as early as possible an analysis showing the amount of shipping estimated to be available, and the requirements of Departements, over the periods ending the (i) 31st December, 1939, (ii) 31st March, 1940, and (iii) 30th June, 1940

(4) That, when the report referred to in (3) above was available, the War Cabinet should consider the method by which priority between Departements in demands for shipping should be determined.

(5) That the Minister of Shipping and the Minister of Food should consult together as to whether additional tonnage could be provided immediately to meet the more urgent requirements of the Ministry of Food.

Shipping Reports. (Previous reference: W.M. (39) 63rd Conclusions, Minute 6.)

11. The War Cabinet took note of the 7th, 8th and 9th Weekly Reports by the Minister of Shipping (Papers W.P. (R) (39) 58, 60 and 74).



Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 10, 1939


2. .1 recaE the.app8al.made by your Majesty7:His^Majesty the Kingtof theBeMans on the 13rd August in the name of the Heads of. States of &apos;the Osfo group,of Powers, in which joa/His; Majesty, pleaded for the submission of disputes and claims to open negotiation carried out in the spirit of brotherly co-operation. my government in the United Kingdom, as well as the French Government, sentfavourable replies to this appeal.3. I recall also the joint offer of good offices made by your Majesty and her Majesty the Queen ofto my Government in the United Kingdom and to the French; German, italian and Polish Governments on the 28th August. This offer was welcomed by my government and by the French, Italian and Polish Governments. A few days later the German Government launched ah unprovoked attack upon Poland.4. My Governments deeply appreciate the spirit of your Majesty&apos;s offer and they would always be willing to examine a reasonable and assured basis foran equitable peace. It is, as it has always been, my desire that the war should not last one day longer than is absolutely necessary, and I can, therefore, at once replyto that part of your Majesty&apos;s appeal in which you state.your willingness tofacilitate the ascertaining of the elements of an agreement to be reached.j.------p..   The essential conditions upon which we are determined that anhonourable peace must be secured have already been plainly; stated. the documents which have been published since the beginning of the war clearlyexplain its origin and establish the responsibility for its outbreak. My peoplestook up arms only after every effort had been made to save peace.6. ^ The immediate occasion of our entry into war was the violent german aggression against Poland. But this aggression was only a fresh instance of theGerman policy towards her neighbours, and the larger purposes for which my peoples are now fighting is to secure that Europe may be redeemed &quot; from theperpetually recurring fear of German aggression so as to enable the peoples ofEurope to preserve their independence and their liberties.&quot; These words of thePrime Minister have been atuDlified arid en^ occasions, inparticular by him on the 12th October in the House of Commons and by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Lords on the. 2nd November.7. The elements which in the opinion of my Governments must form part ofany settlement emerge clearly and distinctly from these declarations of policy.Should your Majesty be able. to communicate to me any proposals from germany of such a character as to afford real prospects of achieving the purpose I have described, above, I. can say at once that my Governments would give them their- ; mbWearnest^consideratiori.&apos;
