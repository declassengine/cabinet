German aircraft had operated offReference: Harwich on the previous evening.   Fighters had been sent up, butWM. (39) 110th visibility was very bad and they had failed to make contact.Snute^lT&apos; The War Cabinet took note of thi* statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:WM.

(39) 107thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinetdetails of certain Fleet movements.So far as was knoAvn, no information about the damage with.M.S. Nelson had reached Germany yet.A sweep by two forces of destroyers, working in co-operationwith aircraft, was taking place off the Dutch coast in the hope ofintercepting German submarines.Steamship Willowpool had been damaged by an explosion off the norfolk coast. The crew had been saved and the ship was stillafloat.H.M.S. Wolverine&apos;s attack on a German submarine (reported at the previous meeting) had given hopeful results. Two othersubmarines had been attacked without decisive results.The Admiralty had no information as to whether theDeutschland was back in Germany.The trawler Ray of [Tope had been sunk by an explosion whensweeping for magnetic mines thought to have been laid by a submarine. There were only three survivors. The Admiralty were anxious to salve one of the mines laid by a submarine, as they were thought to be of different construction from those laid by aircraft.A. mine had been successfully detonated by a magnetic sweeping-device near the place where the Nelson had been damaged. Onlyminor damage had been caused to the sweep.A magnetic mine had now been recovered which was twice as large as those previously examined. There were evidences whichpointed to mass production.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that the port of Harwichhad been opened to traffic (as reported at the previous meeting), asit was not now thought that any mines had actually been laid in thechannel.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence asked whetherdecoy lighted channels had been arranged to mislead German mine-laying aircraft.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he would investigate the matter.The Prime Minister asked whether in the case of the AdolfLeonhardt (reported at the previous meeting as having beenscuttled) the warning authorised by the War Cabinet had beengiven.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was calling fora report of the circumstances from the cruisers concerned, as soon asit was prudent to break wireless silence.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.[20477]
Iron Ire.\SuggestedBritish Actionin Norwegianterritorialwaters.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 99thConclusions,Minute 7.)The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 110thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had arranged with the United States Ambassador to ascertain privately president roosevelt&apos;s reactions to the suggestion that we should mineNorwegian territorial waters in order to interrupt the passage of iron-ore to Germany from Narvik. He had received a message which indicated that the Presidents reactions were more favourable than he had hoped.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.4. The Secretary of State for War said that, as reported onthe previous day, one more German Division had been located in theWest, and there was evidence of one more in the centre of Germany.The Prime Minister said that he had understood from previousdiscussions that, in the opinion of the General Staff, it was notpossible to keep troops deployed ready for attack for any con-siderable length of time, as the Germans appeared to be doingopposite Holland and Belgium.The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that itwas not possible to keep them actually formed up for an attack, butthey could, of course, keep large numbers of Divisions deployed onthe V/estern Front in the same way as the French and british armies were at the present time, and had been throughout the last war. The Germans were undoubtedly relieving Divisions in thefront line in rotation.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.5. The Secretary of State for War said that the latest reports from Finland showed that Russian attacks in the Karelian Isthmushad been repulsed in front of tJhe Mannerheim Line. The russians had not made much progress North of Lake Ladoga. All the otheroperations further North must be regarded as secondary operations.The Russians were believed to have the following forcesdeployed : Karelian Isthmus : 9 Divisions.North of Lake Ladoga : 5 Divisions.Opposite Northern end of Gulf of Bothnia : 3 Divisions.Extreme North : 3 Divisions.Against this the Finns had a Regular Army of 5 Divisions.The Finns appeared, however, to be holding their own, andthis might prove a bad advertisement for Russia&apos;s military strength.Supply of The Lord Privy Seal enquired whether any further steps couldMunitions.        be taken to help the Finns.The War Cabinet were informed that arrangements were beingmade as quickly as possible to ship the Gladiators which had been ordered. Sixty thousand gas masks were being supplied, and theFinnish requirements of small arms ammunition and tracerammunition were being met. The Bofors gun, which we had induced the Swedes to promise to the Turks, had now found their way tothe Finns.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had as yet no confirmation of the passage of Italian aircraft acrossGermany, on their way to Finland, but he had instituted enquiriesFinland.Invasion by .S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 110thConclusions,Minute 5.)
through our Minister in Finland. He had seen a list of furtheritems of war equipment which the Finns needed, which he under-stood was being forwarded to the War Office.The Secretary of State for War undertook to have the listexamined as a matter of urgency.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.scandinavian countries.possible developments.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 91stConclusions,Minute 7.)6. In discussion arising out of the preceding item, the FirstLord of the Admiralty thought that it would be to our advantage if the trend of events in Scandinavia brought it about that norway and Sweden were forced into war with Russia. We would then beable to gain a foothold in Scandinavia with the object of helpingthem, but without having to go to the extent of ourselves declaring war on Russia. Such a situation would open up prospects in theNaval war which might be most fruitful.In discussion it was suggested that, if Norway and Swedenbecame involved in war against Russia, Germany would step into ensure the preservation of her own interests in Scandinavia; andthere might be a partition between Germany and Russia of thekind which had already taken place in Poland.On the other hand, it was argued that, fundamentally, theinterests of Germany and Russia were opposed, and they wouldbe unlikely to agree amicably on a partition of Scandinavia seeing that the iron ore field in the north, on which Germany depended,would inevitably fall into the Russian sphere.The Lord Privy Seal thought that events might move withgreat rapidity, and it would therefore be advisable for the WarCabinet to consider the various possibilities inherent in the presentsituation. It might be necessary to adopt a more forward policy,with the object of influencing events in Scandinavia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadbeen examining broadly the implications of a conflict between ourselves and Russia. The strategic and political considerationswTere closely connected, and he was not sure how the matter shouldbe handled. The position was undoubtedly obscure, but it was clearthat it would be to our advantage to help Finland as much aspossible.The Prime Minister said that he thought it would be better for the War Cabinet to discuss further the political aspect of thesituation, before the military implications were, investigated.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toprepare, for consideration by the War Cabinet, a paper on the present situation in Scandinavia, and the variousdevelopments which might take place as a result of Russiansinvasion of Finland, and a possible extension of the conflict to Scandinavia.The DominionAir training scheme.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 107thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Secretary of State for Air said that a number of telegrams had been received from Canada to the effect that thePrime Minister of Canada was pressing strongly that pupils of canadian origin, after passing out of the Training Scheme inCanada, should be formed into units of the Royal Canadian AirForce in the Field. At the same time, he was anxious that the cost(including the cost of such units) should be met by the BritishGovernment.    Mr.  Mackenzie King was anxious to make an
Formation and financing of squadrons ofthe royal canadian AirForce.announcement to this effect later in the day, but he (the Secretaryof State) thought that this proposal, which might have serious reper-cussions, required further consideration.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, while he appreciated the difficulties inherent in Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;proposal, it was well to bear in mind Canada&apos;s point of view.Canada&apos;s expenditure in the first twelve months of the war was estimated to be as follows : (a) Military expenditure in Canada, andon the two Canadian DivisionsCanadian expenditure on Air TrainingSchemeDollar advances to the UnitedKingdom for financing warpurchases in Canada(o)Total320,000,00046,000,000191,000,000557,000,000say,  125,000,000.Canada was paying for her military units, while, in the case ofAustralia and New Zealand, the money was being borrowed fromthe British Government. Canada&apos;s share of the Air Training-Scheme over 3^ years was $313,000,000.At a later stage in the Meeting the Secretary of State for Airsaid that a report which he had received suggested that it might bepossible to clear up the outstanding difficulties in regard to theDominion Air Training Scheme. He suggested that the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and himself should be authorised to examine the matter further.The War Cabinet (i) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Air and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to examine the latest developments in regard tothe Dominion Air Training Scheme,(ii) Authorised these Ministers to settle the matter withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet, if no point ofprinciple was involved; failing which, the matter shouldbe reported to the War Cabinet.broadcasting stations inFrance.Proposal to close Fecamp.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 101stConclusions,Minute 8.)8. The Secretary of State for Air referred to telegram No. 420from our Ambassador in Paris. It appeared that interested parties were endeavouring to keep the Fecamp Broadcasting Station going.The Ambassador thought that M. Daladier would like to shelterbehind the decision of General Gamelin in this matter. Hesuggested that Lord Gort should be asked to notify General Gamelinof the War Cabinefs decision and to press for the immediate closing down of the station.The Secretary of State for War thought it was important thatwe should not be put in the position of pressing for the closing down of this particular station. He agreed that General Gamelin shouldbe approached in this matter through Major-General Howard-Vyse.The Prime Minister said that he was prepared to take thismatter up with M. Daladier, if the proposed method of appi&apos;oachdid not have the desired result.
United States ofAmerica.Attitudef towards Sovietaggressionagainst Finland.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 881 (R.) dated the 8th December, 1939, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, reporting a statement by thePresident that the United States Government did not favour theproposal advocated in certain quarters that relations between theUnited States and the U.S.S.R. should be broken off, or that theUnited States Ambassador should be withdrawn from Moscow.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Soviet- 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionRoumanian to telegram No. 509 dated- the 9th December, 1939, from HisRelations. Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, reporting that the Soviet Press(Previous had that day published a communique by the Press Department ofReference: the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to the effect that.M. (39) 109th the article in the Pravda threatening Roumania, which had givenConclusions, rise to rumours in the foreign Press, did not correspond with the minute 5.) policy of the Soviet Government and in no way reflected thecharacter of Soviet-Roumanian relations.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Turkey.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 109thConclusions,Minute 6.)11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams, both dated the 9th December, 1939,from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara : No. 817, reporting a conversation which he (the ambassador) had had that morning with M. Sarajoglu, theTurkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which the latter had expressed great regret at the lack of success by M. NumanMenemencioglu during his conversations in London. he admitted that we had done a great deal already to meet Turkishrequirements, but the danger and difficulties remained, since we had been unable to meet the Turkish requirements in regardto anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen considered that M. Sarajoglu was distinctly perturbedby the turn which events seemed to be taking, and it seemedto him that unless we were able to give M. Sarajoglu somesatisfaction the situation would further deteriorate.No. 821, reporting a conversation that day between general Orbay and the British Military Attache at which general Orbay had again stressed the need for either ourselvesor the French supplying Turkey with anti-tank guns.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention alsoto a Memorandum on financial arrangements with Turkey which hadbeen circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer the previous day(W.P. (G.) (39) 144). In view of the imminent departure from london of M. Menemencioglu it was very important that immediatedecisions should be taken on the points raised by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. He therefore suggested that the outstanding questions with Turkey should be considered at a Meeting ofMinisters that afternoon.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that he hadpostponed until the following day his appointment withM. Menemencioglu. The Chiefs of Staff were at the momentdiscussing in France with General Gamelin the question of suppliesof armaments (including anti-tank guns) to Turkey. He had therefore felt it better to await the return to London of tJhe Chiefsof Staff before seeing M. Menemencioglu.In the course of discussion it was pointed out that the Turkishrepresentatives were apt to take the view that there was likely to
be stalemate on the West, and that it was therefore more important to send anti-tank guns to Turkey than to keep them on the western front. It was explained that Germany could not mass a force fora drive into the Balkans without indications of it becoming knownto us. We should hope, in tJhat event, to be able, if necessary, totransfer a limited number of specialist units from the western front to Turkey before Turkey was seriously threatened.The Prime Minister suggested that the best plan would be forthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to confer together that afternoon on the points raised in the Chancellors paper, and to bring into consultation any other ministers concerned, it being understood that, if they reached agreement, that agreement would be reported to the War Cabinetthe following day, while, if agreement proved impracticable, thepoints at issue would be submitted to the War Cabinet for immediate decision.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the proposed meeting should be held at 6 p.m. that evening.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, that he wasin general agreement with the plan outlined by the Chancellor of theExchequer in his Memorandum, provided that the concessions to turkey proposed in it were sufficient to enable us to preventTurkish chrome from being exported to Germany, and also to holdTurkey firmly on our side. If that plan were to prove insufficient for this purpose, he did not think that too much weight should begiven to the objections given by the Ministry of Food in regard tothe purchase of raisins, figs, &amp;c. Rather than lose Turkish goodwill,it would be better to buy Turkish agricultural products which wecould not use.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped that,whatever arrangement was made, we should not bind ourselves to buy fixed quantities of Turkish agricultural products without reference to price, which might be later inordinately raisedagainst us.The War Cabinet agreed That outstanding questions in connection with Turkishrequests for assistance, raised in the memorandum circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (G.) (39) 144), should be discussed at a meeting to beheld at the Treasury at 6 p.m. that evening between theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forForeign. Affairs, and any other Ministers whom those two ministers might wish to invite to be present, it being understood that the conclusions reached by that meeting would be reported to the War Cabinet the following morning.Seizure of enemy Exports.The ease of theJapanese shipSanyo Ma.ru.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 110thConclusions,Minute 6.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office (W.P. (G.) (39) 145) relating to thetreatment to be accorded to the Japanese ship Sanyo Maru, whichwas now at Rotterdam and was alleged to have on board &quot; secretnaval goods.&quot;Some discussion took place as to the nature of the &apos;&apos; secret navalgoods &quot; referred to, and it was suggested that they might well be either component parts of magnetic mines themselves or designs forsuch mines which the Germans were sending out to Japan to be manufactured there in great quantities. In this connection, theFirst Lord of the Admiralty said that there was some evidence thatthe Germans had sent crews to Vladivostok to take over a number
of Russian submarines. If the &quot;secret naval goods&quot; turned out to be mines, it might be intended that these submarines should laythem in Far Eastern waters.The Prime Minister said that it was important to endeavourto obtain further information about this cargo, but it was unlikelythat the manifest would be of any assistance. He regarded it ashighly suspicious that the Japanese Embassy had asked for thisship &quot;to be exempt from control. He suggested that the ForeignOffice should give special attention to methods which might provide information as to the nature of the cargo.In reply to questions, the Minister for Economic Warfare saidthat the assurances referred to in paragraph 3 had been given to theJapanese Embassy before&apos;e the secret information about the cargo hadbeen received. A really thorough search was a, big undertaking andwould take at least a week.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the WarCabinet that we should not be in a position to put the procedure forthe examination of enemy exports into full operation for some weeks.Further, our aim hitherto had been to treat the Japanese delicatelyin such matters without, of course, undermining our plan for theblockade. We were particularly anxious not to offend the Japaneseat this moment.The Minister for Economic Warfare then read out to the WarCabinet a message which he had just received from his ministry to the effect that the Japanese would not allow the Sanyo Maru to-sail until they were assured that she would be exempt from control.The message added that the Japanese were anxious to avoid any-incident in connection with the ship.It was generally agreed that the contents of this messageincreased the grounds for suspecting that the cargo containedsomething which the Japanese particularly wished to be passed through our controls without examination, and that it was all themore necessary to endeavour to ascertain the nature of the cargo.The War Cabinet agreed (a) that, notwithstanding the desirability of avoiding givingoffence to Japan at the present time, we could not contemplate allowing a ship which might contain&quot;secret naval goods&quot; to pass through the contraband control. No assurances should, therefore, be given thatthe Sanyo Maru would be exempt from examination;(b) that every advantage should be taken of the delay in thesailing of the ship from Rotterdam, and that, if possible,,we should endeavour to secure still further delay;(c) that, in pursuance of this policy, the Minister for economic warfare should ask the Japanese Embassy to give full particulars of the cargo of the Sanyo Maru;(d) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should endeavour by all the means at his disposal to obtain further information regarding the cargo of the SanyoMaru. For this purpose, enquiries should be institutedat Rotterdam.[20477]c
Gzecho-SlovakNationalCommittee:ProposedRecognition.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 26thConclusions,Minute 8.)A&quot;13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G.) (39) 137).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his proposal was to recognise the Czecho-Slovak National Committee asthe body with which ITis Majesty&apos;s Government would deal inconnection with the reconstitution of the Czecho-Slovak Army inFrance. It was not, however, proposed, at any rate for the present,to recognise the Committee as a Government.This arrangement would be in line with the arrangement whichthe French had made with the Czecho-Slovak National Committee.The only important point of difference was that, whereasM. Daladier, in his letter to M. Osusky, had used the words &quot; pourrepresenter le peuple tchecoslovaque,&quot; he intended, in his letter toM. Benes, to use the words &quot; to represent the Czecho-Slovakpeoples.&quot; He preferred this phrase, since, when the time came, the czechs and Slovaks would not necessarily wish to be reunited in asingle State on the former basis.Dr. Benes would not be pleased with the difference of wording.If it proved impossible to persuade him to accept it, the WarCabinet would perhaps leave it to his (the Foreign Secretary&apos;s)discretion to obtain the best settlement of this point in his power.The War Cabinet-Approved   the   proposals   contained   in   the   foreign secretary&apos;s Memorandum, subject to the understandingat -&apos;A.&quot;Czecho-Slovakia.(FinancialClaims andRefugees) Bill.14. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G.) (39) 140).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the questions raised in his Memorandum could not be settled without legislation. his proposal was that the Bill now in draft should be submitted tothe Home Policy Committee during the Recess, with a view to its introduction as soon as possible after the reassembly of Parliament.The principal matters to be dealt with in the Bill were : (a) The disposal of the unexpended balance (amounting to approximately  3J millions) of our free gift of 4 millions to Czecho-Slovakia. There was no doubt butthat this balance must be used for the purpose originally intended, namely, the assistance of Czech refugees whohad emigrated.(b) The disposal of the unexpended balance (approximately 3^ millions) of our advance to the Czecho-SlovakGovernment for assisting refugees remaining in Czecho-Slovakia, and for economic reconstruction. In this case,it was intended to apply the balance to meeting (i) the claims of United Kingdom residents in respectof the current service of loans issued or guaran-teed by the Czecho-Slovak Government, and otherexternal loans; and(ii) cash claims by United Kingdom residents, includingclaims in respect of bank balances.There was no question for the present of taking power to dealwith the gold, to the value of about  6^ millions, which was heldin this country on account of the Czecho-Slovak National Bank.If, later on, we recognised the existence of a properly constituted
France.Anglo-Frenchfinancialarrangements.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 105thConclusions,Minute 10.)15. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the Prime minister had written to M. Daladier, informing him of the War Cabinefsviews on the question of the proportions in which this countryand France were to share items of &quot;extraordinary expenditure inthe common cause.&quot;M. Paul Reynaud had now replied as follows :  On economic grounds he was still persuaded that the proportion2 : 1 was the right one. M. Daladier, however, had been impressed with the importance of the political considerations to which thePrime Minister had drawn his attention. In these circumstances,the French Government were prepared to accept the British proposal, namely, that the proportion should be 3 : 2.The Chancellor added that M. Reynaud and he were agreedthat it was necessary to issue a statement on the following day,announcing the signature of the comprehensive Anglo-FrenchFinancial Agreement.The War Cabinet: Took note of the above statement, and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to make the necessary arrangements for a public announcement of the Anglo-French Financial Agreement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 11, 1939.Czecho-Slovak Government, we might have to consider whether thegold should be handed over to that Government.The War Cabinet gave a general approval to the proposals contained in the Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
