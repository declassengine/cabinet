Naval, Militaryand AirOperations.(PreviousEeference:W.M.(44)26thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatMr. Granville, M.P., had put down a Question, for answer on thefollowing day, about the conversations with representatives of theTurkish Government. It was clearly not in the public interest togive any information on this matter. If, therefore, Mr. Granvillewas unwilling to withdraw the Question, he proposed to confinehis reply to saying that he had no statement to make at the presenttime.The War Cabinet-Approved this course.National Day of 3. The Prime Minister said that the Archbishop of Canter-Prayer, bury had suggested to His Majesty The King that there should bea. National Day of Prayer for the success of our arms in theoperations which were to be undertaken this year in WesternEurope. His own view was that, in view of the difficulty of selectinga suitable date and the danger of discouraging the troops, theproposal was inexpedient, and he proposed to advise His Majestyin this sense. If necessary, a National Day of Prayer might be heldsome time after the operations had begun.The War Cabinet-Approved the course of action proposed by the PrimeMinister.Turkey. .(PreviousEeference:W.M. (43) 169thConclusions,Minute 2.)[27080-2]1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command had attacked Stuttgart. United Statesaircraft had attacked Brunswick, French airfields and &quot; Crossbow &quot;targets. In the attack on Berlin the Americans that day had sent800 aircraft and had lost 45. The escorting fighters were reportedto have destroyed 70 enemy aircraft for the loss of 14.During the month of February 32,600 tons of bombs had beendropped, of which 23,000 had been on Germany.Enemy losses for the week amounted to 88 aircraft destroyedand 14 probably destroyed. Our losses included 5 R.A.F. bombersand 45 United States bombers. The A.E.A.F. had lost 9 bombersand 52 fighters.In the Mediterranean the enemy had lost 23 aircraft destroyedas against 41 Allied. A number of enemy ships had been sunk ordamaged.Pacific Rabaul had been attacked without any response from theJapanese.Naval The confirmed shipping losses by enemy action for the weekOperations.       amounted to 5,202 tons, but it was anticipated that belated reportsmight add another 14,000.    February losses, including belatedreports, amounted to 79,766 tons.   This was the lowest figure forany month of the war.Mediterranean. Shellfire and bad weather had interfered with unloadingoperations in the Anzio bridgehead.Military In the north the Russians were advancing following theOperations. German retirement. Further south in the Shepetovka area theEussia Russians had advanced to a depth of 30 miles on a 112-mile front.The Germans were fighting hard in this area owing to the serious-ness of the threat to the Warsaw-Odessa railway.   In the KrioviRog area the Russians had made some progress.Burma. The situation on the Burma front continued to improve, withthe Japanese still suffering considerable casualties.Italy. There had been almost no change in the lines occupied by ourforces.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
Negotiationswith Japan forthe Exchange ofCivilians.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 137) regardingnegotiations with Japan for an exchange of civilians.The Memorandum explained that it had been hoped that thenegotiations, which had been going on for some time, would resultin the release of 1,600 of the 17,000 British and Allied civiliansremaining in the Far East, including 600 of the 2,500 in Hong-Kong, where food conditions were extremely bad and were rapidlydeteriorating. Apart from their primary object, the negotiationswere important in that the exchange ships were the only means bywhich the Americans and we could send much-needed supplies ofmedicines, food and clothing to British and Allied prisoners of warand civilians.A deadlock had been reached in the negotiations because theAustralian Government were unwilling to release 330 pilots andpearl-divers who had been included among the 1,600 civilianinternees selected by the Japanese Government for repatriation.The Australian Government claimed that these seamen, who hadbeen resident in Australia up to the outbreak of war, could not bereleased on account of the specialised knowledge which theypossessed of operational waters and because of their value insalvaging operations. The attitude of the Australian Governmentwras strongly endorsed by General MacArthur.In these circumstances, the Memorandum proposed that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should seek the concurrenceof His Majesty&apos;s Governments and the Allied Governments con-cerned in proposing to the Japanese Government an exchange on ahead-for-head basis of 1,270 persons in place of 1,600, the JapaneseGovernment relinquishing their claim to the 330 Japanese seamenin return for the right to select 330 British or Allied civilians inJapanese hands to be excluded from the exchange.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked whether itmight not be possible to get the Australian Government to agree tothe release of the 330 Japanese seamen now that operations in thePacific had moved further from Australia.Mr. Bruce doubted whether it would be possible to move theAustralian Government. The case for releasing the seamen hadbeen put very strongly to the Australian Government and throughthem to General MacArthur; but both the G-overnment and GeneralMacArthur were very emphatically opposed to the release.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadnot much hope that the Japanese Government would accept anyarrangement which would not give them the 330 Japanese pilotsand pearl-divers for whom they had asked. He felt, however, thatit was worth making an attempt on the lines proposed. If theJapanese Government would not accept an arrangement of this kinda further approach might be made to the Australian Government.The War Cabinet Endorsed the proposal made in paragraph 9 of W.P. (44)137, on the understanding that, if the offer was notaccepted by the Japanese Government, a further approachshould be made to the Australian Government with a viewto persuading them to agree to the release of the 330Japanese seamen concerned.National HealthService.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)21stConclusions,Minute 2.)5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was.proposed that the Government should put down a positive motionin the following terms :-&quot; That this Flouse welcomes the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, declared in the White Paper presented to Parlia-ment, to establish a comprehensive National Health Service.&quot;The debate, which would extend over two days, would be openedby the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland
Food. 6.   The Minister of Food said that, owing to shortage ofReduction of supplies of cheese, the cheese ration for non-priority consumersCheese Ration, would have to be reduced from 3 ozs. to 2 ozs. per week for aperiod of 20 weeks from the beginning of April. During this periodconsumers would be receiving larger supplies of milk. In addition,it was proposed to issue extra quantities of canned meat and fishunder the points scheme, and to raise the purchasing power ofpoints from 20 to 24.   The protein intake would thus be kept up.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Service Pay and 7. The War Cabinet had a short discussion as to the replyAllowances. which the Prime Minister should give on the following day to a(Previous Question by Mr. Kendall, M.P., asking whether he was in a positionReference: to implement the promised investigation into Army Pay andW.M.(44)26th Allowances, what would be the constitution of the group to beConclusions, invited to discuss the problem, and whether any invitations had yetMinute 11.)      been extended.In discussion, it was agreed that it was important to avoid anysuggestion that the group invited to discuss the problem would bein any sense a representative body.   In 1942 the discussions hadtaken place with a number of M.P.&apos;s who were interested in the- matter, and this position should be maintained.It was also agreed that it was important that the reply givenshould emphasise the reservations made by the Leader of the Houseon the 2nd March and, in particular, that the discussions werewithout any commitment.The War Cabinet agreed that a reply should be given on thefollowing lines : 1&quot; No, Sir. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Housesuggested that the same kind of informal discussions whichtook place in 1942 might be repeated. Arrangements to giveeffect to this undertaking, subject to the reservations set forthby my right hon. Friend, will be made through the usualchannels.&quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Qth March, 1944.would wind up. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health,would speak during the debate. It was proposed to have a simul-taneous debate on the White Paper in the House of Lords.The question was raised whether by putting down a positivemotion the Government might be setting a precedent which wouldprove awkward in the case of more contentious White Papers. Thegeneral view was, however, that the course proposed, which was inline with what had been done on the White Paper on Education,need not bind the Government on a future occasion.The War Cabinet-Approved the arrangements proposed by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs for the discussion of the HealthService White Paper in Parliament.
