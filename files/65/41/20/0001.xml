Naval, Militaryand AirOperations.(PreviousKef erence:W.M. (44) 16thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.Pacific.NavalOperations.Indian Ocean.MilitaryOperations.Italy.Pacific.Eussia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Owing to bad weather Bomber Command had not undertakenany major raids. An attack had been made, however, on theAntheor Viaduct near Nice and a very successful attack on a factorynear Limoges.United States bombers had attacked Frankfurt, Ludwigshaven,Wiesbaden and Brunswick.&quot;Crossbow&quot; targets had also been attacked. CoastalCommand had made two promising attacks on U-boats and possiblydamaged six others.Enemy losses for the week, including claims by the UnitedStates Air Forces, amounted to 170 destroyed, 32 probably destroyedand 123 damaged. Allied losses amounted to 104, including43 fighters and 52 United States bombers.Bad weather had again interfered with flying operations, butattacks had been made on enemy communications, ports and air-fields.  Enemy losses amounted to 41 destroyed, against 43 Allied.Japanese aircraft claimed as destroyed during the weekamounted to 108, as against 11 Allied. The claims for Japaneseaircraft destroyed for the year ending the 11th February totalled3,784 in the air, 955 on the ground and 1,001 probably destroyed.Confirmed shipping losses by enemy action for the previousweek amounted to 17,487 tons. Confirmed losses for Februaryamounted to 31,839 tons.Five German U-boats had been destroyed and 3 probablydestroyed so far this month.The War Cabinet-Requested the First Sea Lord to convey their congratula-tions to the Officer Commanding the Second Escort Group,which had sunk 4 U-boats and probably sunk anotherduring one patrol.A large German tanker had been intercepted and sunk by oneof our destroyers. The Khedive Ismail, with troops on board fromEast Africa in convoy to Ceylon, had been torpedoed&apos;and sunk with,it was feared, heavy loss of life.During the previous week the fighting in the Anzio bridgeheadhad been of a serious nature, with the result that our line had beendriven back a small distance on the left flank. There was no reason,however, for serious anxiety about our being able to hold ourpositions. On the main Italian front some small progress had beenmade in the Cassino area after heavy fighting.Australian Forces advancing along the coast of New Guineahad joined up with United States Forces at Saidor.In the North the Russians had been pressing along the EastBank of Lake Peipus and had taken Luga. This advance seriouslythreatened the German salient South of Lake Ilmen. The Germanscontinued to report heavy Russian attacks at Vitebsk. The Germanswere still endeavouring, unsuccessfully, to relieve the 10 encircleddivisions North of Shpola.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Bombing of 2.   The Prime Minister said that one or two cases had beenGermany. reported in which aspersions had been thrown on the R.A.F. bycertain members of the United States Air Forces because we didnot bomb Germany by day. If this were to continue, it might leadto difficulties. He thought that the best way of dealing with thematter would be for the United States Authorities themselves toexplain to their personnel the facts of the position, and the extentof our own air effort and air losses as compared with those of the[26948-^2] B 2
United States. He suggested that it would be as well if the Chief ofthe Air Staff could see General Spaatz and put this suggestionto him.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to carry out the PrimeMinisters suggestion.Danger Zones.(PreviousReference:W.M. (41) 69thConclusions,Minute 4;see alsoW.P. (43) 207.)3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Spanishfishermen had announced their intention of fishing to the north ofthe existing sink-at-sight zone. If they adopted this course, itwould give rise to difficulties, and he therefore proposed that theexisting sink-at-sight zone should be extended to a line runningfrom the tip of Land&apos;s End to the south of Ireland. This proposalhad been discussed with the Foreign Office, who were in agreementwith it.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed.Poland.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)ForeignLanguagePeriodicals.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet the latest infor-mation about Polish affairs. This is recorded in the Secretary&apos;sStandard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.5. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 4th Februarythe Minister of Information had informed the War Cabinet thathe had arranged for the supplies of newsprint to be cut off from aPolish Opposition newspaper which continuously attacked theRussian Government.In discussion, reference was made to the existing powers fordealing with the foreign language periodicals published in thiscountry which persistently attacked another ally or in any wayimperilled Allied unity.The Minister of Information, who had circulated a Memo-randum on this point (W.P. (44) 101), said that he was satisfied onbalance that it would be undesirable to seek further powers fromParliament to deal with this matter. He thought that it was bestto continue to rely on the Ministry of Supply&apos;s licensing powers,which were based on the paper control.General agreement was expressed with this view. But it shouldbe made clear that the responsibility for giving decisions on thismatter lay with the Ministry of Information, and that it was forthe Ministry of Supply to act promptly on any recommendationreceived from the former Ministry in this matter.This was approved.Discussion then turned on the controversy which was beingconducted between the Poles and the Russians in their respectiveperiodicals. The Prime Minister suggested that, as part of ourpolicy of fostering better relations between the Poles and Russians,we should point out to the Russians the action which we had alreadytaken, and which we were prepared to take in future, in regard tothe Polish press, and should indicate that we hoped that theRussians in return would exercise some degree of restraint in thenewspapers under their control.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toprepare a statement suggesting what action could be taken on theselines.
Withdrawal ofCivil Staffsfrom ServiceDepartments.6.   The War Cabinet had before them W.P. (44) 62 : A Note by the Secretary circulating, bydirection of the Prime Minister, a copy of a Minute addressedto him by the Service Ministers; andW.P. (44) 79 : A Memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council,dealing with the question of withdrawal of civil staffs from ServiceDepartments.In their Minute to the Prime Minister the Service Ministerspointed out that the question had been considered by the LordPresidents Committee as part of the proposals of the Minister ofLabour and National Service to obtain additional women for urgenthigh priority work of national importance (L.P. (43) 77th Meeting).The Lord Presidents Committee had then had before them aproposal made in a Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (L.P. (43) 288) that the Service Departments should begranted total exemption from the withdrawal of civil staffs, withoutreference to the Kennet Committee, but had decided that it wouldnot be possible to grant this exemption. In view of the threat tothe efficiency of their Departments, the Service Ministers felt thatthey could not accept this decision of the Lord PresidentsCommittee without reference to the Prime Minister and Ministerof Defence. They claimed that, at a time when the three ServiceDepartments were at the peak of their war effort, they ought not tobe subjected to the loss of efficiency which would result from thewithdrawal of young and active clerks who knew their work, andthey argued that, in any event, the Kennet Committee&apos;was not anappropriate body for deciding what staffs were essential and thatthe task of submitting proposals to the Kennet Committee wouldabsorb effort which ought, especially in the Service Departments,at the present time to be devoted to more positive objectives.In his Memorandum (W.P. (44) 79) the Lord President of theCouncil suggested that it was not unreasonable that the ServiceDepartments should be called on, like other Departments, to satisfyan impartial body that the proposed withdrawals would seriouslyimpair their efficiency. He also pointed out that the argument thatthe Kennet Committee had no responsibility for the administrativeresults of their decision could be equally well used by many otherDepartments and must be rejected as being incompatible with anyorderly system for the equitable allocation of our man-powerresources.In opening the discussion the Lord President of the Councilsaid that the scheme for withdrawing women of the 1923 age-classfrom Government Departments provided for a number of exemp-tions and gave the right of appeal to the Kennet Committee. Hefelt that, in view of this, the position of the Service Departmentswas fully safeguarded.The First Lord of the A dmiralty pointed out that the staffs ofthe Service Departments had been excluded from the .scope of theenquiry carried out by the Committee on the Reduction of NationalGovernment Staffs, although they had been covered by the pro-gramme for the withdrawal of 10 per cent, of mobile womenemployed in Government Departments. He stressed the difficultieswhich would arise if the Service Departments were compelled topart with fully trained women at a time when they were about toundertake important and difficult operations. There was noguarantee of prior substitution, and the substitutes who would beprovided would be inferior in quality and would not be able to standthe pace at the present time. The Secretary of State for War andthe Secretary of State for Air supported the views put forward bythe First Lord of the Admiralty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the ServiceDepartments were granted automatic exemption, there would bebound to be discontent. The fact that the Service Departments werenot automatically exempted would not preclude them from gettingexemption from the Kennet Committee for essential staffs.
The Minister of Labour and National Service said that togrant a total exemption to the Service Departments would put himin an extremely difficult position both as against other Departmentsand in Parliament. He was, however, ready to consider somedeferment of the date of withdrawal of staffs from the ServiceDepartments.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe doubted whether it was wise to withdraw women of the 1923 classfrom any Government Departments at the present time. In anyevent, he must ask that, if an exemption were granted to the staffsemployed in Service Departments, the same exemption should applyto the staff of the Ministry of Home Security engaged on operationalduties.The Prime Minister said that he had considerable sympathywith the views of the Service Ministers. He recognised that to givetotal exemption to staffs in the Service Departments might beinequitable from the point of view of the individual and might leadto a certain amount of discontent. He was, however, opposed to anystep which would impair the efficiency of the Service Departmentsin preparing for the operations which were impending this year.He suggested that the Service Departments should accept, inprinciple, the same treatment as the other Departments; but that,having regard to the special circumstances of the moment, no staffsshould be withdrawn from the Service Departments for a period ofthree months. During that period there would be an obligation onthe Service Departments to take the initiative in doing everythingpossible to release any staffs who could be spared. Towards the endof the period the question whether withdrawals from the ServiceDepartments should be carried out would be reviewed in the lightof the releases which had been made. The same principles shouldapply in the case of the staffs in the Ministry of Home Security towhich the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security hadreferred.The War Cabinet-Agreed to the proposal made by the Prime Minister.Staffing of Civil 7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theService in the Chancellor of the Exchequer (WP. (44) 86) dealing with the staffingImmediate of the Civil Service in the immediate post-war period. AppendedPost-War to the Memorandum was a draft statement which the ChancellorPeriod. of the Exchequer proposed to make at a very early date in the Houseof Commons.The Memorandum explained that detailed proposals had beenworked out in consultation with the Departments and thatdiscussions had begun with the Staff Side representatives on theNational Whitley Council. Some time would elapse before theresults of the discussions could be submitted for final Ministerialapproval, and it was desirable that in the interval an indicationshould be given of the Governments general approach to theproblem. The broad principles had already been agreed by theMinisters principally concerned and the Staff Side representativesconcurred in the proposal that a statement should be made.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposals hadbeen approved by the Ministerial Committee on the Machinery ofGovernment. The proposed statement, which would be made in verygeneral terms, would indicate that the Governments immediateobjective was to recruit at the earliest possible moment properlyqualified personnel, that the main source of recruits would be fromthose who would have had an opportunity of competing for the CivilService but for the interruption of war, and that there would be asubstantial preference for ex-Service candidates.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldbe grateful if, in making his statement, the Chancellor of the
India.Proposed UnitedKingdom-United StatsEnquiry intoEconomicAssistance.8. The War Cabinet had before them a note by the Presidentof the Board of Education covering a Memorandum by the IndiaOffice (W.P. (44) 96) about a proposal, made in the first instance bythe United States Chiefs of Staff, that a combined committee shouldbe formed in India to determine the extent of economic assistancenecessary for India to be built up as a base for forthcoming opera-tions in South-East Asia.In discussion, doubts were expressed as to the wisdom ofassociating United States representatives in an enquiry which waslikely to have a very wide range. On the other hand, it was pointedout that the proposed terms of reference had been so drawn as tobe limited to the economic assistance required to enable India to bea proper base for operations and specifically excluded any enquiryinto the general financial and economic policy of the Governmentof India.The Prime Minister said that the need for the proposed enquirywould to some extent depend on certain strategic decisions affectingSouth-East Asia which had not yet been taken.The War Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Education, on behalfof the Secretary of State for India, to obtain the commentsof the Government of India on the proposed terms ofreference, emphasising the dangers of a combined enquirywith a very wide scope, and indicating privately to theViceroy that the decision as to the need for this enquirywas in part dependent on certain decisions on operationalmatters now pending.Political 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theWarfare Minister of Information (W.P. (44) 92) dealing with the provisionTraining School, of domestic staff for the residential training school which had beenset up to train personnel for front-line and occupational propa-ganda in connection with operations in Western Europe.The Minister of Information said that the staff requirednumbered about 100 women. He had been unable to get any of theService Departments to take responsibility for providing thenecessary staff, and had therefore brought the matter before theWar Cabinet. He had already tried, without success, to obtainassistance from the Women&apos;s Voluntary Services.The Secretary of State for War said that he doubted whetherthe provision of this domestic staff could be regarded - as fallingwithin the scope of the War Office, and that, in any event, he hadnot the resources to meet the request of the Minister of Information.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to decide which Departmentshould be responsible for providing the necessary staff. Thewithdrawal of any staff from a Service Department forthis purpose would be taken into account in the review ofthe question of the withdrawal of civil staffs from ServiceDepartments which had been agreed earlier [seeMinute 6].Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,14th February, 1944.Exchequer would say that a statement would follow shortly on thesubject of recruitment to the Foreign Service. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer agreed to do this, and added that certain other minoramendments were being made to the draft statement.The War Cabinet-Approved the making of a statement on the lines set outin the Annex to W.P. (44) 86.
