The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command had carried out very heavy attacks againstStuttgart and Frankfurt, the latter being the heaviest attack wehad yet made. Railway centres at Amiens and Le Mans andfactories in France had also been attacked. Mosquitoes hadbombed Germany each night. United States heavy bombers hadattacked Brunswick, Augsburg, Friedrichshafen and Munich,together witb airfields in Germany and &quot; Crossbow&quot; targets.Coastal Command had made one promising attack and had possiblydamaged another U-boat. Enemy losses for the week had been273 aircraft destroyed and 51 probably destroyed. UnitedKingdom-United States losses had been 142 bombers, 43 fightersand 2 Coastal Command aircraft. 220 enemy aircraft had been overthis country during the previous week, of which 21 had beendestroyed.In addition to the heavy attack on Cassino, Allied aircraft hadoperated against railways and ports. Strategic targets includedToulon, Vienna and Sofia. Enemy losses amounted to 62 aircraftcompared with 54 Allied.Airborne operations in Burma had been successfully carriedout. Enemy losses amounted to 26 aircraft destroyed comparedwith 17 Allied. In the Pacific 85 Japanese aircraft had beendestroyed compared with 10 Allied aircraft.Confirmed shipping losses by enemy action during the weekamounted to 31,328 tons. The losses for March to date amountedto 81,240 tons. Eleven German U-boats had been destroyed and2 probably destroyed so far this month.The unloading at the Anzio bridgehead now amounted tosome 6,000 tons a day.The attack on Cassino on the 15th March had been preceded bya heavy air bombardment. The New Zealanders had then launchedan attack in a southerly direction, and had captured practically thewhole of the town, although the Germans were still holding out inthe southern portion. &quot;We had not yet succeeded in taking themonastery.Our troops had cleared the enemy from the Tiddim road nearTuitum.The War Cabinet agreed ;That there was now no reason why General Wingate&apos;sname should not be mentioned in connection with theBurmese operations. The Secretary of State for War wasinvited to communicate to the Minister of Information asto the form which the announcement should take.The Russian operations continued successfully. During theprevious week they had opened up two new offensives, one south ofthe Pripet marshes towards Kowel, and the other south of Luck.North-east of Nikolaev the Germans were in a bad position, andtwo corps had been roughly handled. The Russians had reached theDneister on a front of about 60 miles between Mogilev-Podolsk andRibnitsa and had crossed on a 30-mile front. The advanceseriously threatened two of the four bridges over this river.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.[27146-1]b 2

The War Cabinet at their meeting on the 21st FebruaryFood Grain had approved certain proposals of the Indian Food Grain Require-Requirements. ments Committee for dealing with the requests of the Viceroy for(Previous the continued importation of food grains.   They now had beforeReference: them-W.M.(44)23rd ^ COpies 0f further  telegraphic correspondence with theConclusions, Viceroy,   who  continued  to  urge  the  psychologicalMmute 6.) importance of substantial imports, and was averse fromfinding rice for Ceylon until the main question ofimports for India had been resolved;(6) a Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (44) 165), whorecommended (i) that, in view of reduced requirements, the alloca-tion of shipping for military maintenanceprogrammes should be reduced by 25 ships duringthe period April to June, and that the Ministryof War Transport should be invited to makeavailable the equivalent capacity in the secondand third quarters of 1944 for the carriage of200,000 tons of wheat to India;(ii) that the United States military authorities shouldbe approached with a view to their making asimilar contribution in shipping;(iii) that the proposal to ship small quantities of wheatto India in deadweight or in stowage should beapproved in principle, subject to supply difficul-ties being solved;(iv) that the shipping necessary to provide the cerealsfor the minimum maintenance requirements inIndia should be tabulated in future as a militaryrequirement.The Minister of War Transport said that on the latest figuresavailable there was statistically a surplus of food grains in India.But it was clear from the Viceroy&apos;s messages that, despite abundantharvests, the need for imported wheat on psychological groundsremained.   He was ready, therefore, to transport 200,000 tons of
wheat to India, but on the understanding that the 25 shipsrequired would be additional to the ships that had already beenreleased and transferred to other operational uses, and that theArmy would not ask for this released quantity to be made goodlater this year. He was averse from asking the United States WarDepartment to make a cut in their military cargo shipments toIndia, and thought that no commitment to India should now bemade beyond the 200,000 tons. He had had expert examinationmade of the suggestion that bagged wheat should be included in thecargoes of ships loading for the East coast of India, and wassatisfied that for technical reasons it was impracticable.The Secretary of State for India urged very strongly that theViceroy should be given the full amount of 434,000 tons for whichhe was now pressing. The psychological aspect of this matter wasof first-class importance. Nearly three-quarters of a million lives hadbeen lost through famine and its sequels. Unless there was generalconfidence that there was no risk of recurrence nothing could preventthe peasant in 750,000 villages holding back his small parcel ofgrain, with the result of famine or at least famine prices. What-ever crop estimates might be, it was only grain actually procuredand under Government control that was available for distributionor exchange. It was essential not to risk a general breakdown inIndia or the interference with military operations which theCommander-in-Chief in India and the Supreme Commander, South-East Asia Command, feared might follow from a shortage of food.The War Cabinet would incur a grave responsibility if this tookplace in face of the reiterated warnings of the Viceroy. As for thesuggestion that a quantity of rice should be found from India forCeylon, against which 150,000 tons of wheat at present earmarkedfor Ceylon should be diverted to India, the Viceroy&apos;s hands wouldbe immensely strengthened in considering this proposal if HisMajesty&apos;s Government could first meet him on his main demand forwheat.A general discussion followed. Attention was drawn to theserious under-estimate by the Government of India of the rice cropfor this year and to the faulty basis of their statistical case. It wasargued, on the other hand, that the statistical issue had ceased tobe of importance, and that the considerations in issue- were nowessentially psychological.Reference was made by Mr. Bruce and Mr. Nash to theimportance of ensuring the import of prosphates to Australia andNew Zealand, on the basis previously discussed. The question wasraised whether the twenty-five additional ships which were to bringwheat to India from the Southern Dominions could carryphosphates on the outward voyage.The Minister of War Transport said that this would not bepossible without serious dislocation; but he was fully alive to theimportance of the point raised by Mr. Bruce and Mr. Nash.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The allocation of shipping for military maintenanceprogrammes should be reduced by twenty-five shipsduring the period April to June. The Minister of WarTransport was invited to use the capacity so releasedfor loading 200,000 tons of wheat to India in the secondand third quarters of 1944. This was on the under-standing that the twenty-five ships to be made availableby the Army would be additional to the ships alreadytransferred to other operational uses, and that theDefence authorities would not ask for this capacity tobe made good later this year.(2) It should be made clear to the Viceroy that, having regardto stringency of the shipping situation, there was noprospect of wheat additional to the 200,000 tonsbecoming available in the remaining quarters of 1944.
(3) The Viceroy should be strongly pressed to agree to anexchange of rice for wheat with Ceylon, whereby afurther 150,000 tons of wheat could be shipped to India.(4) The effect of the above measures, and of the 50,000 tonsalready arranged for, would be to provide India witha total of approximately 400,000 tons of wheat. TheWar Cabinet felt that an announcement of so substantialan import of wheat should enable the Viceroy to handlethe situation.(5) It would not be desirable to approach the United Statesmilitary authorities for assistance and that should bemade clear to the Viceroy.(6) For the technical reasons which had been explained by theMinister of War Transport, the proposal to ship smallquantities of wheat to India in deadweight or instowage should not be pursued.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,20th March, 1944.
NO CIRCULATION RECORD(W.M.(kh) 36th Conclusions)Prior to the meeting of the War Cabinet on Monday,20th March, the War Cabinet alone met at 5*30 p.m.      Thepoint discussed was the speech made on the previous day byMr. Herbert Morrison, in which he had discussed how thegreat volume of reconstruction legislation was to be passedin a reasonable period of time, and had suggested that itmight be necessary to pass legislation in very general terms,leaving the details to be filled in by delegated legislation.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he was going tosee the 1922 Committee later in the week, and he had beenwarned that he would be asked whether the Home Secretary&apos;sspeech represented Government policy;    and if not, whatwere the views of Conservative members about this matter,and when these views were to be expressed.THE HOME SECRETARY pointed out that no notice hadbeen given that this matter was going to be raised.     Theissue he had raised was a grave problem vrhich meriteddiscussion.      Unless a solution to it was found, we shouldbe in a hopeless position.      So far as he could see,  thematter was not really a Party political issue.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Home Secretary&apos;sspeech had been a perfectly reasonable exposition of theproblem, and of one way of solving it.     He also told theWar Cabinet that the Home Secretary had showed him hisspeech beforehand, and that he (the Prime Minister) had seennothing in it to which exception need be taken.     He hadtaken the view that tQgr.sg^ch had been written with theintention of correcting/impressions given by the speech madeby the Home Secretary a week earlier.     He quite agreedthat the Home Secretary had a perfect right to make a speechon these lines.     At the same time, he said that the speechcould very easily be answered by Conservative members.     Heindicated the lines on which he would be disposed to answerit, if an answer had to be given.     Clearly, however, noanswer could be given to the Home Secretary&apos;s speech, byone of his colleagues, which would not have the effect ofweakening the Government.Broadly,  the line taken by the Prime Ministerwas that speeches of this kind, if repeated, could only leadto a break-up of the Government.      It was his duty to keepthe Government together and,for that purpose, it wasnecessary that Ministers of different Parties should foregotheir right to speak their views on certain matters.The meeting terminated with a tacit understanding(not however recorded in any specific conclusion)        thatit would be far better that speeches of this kind shouldnot be made in future.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1.
