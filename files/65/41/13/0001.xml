Enemy losses for the week,including claims by the United States Air Forces, amounted to284 destroyed and 61 probably destroyed. We had lost 117 bombersand the United States 41.11,500 sorties had been flown in connection with the land battle.Enemy losses amounted to 126 aircraft destroyed compared to73 Allied.Confirmed shipjoing losses by enemy action for the previousweek amounted to 46.700 tons. There had been no belated reports.The January total amounted to 82,290 tons.Eight U-boats had been sunk and 4 probably sunk during themonth.Light naval forces had bombarded enemy land communicationswith success. The cruiser Spartan had been sunk by a glider bomboff Anzio. One hospital ship had been sunk and 2 damaged. Thehospital ships had been well illuminated and had been bombed frommasthead height.The weather had improved and unloading operations wereahead of schedule.The operations in Italy were described. On the southern partof the main front attacks on the German positions were now inprogress. Attacks by the Allied forces in the Anzio bridgehead hadbegun on the previous day -the United States in the direction ofCisterna, which they had occupied, whilst the British attack hadreached the outskirts of Campoleone. It was thought that, withreserves from the southern front and others coming south, theGermans now had some 4^ to 5\ divisions opposite the Allied forceswhich had been landed.On the Leningrad front the Russians had continued to advance.Further south Novo Sokolniki had been captured. In the Ukraineweather had apparently interfered with operations and the Germanshad had some small success. The Russians were also attacking inthe Smyela area.The War Cabinet-Took note of the above statements.Air Raids. 2.

Foreign Affairs.Argentina.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.)Russia.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.)Lord Halifax&apos;sSpeech atToronto.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad a satisfactory talk with the Argentine Ambassador, who hadinformed him that the Argentine Government proposed to stop allcommunications, trade and financial transactions not only withGermany and Japan, but also with the enemy satellite States andenemy-occupied territories. Although Argentina did not mean tobreak off diplomatic relations with the minor satellite States, themeasures proposed gave us, in substance, what we required..The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the terms of thereply which he had received from Premier Stalin to the personaltelegram, the text of which he had read to the War Cabinet at theirmeeting&apos; earlier in the week.Reference. wras made to Lord Halifax&apos;s speech at Toronto on the24th January, which had been the subject of some comment. A notesummarising the Press reactions had been circulated to the WarCabinet (W.P. (44) 67).It was pointed out that these comments seemed to result notso much from the substance of the speech, but from the place andtime of its delivery.The Prime Minister suggested that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should consider whether steps should be taken toensure that the Government were consulted before public statementswere made which were likely to be taken as pronouncements onimportant issues of policy.Indian States. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePetty States in Secretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 57), to which was appendedWestern India, a Draft Bill to render legal the attachment of certain Indian Statesto other Indian States. It was explained in the Memorandum thatthe Bill was made necessary by a recent decision of the localJudicial Commissioner, declaring ultra vires a notification by theCrown Representative transferring the jurisdiction previouslyexercised by the Paramount Power over a number of small Statesin the West of India to certain of the larger adjoining States. Thistransfer of jurisdiction had been made in August 1943 in order toadmit the population of the small States concerned to a share inthe benefits of modern administration, whilst taking due account ofthe long-standing rights and dignities of the &quot; Taluqdars &quot; orChieftains of the States concerned. The Judicial Commissionersdecision, of the legal soundness of wdiich there appeared to be gravedoubt, had created a serious and urgent situation in the Statesaffected. The larger States to which they had been attached wereuncertain as to their own position as regards the exercise of juris-diction. There had been collisions between the representatives ofthe Taluqdars and the larger &apos;&apos; attaching &apos;&apos; States, and economicdistress was also making itself felt owing to the refusal of manyunits to obtain through the attaching States the control commoditiesessential for their people.The Prime Minister expressed uneasiness lest we should beregarded as proposing to legislate to remove long-established rightsas a matter of administrative convenience. He was apprehensiveof the possible effect on the Princes of legislation to remove nativerights in India or of any suggestion that we appeared to take a lightview of such legislation.The further point was made that legislation such as that nowcontemplated might be exposed to criticism in Parliament on theground that jurisdiction was being transferred from British controlto the control of Indian States.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, pointedout that the proposal required legislation at a time when agreed
reconstruction legislation which was urgently required was held upfor want of Parliamentary time.On the other hand, it was pointed out that a situation of graveurgency showed every sign of developing in Kathiawar. Thenormal recourse of appeal to the Privy Council would involvesubstantial delay, possibly as much as nine months. There was arisk that in the meantime a condition of chaos might develop in theareas affected. In reply to a suggestion that the notification of lastAugust, under which the jurisdiction now in issue had beentransferred from the Political Agent to the &quot;attaching&quot; State,should be cancelled or suspended and jurisdiction restored to thePolitical Agent pending, at any rate, judicial investigation of thematter, it was explained that such a course would have a mostunsettling effect locally and could not, apart from that, but reflectunfavourably on the prestige of the Crown Representative.The Prime Minister suggested that the Leader of the Houseof Commons should discuss with the Leader of the House of Lordswhether arrangements could be made for the introduction of theBill in the House of Lords, and, if so, whether undue expenditureof Parliamentary time would be involved; and that the mattershould be further discussed in the light of this report in a week&apos;stime, when the Secretary of State for India would himself bepresent.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the Prime Ministers proposal.Shipping.Supplies ofPhosphate Rockfor AustraliaandNew Zealand.(PreviousReference:.W.M. (43) 172ndConclusions,Minute 3.)5. On the 20th December, 1943, the War Cabinet had decidedthat the American Authorities should be asked to provide vesselsto ship, by the end of March, 281,000 tons of additional rockphosphate to Australia and New Zealand.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of War Transport (W.P. (44) 56) reporting that the &quot;WarShipping Administration had so far been unable to agree to thisproposal. In view of the fact that some part of the extra shippingneeded would inevitably have to be found from British resources,and as the shipments would have to be made by March in order tobe available for the coming season in Australia, the Minister ofWar Transport proposed to allocate additional tonnage to lift about75,000 tons as soon as possible.The Minister of War Transport said that he had done all inhis power to obtain additional shipping from the War Shipping-Administration, but so far without success, owing to the fact thata- decision had not yet been reached on certain operational require-ments. He hoped that a decision on our part to find shipping fora. further 75,000 tons as now proposed might stimulate theAmericans to go further to help us in this matter.He had used all possible arguments with them, but so far hehad found it impossible to move them.The Prime Minister expressed his uneasiness, at a time whenthe shipping situation was so serious, at the diversion of even thetonnage proposed for this purpose.Mr. Bruce said that the matter was a most serious one fromthe point of view of Australia, and that New Zealand was equallyinterested. Australia was faced with very heavy demands for meatfor American troops and was anxious at the same time to give allassistance she could to the United Kingdom. Failure to securethese phosphates was bound, however, to react on the Australianmeat output.The Paymaster-General suggested that, if British shipping-was used to transport phosphates to Australia, a lien might beobtained on the resultant meat output. He referred to the verylarge American demands, which were on a scale far higherthan ours.
War Pensions.Pensions andGratuities forOfficers&apos;Widows.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 150thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. On the 4th November, 1943, the War Cabinet had appointeda Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of theExchequer, to make recommendations to the War Cabinet on thequestion of pensions payable to the widows of retired Flag Officersre-employed as Commodores of Convoy and the conditions ofpayment of the &apos;&apos; killed in action &apos;&apos; gratuity.The War Cabinet now had before them the Report of thisCommittee (W.P. (44) 60). The Committee&apos;s recommendations wereas follows : (a) Pensions of Widows of Retired Flag Officers Re-employed asCommodores of Convoy.The Committee recommended that the widow should receive,in addition to the attributable pension of the rank in which theOfficer was re-employed, half of the difference between that amountand the attributable pension appropriate to the higher rank inwhich the Officer served on a substantive basis before his retirement.The Committee suggested that this special arrangement mightapply to certain other classes of Officers, to be agreed between theService Departments and the Treasury. A suggested definition forthese classes was &apos;&apos; pensioned Officers performing work of a speciallyhazardous character in ranks lower than the rank in which theywere pensioned.&quot; The Service Ministers and the Minister ofPensions agreed to this proposal.(b) Killed in Action Gratuity.The Committee recommended that no change should be madein the present ba,sis of payment of this gratuity. The ServiceMinisters (with the exception of the First Lord of the Admiralty)and the Minister of Pensions accepted this recommendation.- The First Lord, of the Admiralty said that he remained of theopinion that the proper course was that the gratuity should be paidto cover cases of &apos;&apos; violent death due directly to the special risks ofwar service.&quot; This he understood to have been, broadly speaking,the practice in the last war.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet -Endorsed the Committee&apos;s recommendations as set out inW.P. (44) 60.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,31st January, 1944.The Minister of Reconstruction thought that Americandemands should be looked into.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought it wasclear that, in view of the extreme scarcity of shipping, the SouthAfrican request for 37,000 tons of phosphates, which was a lowerorder of priority, could not be proceeded with.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the proposals of the Minister of War Transportas set out in W.P. (44) 56.(b) Agreed that the additional 37,000 tons of phosphates askedfor by South Africa should not be shipped; and thatthe South African Government should be informedaccordingly.(c) Invited the Minister of Food to investigate the questionsraised as to the extent and scale of United Statesdemands for Australian meat for their troops, and tosubmit a report setting out the lines on which represen-tations might be made to the United States authorities.
