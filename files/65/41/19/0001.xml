Indian Food. AT their meeting on the 7th February, 1944, the War CabinetGrain had appointed a Committee consisting of the President of the BoardRequirements, of Education (in the absence of the Secretary of State for India),(Previous the Minister of Food, the Minister of War Transport, and the Pay-Reference: master-General, to examine further the request of the GovernmentW.M.(44)16th of India for continued importation of food grains, with particularConclusions, reference to the statistical basis of the case set out in the memo-Minute 6.) randum by the Secretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 63).The War Cabinet now had before them &apos;(a) the report of the Committee presided over by the Presidentof the Board of Education (W.P. (44) 99);(&amp;) a draft (W.P. (44) 103) of a possible official telegram to the- Governor-General of India conveying to him a decisionin the sense of the conclusions of the Committee.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, besidesthe telegrams before them, there had been a further communicationfrom the Viceroy urging in the strongest terms the seriousness of thesituation as he foresaw it, if the Government of India&apos;s full demandwas not met. The Prime Minister added that the shippingdifficulties revealed by the report of the Committee under thePresident of the Board of Education were very real. While he wasin general agreement with the draft telegram to the Viceroy he wasmost anxious that we should do everything possible to ease theViceroy&apos;s position. No doubt the Viceroy felt that if this cornercould be turned, the position next year would be better. It was veryimportant, too, that the difficulties seen by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in acceding to a request so anxiously pressed by the Viceroyshould be clearly stated in the telegram.The President of the Board of Education observed that theCommittee had felt that they ought not to go further than the con-clusions set out in their report. But he feared that the decisionwould cause consternation in India. The Indian grain market wasaccustomed to depending to some extent on imports. The 50,000 tonsof Iraqi barley now in view consequent on his Committee&apos;s reportwas not a large amount; its price would be high; again barley hadnot the same value, from the Indian point of view, as wheat, and itsprovision would not have the same effect, particularly in the Punjab.The Minister of War Transport said that it would be out of thequestion for him to find shipping to maintain the import of wheatinto India at a monthly rate of 50,000 tons for an additional twomonths. The best that he could do was represented by the proposedimport of Iraqi barley. If, when the final figures of the rice cropwere available, the Government of India&apos;s anticipation of an acuteshortage proved to be justified he would then have tonnage in aposition to carry to India about 25,000 tons a month. But even thishelp would be at the expense of cutting the United Kingdom importprogramme in 1944 below 24 million tons, this being the latestestimate in the light of increasing operational requirements. In thecircumstances it was clearly quite impossible to provide shipping tomeet the full demand of 1-J million tons made by the Government ofIndia.The \following suggestions were made for the amendmentof the draft telegram : (a) It should be made clear that the Viceroy&apos;s request had beenfurther considered by the War Cabinet.(b) A paragraph should be added to the effect that shipping tocarry any additional cargoes could only be provided bythe United States, and that it was clear that any suchrequest would be most unlikely to succeed unless it wasput forward on the basis of the ascertained facts as tothe 1944 harvest.In this connection reference might be made to theseriousness of our own shipping position.
(c) The last sentence of the existing draft might be expresseddifferently, so as to make it clear that refusal of India&apos;srequest was not due to our underrating India&apos;s needs, butbecause we could not take operational risks by cuttingdown the shipping required for vital operations.The Lord President of the Council drew attention to the short-age of trained staff, at a time when the Indian Administration wasmaking a strong effort to overcome a serious situation. Ought notthe India- Office to examine the lists of retired members of the IndianServices and consider whether any of them could be invited to returnto India to assist the Government of India?The War Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the lines of the draft telegram tothe Viceroy and asked the President of the Board ofEducation to arrange for a revised draft to be prepared,to meet the suggestions made in discussion, and sub-mitted to the Prime Minister for his approval.(2) Asked the President of the Board of Education, on behalfof the Secretary of State for India, to arrange for thesuggestion made by the Lord President of the Council asto the re-employment of retired members of the IndianServices to be examined.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,14 A February, 1944.
