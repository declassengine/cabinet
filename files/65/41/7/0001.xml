The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Owing to bad weather, Bomber Command had only carried outone major attack-against Brunswick. Night air photographsshowed the results to have been promising. Mosquitoes had alsobombed Berlin and Magdeburg.United States bombers had attacked most successfully theGerman fighter assembly factory at Oschersleben and the bomberaircraft components factory at Halberstadt as well as other targetsin Germany.&quot; Crossbow&quot; targets had also been attacked by our own andUnited States Air Forces.Coastal Command had attacked 5 U-boats, 1 of which had beenassessed as sunk and 3 possibly damaged.Enemy losses for the week, including claims by the UnitedStates Air Force, amounted to 199 destroyed and 58 probablydestroyed. (The former figure included claims of 134 by the UnitedStates heavy bombers.) Allied losses amounted to 127, including39 United Kingdom and 62 United States heavy bombers.Air activity had increased during the previous week. 9,300sorties had been flown: 70 per cent, had been against tactical and30 per cent, against strategic targets. Included in the latter wereSofia, the Pirseus and aircraft factories near Florence.Enemy losses were 35 aircraft destroyed as against 45 Allied.1,600 sorties had been flown. Targets attacked includedRabaul, Cape St. George and enemy dumps in New Guinea.Eighty-six Japanese aircraft had been claimed as destroyed asagainst 17 Allied.Confirmed shipping losses during the previous week, includingbelated reports, amounted to 17,064 tons. Confirmed losses forJanuary amounted to 35,617 tons.During the month 2 U-boats had been sunk and 3 probablysunk.Light forces had operated in the Adriatic in support of theEighth Army.A Japanese cruiser had been reported as sunk by one of oursubmarines off Penang.Weather conditions on the Italian Front continued to be bad.Most of the fighting had been on the Fifth Army front. TheFrench Corps and the Americans had each made an advance ofabout 4 miles on a 9 to 10 miles front.No account had been received from the Russians regardingtheir attacks in the Leningrad area. Near Veliki Luki the Russianshad made an advance which had reached the Nevel-LeningradRailway. Further, south Mozyr had been captured, and consider-able progress had been made in that area. The three Germancounter-attacks in the Kiev salient had all been reported to be held.Still further south the Russians had made some minor improvementsin their line. There were still no signs of a German withdrawalfrom the Dnieper Bend, but there was evidence that they wereexperiencing difficulties with their railway communications.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Poland.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 6thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the latest information in regard to the Russian-Polishsituation, a record of which is contained in the Secretary&apos;sStandard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.[26768-1]
Argentina.(PreviousEef erence:W.M. (44) 6thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 34), in which hereported that Mr. Cordell Hull had agreed to defer the moredrastic steps he had been contemplating, but was still pressing toissue a general statement, to impose a general freezing of Argentineassets, and to withdraw the United States Ambassador from BuenosAires; and wanted us to take parallel action.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had appended tohis Memorandum a draft telegram to our Ambassador atWashington setting out the lines on which he should speak toMr. Hull on this matter and indicating the steps which we mightbe prepared to take in the interests of Anglo-United Statessolidarity.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theinformation which had come in during the week-end, giving thereactions of other countries, all tended to increase his anxiety aboutthe course of action proposed by the United States Government, andbrought home the need for further consideration of this matterbefore any action was taken.The Minister of Food said that our 1944 import programmeincluded about If million tons of foodstuffs from the Argentine.About one-third of our meat came from that country, and there wasvery little chance of making good from elsewhere any falling offin imports from the Argentine. Our balance of trade with theArgentine was adverse and, reviewing the position as a whole, hewas satisfied that the suspension of trading between the twocountries would be far more damaging to us than to the Argentine.The Minister of Production referred to our urgent need forhides, for which we were largely dependent on the Argentine.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the last twosentences of the penultimate paragraph of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sdraft telegram went too far towards committing us to a course ofaction which might have very serious consequences on supplyprogrammes, failure to achieve which would inevitably have adamaging effect on military operations during 1944. It wasaccordingly suggested that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send the telegram to Lord Halifax on the followinglines : The War Cabinet had again examined the situation.With every desire, on our part, to keep in step on this matterwith the United States Government, it seemed to us that, ifMr. Hull&apos;s proposed general statement was at a later stagefollowed by action, military operations would inevitably bejeopardised. Accordingly, we thought that no final decisionshould be taken in this matter until the military implicationshad been examined. We had accordingly asked that the mattershould be examined as a matter of urgency by the British Chiefsof Staff.This suggestion met with the general approval of the WarCabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if at a later dateit was desired to make a statement on the lines of the last twosentences of the penultimate paragraph of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sdraft telegram, the reference to our own controls would have to bedifferently expressed.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited tosend an interim telegram to our Ambassador atWashington on the lines suggested at &apos;.&apos; X.&quot;(2) The Chiefs of Staff were invited to examine and report tothe War Cabinet, as a matter of urgency, on the effecton military operations this year of an immediatecessation of supplies of all kinds from the Argentine,and on the strategical implications of breaking offrelations with that country.
31 W.M. 7 (44), -(3) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs wasauthorised to inform the Dominion Prime Ministers ofthe course of action which the United States Govern-ment had proposed to take in this matter, and of ourattitude to these proposals.4.   The War Cabinet considered the following papers : (i) A Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport(W.P. (44) 26) reporting that the country&apos;s transportsystem would not be able to continue to move the presentload as well as the additional traffic arising from&quot; Overlord,&quot; and suggesting that he should examine theposition in consultation with the Ministers responsiblefor heavy movements and agree with them what reduc-tions in traffic should be made,(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power(W.P. (44) 29) pointing out that any further reductionin the volume of coal transport could only be achievedat the expense of war production, of the domesticconsumer or of the coal set aside for &quot; Overlord.&quot;(iii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (W.P. (44) 27) drawing attention to the serioussituation which would arise if, so soon after the Govern-ment had announced their decision to direct young mento the mines, numbers of miners became idle owing tothe Government&apos;s inability to move coal from the pits.(iv) A Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister (W.P.(44) 31) suggesting that the whole, inland transportposition should be examined by the Minister of Produc-tion in consultation with the other Ministers concerned.Points in discussion : (a) The Minister of War Transport said that all the Depart-ments concerned had been aware for some time that the launchingof operations on the Continent based on this country would lead toa difficult transport position. It was, however, only recently thatthe full implications had begun to become clear, and he had takenthe first opportunity of bringing the position to the notice of theWar Cabinet.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, as a result ofthe transport difficulties which had already arisen, stocks of coalwere already 2,000,000 tons less than had been anticipated. If forthe rest of the coal year transport facilities for coal could berestored to the level of last November, it should be possible to avoidfurther consumption cuts. If, however, further cuts were made inthe volume of coal traffic, it would be necessary to consider furthercuts in consumption, which might involve the closing down of someless essential production.The Minister of Production said that the Americans hadpromised delivery by April next of considerable quantities ofmachinery required for working outcrops. A difficult positionwould arise if, after obtaining this machinery, which the Americanshad been reluctant to supply, we were unable to move all the coalproduced.(c) The Minister of Production also suggested that, in additionto the points mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister in hisMemorandum, the implications of the inland transport position onour supply and import programmes also required examination.id) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that hehad made provision for all the labour requirements arising from&quot;Overlord &quot; of which he had received notice, and these had beentaken into account in the recent man-power allocations. Had hereceived notification of some  of  the  additional requirements,InlandTransport.
e.g., those for dockers, which had now arisen, he might have beenable to make provision for them also. At this late date, however, itwas difficult to see how, even if the additional men could beprovided, they could be trained in time. In any case, considerationof these additional requirements must inevitably involve a reviewof the recent man-power allocations.(e) The Secretary of State for War said that a Committeeunder the Chairmanship of Sir Findlater Stewart was nowexamining a proposal to reimpose, on security grounds, the ban onvisitors to the coastal areas. He thought that this Committeeshould also take into account the relief which such a ban mightbring to the inland transport position.(/) The Minister of War Transport pointed out that reductionson many types of small traffic would yield little result. He hoped,therefore, that any enquiry which might be undertaken wouldconcentrate on the big traffics.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Production, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to examine both the immediateproblem of coal transport and the more general questionof the steps which should be taken to relieve the congestionon the inland transport system.This enquiry should be carried out on the lines proposedby the Deputy Prime Minister, subject to the points raisedin discussion.Parliament. 5.   The War Cabinet discussed the business of the House inBusiness of       the weeks beginning the 23rd and 30th January,the House. The main question discussed was whether provisional arrange-ments to hold the two days&apos; Debate on Electoral Reform in the weekbeginning the 23rd January should be modified so as to allow of adebate in that week on agricultural policy. The War Cabinetdecided that on balance it was desirable that there should be aDebate on agriculture during the course of that week; and, further,that, since the course of the Debate was likely to turn on the inter-pretation of the Government pledge about fixing prices ofagricultural products in relation to agricultural costs, the Debateshould be wound up by a War Cabinet Minister.The  War  Cabinet  accordingly decided  on  the  followingprogramme : -Tuesday, 25th January. Committee stage of the Vote ofCredit. Debate on His Majesty&apos;s Governments contributionto the expenses of UNRRA. The Chancellor of the Exchequerwould speak first for the Government, and either the Ministerof State or the Minister of Food would be asked to reply to theDebate.Wednesday, 2Qth January. Debate on agriculture. TheMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries would speak first for theGovernment, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer would replyto the Debate.Thursday, 27th January, and Friday, 28th January. These days would be occupied by items of the legislativeprogramme.Tuesday, 1st February, and Wednesday, 2nd February. *A two-day Debate on Electoral Reform. The Home Secretaryand Minister of Home Security would speak first for theGovernment, and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairswould wind up for the Government on the second day.
33W.M. 7 (44)&quot;.Delegated 6.   The  War  Cabinet  had  before  them  a  MemorandumLegislation. (W.P. (44) 30) in which the Minister of Labour and NationalControl of Service drew attention to an amendment which had been put downParliament to the Disabled Persons (Employment) Bill and which sought toover provide that no regulations or orders made under the Bill shouldDepartmental nave effect until they had been approved by affirmative resolutionEegulations of each House of Parliament. The proposals at present containedand Orders. in the Bill provided that regulations and orders should be laid downbefore Parliament as soon as may be after they had been made, andmight be annulled by resolution of either House if a prayer waspresented within twenty-eight sitting days next after the laying ofthe regulations or orders.The Minister of Labour and National Service said thatregulations and orders to be made under the Bill fell into thefollowing three categories : (a) Regulations on matters relating to the entry and retentionin the register of the names of persons handicapped bydisablement.(&amp;) Orders (which could only be made after previous consulta-tion with the appropriate employers&apos; or workers&apos;organisations) fixing the standard and special percen-tages determining an employer&apos;s quota under the Billand designating classes of employment speciallysuitable for disabled persons.(c) Regulations on matters of procedure.He was not prepared to agree that regulations on matters ofprocedure should be made subject to affirmative resolution. So faras the present Bill was concerned, he would have seen no greatobjection to agreeing to the amendment so far as the other ordersand regulations in question were concerned. He understood,however, that other Ministers concerned with post-war legislationfelt that an awkward precedent might be set if a concession weremade in regard to these regulations and orders.The President of the Board of Trade said that the legislationon economic matters, which would be required after the war inplace of the present Defence Regulations, would have to containmany provisions empowering Ministers to make regulations andorders. He would see no objection to it being provided that suchorders and regulations might be annulled by negative resolution.If, however, they were made subject to affirmative resolution, theconsequent congestion of business would be most serious.The Minister of Production said that he had been asked by theMinister of Supply to make a similar point in regard to the legis-lation which would be required to provide for the continuance andgradual relaxation of the raw material controls.The War Cabinet were informed that it was difficult, on thebasis of precedents, to draw any hard-and-fast line between thetypes of regulation or order which were normally made thesubject of the affirmative or negative resolution procedure. Broadlyspeaking, however, it might be said that affirmative resolutions werenormally only provided for in cases in which regulations or ordersamended the provisions of a Statute or contained provisionsaffecting monies payable to the Exchequer. It appeared probablethat the amendment to the Disabled Persons (Employment) Bill wasdirected not so much to the merits of the particular proposals aboutregulations and orders made under the Bill as to the generalobjection felt by some Members to delegated legislation.The general view of the War Cabinet was that any concessionon this occasion would be likely to lead to the establishment of anundesirable precedent and that the amendment should, therefore,be resisted on the ground that, if regulations and orders arisingfrom the whole field of reconstruction legislation were to be made
subject to affirmative resolution, this would lead to such congestionof Parliamentary business as would seriously impede the work ofreconstruction.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service to.deal with the amendment on these lines.Press.Daily Worker&apos;sRequest for theaccrediting ofcorrespondentsto BritishForces.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 4thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. At their meeting on the 10th January, 1944, the WarCabinet had accepted in principle a proposal that the Daily Workershould not be permitted to have accredited correspondents with HisMajesty&apos;s Forces, and had invited the Secretary of State for War,in consultation with the Minister of Home Security, to formulatethe terms in which this decision should be conveyed to the DailyWorker.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet approved a draftreply, submitted by the Secretary of State for War, to a questionby Mr. Pritt for answer on the following day, subject to the amend-ment of one sentence.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,17th January, 1944.
