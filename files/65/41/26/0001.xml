The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security madea report to the War Cabinet on the air raids that had taken placein London between the 21st and 25th February.The raid on the 21st/22nd February, carried out by 26 aircraft,had been of minor importance; very extensive flare-dropping hadbeen a feature of it. The raids on the three following nights hadbeen in many respects similar to one another. Each of these raidshad been carried out by 100 to 150 aircraft, many different typeshaying been employed. Casualties last week and the precedingweek had been as follows : -Week Week21st-28th Feb.        14th-21st Feb.KilledSeriously injuredSlightly injured3145563923711,016500The War Cabinet-Agreed that the month&apos;s casualty figures, which in thenormal course were due for release in the immediate future,should be published.Civil Defence. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theUse of Deep Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 135) onShelters. Deep Tube Shelters.  The Memorandum set out the present positionin regard to these shelters, their numbers, and the accommodationthey afforded.  As a result of recent raids, there had been a sharp
increase in the pressure on shelter accommodation, which wasaggravated by the removal of certain of the bunk accommodationfrom tube shelters. The resultant congestion at certain tubeshelters had led to pressure, encouraged by sections of the Press,for the opening of the deep shelters. The accommodation in thoseshelters had been provided to meet the need felt at the end of 1940for shelters in which people could spend the whole of the night.The recent raids had been short and sharp and the deep sheltershad not been built for this contingency. Moreover, of the eight deepshelters, one was in occupation by military staffs and two otherswere being adapted for the accommodation of Operational Staffs.The Civil Defence Committee had agreed that it would be desirablethat all the deep shelters should be so reserved, while the DefenceCommittee (Operations) had&apos; decided that in the allocation ofaccommodation in deep tube shelters priority must be given to themaintenance of the machinery of Government.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that,looking at the matter from the point of view of the shelter accommo-dation available, there was no need to take these shelters into use.He deprecated anything that would encourage the development ofthe deep shelter mentality, and drew attention to the possible effecton morale of Civil Defence workers of encouraging it. On a reviewof the whole position, he recommended that the deep shelters shouldnot be opened to the public and that an explanation of the reasonsunderlying this decision should be given.The Prime Minister suggested that, if the present raids werecontinued, and these shelters were known to exist, but the accommo-dation was not made available, there was a risk of strong publiccriticism. Would it not be possible to allow the public to use themtemporarily and to close or empty them at the appropriate time?He also thought that the effect on morale of the opening of thesedeep shelters could be exaggerated.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe possibility of allowing the public to use these shelterstemporarily, and thereafter requiring them to vacate, had been mostcarefully examined; but all expert opinion was agreed that it wouldnot be practicable to do so and that very serious difficulties wouldfollow any attempt to apply such a policy. Admittedly, the amountof shelter accommodation in issue was small in relation to the totalpopulation to be catered for. But he attached importance to thequestion of morale, and to avoiding anything that would encouragethe existing prejudice against street shelters, or tend to developthe deep dugout mentality. A question had now been put down inthe House of Commons for to-morrow and he was anxious, if thepresent policy was approved, to give in reply to it a real justificationof the policy which he was advocating. He outlined the terms ofhis proposed reply.The Prime Minister said that, while he still felt some doubt asto the course proposed, he would not press his point of view.After further discussion, the War Cabinet Endorsed the proposals of the Home Secretary andMinister of Home Security, as contained in W.P. (44) 135,and agreed as to the terms of the reply to be given inParliament, subject to the omission of the reference to&apos;&apos; forthcoming offensive &apos;&apos; and the substitution therefor ofsome such words as &quot; essential military purposes.&quot;
Civil Claims 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theagainst Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 133) setting outMembers of the proposed arrangements for dealing with civil claims againstUnited States    members of the United States Forces.   Attached to the Memo-Forces.&quot;X1randum was a draft statement which would be made in the Houseof Commons if the arrangements were approved.   &apos;The main proposals in the Memorandum were :- (i) His Majesty&apos;s Government should assume responsibilityfor the settlement and payment of claims arising out oftraffic accidents, accidental shootings, accidental explo-sions, loss of or damage to chattels in premisesrequisitioned by United States Forces, and certain otheraccidents, such as those caused by practice gun-fires andfires in billets. Responsibility would be limited toclaims arising on and after the 19th March, and claimswould be accepted only if they arose out of acts oromissions of United States Forces in the course of theirmilitary duties;(ii) His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept responsibilityfor payment, but not for the examination, of any out-standing claims of the kind referred to in (i) and theAmericans should be urged to clear up these claimssatisfactorily and speedily; and(iii) In the case of outstanding claims for sums exceeding5,000 dollars, His Majesty&apos;s Government should assumeat once the responsibility for the examination as well asthe payment, since, if it were left to the Americans tosettle these claims, they would be forced to refer themto Congress, with a consequent delay of many months.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that there wasa great deal of criticism of the delay in settling claims againstmembers of the United States Forces and that, unless a satisfactorysolution could be reached, it would be difficult to keep this criticismin check. By no means all the traffic accidents which gave rise toclaims were due to dangerous driving.The following points arose in discussion : (a) Could American drivers not be made to conform to the samerestrictions on speed as were imposed on British Service drivers?It was suggested that the possibility of getting the United Statesauthorities to agree to this might be explored.(b) To what areas would the arrangements proposed inW.P. (44) 133 extend? It was explained that the arrangementswould extend only to the areas covered by the British ClaimsCommission.(c) The Prime Minister thought that the proposed statementto be made in the House of Commons was too long. It was agreedthat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make a brieforal announcement and circulate the full statement in the OfficialReport.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals in W.P. (44) 133 subject toabove.X&quot;Application ofAllied Powers(MaritimeCourts) Act,1951, to France.8.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council(W.P. (44) 124) proposing that an order should be madeunder Section 1 (2) of the Allied Powers (MaritimeCourts) Act, 1941, applying the Act to France.; and
Food Problems 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thein Liberated Minister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (44) 113) proposing that, inEurope. view of the present world food situation, British propaganda should(Previous encourage the Spring sowing of crops while continuing to urgeEeference: peasants not to market the food through Nazi-controlled channels.W.M. (43) 131st jjfog Minister of Economic  Warfare recalled that at theConclusions, meeting on the 24th September, 1943 (W.M. (43) 131st Conclusions,Mmute 3.) Minute 3), the War Cabinet had decided to reconsider before theSpring sowings the question whether British propaganda should goso far as to encourage food production in Europe. He suggestedthat the time had come to take this step if we were going to avoida situation in which the population of liberated areas in Europewould blame the Allies for the shortages of food which were likelyto arise.- The Prime Minister saw some objection to open propagandaon these lines. He suggested that, while not changing our openpropaganda to the populations of occupied areas, local agentsshould be instructed to speak on the lines proposed. -The War Cabinet-Agreed that there should be no change in the public propa-ganda to populations of occupied countries on the subjectof food production, but that local agents in these countriesshould be instructed to encourage food production.Army 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theBenevolent Secretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 116) covering a schemeFund. worked out by the Army Council for the formation of an ArmyBenevolent Fund.The War Cabinet-Deferred consideration of the scheme until after the forth-coming debate in the House of Commons on Army pay andallowances.Service Pay and        11.   The Secretary of State for War said that in the DebateAllowances.       on Army Estimates Mr. Kendall, M.P., had a Motion callingattention to the inadequate pay and allowances of Service men andwomen and moving &quot; that this House is of the opinion that the pay(ii) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security (W.P. (44) 130) stating what responsi-bilities and liabilities would fall on him in the event ofthe establishment of a French Maritime Court in thiscountry.The Memorandum by the Lord President of the Councilexplained that the Lord Presidents Committee were satisfied thatan order should be made to enable a French Maritime Court to beestablished, but that, in view of the desirability in present circum-stances of proceeding with great caution in any matter involvingthe French Committee of Liberation, they had felt it necessary todraw the attention of the War Cabinet to the proposal.The War Cabinet Approved the proposal that an order should be made underSection 1 (2) of the Allied Powers (Maritime Courts) Act,1941, applying the Act to France.
and allowances of members of His Majesty&apos;s Army are inadequateto enable them and their families to maintain a reasonable standardof living, and therefore it is urgent that immediate increases bemade in such pay and allowances.&quot;The Secretary of State for War reminded the War Cabinetthat on the occasion of the last major alteration in Service pay andallowances in September 1942 it had been stated on behalf of theGovernment that the concessions then introduced were regarded asa final solution of the matter so long as prices remained substantiallyat their present levels.Since that date price levels had not changed, but there hadbeen some increase in industrial wages. The Secretary of Stateinformed the War Cabinet of the general lines of the statementwhich he proposed to make. This was that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment stood on the position which they had taken up in September1942 and Which had been reaffirmed on several subsequent occasions,and that they remained of opinion that the general scheme of thepresent pay and allowances was essentially sound and afforded afair and reasonable standard for officers and other ranks and theirfamilies. At the same time the door was not closed so far asconcerned the detailed application of the scheme then adopted.The position was constantly being examined in the light of theinformation received, and suggestions made in debate would beadded to evidence already received and would be taken intoconsideration.In discussion, it was suggested that the House might bereminded that on the occasion of the alterations effected inSeptember 1942 the whole position had been very fully discussedbetween the present Chancellor of the Exchequer and Minister ofAircraft Production and a committee representative of all sectionsof the House, who had accepted as satisfactory the rates of pay andallowances which had then been introduced. It was generallyagreed that reference to this might be included in the Secretary ofState for War&apos;s statement.Subject to this point, the War Cabinet Endorsed the general lines of the statement outlined bythe Secretary of State for War.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,28th February, 1944.
