Production inSouth Walesand South-WesternRegion.Effect of theCoal Shortageon ElectricitySupplies.The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum^ by theMinister of Production on the situation in regard to the supply ofpower for industrial purposes in South Wales and South-WestEngland. The Memorandum recorded the interim action which hadbeen taken on the 10th March to meet the situation which showedsigns of developing, and the outcome of meetings with representa-tives of the industry and the interested Departments held in Cardiffand in Bristol on the afternoon of the 11th. As a result of thosemeetings the following proposals were submitted for approval by theWar Cabinet: &apos;(a) In South Wales a reduction in industrial load of 53,000 kilo-watts, for which arrangements had been agreed with allconcerned.(&amp;) In the South-Western Region an economy of use should beenforced amounting to 15 per cent, of the average con-sumption during the four weeks ended the 4th March,1944. This would apply to all firms using an appreciableamount of electric power, probably embracing under-takings using 30 kilowatts or more.The question of discharging or &apos;&apos; laying-off &apos;&apos; workpeople inconnexion with these reductions might arise in South Wales. Anundertaking operating under the Essential Work Order wasobliged to pay wages to employees laid off; and it seemed right that,in these circumstances, such payments should be recoverable.Arrangements had been made for the authority vested in theMinister of Fuel and Power under the Defence Regulations to bedelegated to the Ministry of Production Regional Controllers toenforce these cuts. It had also been arranged that special exemptionwould be given to work on products of particular urgency inconnexion with forthcoming operations.The Minister of Production, in his Memorandum, also pro-posed : (1) that a survey should be made forthwith of Regions otherthan the South Wales and the South-Western Region inorder to determine the supply positions in relation to(a) industrial, and (&amp;) domestic load, so that from theproduction angle the best possible plans might be madeto safeguard the position in advance of a crisis; and(2) that consideration should be given to the question whethersome cut should not be made in &apos;&apos; domestic &apos;&apos; consumptionof electricity.The Minister of Production said that the Central ElectricityBoard had at first put the shortage in these two areas as about250,000 kilowatts. This would have meant a 50 per cent, cut inSouth Wales and an 80 per cent, cut in production in the South-Westeim Region. So big a cut would have involved a risk of seriousloss of essential war production, and immediate action had thereforebeen taken. As a result of the steps taken locally, and by theMinistry of Fuel and Power, the short fall had now been reduced to60,000 kilowatts. While the situation to-day was easier, he stillfelt, however, that the proposed measures should be adopted andpressed for immediate action in that sense. The margin was a verynarrow one and it was relevant that when work was restarted in thepits, this would involve the use of power to the extent of 20,000 kilo-watts, as compared with the total of 53,000 kilowatts by which theindustrial load was nowr to be reduced in South Wales.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, from the long-termview, he was ready to support any steps which would bring downconsumption. In the last week for which figures were available theconsumption of coal by electricity undertakings in the country as awhole had been 21 per cent, more than in the corresponding weeklast year, and the coal stocks of electricity undertakings as a wholehad averaged only 4^. weeks&apos; consumption.   As regards the imme-* This has now been circulated as W.P. (44) 158..
diate position, however, the alternatives put to him by the CentralElectricity Board had been either a cut of 300,000 kilowatts forfifteen hours a day during the strike, or the provision of 20,000 tonsof coal per week for eight named stations in the two Regions, eitherfrom open-cast or by diversion from other areas, to cover three weeks.Arrangements had been made on these lines, and power wouldaccordingly now be forthcoming to maintain electricity supply inSouth Wales and the South-Western Region. In addition, he hadjust received information that this morning 95 out of some220 pits were working in South Wales. He would deprecate, there-fore, having to shut down factory production merely because of theimmediate South Wales coal situation, since he felt that it should bepossible, on the facts as now known, to see this situation through.On a long-term view, however, he strongly favoured a reduction inthe use of electric power on the lines advocated by the Minister ofProduction.The Minister of Labour and National Service remarked that hewas wholly in favour of substantial economies if they could beachieved. But these economies were being linked with the effectsof the coal strike. An immediate announcement of the measuresproposed by the Minister of Production might, he feared, play intothe hands of those elements in the coalfields which might not beanxious to see the settlement of the strike. He strongly urged theimportance of postponing any action until the 15th, or, if possible,the 16th March, and basing justification for these measures, whentaken, on the need for economising electricity. He was also stronglyagainst the making of any public announcement.&apos; To-day andto-morrow were the vital days for the settlement of the strike. Theweek-end had left only the Welsh position uncleared in the coaldispute, and he thought it most important, for the reasons given, notto take, the risk of any action which might reduce the chance of asettlement.The Minister of Information was strongly opposed to makingany public announcement.The Minister of Aircraft Production pointed out that thescheme put forward in the Minister of Production^ Memorandumhad been the subject of discussion with the employers and tradeunions over the week-end, and they were aware, therefore, that itwas being submitted to the Government for approval. Thisimmediately affected the possibility of entire secrecy.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that hethought that the issue of instructions to give effect to the measuresproposed need attract very little attention if they were issued con-fidentially (no public announcement being made), and if as fewmen as possible were stood off, reductions in production being dealtwith by cutting down overtime.After further discussion, the War Cabinet reached the follow-ing conclusions :  -(1) The measures recommended in paragraph 7 of the Memo-randum by the Minister of Production were acceptedsubject to a delay of 24 hours. Those concerned shouldbe told to-day to await further orders; and the instruc-tions in regard to these measures should be treated asconfidential, and no communication about them shouldbe made to the Press.(2) Every endeavour should be made to avoid work-people beinglaid off temporarily as a result of these cuts, recoursebeing had to a reduction of overtime. In so far asemployees were temporarily laid off (as a direct result ofthe cuts imposed) wage payments would be recoverablefrom the Supply Department concerned, through theappropriate machinery.
(3) The Minister of Production and the Minister of Fuel andPower should, at the appropriate moment, formulateplans for dealing, in other Regions, with emergenciessimilar to that now under discussion.(4) No statement should be made to the Press as to the actionbeing taken. (It was hoped that it would not be neces-sary for any statement on the subject to be made inParliament until the position in South Wales had eased.)(5) Because of the importance of avoiding publicity at thisjuncture, consideration of the means to secure a reductionm &apos;&apos; domestic &apos;&apos; consumption of electricity was deferred.Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,ISth March, 1944.
