Qoal- 1.   The War Cabinet discussed briefly the position in the(Previous        mining industry.W M (44) 32nd        ^he Deputy Prime Minister reported the decisions which hadConclusions&apos;)    Deen taken at the meeting of the War Cabinet earlier in the day&apos;;    (W.M. (44) 32nd Conclusions).The Minister of Fuel and Power reported that about 50 percent, of the pits where strikes had occurred were now workingagain.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that thestatement, which had appeared in some newspaper head-lines, thatthe strikers had gained 90 per cent, of their demands, was whollyinaccurate. He was convinced that the strikers would now returnto ,work, though it might be some time before full working wasresumed in all pits. Once the strikes in South Wales were over, hebelieved that it would be possible to get the workers to make goodthe loss in output.With reference to the Parliamentary question which had beenput down by Mr. Granville, M.P., the Prime Minister said that heproposed to say that the time was not opportune for a statementor for a Debate on the subject.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Ireland.(PreviousPreference:W.M. (44) 15thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet considered the terms of a reply whichthe Prime Minister had drafted to the Private Notice Question*by Sir W. Davison, M.P., referring to the refusal of the EireGovernment to remove Axis Diplomatic and Consular representa-tives from Eire, and enquiring what further action, if any, HisMajesty&apos;s Government had in view to minimise the danger fromespionage.The Prime Minister drew attention to the statement in hisproposed reply that the restrictions on travel announced were thefirst step in a policy designed to isolate Southern Ireland from theouter world during the critical period which was now approaching.In view of what was at stake in the operations to be undertakenthis year, the most stringent steps must be taken to avoid aleakage of information from Southern Ireland. He contemplatedthat, later in the year, it might be necessary to prevent the sailingof ships or the departure of aircraft from Southern Ireland to theContinent.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested theaddition of a paragraph to the Prime Ministers draft stressingthat the initiative in this matter had been taken by the UnitedStates.   This was agreed to.In further discussion of the draft reply, it was also agreed tomake certain amendments so as to avoid giving the Eire Govern-ment an opportunity to divert the argument from security to thepartition issue.Subject to the amendments made in discussion, the WarCabinet Approved the terms of the Prime Minister&apos;s draft reply.Prance. 3.   The Prime Minister referred to the result of the trial ofTrial of M. Pucheu, former Vichy Minister of the Interior, who had beenM. Pucheu.      condemned to death.  If M. Pucheu was executed, he thought thatthe United States Government would become still cooler towards* For this Question, and the reply given on the 14th March, see Annex.
the French Committee of National Liberation. This might reacton the claims of the Committee to be given the control of anyportions of France immediately it had been liberated. But, on thefacts available, we could not say whether the death sentence wasjustified. In all the circumstances, he felt that it would beundesirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to intervene.The War Cabinet-^-Agreed with the view expressed by the Prime Minister.Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,13th March, 1944.ANNEX.(Extract from Hansard, Vol. 398, No. 46, Cols. 36-37.)Eire (Security Measures).Sir William Damson (by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether, inview of the refusal of the Government of Eire of the American request supportedby Great Britain that Axis Consular and Diplomatic representatives should beremoved from Eire having regard to the serious danger to the Allies in connectionwith the forthcoming invasion of Europe in having a centre of espionage withinthe British Isles, he is satisfied that the steps recently taken to minimise thedanger are adequate, and, if not, what other measures the Government havein view.*The Prime Minister: The initiative in this matter was taken by the UnitedStates because of the danger to the American armed forces from the presence ofAxis missions in Dublin. His Majesty&apos;s Government were, however, of course,consulted throughout by the United States Government, and gave the Americanapproach full support. We have for some time past taken a number of measuresto minimise the dangers arising from the substantial disservice to the Allied causeinvolved in the retention by Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government of the German Ministerand the Japanese Consul with their staffs in Dublin. The time has now comewhen these measures must be strengthened, and the restrictions on travel toIreland announced in the press yesterday are the first step in the policy designedto isolate Great Britain from Southern Ireland and also to isolate SouthernIreland from the outer world during the critical period which is now approaching,I need scarcely say how painful it is to us to take such measures in view ofthe large numbers of Irishmen who are fighting so bravely in our armed forcesand the many deeds of personal heroism by which they have kept alive the martialhonour of the Irish race. No one, I think, can reproach us with precipitancy.No nation in the world would have been so patient. In view, however, of the factthat both British and British Dominion lives and the lives of the soldiers of ourAllies are imperilled, we are bound to do our utmost to obtain effective securityfor the forthcoming operations.There is also the future to consider. If a catastrophe were to occur to theAllied armies which could be traced to the retention of the German and Japaneserepresentatives in Dublin, a gulf would be opened between Great Britain oh theone hand and Southern Ireland on the other which even generations would notbridge. His Majesty&apos;s Government would also be held accountable by the peopleof the United States if it could be shown that we had in any way failed to doeverything in our power to safeguard their troops.* An earlier version of this Question, in a form disallowed by the Speaker, was circulatedin W.P. (44) 157.
