1.84. On the 3rd January, 1944, the War Cabinet had invited theChiefs of Staff to report whether there were still military objectionsto the publication of the Long Armistice Terms.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theChiefs of Staff (W.P. (44) 15) stating that, in their view, onmilitary grounds publication at present was undesirable.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that a telegramhad been sent to General Eisenhower in the United States to obtainconfirmation that he was still opposed to publication, but a replyhad not yet been received.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that three ofthe objections to publication cited by the Chiefs of Staff seemed tohim to be largely political, although no doubt they had a militaryaspect. In view of the Chiefs of Staffs opinion, he would not pressfor publication at this juncture, but he thought that the point wouldbe pressed when Parliament met again.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 7).The Secretary of State for War said that the Daily Workerhad put forward the names of four correspondents for accreditingas correspondents to the British Forces. These had been refusedon the grounds of their individual unsuitability. A point had nowbeen reached at which he thought that it should be definitely decidedthat the Daily Worker should not be permitted to have accreditedcorrespondents with His Majesty&apos;s Forces. If a decision in thissense was arrived at, then a statement to this effect should be madeto the Daily Worker.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet (1). accepted, in principle, the Secretary of State for War&apos;sproposal that the Daily Worker should not be permittedto have accredited correspondents;(2) invited the Secretary of State for War, in consultationwith the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity, to formulate and submit to the War Cabinetthe terms in which this decision should be conveyed tothe Daily Worker.6. The War Cabinet had before them the following Memo-randa on the Reinstatement in Civil Employment Bill by the Home Secretary and Ministry of Home Security(W.P. (44) 6);by the Minister of Reconstruction (WP. (44) 16);by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (W.P.(44) 17).The point at issue was whether the right of reinstatementunder the Bill should be extended to whole-time volunteers in theCivil Defence, Police and Fire Services. This matter had beendiscussed* by the Reconstruction Committee, which had decidedagainst such an extension.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe had set out the arguments in favour of this extension in detailin his Memorandum. Perhaps the main point was that reinstate-ment rights were possessed by men and women who had been calledup under the National Service Act for duty in Civil Defence* R. (44j 1st Meeting.
19W.M. 4 (44).&quot;Forces.&quot; To withhold these rights from whole-time volunteerswould, he felt sure, give rise to bitterness ;and disappointment.It had been argued that the extension of reinstatement rightsto whole-time volunteers in the Civil Defence Services would meanthat these rights would have to be extended to persons directed toemployment in industry. He did not share this view, since hethought that public opinion would draw a clear line betweenindustry and the Services (including Civil Defence).The views of the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity were supported by the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister of Health.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that, in hisview, women who volunteered for the Women&apos;s Land Army had atleast as strong a claim as members of the Women&apos;s Services andCivil Defence personnel, and that there would be strong Parlia-mentary pressure for their inclusion in the Bill.The Minister of Reconstruction said that reinstatement rightswere generally identified in the public mind with service in theArmed Forces. It was true that these rights had been extended tothe small proportion of persons in Civil Defence who had beenconscripted to the Civil Defence Forces under the National ServiceAct of 1941. This was not the result of any deliberate decision ofpolicy, but an incidental consequence of their having been called upunder the procedure for call-up to the Armed Forces. The Recon-struction Committee had taken the view that, on balance, it wouldbe wrong, merely because reinstatement rights were enjoyed by thisrelatively small number of Civil Defence personnel, to extend themto the whole body of volunteers in Civil Defence.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that it wasimpossible to avoid some anomalies in this matter, and that hismain object was to ensure a workable arrangement. The questionof the Civil Defence Services had not been raised in his discussionswith industry on this matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that mostmembers of the Civil Defence Services could, look to being releasedwhen the Avar with Germany came to an end, and would thereforehave an advantage as compared with members of the Forces.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention, however, tothe following cases which might arise : (1) A man might have left a position in industry to become awhole-time volunteer in a Civil Defence Service. Hisplace might have been taken by a man who had beensubsequently called up for the Army. Under presentarrangements, in such a case, reinstatement rights wouldattach not to the man who volunteered for Civil Defencebut to the man who took his place.(2) The second case concerned a man who had left a post inindustry to become a volunteer in Civil Defence and hadlater become a member of the Armed Forces. In sucha case there was no value in the right to reinstatementin the last job occupied before entering the Army.The Minister of Labour and National Service undertook tolook into these instances. He also agreed that representatives ofthe Ministry of Labour and National Service and the Treasuryshould consult together as to any repercussions which the Reinstate-ment in Civil Employment Bill might have, by way of analogy, onGovernment employment.The general view of the War Cabinet was that it was clearlydifficult to define a satisfactory line of demarcation in regard toreinstatement rights, and - that the position of whole-timemembers of the Civil Defence Services was no doubt somewhatanomalous.    But, short of taking  away existing rights  from
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,10th January, 1944.conscripts in Civil Defence &quot; Forces,&quot; discrimination betweenconscripts and volunteers in Civil Defence could not be avoidedwithout creating other and more serious difficulties in otherdirections.The War Cabinet Endorsed the view of the Reconstruction Committee thatthe provisions of the Reinstatement Bill should not beextended to whole-time volunteers in Civil Defence, andagreed that the position in this respect should be madeclear to Parliament at an appropriate stage.
THE PRESS&quot;Daily Worker1s&quot;Request forAccrediting ofCorrespondents toBritish ForcesNO CIRCULATIONW.M. (44) 4TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5(10th January, 19hh - 5-30 p.mv)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that hewas satisfied that to accredit correspondents to the&quot;Daily Worker&quot; would not &quot;be consistent with security.The Communist Party were already trying to plant agentsin the Army and had succeeded in planting members oftheir party in certain very secret1 organisations.He thought we ought to say quite flat-footedly thatwe were not prepared to allow the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; tohave accredited correspondents.MR. RADGLIFFE said that at the present momentthe Ministry had no option hut to treat the &quot;DailyWorker&quot; on the same &quot;basis as any other paper with afairly considerable circulation.      The &quot;Daily Worker&apos;*s&quot;application to have an accredited correspondent hadcome from the Newspaper Proprietors Association, ofwhich Association the paper&apos;s proprietors were members.In the Ministry&apos;s view it was not open to them todeprive the paper completely of all normal pressfacilities on the grounds that the paper was not to betrusted.      On the other hand they have never invitedthe Editor of the &quot;Daily Yforker&quot; to any MinisterialConference.      Up till recently this latter positionhad been acquiesced in;   but the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; hadnow complained that they had not been invited to the&quot;CROSSBOW&quot; Conference, held by the Home Secretary andMinister of Home Security.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR-said that itmight be relevant in this connection that he understoodthat General Eisenhower intended to do a good deal ofwork through Press Conferences.THE HOME SECRETARY said it coulter haps beargued that, having raised the ban against the &quot;DailyWorker&quot;, the paper must now be given all facilities.He agreed that the paper should be given all generalfacilities, but did not feel that the paper&apos;srepresentatives should also be admitted to intimateMinisterial Conferences.      He thought that the Editorwould feel under an obligation to pass on anyinformation which he received to the Leaders of theCommunist Party.      On the merits of the case he was inagreement with the views expressed by the Secretary ofState for War.The question was then raised as to what reasonshould be given to the refusal to accredit correspondents,THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER thought that a reference tothe Springhall case would suffice.The suggestion was made that it might be possibleto arrange for the accrediting of a correspondent whomthe Government was prepared to trust.

THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER,  however,  thoughtthat this would lead to trouble in the Press.After some further discussion the War Caoinet -(l) Accepted, in principle, the Secretary ofState for War * s proposal that the &quot;DailyWorker&quot; should not he permitted to haveaccredited correspondents;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War,in consultation with the Minister of HomeSecurity, to formulate and submit to theWar Cabinet the terms in which thisdecision should he conveyed to the&quot;Daily Worker&quot;.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.
