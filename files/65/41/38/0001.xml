Pensions(Increase)Bill.1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on the secondreading of the Pensions (Increase) Bill some criticism had beenexpressed of the Bill.The criticisms fell under two heads: the first concerned thesupplementary provisions as to increase of pensions. Thus amarried man whose pension was  150 a year or less would receivean increase of 25 per cent., and a man whose pension fell between 150 and  250 an increase of 20 per cent.He thought that he could meet the criticism on this part of theBill by certain minor changes, e.g., he proposed to increase themaximum figure in the case of married pensioners from  250 to 300 a year and to extend the definition of dependants.The second criticism concerned certain pensions which undera settlement made at the end of the last war had been subject to aprovision whereby 20 per cent, thereof had been varied in accordancewith changes in the cost of living. These pensions had beenstabilised about 1935 at 9^- per cent, below the 1919 rates. Thisstabilisation had proved to be in the interests of the pensionersconcerned until 1939, but thereafter had been in the interests of theExchequer. It had now been contended by Major-General Sir GeorgeJeffreys, M.P., that failure to restore this 9^ per cent, cut in fullto all the pensioners in question was a breach of faith. This, ofcourse, was not a fair statement of the facts. The provision in theBill dealing with this class of pensioners gave an increase of 10 percent, on pensions of this class up to  200 a year, of 1\ per cent, onpensions exceeding  200 but not exceeding  400 a-year, and of5 per cent, on pensions exceeding  400 but not exceeding  600 ayear.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied thatto concede what was demanded in this case, namely, restoration infull of the 1919 rates, would have very dangerous repercussions.For example, it would raise the issue of bonus to higher grades ofCivil Servants. At present there was no cost of living bonus payableon salaries in excess of  1,000 a year. He hoped that the Cabinetwould support him in resisting the claim made for restoration ofthese pensions to the full 1919 rates.The War Cabinet supported the view taken by theChancellor of the Exchequer on the point of principle, butfavoured some adjustment as, for example, that theincrease of 10 per cent, should apply on pensions up to 400 a year and that the *l\ per cent, rate should applyon pensions exceeding  400 but not exceeding  600 a year..Town andCountryPlanningLegislation.(PreviousEef erenee:W.M.(43)51stConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on thesubject of.future Town and Country Planning Legislation, and hadbefore them a Memorandum by the Minister of Town and CountryPlanning (W.P. (44) 164) to which was appended : (i) The heads of a Bill empowering the compulsory purchaseof land required for development and redevelopment,regulating the disposal of such land when acquired andfixing the price of land acquired for public purposes;and(ii) A statement of the principles of the legislation requiredto implement the Governments undertakings withregard to positive national planning.The Memorandum proposed that the Bill, the heads of which wereset forth in Appendix I, should be introduced and passed into lawby the summer. It also suggested that, not later than the intro-duction of the Bill, the Minister should make a statement settingout what were the Governments proposals for the control of landuse, the payment of compensation and the levying of fees for thegrant of permission for change of use; and undertaking to introduceas soon as possible a Bill to carry these proposals into effect.
In discussion it was generally agreed that fresh powers wererequired for the acquisition of land for such public purposes as theredevelopment of reconstruction areas and the carrying out of theplans for housing and other forms of development which would haveto be undertaken immediately after the war.Basis of Purchase of Land for Public Purposes.Discussion then turned on the need for legislation to give effectto the principle accepted on behalf of the Government in the state-ment made by the Minister of Works and Buildings in the Houseof Lords on the 17th July, 1941, that the compensation payable inpublic acquisition or control of land should not exceed sums basedon the standard of values at the 31st March, 1939.In paragraph 5 of Appendix I to W.P. (44) 164 it was proposedthat the price at which the land should be acquired should be thevalue of the land as at the 31st March, 1939, to which should beadded or from which should be deducted any amount by which thevalue of the land for its use as at that date should have increasedor diminished; and that in assessing any such sum it should be adirection to the arbitrator to disregard any temporary and abnormalincrease or diminution in the value of the land in question due solelyto local circumstances arising from the war.It wTas argued in favour of this proposal that it was in linewith the practice already adopted by the War Damage Commissionin making payments; that it took account of the fall in the valueof money without an explicit admission which would be dangerous that this was being done; and that, by allowing the price to beinfluenced by any general rise which might have taken place since1939 in the value of the kind of land which was being acquired, itput owners who were dispossessed by the public purchase of theirland in a position to reinstate themselves. It was also pointed outthat in so far as the formula proposed brought the price paid forland acquired for public purposes nearer to current values, on whichDeath Duties were at present charged, it lessened the potentialcriticism of the Governments scheme.On the other hand, it was argued that the formula departedtoo far from the principle embodied in the statement made on behalfof the Government by the Minister of Works and Buildings on the17th July, 1941, namely, that compensation payable in publicacquisition or control of land should not exceed a sum based on thestandard of values at the 31st March, 1939. Allowance should,no doubt, be made for the fall in the value of money, but difficultywas seen in agreeing to the proposition that the price paid forland acquired for public purposes should be affected by generalincreases in the values of particular kinds of land which had takenplace since 1939. It was contended, for example, that it was notfair that the general increase in the value of agricultural land whichhad taken place over the war years-an increase largely due to theencouragement given by the Government to agriculture should bereflected in the price paid for land acquired for public purposes.No doubt the application of a formula which allowed only for the fallin the value of money would give rise to some hard cases. But therewas much to be said for putting before Parliament a proposal whichwas consistent with the pledge already given; and which could notbe represented as a substantial departure from the principle whichthe Government had accepted.Discussion then turned on the principles of legislation requiredto implement the Government&apos;s undertakings with regard to positivenational planning.  (See Appendix II of W.P. (44) 164.)It was pointed out that the Government were firmly committedto the principle of planning as a feature of national policy, and thatthe proposals now put forward were intended to give effect to theseundertakings. Purthermore, the scheme proposed would greatlyassist in the orderly control and planning of the use of landthroughout the country. Thus it would make it possible to ensurethat the limited quantities of, first-class agricultural land in this
country were not unnecessarily used for building. Again, localauthorities had hitherto been hampered in the work of town andcountry planning by consideration of the amount of compensationwhich would be payable under particular schemes. Under theproposals put forward by the Minister in Appendix II, the costsof compensation would, in the long run, be balanced by the feespayable when permission was given for the change of use fordevelopment of land. It was also urged that the proposed schemewould put a stop to the evils of land speculation.On the other hand, it was argued that the effect of the schemewould be to raise the question of compensation in respect of develop-ment rights as a potential issue in regard to all the land of thiscountry. The result would be that all landowners would have toconsider whether they should not put in claims for compensation.The amount of work involved would be very great indeed, and wouldcause unnecessary disturbance in regard to all transactions in landat a critical time. It was for consideration whether some schemecould not be devised which would ensure that the question ofcompensation in respect of refusal to allow a particular plot of landto be developed was not raised until the question became a live issue.The War Cabinet-Agreed to resume discussion of these aspects of the schemeat a later date.House of Lords: The War Cabinet agreed that in the Debate on Lord Latham&apos;sDebate on Lord Motion on the following day, the Government spokesman should sayLatham&apos;s that final conclusions on these matters had not yet been reachedMotion. and the Government would not be in a position to announce decisions(Previous       until after the Easter Recess.Eeference:W.M.(44)37thConclusions,Minute 3.)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,21st March, 1944.
