Protection of 2.   The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda on this,Monuments subject. The first was a Note by the Deputy Prime Minister (W.P.and Works (44) 14)j covering a memorandum received from the Chairman ofof Art. the Standing Committee of the Trustees of the British Museum,and signed also by the Principal Trustees of the Museum, by theChairman of the Trustees of the National Gallery and by theChairman of the Advisory Council of the Victoria and AlbertMuseum. This memorandum dealt with the steps to be taken tominimise war damage to monuments and works of art, and withthe post-war problems of compensation for and restoration of lootedand destroyed properties. The signatories recommended theestablishment in this country of a Commission on the lines of theSpecial Commission set up by the President of the United States.The second Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (44) 35), set out the steps which had been taken to protectmonuments and works of art in territories entered by our forces.I and also dealt with the post-war problem.The first point dealt with in discussion was whether the stepstaken to prevent unnecessary damage to monuments and works ofart in territories entered by our forces could be improved. It wasadmitted that in the past there had been some avoidable damage andloss. The organisation had accordingly been remodelled and nowprovided the three essentials required for the task. These were,first, the issue of stringent and effective&apos; orders by the AlliedCommander-in-Chief, placing upon the Commanders of troops theresponsibility for taking adequate steps to deal with this matter.Secondly, the Commanders had been provided with a list ofmonuments and other historic buildings in their areas. Thirdly,[26817-1] b 2Post-War 1.   At their meeting on the -23rd December the War CabinetRelief. had invited the Minister of State to arrange for an examinationFinance in the of the finance of relief during the military period. The WarMilitary Period.Cabinet now had before them a memorandum on the matter by the(Previous Minister of State to which was appended a joint memorandum, the-R0w0-,n0       terms of which had been agreed by the Chancellor of the ExchequerConclusions ^e mam point at issue was whether the finance of relieiMinute l ) &apos; during the military period should be met from our contribution toUNRRA of 1 per cent, of our national income ( 80 million).Since the matter had last been discussed in the War Cabinet, atelegram had been received from the United States which showedthat the United States Treasury took the view that relief suppliesduring the military period (and also relief supplies for ex-enemyterritories) should be outside the UNRRA 1 per cent, contribution.It had accordingly become necessary to make our position in thismatter clear as a matter of urgency, and telegrams had beendespatched to Viscount Halifax, making it clear that our 1 percent, contribution represented the maximum United Kingdomcontribution to relief in all areas and at all times. These telegrams-were now reported to the War Cabinet for endorsement.It was pointed out that at the Conference at Atlantic City,,our representatives had been authorised to approve contributions toUNRRA at the rate of 1 per cent, of national income; but thatthe question of how relief in ex-enemy territories or in the militaryperiod should be financed bad not been clearly defined. It wastherefore possible that the attitude which we had now taken upwould be regarded as, in a technical sense, inconsistent with theresolutions recorded at the Conference.After a short discussion the War Cabinet Endorsed the view set out in W.P. (44) 38 that the figureof  80 million, or 1 per cent, of our national income, mustbe regarded as the maximum United Kingdom contribu-tion to relief in all areas and at all times, and took notewith approval of the Memorandum by the Minister ofState.
Officer experts were attached to the fighting commands, and othersin the rear of the battle areas were available for posting whereverrequired. These officers now enjoyel an authority which they hadnot formerly possessed.General agreement was expressed with the view that themeasures now in operation were on sound lines and were wellcalculated to prevent unnecessary damage to monuments and worksof art.The second point discussed was the steps which should be takento deal with the post-war problem created by the looting ordestruction of works of art and of valuable properties by theGermans. This was a Large and difficult subject, and it wasgenerally agreed that use could probably be made to good advantageof the services of a body of experts in this country. As was pointedout in the paper by the Secretary of State for War, steps hadalready been taken to enlist a panel of authorities on the fine arts,whose advice could be called for in cases of special difficulty.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) The measures described to the War Cabinet for preventingunnecessary damage to monuments and works of art interritories entered by our forces were generallyapproved.(2) The Secretary of State for War was asked to arrange, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor, for a fullexplanation of these measures to be given to thesignatories of the memorandum appended to the DeputyPrime Ministers Note.(3) The Secretary of State for War was also invited to considerthe best means of making use of the services of anadvisory body of art experts in this country, inconnection with the post-war problem arising out ofthe looting and destruction by the enemy of works ofart, &amp;c.St. John&apos;s 3.   Arising out of the preceding minute, the War Cabinet wereChurch, Smith informed that it was understood that there was a proposal to pullSquare. down this church (which had suffered bomb damage) and to sell thesite. The Prime Minister expressed the strong view that the churchshould be restored and that considerable pressure should be exercisedto prevent the destruction of this building.This view was warmly endorsed by the War Cabinet.Meeting withDominionPrimeMinisters.4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (44) 12) reportingthat in the absence of some unexpected development it could nowsafely be assumed that the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia,New Zealand and South Africa would arrive in the first week ofMay, and suggesting that consideration should be given to thequestion whether it was desirable that any preliminary memorandashould be prepared and what briefs should be prepared for theassistance of United Kingdom Ministers at the meeting.The first point dealt with was attendance at the Conference.The meeting was not a full Imperial Conference, but a meeting ofUnited Kingdom and Dominion Prime Ministers. Arrangementswere being made separately for the Indian representatives of theWar Cabinet to be available in London so that they could take partin any discussions on special subjects affecting India. The questionof attendance of the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia wasraised. After discussion the War Cabinet decided that it wouldbe desirable to give the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia anopportunity of being present at the time of these discussions, whilemaking it clear that he would not be attending on the same basisas the Dominion Prime Ministers. . An invitation should not,however, be extended to Newfoundland.
The second point dealt with was the preparation of papers forthe assistance of United Kingdom Ministers. The Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs suggested that no briefs wouldpresumably be needed on international policy and post-war settle-ment which would be dealt with by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, but he thought that memoranda would be requiredon certain subjects, e.g., closer co-operation in the Empire, on whichhe undertook to circulate a paper.The Minister of Labour and National Service enquired whetherpreliminary study could be given to the future defence of the Empireand a budgetary contribution.The Prime Minister thought it would be preferable for anymove in this matter to come from the Dominions rather than fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. He added thatwe should be at pains to make it clear that the note of the meetingwas to be an effort to establish still more strongly, closely andrecognisably the unity of the structure of the Commonwealth andof the Empire.The War Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in the paper by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (44) 12) as to thosewho should be invited to the Meeting, subject to themodification that the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia should be invited to be in London at the timeof the discussions, on the understanding that it shouldbe made clear to him that he would not be attendingon the same basis as the Dominion Prime Ministers, andwould only be present at certain meetings.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsshould convene and preside over a small committee whichshould include the Minister of Labour and NationalService and the Secretaries of State for the Colonies andIndia and the Minister of State, with power to co-optother Ministers or their representatives as necessary, asa Standing Committee to be in session from now untilthe Meeting took place, charged with preparing thematerial for the Meeting and advising the War Cabinetthereon. .Report of 5.   The War Cabinet had before them the report of theCommittee on Committee on Basic English (W.P. (43) 551), which had beenBasic English, appointed at their meeting on the 12th July, 1943 (W.M. (43)(Previous 97th Conclusions), under the chairmanship of the Secretary of StateReference: for India, &quot; to consider whether action should be taken to promoteW.M.(43)97th the spread of Basic English and, if so, to consider a programmeConclusions, of action.   It should be open to the Committee to consider alterna-Minute 3.) fives to Basic English, such as &apos; Essential English.&apos; &quot;The Secretary of State for India said that the Committee hadhad to deal with two main questions, the first the best method ofteaching ordinary English as such, the second the value of BasicEnglish as a self-contained international language.As regards the first of these matters, they were not satisfiedthat Basic English represented the best initial- preparation forpeople who were anxious to learn literary English, and they did notfeel justified in making any recommendation that would prejudicethe excellent work done by other methods aimed at leading moredirectly to idiomatic and colloquial English. In their view thechoice of methods most suitable for this could well be left to theEducation Authorities of the countries concerned, private bodiesor Institutes abroad, and to the individual student.As regards the second point, the Committee, on the other hand,were satisfied that there was an important field for the development
of an auxiliary international language such as was provided byBasic English and a still greater potential value. The use to whichBasic English might be put in Colonial Administrations with avariety of local languages was obvious.The practical steps which in the view of the Committee shouldbe taken to encourage development of Basic English as an auxiliary,original and international language were those set out in para-graph 15 of the report of the Committee.The Secretary of State for India drew particular attention torecommendation 15 (c) that substantial financial assistance shouldbe given to the Orthological Institute through the appropriateMinistry. He added that he was not in a position to suggest aspecified amount. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that thequestion of which Department should cany the expenditure alsorequired consideration.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) The recommendations of the report as summarised inparagraph 15 were approved in principle.(2) On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, it was agreedthat, subject to a further scrutiny of the report fromthe point of view of its suitability for communicationto the United States (a) a copy should be sent by the Secretary of State forIndia through the Foreign Office and the StateDepartment to Mr. Cordell Hull;(&amp;) a copy should also be sent by the Prime Ministerunder cover of a personal letter to PresidentRoosevelt.(3) The Secretary of State for India, as Chairman of theMinisterial Committee, was invited to arrange, asrecommended in paragraph 18 of the Report of theCommittee on Basic English for an inter-departmentalCommittee to be convened, comprising representativesof the Government Departments concerned, to considerthe preliminary action to be taken on the recommenda-tions in the Committee&apos;s report.(4) Note was taken in this connection that no estimate of theextent of the financial assistance required was yetavailable, and that the question of which Departmentshould assume responsibility for this expenditure hadnot yet been settled.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
