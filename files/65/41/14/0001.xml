Party Truce in       1.   The War Cabinet had a discussion about the Party TruceBye-Elections, in relation to Bye-Elections.   The discussion is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Man-Power and      2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theRelated Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 52) giving the detailedQuestions. allocations  settled,   under  the supervision  of  the  MinisterialMan-Power Committee on Man-Power, for the industries and services inAllocations for Groups II and III, other than those industries for which detailedIndustries and allocations had already been made.Services in yAe Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the MinisterialGroups II and Qommittee had made a full enquiry, and were satisfied that theIII m 1944. allocations proposed were the best that could be made within the(Previous existing limitations.   The Ministers concerned had been consultedReference: an(C^ although it had not been possible to meet all their points, theW.M. (43) 164tnpr0pOSais in the Memorandum had been generally accepted.Conclusions.) -j,^ fwiowjng points were made in discussion : (a) The Minister of War Transport pointed out that, since theallocations had been made, he had found it necessary to ask for9,000 additional workers to meet the demands on transport in thenext six months.(b) The Secretary of State for War said that the allocation forWar Office industrial staffs fell far short of War Office require-ments. He would, of course, do the best he could with the allocationsproposed, but it would be necessary to have recourse to the emergencymachinery recently approved by the Cabinet to meet urgent &quot; Over-lord &quot; requirements for which staff could not be provided withinthe allocations.(c) The Minister of Food pointed out that since he had acceptedthe allocation for food manufacture, there had been a very largeincrease in the military demands for canned meat.(d) The Minister of A gricidture and Fisheries emphasised theserious effect which the proposed allocation would have on agricul-turai production in 1944. He recalled that an additional 700,000acres had been ploughed up and that he hadbeen asked to increasethe acreage of potatoes to over 1 million. If it were not possibleto meet a very much higher proportion of his requirements, he wouldbe compelled to reduce the acreage of potatoes and there would alsohave to be some reduction in the output of milk. The MinisterialCommittee had suggested that his difficulties might be met by theemployment of additional prisoners of war, but there was noprospect of his getting a sufficient number of prisoners to make upthe difference between his requirements and the allocation proposed.It was pointed out that the shortage of agricultural workerswas not large when compared with the total number of workers inthe industry, and that to some extent the demand for additionalworkers was designed to enable the working week to be reduced, ameasure which could; hardly be justified at the present time.The Prime Minister said that he accepted the warning givenby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, but that he hoped thathe would do everything possible to keep production at the highestlevel with the resources available to him.(e) Reference was made to the risk that, if, result ofsecurity measures in connection with &quot; Overlord,&quot; the movement ofworkers to and from Ireland was interrupted, the difficulties of theAgricultural Departments in maintaining production would beincreased. The Prime Minister said that this matter clearlyrequired careful examination; and that any difficulties in regardto it should be brought to the Committee, under his chairmanship,on &quot; Overlord &quot; preparations.
The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the allocation proposed in the Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 52).(2) Agreed that any necessary adjustments in the allocationsto meet emergency conditions should be dealt with by theMinister of Production and the Minister of Labour andNational Service under the scheme approved by the WarCabinet on the 24th January, any points of difficultywhich emerged, being referred to&apos; the Committee on&quot; Overlord &quot; Preparations presided over by the PrimeMinister.Employment of 3. The War Cabinet then considered the Memoranda by thePrisoners of Lord President of the Council (W.P. (44) 36) and by the MinisterWar in the 0f Agriculture and Fisheries (W.P. (44) 44) on the employment ofUnited prisoners of war in the United Kingdom.Kingdom.(Previous       General Policy.Eeference: jyie Prime Minister said that he agreed generally that nothingW.M. (43) 128th would be gained by bringing additional Italian prisoners into thisConclusions,     country at this stage of the war if this led to substantial demandsMmute 1.)      on materials and labour for building new camps and hostels toaccommodate them.    He suggested, however, that it might bepossible to do more than the Lord President^ Memorandumcontemplated in the way of using existing! accommodation.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that under theGeneva Convention we were bound to provide for Italian prisonersof war the same standard of accommodation as for our own troops.The War Cabinet took the view that our general policy shouldbe to bring as many Italian prisoners as possible to this country, andthat the Minister of War Transport should not regard himself asrestricted to the figure of 32,500 mentioned in the Lord Presidentspaper.Allocation.With reference to paragraph 7 of the Memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries (W.P. (44) 44) the LordPresident of the Council pointed out that paragraph 7 (a) of hisMemorandum (W.P. (44) 36) was not meant to imply that theDepartments possessing available accommodation should necessarilyhave the prisoners.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries referred to what hehad said about the effect on agricultural production of the allocationof labour given by the Ministerial Committee on Man-Power.Whereas the Ministerial Committee had suggested that it mightbe possible to ease the position by the use of Italian prisoners ofwar, the Agricultural Departments had been allocated only 8,600out of 32,500 prisoners of Avar who were likely to be available. Hewas satisfied that he could find accommodation for additionalprisoners, and he emphasised again that unless a considerable partof the deficiency in labour was met by the allocation of additionalprisoners, there would be a serious fall in output.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theallocation of Italian prisoners of war had been made by aCommittee of Officials convened by the Ministry of Labour. Hepromised to look into the possibility of varying the allocation witha view to increasing the numbers available for the AgriculturalDepartments.Conditions of Employment.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply askedwhether steps could not be taken to enable more profitable use to bemade of Italian prisoners of war already in this country by giving
them incentives to work harder and by relaxing present restrictionson their movements.The Secretary of State for War said that he thought that therewould be considerable difficulty in doing this, but that he wouldexamine the point in consultation with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) For the time being the Minister of War Transport shouldbring as many Italian prisoners as possible to thiscountry, and should not regard himself as restricted tothe figure of 32,500.(2) At this stage of the war we should not use material andlabour in building new camps and hostels for Italianprisoners; but Departments should try to make themaximum use of existing accommodation.(3) Note was taken that the Minister of Labour and NationalService would examine the possibility of increasing thenumber of prisoners allocated to the AgriculturalDepartments.(4) Note was taken that the Secretary of State for War, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, would examine whether means could be foundto make more profitable use of the labour of Italianprisoners.Government 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theBuilding        Minister of Production (W.P. (44) 42) setting out the proposedProgramme.    labour allocations for the Government Building Programme for the(Previous       six months January-June 1944,   The Minister explained that heReference:      proposed to take stock of the situation in three months&apos; time.W.M. (43) 142nd      The following points were made in discussion :  Conclusions, ^ Thg Secretary of State for Air said that the Minister ofMinute 7.) Production had allocated 14,000 men to the Air Ministry formaintenance. This was based on the number of men employed onmaintenance by the Air Ministry in the previous summer, at a timewhen the number of men on maintenance had been reduced to anabnormally low level in order to employ as many men as possibleon new construction. Further, 100 new airfields were now in useand this called for a larger maintenance force.(b) The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the Admiralty&apos;sallocation represented a cut of over 11 per cent. Furthermore, sincethis cut had been proposed, there had been new operational demandscalling for 1,500 men. He also thought that when.&quot; Overlord &quot;started it would be necessary to have a pool of 30O or 400 menavailable to make good damage from enemy air attacks atembarkation points.The Minister of Production said that he thought this shouldbe dealt with under the emergency arrangements which had beenapproved by the War Cabinet.(c) The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supplysaid that &quot; Phoenix &quot; was now occupying not 14,000 but 20,000 men.On the other hand, the number of men employed on &quot; Ministry ofSupply (Other Works) &quot; was not 30,000 but 26,000 men. As a result,arrears of urgent work under this head were accumulating. Hethought it would be verv difficult to reduce the allocation for&quot; Ministry of Supply (Other Works) &quot; from 30,000 to 29,000 inJune next, as proposed by the Minister of Production.The Prime Minister said the points raised in discussion couldappropriately be taken into account iii the adjustments whichinevitably had to be made in a matter of this kind. In his viewthe Minister of Production^ proposed allocations should beapproved.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)10thConclusions,Minute 5.)
fitThe War Cabinet-(1) Approved the allocations of building labour set out in the-Memorandum by the Minister of Production.(2) Agreed that any necessary adjustments in the allocations,to meet emergency conditions, should be dealt withby the Minister of Production and the Minister ofLabour and National Service under the scheme approvedby the War Cabinet on the 24th January, any points ofdifficulty which emerged being referred to the Committeeon &quot; Overlord &quot; Preparations presided over by the PrimeMinister.Building 5.   In connection with the preceding item, the War CabinetProgramme. had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of ProductionRequirements (W.P. (44) 43) asking whether provision should be made for certainfor building proposals put forward by the Ministry of Aircraft&quot; Crossbow &quot;   Production in relation to &quot; Crossbow.&quot;Dispersals. After a short discussion the War Cabinet reached the followingconclusions : (1) The proposal to erect the six reserve factories, in the formof prefabricated hangars, referred to in Annex I (a) ofW.P. (44) 43 should not be proceeded with.(2) Authority was given for the following : (a) the proposal to proceed more quickly, on accountof &apos;&quot;&apos; Crossbow,&quot; with the erection of three radiovalve factories which formed part of a long-termexpansion of the radio valve industry;(b) certain  smaller  extensions  and modifications  ofexisting buildings, for which labour would befound from the Ministry of Aircraft Production^bulk allocation.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,1st February, 1944.
