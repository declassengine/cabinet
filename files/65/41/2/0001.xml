9 W.M. 2 (44).Jute Supplies. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (44) 1) calling attention to the long-term position of jute supplies. The present view of the Govern-ment of India was that the same acreage should be licensed forplanting in 1944 as in 1943. This was estimated to yield8 - 5 million bales, whereas the estimated requirements for the year1944-45 (including allowances for liberated territories in Europeand the Far East) were 10-5 million bales. Little relief could beexpected from reducing stocks or using alternative material. Thedifficulty of increasing the acreage to be licensed was that this couldonly be done at the expense of rice production. In the circumstancesthe Minister suggested that the best plan was to consider, with theGovernment of India, steps to ensure that the acreage licensed wasactually planted.Points in discussion :  (a) If Burma and Malaya were not liberated during the year1944/45, 0-6 million bales of the total estimated require-ments for that year would not be needed.(6) It was suggested that the European territories at presentoccupied by Germany, who were at present obliged touse substitutes, could continue to do without jute for atime after their liberation.On the other band it was pointed out that any actionwhich had the effect of promoting the use of substitutesfor jute would be likely to have an adverse effect on thepost-war economy of Bengal.(c) It was suggested that the failure to plant with jute during1943 the total acreage licensed for planting was probablydue partly to the unpleasant nature of the crop andpartly to the high price of rice.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that jute andrice were not always competitive crops. Over large areaswinter paddy could be groAvn in the same year as jute, asa follow-on crop. Mr. Casey undertook, after his arrivalin Bengal, to find out whether this had been taken intoaccount in calculating the acreage which it would bepossible to license for planting with jute.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal contained in the Memorandum bythe Minister of Production.India. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theAppointment Secretary of State for India (W.P. (43) 590) as to what should beof New done when the normal term of office of Sir Jeremy Raisman, theFinance present Finance Member of the Viceroy!s Executive Council, cameMember. to an end in April 1944.  Attached to the memorandum was a tele-gram by Lord Wavell. who thought that Sir Jeremy Raisman&apos;ssuccessor should be an Indian, and recommended the appointmentof Sir R. Mudaliar. The Secretary of State for India stronglysupported this proposal.The following views were put forward by the Secretary of Statefor India and other Ministers in support of the course proposed.(a) It was no longer necessary that the Finance Member shouldbe an expert. What was required was rather a FinanceMinister, capable of weighing the advice of his experts,and having come to his conclusion, of convincing his-colleagues.(6) This was in accord with the general tendency whereby theViceroy&apos;s Council was ceasing to be a small Council ofexpert officials and was becoming something much morelike a Cabinet, overwhelmingly Indian, of men chosen for; lw; their general political and administrative ability but notresponsible (as in this country) to the Legislature.
(c) Any Finance Member sent out from this country would findit more difficult than an Indian to get acceptance of themeasures required to meet the present financial situation,or, later on, to negotiate the agreement on outstandingfinancial issues between the Government of India andthe British Treasury.(d) Difficulty had been encountered in finding a suitable Britishcandidate. Any Finance Member who was connectedwith the Bank of England would be suspected of tryingto defend British financial interests. On the other hand,it should be possible to find an expert from this countrysuitable to act as Adviser to Sir R. Mudaliar.(e) It was dangerous to continue to withhold key posts fromIndians. Moreover, the fact that a man of SirR. Mudaliar&apos;s undoubted qualities was available affordedan opportunity of making an appointment which wouldgive great satisfaction to that section of Indian publicopinion which did not take its views from the politicalparties.This view was opposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The following were the main points made by the Chancellor of theExchequer, and by other Ministers who shared his view : (./) The situation which the Finance Member of the Viceroy&apos;sExecutive Council had to face was one of extremedifficulty. It was of the utmost importance to appointthe best man who could be found. Nobody in India hadthe necessary qualifications.(g) The proposal that the Finance Member should be appointedfor his political ability and that he should rely on thehelp of an expert adviser did not meet the case. Thispoint was specially emphasised by those with experienceof Indian administration.(h) His Majesty&apos;s Government had a direct responsibility forIndian finance which had repeatedly been acknowledged,and we could not afford to stand aside and see adangerous situation develop.(i) The recent Debate in the House of Commons on the foodsituation in India (a matter within the responsibility ofthe Indian Provincial Governments) had shown thatParliament would not lightly absolve His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of responsibility for the shortcomings ofIndian administration.(j) India was to be the base for very important operations.The extent to which India could carry this burden wouldlargely depend on how the financial situation washandled.(Jc) At the present time there was a Congress majority on theBoard of the Reserve Bank of India. An-^ftgwsooIndian had recently been appointed to be Governor ofthe Bank. The appointment of an Indian as FinanceMember at this juncture would result in an undue riskthat finance questions would be settled result ofstrong political pressure.(I) Indian public opinion would readily accept the appoint-ment of someone from this country as Finance Member,provided that a man of acknowledged and outstandingqualifications was appointed. In this connection theChancellor of the Exchequer said that he hoped to beable to put forward some further names.(to) Once an Indian had been appointed as Finance Member,it would be virtually impossible again to appoint to thispost someone from this country. But there was nocertainty that a man of Sir R. Mudaliar&apos;s qualitieswould always be available.(n) If a suitable man could not be found at the moment, itwould be worth while to give further consideration to
11W.M. 2 (44).the extension of Sir Jeremy F aisman&apos;s term of office for... . a further year. In this connection the War Cabinetwere informed that the Prime Minister had sent atelegram, saying that he thought it would be a gravemistake to appoint an Indian as Finance Minister untilwe knew how we stood about the.sterling balances, andthat he hoped his colleagues would consider the extensionof Sir Jeremy Raisman&apos;s term for another year.(o) Discussion followed as to whether certain phrases inLord WavelFs telegram (the &quot;transfer of financialresponsibility in this country to Indian hands cannot bepostponed indefinitely &quot;), and in the Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum (&quot; demonstrate the sincerity of our desireto see India governed by Indians and in India&apos;sinterests &quot;), implied that the appointment of an Indianto be Finance Member was a constitutional change andwas being urged on that account. There was generalagreement among Ministers that no constitutionalchange was in question. The appointment of an Indianas Finance Member would, however, be a furtherimportant step in the process of Indianisation of theViceroy&apos;s Council, which would inevitably have someeffect, on the growth of convention.The Deputy Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, saidthat it was clear that the predominant view of the War Cabinetwas not in favour of the appointment at this juncture of an Indianas Finance Member.The War Cabinet-Accordingly invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and.the Secretary of State for India to consider whether theycould suggest the names of persons in. thio country suitablefor this appointment; or, alternatively, whether theywould wish to recommend the extension of Sir JeremyRaisman&apos;s term for a further year.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State forWar (W.P. (44) 3) setting out the steps that had been taken for theplanning of the administration of Malaya and Borneo afterreoccupation, and outlining some of the problems to be faced indetermining the future system. It was suggested that a CabinetCommittee should be appointed to consider the matter in detail andrecommend a directive on which the Planning Authorities couldwork.The War Cabinet decided to appoint for this purpose a Com-mittee composed as follows : The Lord President of the Council (Chairman).The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The Secretary of State for India.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for War.The Attorney-General.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.4. The &quot;War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (44) 4) proposing, by agree-ment with the Secretary of State for War, that a West Indian con-tingent should be moved to serve with the Central MediterraneanForce as soon as possible after April 1944.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the sendingof a West Indian contingent to a theatre of war would be warmly
welcomed by all the Caribbean Colonies, whose inhabitants had beendisappointed at having no opportunity of taking any active part inthe war. The numbers involved were only about 1,000.The Minister of War Transport said that, having regard tothe small numbers involved, he did not anticipate any difficultyin providing British-controlled ships for the proposed movement.It would not, therefore, be necessary, as suggested in the Secretaryof State&apos;s Memorandum, to approach the Combined Chiefs of Staffin order that American shipping might be made available.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed in principle that a West Indian contingent shouldbe moved to serve with the Central Mediterranean Forceas soon as possible after April 1944.(ii) Took note that the detailed arrangements for the transportof the contingent would be worked out in consultationbetween the Colonial Office, War Office, and the Ministryof War Transport.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Qth January, 1944.
