At their meeting on the 11th February the War Cabinethad appointed a Committee to determine, in the light of thediscussion in the War Cabinet, the attitude to be taken by UnitedKingdom officials in the forthcoming discussions with official repre-sentatives of the Dominions and India.The War Cabinet now had before them a report by thisCommittee (W.P. (44) 121). This document contained a report fromthe majority of the Committee, to which was appended draftinstructions to the United Kingdom officials on particular issues,and a minority report signed by the Lord Privy Seal.Considerable discussion took place on three main issues. Thefirst of these was the proposed International Monetary Fund. Onthis, the main point dealt with was the probable effect of this Fundon the continuance of the main features of the sterling area.The second issue considered was Imperial Preference. Onthis, the view was expressed by some Ministers that great careshould be taken to avoid giving any indication that we were readyto see reductions in Imperial Preference, unless and until it wasclear that the Americans would be willing to make substantialreductions in their tariffs. The view was also expressed that theAmericans were unlikely in the event to make such reductions.There was general agreement, however, that the word &apos;&apos; expedient&apos;&apos;should be substituted for the words &apos;&apos; worth while &apos;&apos; in the formulaat the top of page 3 of the Committee&apos;s Report (W.P. (44) 121).The third issue on which discussion took place was the positionof agriculture under the provisions of the proposed CommercialUnion.At the end of the discussion the Prim,e Minister said that hethought that it would be desirable that the War Cabinet shouldhave an opportunity for further consideration of these mattersbefore recording conclusions. At the same time, he thought thatthere would be no objection to the report of the Committee, togetherwith the instructions appended thereto, being given to the UnitedKingdom officials who were taking part in the discussions with the* Memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 102 and 109).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 119).Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P (44) 126).
Dominion and Indian Representatives, which had now begun, as ageneral guide to the lines on which the discussions should beconducted, provided it was clearly understood that the report didnot carry with it the authority of the War Cabinet, and that thesematters would be further discussed by the War Cabinet in the nearfuture.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,23rd February, 1944.
