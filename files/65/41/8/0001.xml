THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was sorry tohave been away for so long from this country.     But itso happened that his stay in North Africa had enabledhim to have some very useful conferences with theCommanders-in-Chief in the Mediterranean Theatre.These had helped to bring about a satisfactory conclusionof a number of matters upon which the forthcomingoperations in the Mediterranean depended.     The U.S.Authorities had been very helpful, and all thenecessary arrangements for operation SHINGLE had nowbeen made.In view of these impending operations, hethought it was undesirable to make any statement inParliament in the near future on the military situation.Reference was made to the fact that theGermans had occupied several of the islands off theDalmatian coast.THE PRIME MINISTER s aid that when operationSHINGLE was over, operations ought to be carried outfor the capture of some of these islands.     We oughtnot to allow Yugoslavia to be sealed off.Op^-ation SHINGLEConference with THE PRIME MINISTER had had long talks withGeneral de Gaulle       General de Gaulle in the presence of Mr. Duff Cooper.He had taken the opportunity of taking General deGaulle to task for not conducting matters in a waywhich would lead   to early and friendly relations,particularly with the U.S.A.The Prime Minister said that the positionof General de Gaulle, vis-a-vis the French NationalCommittee was now greatly altered.     The FrenchCommittee of National Liberation was now by no means aone-man show and contained some new and powerfulelements, although General de Gaulle was the biggestfigure on it.Turkey The Prime Minister referred to the positionin regard to Turkey.     He understood that the Turkswere now refusing to agree that we should send in the1,200 experts (this was the latest figure which had been(ft agreed upon) unless we met all their armament demands,1 which were impossibly high.     The Prime Minister addedthat if this position continued, the matter would haveto be put very bluntly to President Inoneu.Argentine Brief reference was made to the Argentine.Some of the difficulties of the situation, e.g. on thesupply side were explained.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it wasimportant that we should try so to handle matters thatMOST SECRET &quot;RECORD OF DISCUSSION AT WAR CABINET:W. M. (44). 8th Ccnclusiena.(18th January, 1944 - 12.15 p.ra. )

the United States did not withdraw their Ambassadorwhile we took no parallel action.  &apos;  THE FOREIGNSECRETARY said that we were using all our endeavoursto see that the Americans did not take any such actionuntil the consequences had been fully examined.PcCplnd and Russia Reference was made to the very difficultposition between Poland and Russia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would considerthe matter and would see if he could take any actionwhich would be of help.The view was expressed that the U.S.S.R.would be putting themselves in a false position if theytook the line that it was for their Government to saywhat personalities should or should not be included inthe Governments of other countries.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that a number ofParliamentary Questions on the relations betweenPoland and Russia had been put down for answer on thefollowing day.     So many questions had been put downthat he thought it was impossible to ask that they bewithdrawn.     He proposed to deal with them by a singlegeneral statement, the text of which he would showlater to the Prime Minister.Baltic States THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the Cabinetshould have a discussion in the near future about theBaltic States.,     He did not suggest that we shouldvolunteer any public statements on the Baltic States,but our hands in the position might easily be forced.His own views on the matter had changed considerably.Italy. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was sure weshould stand by the King of Italy and Marshal Badogliountil Rome had been captured.     It was interesting tonote that M. Vishinsky had expressed the lowest opinionof Counts Sforza and Groce.Italian Ships No reply had been received from Presidentfor Russia Roosevelt to telegram No. 545 containing an alternativeproposal as to the best way of meeting the Russiandemand that certain Italian ships should be handed overto them.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this telegramcontained a proposal that we should lend the Russiansone of our older battleships, the Royal Sovereign, whichhad recently completed a refit in the U.S.A.Germany THE PRIME MINISTER said that recent secretintelligence showed that Hitler1s position was stillvery strong.      If operation OVERLORD did not achieveconsiderable success, many people would no doubt startobjecting to the demand for unconditional surrender.

3 3The Prime Minister said that in his viewunconditional surrender meant that the enemy&apos;s willhad been broken, and that it was not thereafter possiblefor the enemy to claim we had no right to imposeparticular terms or treatment.     The question whetherthe terms imposed were in accordance with the AtlanticCharter was a question for the Allies to settle.CROSSBOW THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF gave the PrimeMinister an account of the degree of success obtainedby bombing attacks on ski sites.     Of 94 identifiedsites about 20 had received Category &apos;A&apos;  and about 30Category &apos;B&apos; damage.     The space occupied by thebuildings on these sites was very small indeed;    andthey were very difficult to damage.After some further discussion:The Chiefs of Staff were invited to pre-pare a report showing the military advantagesand disadvantages of using gas against skisites in the event of the attacks on thiscountry based on these sites becoming toodamaging.     Moral and political considerationsshould not be taken into account in preparingthis report.Operation OVERLORD THE PRIME MINISTER said that when operationOVERLORD was carried out, it might be necessary todivert aircraft from Coastal Command to increase thelift of parachute troops.     This use of Coastal Commandaircraft might be vital to the battle, and it might,therefore, be necessary to ask for aircraft to bediverted from anti-U-boat warfare, even although suchdiversions would result in increased sinkings.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthere would in any case be a substantial risk ofsinkings during OVERLORD, since it would be necessarygreatly to reduce the number of escort vessels witheach oonv:y.THE PRIME MINISTER was infoi-med that the planfor OVERLORD attack had not yet been finally settled.General Montgomery was keen that the attack should takeplace   on a wider front.Reconstruction T5ae War Cabinet was informed that a good deal&quot; of progress had been made with post-war.:reconstruction.( \ The scheme for demobilisation had been re-cast andwould shortly be resubmitted to the Cabinet.     DraftWhite Papers v/ere being prepared dealing withcomprehensive medical services, social service schemes,workmen&apos;s compensation, employment after the war, and&quot;Uthwatt&quot;.     All these would, of course, be submittedto the Cabinet in draft.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
