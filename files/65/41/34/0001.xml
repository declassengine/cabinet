The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.As the weather and moon had been unfavourable for nightattacks on Germany, Bomber Command had attacked two railwaycentres in France. &apos; -United States heavy bombers had made two heavy daylightattacks on targets in the Berlin area, during the second of whichthere was no enemy fighter opposition. The Allied ExpeditionaryAir Forces had attacked &quot;Crossbow&quot; and railway targets inFrance. Coastal Command aircraft had sighted 16 U-boats,attacked 10 and sunk 1. Off Holland 3 merchant vessels hadprobably been torpedoed.In the Mediterranean 7,400 sorties were made as opposed to anestimated enemy total of 600. Railway targets, ports and airfieldshad been attacked. Twenty-four enemy aircraft had been destroyedand 12 probably destroyed for the loss of 38 of our aircraft. Astrong enemy attack by 50 aircraft on a convoy off Algiers had beendriven off by fighters, who had shot down 4. A good attack hadbeen carried out on Toulon.The main targets had been airfields and railways. Animportant airborne troop-carrying operation had been carried out.Approximately 7,500 men with equipment and animals had beenlanded in Burma in the rear of enemy positions. During supportingoperations 60 enemy aircraft had been destroyed on the ground.Confirmed shipping losses by enemy action during the week,including belated reports, amounted to 26,300 tons. A convoy from.North Russia had returned without loss, 5 U-boats having been sunkduring its passage. The escort-carrier Chaser had accounted for2 of these U-boats and had assisted in the sinking of a third.During this year seven convoys had reached Russia, carrying justunder a million tons of cargo. Our coastal forces had been activeoff the coast of Holland and had inflicted damage on the enemy onseveral nights.Our submarines had scored successes against Axis shipping offthe South coast of France and in the iEgean.Bad weather had interfered with our unloading operations atAnzio in the early part of the week, but over 7,000 tons had beenunloaded on the 10th and 11th. There had been no losses by enemyair action off the beachhead.The Russians had had a most successful week over the wholeof the Southern front and were driving towards the River Dniesteron a very broad front. Very important captures of material hadbeen made in the advance from Uman. There were no signs of an .enemy withdrawal from the Crimea. There had been littlemovement on the Northern front.Two Chinese Divisions and two long-range penetration groupswere advancing towards Myitkyina.

Foreign Affairs.Poland.^PreviousReference:W.M.(44)28thConclusions,Minute 1.)Visit ofMr. Stettinius.2. Attention was drawn to a recent article in the Press on theRusso-Polish situation.The Minister of Information undertook to enquire and reportto the War Cabinet what action could be taken to ascertain thesource from which the newspaper had derived the information onwhich this article was founded.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he under-stood that Mr. Stettinius, the United States Under-Secretary ofState, proposed to arrive in this country on his visit on the3rd April. This would be just before Easter Week and would notbe convenient. He thought that we should send a message to saythat it would be more convenient if he could time his visit so thathe would either arrive a little earlier or, say, about a fortnight later.The War Cabinet-Approved this course.Neutral 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that aCountries. request had been received from a Member of Parliament to visitGrant of Travel Turkey. On the 2nd July, 1943, the War Cabinet had laid it downFacilities from that facilities for travel to any neutral country should be withheld,United unless  the  Government were  satisfied that  a  definite publicKingdom. advantage would be served by the journey, or that the applicant(Previous had bona fide domestic business to transact in that country whichReference:        w-as urgent and important and could not be transacted without aW.M.(43) 152nd personal visit; and that these rules should apply to Members ofConclusions,      Parliament in the same way as they applied to other persons.Minute 3;) The Member of Parliament in question had business interestsin Turkey, and it could, therefore, be argued that his case fell withinthe terms of the War Cabinet ruling.On the other hand, it was pointed out that at the presentmoment we were taking all practicable steps to ensure that peopledid not leave this country to visit neutral countries, on securitygrounds No reason was seen for making an exception in favour ofthe present applicant.The War Cabinet-Decided that the application in question should be refused.War Criminals.(PreviousReference:W:M. (43) 152ndConclusions,Minute 7.)4. On the 10th November the War Cabinet had had beforethem a Memorandum by the Prime Minister (WP. (43) 496) aboutthe punishment of war criminals. In this Memorandum the PrimeMinister had pointed out that the Joint Declaration on Atrocitiessigned in Moscow would result in a large number of lesser warcriminals being handed over to the Sovereign States against whomtheir outrages had been committed. It remained to deal with themajor war criminals. He had suggested that the United Nationsshould prepare a single list of major war criminals who would bedeclared outlaws and might be put to death without trial on fallinginto the hands of the Armed Forces.The War Cabinet had invited the Lord Chancellor, theAttorney-General and the Minister of Aircraft Production toredraft the Prime Minister&apos;s Memorandum on the basis that(a) Quislings were excluded from the scope of the proposal; (&amp;) anyperson in the suggested list of major war criminals coming into thehands of the Armed Forces of the United Nations should be seizedand held pending a decision by the United Nations as to their fate.The War Cabinet now had before them a, Note by theSecretary of the War Cabinet (W.P. (44) 105) circulating theformula proposed by the three Ministers.The Prime Minister, in reviewing the position, said that hegreatly hoped that the list of the 50 or 100 most prominent warcriminals would be&apos;drawn up.  The compilation of such a list would
UnconditionalSurrender.5.   The War Cabinet had before them- (a) A Memorandum by the Prime Minister (W.P. (44) 33).(b) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (44) 125), to which was appended thedraft of a declaration which might, if approved, beissued in the name of the Prime Minister, PresidentRoosevelt and Premier Stalin.(c) A Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (44) 83).The Prime Minister said that the question for decision waswhether anything further could wisely be said on &apos;&apos; unconditionalsurrender.&quot; It was relevant that there were signs of criticisms fromsome quarters of the House of Commons on the ground that wewere not adhering strictly to the principles of the Atlantic Charter.That criticism was based on some recent remarks of his own aboutthe transfer of territory.   But we had never bound ourselves totend to make a gulf between them and the ordinary people of theenemy countries. On reflection, he still felt that there was muchto be said for the summary execution of the persons on that listwhen they fell into our hands, rather than to announce that it wasour intention to keep them in confinement until the United Nationshad decided on their fate.The Lord Chancellor said that the redraft which had beencirculated (W.P. (44) 105) referred specifically to the three-PowerDeclaration made at Moscow. That Declaration had set out theprocedure for dealing with war crimes committed in occupiedterritories, and had concluded with the statement that it waswithout prejudice to the case of enemy criminals whose offenceshad no particular geographical location and who would be punishedby a joint decision of the Governments of the Allies. The presentdraft was intended to extend the last paragraph of this Declarationand to round off the arrangements embodied in it. Furthermore, therevised draft negatived the idea that those criminals would be dealtwith by ordinary processes of law, and made it clear that theywould be kept under control until a decision as to their fate wasreached by the United Nations.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that in W.P. (44)105 the only charge which was levelled against &quot; the inner ring ofpolitical leaders &quot; was their responsibility for the barbarous wayin which the war had been conducted. Surely an even greatercharge was their direct personal responsibility in having conspiredagainst world peace.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security addedthat there was the further charge of evil practices against certainraces and their perversion of justice.He agreed with the Prime Minister that any arrangementwhich would have the effect of leaving war criminals in the custodyof the United Nations, pending a decision as to their fate, might behighly embarrassing. .After further discussion, the Prime Minister said that hethought there would be advantages in ascertaining the views of theUnited States and of the Russians on how the major war criminalsshould be dealt with. He asked the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to consider whether he thought the present was a suitablemoment to take this step.He also suggested that the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and the Minister of Aircraft Production should be invitedto give further consideration to the draft formula and to preparean alternative version in the light of the discussion which had takenplace. \The War Cabinet Approved the course proposed by the Prime Minister.
Civil Aviation.Commonwealthand EmpireConference onRadio.((-PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 146thConclusions,Minute; 3.)apply the terms of the Atlantic Charter to ex-enemy countries. Forexample, it was impossible, in his judgment, to deny the right of theUnited Nations to make territorial changes in the Reich. Thatwas a strong argument for holding to the term &quot; unconditionalsurrender,&quot; which gave a free hand to the United Nations. Herecognised, on the other hand, the force of the argument that areassurance to the German people that in the event of theirsurrendering they would not be deprived of everything might makeit easier for them to surrender. The draft now before the WarCabinet was designed to test how far we oould go in that direction.He doubted, however, if any real advantage could be gained byattempts at reassurance of this nature at this moment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his draftMemorandum (W.P. (44) 125) had been prepared with a view toseeing how far it was possible to go by way of reassurance. Itshould be borne in mind that reassurance of this nature wasdesigned to be set against the immense propaganda value to whichGoebbels was at the moment turning the anxiety not only of theGerman people but of all enemy or ex-enemy countries in Europeas to the action which would be taken by the victorious Allies.The general view of the War Cabinet, as expressed indiscussion, was that on balance no advantage would be gained bythe adoption of any of the formulae proposed at this time; but thatthe matter might be further considered later. The Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs suggested that the matter might bere-examined when the European Advisory Commission hadexamined the German Armistice terms.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the matter should be re-examined at a laterdate.6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production reporting the conclusions reachedby the Commonwealth and Empire Conference on radio for civilaviation (W.P. (44) 147).The Conference had suggested that the establishment of aworld radio authority for air transport was essential to the achieve-ment of general standardisation of radio for international airtransport, and had recommended an early exchange of views withthe United States and others of the United Nations and continuousCommonwealth and Empire consultation both during and after thepresent war.On the technical side, the Conference had put forward recom-mendations for a complete series of standard radio systems whichwould be available in the immediate post-war period, and had alsosuggested tentative longer-term plans for standard post-warsystems.The Memorandum proposed that immediate technical dis-cussions, based on the recommendations of the Conference, shouldtake place with the United States and with others of the. UnitedNations, and that the technical recommendations of the CbriferehcOshould be remitted to the Radio Board.The War Cabinet agreed .(1) That the proposed discussions with the United States andothers&apos; of the United Nations should be undertaken :action to this end would be taken under the supervisionpf the Committee on Post-War Civil Air Transport. .That the technical recommendations of the Conferenceshould be remitted-to the Radio Board.cesof the *War Cabinet, .S :W. 1,13th March, 1944.
