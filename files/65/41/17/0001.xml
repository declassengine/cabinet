H.B.H. Princess 1. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he hadElizabeth. been in communication with His Majesty The King in regard to thesuggestion which had&quot;been made in some quarters that a title shouldbe conferred on H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth on the occasion of her18th birthday. The Prime Minister asked the War Cabinet toagree that he should tender advice to His Majesty in favour of theissue from Buckingham&quot; Palace in the near future of a short officialannouncement that The King did not contemplate any change inthe style and title of H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth on the occasion ofher approaching 18th birthday.The Prime Minister said he understood that this would be inaccordance with His Majesty&apos;s own wishes in the matter.The King&apos;s Private Secretary would, of course, inform theGovernors-General of the Dominions of the proposed announcementbefore it was made.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed.National Health 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theService. Minister of Reconstruction,  the Minister of Health and&quot; theSecretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (44) 74) regarding the schemefor a National Health Service. Attached to the Memorandum werethe draft of a White Paper on the scheme, and a shorterMemorandum which was to be issued as a Stationery Officepublication.The Minister of Reconstruction explained the main features ofthe scheme, which was the result of many months of work by theWar Cabinet Committees concerned with reconstruction. Therehad been differences of opinion on a number of points, as wasinevitable in the consideration of so extensive and complex aproblem; but the scheme now put forward had the unanimoussupport of the Reconstruction Committee. He sought the authorityof the War Cabinet to publish the documents circulated with theMemorandum, not as representing the Governments final decisionsin this matter, but as a basis for public discussion of the scheme.Points in discussion were : (a) The scheme did not involve the abolition of private medicalpractice. Although the public service would provide free medicaltreatment for all who cared to avail themselves of it, it would beinexpedient to prevent those who so desired from making privatearrangements for treatment. Equally, it would have been wrong toexclude any class of persons from treatment under the public servicemerely on the ground that they could afford to pay for treatment asprivate patients.(b) It must be recognised that the scheme would constitutesome threat to private medical practice-any proposals for theestablishment of a comprehensive medical service must have thateffect.On the other hand, it was pointed out that &quot;the proposals forgrouped practice whether in health centres or otherwise werelikely to lead to increased efficiency among the rank and file of themedical profession.(c) The suggestion was made that the scheme would involve theestablishment of a large bureaucratic machine which, through theproposed Central Medical Board, would determine where eachdoctor should practise.It was pointed-out that, if there was a shortage of doctors andthe State had undertaken to provide a universal service, the Statemust have some power to control the general distribution of doctorsin the public service. The degree of this control was not, however,so drastic as had been suggested.  In the case of separate practice,
Australia- 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theNew Zealand Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (44) 70) about theAgreement of Australia-New Zealand Agreement of the 21st January, 1944.21st January, Attached to the Memorandum was the text of the agreement,19W- together with a telegram on the subject, dated the 25th January,from the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Australia.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs explained that wehad had virtually no prior knowledge of this conference, which wehad thought was intended to be a mutual consultation between thetwo Governments of a preliminary character before consultationwith ourselves and other foreign countries. It was, therefore,perhaps somewhat unfortunate that the two Governments shouldhave published their conclusions without any prior consultationwith us. Nevertheless, on a broad view, he thought that the resultsof the conference might well prove to be useful. In particular, hepointed out that the two Governments had stated publicly that theyhad a primary interest in the defence of the Pacific.The Secretary of State also drew attention to paragraphs 7, 10and 14 of the agreement, in which the two Governments asked forrepresentation on certain bodies, including representation at thehighest level on all armistice planning and executive bodies.   Hefor example, all that was proposed was that the consent of the Boardshould be required before a vacant public practice was filled or anew public practice established; and it was intended that thisconsent should.be withheld only if there were enough or too manydoctors in the area.(d) It was suggested that the scheme was likely to meet withkeen opposition from the doctors, and would be represented asundermining the whole basis of the medical profession.The War Cabinet were informed that, while opinion amongdoctors might be divided, it was likely that the scheme would besupported by a substantial proportion of the profession. It wasalso pointed out that a scheme on somewhat similar lines had beenin operation for over thirty years in the Highlands and Islands ofScotland where it had proved highly beneficial to the population,had increased the efficiency of the service, and had not had the effectof killing private practice.(e) It was suggested that the reference to Sir WilliamBeveridge in the introductory paragraphs in each of the two Papersmight, with advantage, be omitted.This was agreed to.The Prime Minister asked that, in presenting this scheme tothe public, Ministers should stress the fact that it did not represent&apos;the final views of the Government; that it was put forward forpublic discussion and that constructive criticism would bewelcomed; that, when there had been an opportunity for theformation of public opinion, the details would be further discussedwith the medical profession and other interests affected; and thatonly then would the Government proceed in the light of all thesediscussions to formulate their final conclusions and to bring forwardproposals for legislation.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved  on  this  basis  the  scheme  outlined  in  thedocuments attached to W.P. (44) 74.(2) Authorised the presentation of the White Paper to Parlia-ment and the simultaneous publication of the shortermemorandum.&apos;(3) Took note that these documents would be published on the17th February, and that arrangements would be madefor them to be debated in Parliament after an intervalof two or three weeks.
thought that it might be difficult to give effect to such claimswithout giving rise to awkward claims on the part of the UnitedNations generally.The main point dealt with in the course of a preliminarydiscussion was what reply should be returned to the telegram fromthe two Prime Ministers of the 25th January.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toarrange for a reply to be drafted, in consultation with theother Departments concerned, and submitted to the WarCabinet on the broad lines indicated in his Memorandum.This reply would include- a statement to the effect that wetook the view that the matters dealt with by the conferenceWould be suitable for discussion at the forthcomingmeeting in London of Dominion Prime Ministers.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,9th February, 1944.
