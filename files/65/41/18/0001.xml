Miners&apos;  Wages.(PreviousReference:W.M. (42) 79thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Minister of Fuel and Poiver said that a point hadarisen in regard to the Porter Award on which the Governmentwould have to make an immediate statement. Under that awardthe minimum weekly wages of adult underground workers andsurface workers, and of youths under 21, had been increased andnew rates had been laid down for overtime and week-end pay. Hethought that the Government must accept the position thatprovision would be made either directly or indirectly from the CoalCharges Account to meet the cost of this Award, and also of aprevious award dealing with holidays with pay. It would also benecessary that there should be an adjustment of pay in certain casesto remove certain anomalies arising directly from the PorterAward. Otherwise there would, for instance, be cases in which&quot; contractors &quot; would have to pay increases to day wage men intheir gang without receiving corresponding increase themselves.It appeared, however, that negotiations had been started betweenthe mine workers&apos; and mine owners&apos; representatives in certaindistricts (notably in South Wales) for a substantial increase inpiece-work rates, on the understanding that such increases would beaccepted as a charge against the Coal Charges Account.The matter had been discussed in the Lord PresidentsCommittee that morning and it had been agreed that an announce-ment should be made that, while provision should be made from theCoal Charges Account to meet the cost of the Porter Awards, andof any necessary adjustments to meet obvious anomalies arisingdirectly from those awards (e.g.,- in regard to wages of&quot;contractors &quot;), the Government were not prepared to make similarprovision in regard to other wage increases. He thought that, ifthe Government took this line, there was a risk of trouble in SouthWales, and possibly in other districts. The Ministers concerned,however, were satisfied that this risk must be faced. .The Minister of Laboiir and National Service said that heagreed with the views of the Minister of Fuel and Power. Anyfurther concession would have serious consequences of an infla-tionary character.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed; and took note -that theterms of the announcement would be agreed by theMinister of Fuel and Power, in consultation with the LordPresident of the Council and the Chancellor of theExchequer.Seourlty ofPreparations for&quot; Orariord.&quot;(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 10thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Prime Minister referred to the Committee which hadbeen set up under his Chairmanship to deal with preparations forOperation &quot; Overlord.&quot; At the meeting of this Committee held onWednesday, the 9th February, consideration had been given to ascheme for the imposition of a visitors&apos; ban over a coastal belt fromthe Wash to Land&apos;s End and covering certain areas of Scotland.The Prime Minister said that it was of the utmost importancethat due regard should be paid to military security. He thought,however, that consideration should be given to measures to deal withthe matter on a different basis, namely, by preventing any informa-tion passing out of the British Isles. This involved considerationof the facilities enjoyed by the representatives of foreign Govern-ments. He had asked that a Committee consisting of the Ministerof Production (in the Chair), Minister of Aircraft Production andthe Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply shouldbe responsible for the preparation of a report on these measures.But, in view of the wide scope of the measures involved, he thoughtthat representatives of the Foreign Office and of the Home Officeshould be associated with the three Ministers who had been askedto carry out this enquiry.The War Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement. \
National HealthService.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 17thConclusions,Minute 2.)Anglo-AmericanDiscussionsunderArticle YII.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 173rdConclusions,Minute 1.)4. At their meeting on the 21st December the War Cabinethad invited the Minister of State to prepare a note focussing forministerial decision the points arising out of the recent Anglo-American discussions under Article VII of the Mutual AidAgreement, and had asked that the Minister of State should beinformed of any points which Ministers wished to raise on thesubject.The War Cabinet now had before them (a) Two Memoranda by the Minister of State (W.P. (44) 75 andW.P. (44) 81) focussing issues arising out of theWashington conversations and dealing with the pointsraised by individual Ministers.(&amp;) A Memorandum (W.P. (44) 82) by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs recommending that the Censorshipshould be asked to arrange with the Press for theavoidance of all reference to the forthcoming discussionswith the Dominions and India whether on the monetaryor other aspects.(c) A Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 95)criticising the outcome of the Anglo-Americandiscussions under Article VII as representing in effectthe revival of the gold standard issue and pressing fortheir rejection.A general discussion took place on the issues arising out of thepapers before the War Cabinet. A record is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.At the end of the discussion the Prime Minister summed upby saying that the general view of the War Cabinet was in favourof proceeding with a policy generally on the lines discussed atWashington, and as set out in the Minister of State&apos;s Memorandum,although no doubt there would be a number of specific points whichwould require further examination. The main point which hademerged from the morning&apos;s discussion had been the importance ofthis country securing adequate safeguards in respect of thetransitional&apos; period. He thought, too, that those handling thesequestions should not neglect to consider the alternatives which weshould have to adopt if no agreement were reached with the UnitedStates on the lines of the Washington discussions.The Prime Minister added that it was a matter of urgency tosettle the lines which our officials should take in the discussions withrepresentatives of the Dominions and India, which were due tostart on the 21st February. This immediate task should beentrusted to a small committee of Ministers, though it might laterbe found desirable to turn this body into a Standing MinisterialCommittee to consider our post-war financial, economic andcommercial policy in the international field, including generalproblems likely to arise in the transitional period.3. The Prime Minister referred to the discussion on thismatter two days earlier. The matter had, of course, been very fullydiscussed over a long period on the Reconstruction Committee. Theissues involved were, however, very far-reaching, and he had cometo the conclusion that, on the whole, it would be desirable that theyshould be rather more fully discussed than had been possible on theoccasion of the earlier meeting, before a final decision was reachedto publish the White Paper.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet- Agreed that consideration of this matter should beresumed at a meeting to be held at an early date in thefollowing week.
The War Cabinet-Agreed that a Committee should be set up as follows :  Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),Minister of Production,Lord Privy Seal,President of the Board of Trade,Minister of State,Paymaster-General.The Committee&apos;s task was to determine, in the light ofthe discussion in the War Cabinet as summarised by thePrime Minister, the attitude to be taken by UnitedKingdom officials in the forthcoming discussions withofficial representatives of the Dominions and India overthe whole field of the Washington Conversations underArticle VII.It was, of course, open to the Committee to invite otherMinisters to assist them, as might be necessary, in regardto any particular aspect of their enquiry.Australia-New ZealandAgreementof the 21stJanuary, 1944.(PreviousEef erence:W.M. (44) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. At their last meeting the War Cabinet had invited theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs to arrange for a reply tothe Australian and New Zealand Governments to be drafted andsubmitted to them. Copies of the draft reply were handed roundand considered at the meeting.The War Cabinet-Approved  the  draft  reply  subject  to  the  followingpoints : (a) the offer to share in defence responsibilities in thePacific was a notable landmark, and should be mademore cordial;(b) paragraph 7 should read as follows:  &quot;We are inagreement with the general principle laid down inthis paragraph, with the proviso that its applica-tion in certain individual instances might beaffected by the terms of the arrangements made atthe time.&quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th February, 1944.
