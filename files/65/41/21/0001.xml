The War Cabinet were given the latest information about(Previous the discussions with the Polish Ministers.Eeference: The discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofW.M.(44)20th War Cabinet Conclusions.Conclusions,Minute 4.)National Health 2. At their meeting on the 11th February the War Cabinethad agreed that the proposals for a National Health Service(W.P. (44) 74) should be further discussed before a final decisionService.(PreviousEeference:W.M.(44)18thConclusions,Minute 3.)was taken to publish the White ParThe following were the main points raised in the course of afurther discussion of the scheme outlined in the White Paper : (a) Would the scheme mean the end of private medical practiceand the family doctor ?The War Cabinet were informed that the scheme would notprevent the continuance of private practice; in particular, doctorstaking part in the public service would not be prevented from takingprivate patients. Nor would it affect the relation between the doctorand the patient. The conception of the family doctor would indeed. be strengthened, since dependants of insured persons would infuture become eligible for free medical treatment.It was true that the eventual effect of the scheme might be tolimit the scope for private practice since, when free medicaltreatment was available for all, there might be some reduction in thenumbers willing to pay for private treatment. At the same time,the scheme would not directly prohibit or restrict the extent ofprivate medical practice.(b) Would the scheme mean the end of the voluntary hospitals,which had for so long taken the lead in teaching and in research %These hospitals, supported by voluntary contributions, were rightlyjealous of their independence. Could they continue to play the samepart in the development of medical science if they became financiallydependent on public authorities and had, in consequence, to acceptpublic control ?The War Cabinet were informed that it was not proposed thatthe management of the voluntary hospitals should be taken over bypublic authority. The scheme contemplated that these hospitalsshould make a certain number of beds available for public patients,and that they should be paid for this service. But the payment,which would be made by the Central Government, not by the localauthority, would not meet the whole of their expenditure : theywould still have to rely on voluntary support for a substantialproportion of their revenue. Ministers had discussed theseproposals with responsible representatives of the voluntaryhospitals, who were satisfied that they could still enlist the supportof voluntary contributors, so long as it was made clear that theirindependence was preserved and that the revenue guaranteed tothem by the scheme was not sufficient to meet the whole of theirexpenditure.(c) To what extent would the scheme interfere with the rightof doctors to set up in practice as consultants 1It was explained that the proposals for a consultants&apos; service,linked with the hospitals, would make the service available to a farwider range of patients. The eventual result of the scheme wouldbe to increase the number of consultants, and to improve theirdistribution over the country as a whole. This would be broughtabout, not by any system of State selection of doctors for consultantwork, but by providing greater opportunities for doctors to practiseas consultants. The scheme would not, however, prevent consultantsfrom seeing patients privately, in addition to any part which theytook in the public medical service.(d) The Secretary of State for Scotland referred to the schemeoriginally known as the Clyde Basin Experiment and subsequently,after its extension to the rest of Scotland, as the SupplementaryMedical Service. Under this scheme general practitioners were ableto refer any patients for whom they felt that specialist advice wasdesirable to the Regional Medical Officers of the Department of
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,lUh February, 1944.-Health and, through them, to consultants in private practice. Upto the present date nearly 7,000 patients who might not otherwisehave been able to obtain the services of a consultant had been dealtwith. No fees were charged by the consultants for their services,and all the consultants attached to Scottish hospitals were in favourof the scheme. This scheme illustrated both the need for extendedconsultant services and the method by which such services might beprovided under the proposals in the White Paper.As regards voluntary hospitals, the Secretary of State said thatin 1940 over 30,000 patients were on the waiting list of voluntaryhospitals in Scotland. By agreement with the voluntary hospitalsarrangements had been made under which patients on these waitinglists were admitted to the new hospitals built for the EmergencyMedical Service. 26,000 patients had been dealt with under thisscheme, and the voluntary hospitals had co-operated willingly inmaking it a success.(e) With regard to the finance of the scheme, The Chancellorof the Exchequer explained that the estimate of the cost of thegeneral practitioner service was based on the payment of 8-4 million made to general practitioners in 1938 in respect ofthe 17,800,000 persons who were then insured under the NationalHealth Insurance scheme. The basis of remuneration of generalpractitioners under the new proposals had been left open; probablypayment would be in the main by capitation fees, although in certaincases salaries would be paid.The total cost falling on public funds would be  132 milliona year, of which about  40 million would probably be derived fromsocial insurance contributions. The rest would be shared betweenthe tax-payer and the rate-payer in almost equal proportions.There would be some increased burden on the rates, but the newburden would fall mainly on the Exchequer.After a full discussion, the War Cabinet Re-affirmed their decision of the 9th February that thedocuments annexed to WP. (44) 74 should be publishedas the basis for public discussion and further negotiationwith the various interests concerned.
