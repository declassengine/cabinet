Air Raids.Casualties andDamage.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Prime Minister asked the Home Secretary andMinister of Home Security to consider the issue of an announcementto the effect that, unless people had work to do, they should proceedto shelters during air raids. In recent months the people of Londonhad got into the habit of ignoring the risks of enemy air activity.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said hewould look into this point. He also undertook to examine asuggestion that certain tube shelters should be opened to the public.0&quot;&quot;* 2.   The War Cabinet considered a draft telegram from the(Previous Prime Minister to the President in reply to a telegram from theReference: latter which had been considered at their last meeting.   Copies ofW.M.(44)24th the draft reply were handed round.  A number of amendments wereConclusions,. made and the War Cabinet agreed that the reply, as amended,Minute 1.) should be despatched.3.   The War Cabinet considered (i) A Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction(W.P. (44) 110)&quot; on Housing in the TransitionalPeriod; and(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare(W.P. (44) 122) dealing with the suggestion that legis-lation conferring on public authorities statutory powersto purchase land compulsorily at 1939 prices should beenacted as soon as possible.The Minister of Health said that the proposals in theMemorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction were designed toplace local authorities in a position to make an immediate start ona two-year programme of new houses of permanent type as soon asthe war in Europe was over. It was hoped to have 100,000 housescompleted or under construction by the end of the. first year, and200,000 additional houses by the end of the second year. Underexisting legislation housing subsidies were limited to the provisionof houses for slum clearance, for the abatement of overcrowdingand for agricultural workers. The most urgent need after the war,however, would be for houses for general needs, and it wastherefore proposed to introduce legislation extending the scope ofthe housing subsidies, and that the Secretary of State for Scotlandand he should enter into discussions with representatives of the localauthorities about the rates of subsidy payable after the war. Thepresent restriction on the purchase of land for housing purposesshould be removed and legislation should be introduced giving theHealth Ministers power, during a period of two years, to confirmopposed compulsory purchase orders without holding a publicenquiry. In presenting the proposals to the local authorities theHealth Ministers would make it clear that the total volume of house-building in the transitional period would necessarily depend on thelabour available, and that this could not yet be estimated withprecision. The local authorities would, however, be asked to havetheir plans ready to ensure that, if building resources permitted,they would be ready to undertake a programme of the orderindicated,The Minister added that the proposalsin W.P. (44) 110 relatedonly to the provision of permanent houses, but that he and theSecretary of State were discussing with the Minister of Works otherproposals for the provision of emergency houses.[27001^3] b 2Housing.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 144thConclusions,Minute 1.)
The Prime Minister said that the first task must be to restoreany damaged houses which could be brought back into use. Thiswas being done.The Prime Minister then said that he envisaged a largeprogramme for the provision of emergency houses, to be undertakenby exceptional methods, so as to ensure that a large number ofhouses were made available immediately after the war for the youngmarried couples who would then want to set up house. This would,of course, be without prejudice to the long-term programme for theerection of houses of permanent type.The Prime Minister proceeded to outline some of the pointswhich he thought should be included in such a programme, e.g., theerection of a considerable number of model houses in order to obtainthe views of working-class women, and the incorporation ofstandard furniture and fitments to the greatest degree.Discussion then turned on the question raised by the Ministerof Economic Warfare in his Memorandum.The Prime Minister expressed the view that the prices paidfor land required for public purposes should be based on thestandard of value of the 31st March, 1939, which meant,incidentally, that account ought to be taken of changes in the valueof money since that date.It was explained that the recommendation made by the UthwattCommittee was at present before the Reconstruction Committee,who would be reporting on it to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet :(1) Authorised the Minister of Health and Secretary of Statefor Scotland to open discussions with representatives ofthe local authorities on the basis indicated in para-graphs 3 to 6 of WP. (44) 110, and to arrange for theearly introduction of the legislation mentioned inparagraphs 4 and 6 (d) of W.P. (44) 110.(2) Took note that the recommendation of the UthwattCommittee that land required by public authoritiesshould be bought at prices not exceeding those rulingat the 31st March, 1939, was at present being examinedby the Reconstruction Committee and would be broughtbefore the War Cabinet.Indo-China. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (WP. (44) 111), to whichwere attached memoranda, prepared by the Foreign Office and by thePost-Hostilities Planning Committee, about our policy in regard toIndo-China and the French possessions in the Pacific.Broadly, the conclusion reached in these memoranda was thatwe should aim at continuance of French sovereignty over Indo-China and France&apos;s Pacific possessions, subject to certain conditions,the chief of which was the establishment of international bases atstrategic points. It was also suggested that the Dominion Govern-ments should be consulted on the matter at the earliest opportunitywith a view to forming an Imperial policy on this matter.The War Cabinet-Approved the course of action proposed in WP. (44) 111and invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs totake  the  necessary  action,   in  consultation  with  theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.
Parliament.Railway Faresof PeersattendingSittings of theHouse of Lords.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (44) 117) about therecovery of railway fares by Peers attending sittings of the Houseof Lords.The War Cabinet-Approved in principle the proposal set out in this Memo-randum; invited the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to arrange for the detailed arrangements to bediscussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer; andagreed that when this had been done the matter should beraised inDiscussionsunderArticle YII.(PreviousReference :W.M.(44)24thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Prime Minister said that he intended to set out for theconsideration of his colleagues certain principles which he thoughtwould meet with general acceptance in regard to the matters whichformed the subject of Article VII discussions. He hoped that thiswould prove helpful.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,24th February, 1944.
