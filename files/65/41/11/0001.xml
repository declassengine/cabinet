(44) 53), in which hestated that the farmers&apos; confidence would be largerly restored ifthe War Cabinet would agree to the extension of the presentguarantee in two respects (i) The Minister had been authorised to say that the presentsystem of fixed prices and assured markets for agricul-tural products would be maintained for two years afterthe end of hostilities with Germany.It would be a great help if it could be stated thatthe present system would be maintained until the end ofthe harvest of 1947.(ii) It would also be a help if it could.be stated that actualminimum prices for live-stock would be fixed now forthe period up to 1947.The view of the War Cabinet was in favour of the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries having authority to make a statementon the lines of (i), but not of (ii).Discussion then ensued as to whether a statement on theselines should be made by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieson the following day, or whether he should hold it in reserve for-use in discussions with the National Farmers&apos; Union.The War Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesshould make a statement on this matter on the followingday, on the lines of the Annex to these Minutes.

That also I am willing to discusswith the National Farmers&apos; Union.Thirdly, I would remind the House of the other part of our policy theguarantee that the system of fixed prices and an assured market will bemaintained for the duration of hostilities and for at least one year thereafter.That is a valuable assurance of stable conditions : the period which it covers is,however, difficult to forecast. In seeking a clear and definite understandingabout the future application of our policy, I am quite willing to consider withthe National Farmers&apos; Union whether this assurance of the continuance of thesystem cannot be related more closely to the four-year production plan, endingwith the harvest of 1947, which I have already set before the industry.The object would be to cover the transition period from war .to peace andallow sufficient time for the formulation after the termination of the war inEurope of a long-term agricultural policy on the basis of the discussions alreadyproceeding with the industry, as part of the general national economic policy.
