Position inMiningIndustry.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44)ConclusionsMinute 3.)30th1. Reference was made to the position in the mining industry.The War Cabinet was informed that, while a large number of menwere out in South Wales, there was now little trouble in any of theother coal-fields.The Minister of Production said that, if the strike in SouthWales continued, there was a danger that at the beginning of nextweek there would be a reduction in electrical power for industry ofabout 50 per cent, in that area. This would have some effect on warproduction. He thought, however, that the right policy was tocontinue production at the full rate until such time as work inparticular factories had to be stopped owing to the shortage of coal,and not to send coal specially to South Wales from other areas.This course would have the incidental advantage of bringing hometo those concerned the effect of the stoppage in the South Walescoal-field on essential war production.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view.The War Cabinet was also informed that some desire had beenexpressed in certain quarters that there should be an opportunityfor a Debate in the House of Commons in the near future on theposition in the coal-mining industry. The view of the War Cabinetwas that discussion on this matter in the House of Commons at thepresent juncture would not serve any useful purpose and should bediscouraged.&quot; Overlord &quot; 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a paper by the MinisterSecurity. 0f Production (W.P. (44) 153) covering a note dealing with certain(Previous proposals connected with &quot;Overlord&quot; security.

W.M. (kh) 31Note of Points not thought worth recording in theCabinet Conclusions1 .     Hours of Sitting.     There was some reference to this andthe Foreign Secretary said that he would he embarrassed if,having got general agreement to the hours of 2 - 9 on conditionthat there was work for Standing Committees, if set up, itemerged that there wasn&apos;t any flov/ of legislation.     The LordPresident said he was looking into this.2.      In connection with the above, reference was made to theWater Bill, and the Prime Minister asked Lord Woolton to bringit before the Cabinet at an early date.3. Talk about the Dollar Balances, but no conclusion worthrecording.1+.     The Foreign Secretary was asked to tell Clark Kerr howwell President Roosevelt had reacted to the telegram to Russiaabout Poland.5.      Talk about the Housing Bill, leading to discussion aboutUthwatt and land values, all of which is being settled in theR. Committee.     No definite conclusion, but the need forbringing this to a point at which it can come before theCabinet in the near future was strongly emphasised.6.      The Prime Minister wants to see the draft White Paper onthe Social Security Scheme as soon as possible, even if itisn&apos;t finished.Generally, I think it is clear that it would be a goodplan to let the Prime Minister have early drafts of any of theWhite Papers which are nearing completion.7.     Mr. Bevin spoke of circulating a draft White Paper aboutthe Demobilisation Scheme and suggesting an early discussionat a meeting of the War Cabinet attended by the ServiceMinisters.8, The Lord President tmclertook to send a note to the PrimeMinister about his suggestion that our aircraft should attackpanzer divisions in Prance,9.      The Minister of Production undertook to send a note to thePrime Minister about shortage of man-power in the Guards.10.    There was some talk about the Prime Minister making abroadcast.      The Prime Minister would like to do this in abouta fortnight, but some of his colleagues would like to waituntil rather more of the White Papers on reconstruction problemshave been issued.1Oth March, 19kh
