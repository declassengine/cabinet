Details are contained in the Secretary&apos;sStandard File of War Cabinet - Conclusions.Argentina. 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to theposition of Argentina and to the United States views as to the needfor urgent action. The facts were set out in the Memorandumwhich he had circulated to the War Cabinet (W.P. (44) 21).The, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was,of course, anxious to keep in step with the Americans in thismatter. He knew that this was a point to which the PrimeMinister attached great importance. For the moment, however, hefelt that the first essential was that the United States Governmentshould agree to defer action until there had been time to considerthe matter in all its bearings.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Ikth January, 1944.


A.C.A. Meeting held onWEDNESDAY.  12TH JANUARY,  1944THE FOREIGN SECRETARY raised two questions which,t^&quot; had the War Cabinet &quot;been in session, would have been raisedat the Cabinet.      The first concerned Poland.POLAND The Foreign Secretary said that the Poles had nowchanged their mind and did not intend to issue a statementto the effect that they were not prepared to discussfrontiers until after the war.      He read out extracts fromthe text of a statement which the Polish Government proposedto issue.      The essential point was that the Poles nowintended to say that they were willing to discuss mattersof common concern to themselves and the Russians atmeetings to be attended by representatives of the RussianGovernment, His Majesty&apos;s Government and the U. S.  Government.The Foreign Secretary said that the proposed statementwas not quite on the lines which he would have wished thisstatement to take.      But he saw no reason why we shouldobject to the issue of this statement, more especially seeingthat, as a result of our pressure it was a far better statementthan that which the Poles had had in mind to issue a day ortwo earlier.This course was approved by the Ministers concerned.ARGENTINE THE FOREIGN SECRETARY then referred to a telegram fromour Ambassador (No.  139 from Washington) reporting thatMr.  Hull intended to recommend that the U. S.  Governmentshould issue a statement about the Argentine Government,accompanying it by the recall to Washington for consultationof their Ambassador to Buenos Aires, and by the freezing ofArgentine funds in the United States.    Mr. Hull had said itwould be a fine thing if we could do the same.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that while he was anxiousto keep in step with the Americans, he was most apprehensivethat the measures proposed would not only fail with theirobjective in regard to the Argentine Government, but mightseriously impede the flow to the United Nations of essentialArgentine -oroducts.      In particular, we were greatly dependentupon Argentine for meat.      He therefore proposed to send atelegram to Washington asking the Americans to postpone action,but proposing joint examination by the Combined Boards of theprobable effect of any such action on the war effort.This course was also approved by the Ministers concerned.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W. 1.NO CIRCULATION
