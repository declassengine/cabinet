/EducationBill.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43)166thConclusions,Minute 3.)The War Cabinet discussed the situation which had arisen asa result of the Government having been defeated that evening, by117 votes to 116, on an amendment moved by Mrs. Cazalet-Keir, M.P., to Clause 82 of the Education Bill, that the Ministerof Education-, in approving salary scales, should not differentiatebetween men and women solely on the grounds of sex.The President of the Board of Education explained thatClause 82 had been included in the Bill to meet the views of theteachers. The Clause enabled the Minister to secure that theremuneration paid to teachers was in accordance with the scalesrecommended by the Burnham Committees independent bodiesrepresenting both teachers and local authorities. The result of theamendment carried against the Government was to put the Ministerin a position in which he had to interfere with the proceedings ofthe Burnham Committees to the extent of requiring them to fixscales applicable equally to men and women. Both he and hispredecessors had always avoided any interference with the pro-ceedings of the Burnham Committees,, on the ground that bodiesof this kind must have complete freedom to reach their owndecisions.It was clear that the supporters of the amendment, and inparticular the Tory Reform Group, had seized the opportunity ofraising the question of equal pay on Clause 82 of the Education Billbecause they saw no prospect of raising it at any other time. Hehad made the seriousness of the situation plain to the House so thatthose who voted for the amendment could not be in any doubt as tothe consequences of the vote.The President added that, from the point of view of adminis-tration, it would be possible to omit the Clause altogether from theBill without any embarrassment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that thePresident of the Board of Education had so handled the situationthat none of the members present could have failed to realise theimplications of a vote against the Government. His impressionwas that after the vote there had been a change in feeling amongthose members who had supported the amendment, and an attempthad been made to suggest that the Government should not treat thematter as one of confidence, but should consider, whether they mightnot acquiesce in the decision of the House. He had made it clearthat, while the Government accepted the proposal to report progress,he could give no undertaking whatsoever as to the Governmentsattitude.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Government werecommitted to formidable military operations in the near future.This incident might well have a most damaging effect on opinionabroad, and it was essential that prompt measures should be takento make it clear beyond any doubt that the Government had the fullsupport of Parliament. The great majority of members were withthe Government, and, if the issue was treated as a major one ofconfidence, he was sure that the effect would be salutary.The Lord President of the Council said that the situationwhich had arisen was the culmination of a course of irresponsible.conduct pursued by certain members of the House.   He fullyendorsed what the Prime Minister had said.The Minister of Labour and National Service agreed that thequestion must be treated as a major issue of confidence. Any signof weakness on the part of the Government would have the worstpossible effect on industrial relations. He agreed with thePresident of the Board of Education that it would be disastrous todepart from the principle of non-interference with the decisions ofindependent tribunals on wage questions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the deputa-tion which he had received in the previous week on the subject ofequal pay had not pressed for the immediate application of the
principle, but only that it should form a feature of the post-warCivil Service.Further discussion showed complete agreement that thePresident of the Board of Education could have taken no other line,and that the matter must be treated as a major issue of confidence.The War Cabinet then turned to the question of the procedureto be adopted in the House. There was general assent to the viewthat no time should be lost in restoring the position. It was felt,however, that it would be advantageous to allow one day to elapsein order to enable members who were out of London to return.The President of the Board of Education pointed out that, asa result of the proposed procedure, at least one day of those setaside for the Committee Stage of the Education Bill would be lost.He was most anxious that, if at all possible, the Committee Stageshould be completed by Easter.It was agreed that the possibility of sitting for an extra dayfor this purpose should be borne in mind.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) The line taken by the President of the Board of Educationin dealing with Mrs. Cazalet-Keir&apos;s amendment wascordially endorsed.(2) At the meeting of the House on the following day,Wednesday, the 29th March, the Prime Minister wouldmake a statement emphasising that the Government feltthat at this serious stage of the war there must be nodoubt of the support which they enjoyed from theHouse of Commons. There would therefore have to bean alteration in Government business.(3) The Prime Minister&apos;s statement would proceed to indicatethe procedure to be followed when the Committee Stageof the Bill was resumed on the following clay, Thursday,the 30th March. The Government would then opposethe Motion that the Clause, as amended, should standas part of the Bill, and this would be treated as a voteof confidence. In the same way, when the Report Stageof the Bill was reached the Government would move torestore the Clause as it originally stood in the Bill.This also would be treated as a vote of confidence. Afterthe Prime Minister&apos;s statement had been made, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs would move theadjournment of the House.(4) The Prime Minister, the Lord President of the Council,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Presidentof the Board of Education and the Joint Chief Whipswere invited to settle the terms of the draft statementreferred to in (2) and (3).(5) The Joint Chief Whips were invited to take stejas toensure a full attendance in the House on Thursday, the30th March.(6) -The Prime Minister, the Lord President of the Council,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Education would speak onbehalf of the Government in the Debate on Thursday,the 30th March.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,29th March, 1944.
