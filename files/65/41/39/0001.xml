Food andAgriculture.PermanentUnited NationsOrganisation.(PreviousReference:W.M.(43)91stConclusions,Minute 1.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of State (W.P. (44) 161) covering-(a) the draft First and Second Reports to the Governments ofthe United Nations by the Interim Commission on Foodand Agriculture;(b) recommendations on these Reports by the Committee ofOfficials.The Committee had reached the conclusion that the Reports,while not in all respects in the terms which we could have desired,were generally satisfactory provided that our representatives on thepermanent organisation exercised the vigilance and leadershipnecessary to secure that its activities were kept on the proper lines.They accordingly recommended that, if the other Governmentswere prepared to accept these Reports, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould do likewise. If, however, other Governments put forwardamendments to the draft Constitution appended to the SecondReport, the British delegate on the Commission should refer homefor instructions. In that event, opportunity would arise for makingcertain amendments which were in themselves desirable.The Minister of State briefly reviewed the origin of thesedocuments and the circumstances in which they had been framed.He was satisfied that their substance was in general accordancewith our interests and that, were we now to move amendments toprotect our position more completely, there was a risk that otheramendments would be moved by other Governments which mighthave the result, which we were anxious to avoid, of securing for theExecutive of the Food Organisation powers which we had beenconsistently anxious that they should not exercise.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries drew attention tothe recommendations contained in Article XI (/) and (g) on page 29of W.P. (44) 161, which stated that the functions of the Organisa-tion should be to promote the adoption of policies for the provisionof adequate agricultural credit, and in regard to agriculturalcommodity arrangements. These clauses were not, in his view,consistent with the Organisation being a fact-finding body of anadvisory character. He would like to see these clauses amended;otherwise we might find ourselves in a very awkward position lateron. If amendment was regarded as impracticable, we ought atleast to define more precisely what was intended by the word&quot; promote.&quot;The Minister of State said that paragraph 80 of the draftSecond Report at page 19 of W.P. (44) 161 should be read with thedraft Constitution. This made it clear that a decision on anyrecommendations from the Organisation would only be taken by themember Governments.In the discussion which followed there was general support forthe view that steps should be taken to protect the point raised bythe Minister of Agriculture, and that this could best be done bya declaration, the terms of which would have to be carefullyconsidered, to be made by the United Kingdom Representative atthe time of signature.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) Our Representative should be instructed to take the linethat, if other Governments were to accept the draftReports as they stood, His MajestyV Government woulddo likewise.(2) If, however, other Governments put forward amendmentsto the draft Constitution, our Delegate on the InterimCommission should refer home for instructions. Inthat event, there would be an opportunity to press forcertain of the amendments which the Committee ofOfficials had recommended as desirable.
(3) Our Representative should, when intimating our accept-ance of the Reports, make a Declaration, the terms ofwhich should be settled by the Deputy Prime Minister,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofState, to protect the position as regards the nature ofthe functions to be exercised by the Food Organisation.The Declaration might be to the effect that HisMajesty&apos;s Government, while agreeing to the Declara-tion and ready to sign the proposed Constitution, did soon the understanding that, notwithstanding the pro-visions of Article XI (/) and (g) of the Constitution, theOrganisation would not assume functions in regard tothe matters referred to in those clauses, which wouldfall within the scope of other organisations which mighthereafter be established, and that the Constitution does&apos; not of itself confer on the Organisation direct executivefunctions in this field. The meaning of these clauseswas understood to be that the Organisation wouldproperly seek to influence the Governments of the&apos; United Nations to agree upon international measures tobe realised through other agencies.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,23rd March, 1944.
