1.   The War Cabinet considered the following: A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (44) 18) covering an exchange of telegrams with theViceroy in which the view was strongly expressed byLord Wavell that the Bengal situation could only be safe-guarded, and a danger of recurrence of famine avoided, if theMinistry were dismissed, and government by the Governor byproclamation under Section 93 of the Government of India Actwas established.A further exchange of telegrams (657 to the Viceroy and64-S from the Viceroy); andA further memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (44) 20) covering a draft of the statement which it wouldbe necessary to issue if the Viceroy&apos;s proposal were approved.The Secretary of State for India said that, in his telegrams,the Viceroy had made it clear that by whatever means, theresponsibility for control of the food situation in Bengal must betaken out of the hands of the Ministry. In his telegram 38-S ofthe 6th January the Viceroy discussed five methods which had beensuggested as theoretically possible, and explained his reasons forfavouring the adoption of the fifth method -the dismissal of theMinistry for failure to take the necessary food measures,accompanied by the issue of a proclamation under Section 93 by theGovernor assuming to himself the powers of the Ministry.In support of the view that drastic action of some kind wasnecessary, the Secretary of State gave a number of instances, inthe sphere of public health, to illustrate the inability of the Govern-ment of Bengal to carry out their responsibilities in times of crisis.He was advised that some 50 per cent, of this year&apos;s grain cropswould normally be marketed during the next three months, and thatthere was a grave danger that, if the Ministry remained in control,they would not take the action necessary to ensure that aconsiderable proportion of the crop did not go underground.It was clear, however, that the application of Section 93 wouldhave grave repercussions. It was true that there would be no legalway in which the Governors decision to apply the Section couldbe challenged. The Ministry would, however, protest on thegrounds that the action had been taken because the present Ministrywas a predominantly Moslem League Government, and this mightlead both to unrest in Bengal and to the resignation of MoslemLeague Governments in other Provinces. This step should not,therefore, be taken unless it was really necessary, in order to avoidthe recurrence of famine.No doubt it was a serious matter to reject the Viceroy&apos;sconsidered opinion. The Secretary of State wondered, however,whether the necessary results might not be achieved by a combina-tion of the first two methods discussed in Lord Wavells telegramNo. 38-S&apos; namely, a decision by the Governor that thecircumstances were such that his special responsibility underSection 52 (1) (a) was attracted in regard to food administration,which would enable him to override the Ministry as he thought fit;and the use by the Central Government of its powers underSection 126a.In conclusion, the Secretary of State read out a telegramNo. 79-S in which the Viceroy reported that he had not discussedthe proposed application of Section 93 with his Executive Council,but gave an estimate of their views as indicated by their commentson reports regarding the food situation in Bengal. The generalconclusion reached by the Viceroy was that the majority of hisExecutive Council would favour the proposed action, but that theIndian members, including Hindus, would not wish to be associatedwith it and would expect him to take entire responsibility.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Lord Wavsll hadevidently formed a very unfavourable opinion of the efficiency ofthe Bengal Government.   The War Cabinet had not, however, been
23W.M. 5 (M).informed of the considered views of the senior officers serving inthe Province.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the instancesmentioned by the Secretary of State and those cited in telegram38-S, as to the ineffectiveness of various officials in the BengalProvince. He said that it would appear that the responsibility forseveral of the appointments in question rested with the Centre, andnot with the Provincial Government. If the Government of India,in justification of the use of Section 93, were to rely on some of theinstances of inefficiency which had been cited to the War Cabinet,he thought that they might find themselves on very insecure ground.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, theGovernor of Bengal could clearly exercise his individual judgmentin matters affecting the supply of food or the health of the people,as being matters which were closely bound up with good govern-ment. Moreover, it was important to bear in mind the procedurewhen a Governor decided to exercise his individual judgment inregard to a particular matter. It was not the case that the Ministerconcerned first came to a definite conclusion and then submitted thematter for further consideration by the Governor. In practice,what happened was that the Minister consulted with the Governorbefore deciding what action should be taken, and no question aroseof the Minister being formally overridden by the Governor. More-over, all orders were issued as orders of Government, and there wasnothing to indicate that certain orders were issued as a result ofthe Governor exercising his individual judgment. The wholearrangement thus worked quite smoothly.If, on the other hand, recourse was made to Section 93, and thepresent Government was dismissed, the Hindus would be delighted.More of the Moslems would stand back and do nothing, and, somewould be actively hostile. In the result the Government of Bengalwould be left without friends.It was a serious matter to override the Viceroy&apos;s consideredjudgment, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that, inany event, the newly-appointsd Governor should be given time to findhis feet and to establish relations with the Government of Bengal.If, after experience of trying to work with the Bengal Government,Mr. Casey found that it was impossible to carry on, the questionof recourse to Section 93 could always be considered.. But hesincerely hoped that Mr. Casey would find it possible to workthrough the Ministry, on the lines which he had suggested.The Secretary of State for War expressed agreement with theseviews. He felt sure that, even if the existing Ministry weredismissed, it would not be possible to produce a really effectiveorganisation at all quickly. In his view, the use of Section 93 wouldprobably result in worsening the position in Bengal. He did, notfavour dismissing the Bengal Government except for explicit refusalto Carry out clear-cut orders.The Secretary of State for War also referred to a report in TheTimes that morning according to which the views of the Centrewere prejudiced in the eyes of the Bengal Ministry, by the fact thatthey happened to coincide with those of the political oppositionin Bengal.   This might have serious political consequences.The Lord Chancellor was opposed to the use, of Section 93 atthis juncture, which he would regard as an extreme step. He quotedthe terms of Section 52 (1) (a) of the Government of Indian Act,and thought that the acting Governor of Bengal was wrong inthinking that the present situation in Bengal was not sufficient tojustify him in exercising, in regard to health and food, matters, hisspecial responsibility under this Section.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also expressedagreement with the views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Aircraft Production was of the same opinion.In his view the use, at this juncture, of Section 93 would createthe worst possible impression, at the time when the neAV Governor

It would make the whole Province hostile to us.Moreover, he did not feel that a case had been established whichwould justify recourse to Section 93 against the present Government.Responsibility for most of the matters referred to seemed to restwith the previous Government of Puzlul Huq.Mr. Casey agreed that it was a serious matter to overrule theViceroy&apos;s considered judgment, but favoured an effort to workthrough the existing Government, rather than to break with it. Hereferred, in this connection, to the need for making the best use ofall available resources, including those from outside the Province.The Chancellor of the Exchequer in this connection suggestedthat as many as possible of the members of the I.C.S., now servingthe Centre, who had previous service in Bengal, should be madeavailable for service in Bengal during the present emergency.The War Cabinet&apos;s decisions were as follows : (1) Of the five methods of removing food from Ministerialcontrol, set out by the Viceroy in Telegram 38-S of the6th January, the War Cabinet rejected (3) amendmentof the Constitution Act and (4) and (5) the assump-tion of powers of direct rule bv the Governor underSection 93.(2) The right line of action was for the Governor to decide thatthe circumstances were such that his special responsi-bility was attracted under Section 52 (1) A of theGovernment of India Act in regard to food and healthadministration (the Viceroy&apos;s course (1)) as well as inrespect of the proper execution of directions from theCentral Government under Section 126a.(3) In communicating this decision to the Viceroy referenceshould be made to the methods and procedure wherebythe Governor of a Province would normally exercise hisspecial responsibilities, as explained, by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.(4) The Secretary of State for India was invited to prepare atelegram to the Viceroy setting out the War Cabinefsviews. This telegram should be shown to the DeputyPrime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer and,subject to their concurrence, should be despatchedwithout further reference to the War Cabinet.
