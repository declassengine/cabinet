Poland. i    The War Cabinet had a further discussion on the Polish-previous       Soviet question, a record of which is contained in the Secretary&apos;sEef erence:      Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M. (44) 11thConclusions, -----Minute 1.)Publication of 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theDocuments on Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 49) on theBritish Foreign publication of documents on British Foreign Policy.Policy&apos; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded,the War(Previous Cabinet that there had been previous discussion on this matter,w m&apos;61&quot;^ ^ not now Press ^or authority to publish the collection of. I. (42) 121st ;(iocuments illustrating the course of Anglo-German relationsConclusions, between 1925 and March 1939. He was, however, impressed by theMinute.4.) necessity of making available to the general public here and abroad,more particularly to historians and publicists, material on whichto form a sound judgment regarding British foreign policy duringthe inter-war years. There was a risk of our case going by defaultand the arguments for publishing a collection of British documentswith this end in view was strengthened by the fact that documentsillustrating American foreign policy in the inter-war years werealready being published. It was not desirable that on the Alliedside the only authoritative records of international policy duringthe period preceding the present war should be those from Americansources. In these circumstances he asked for the approval of theWar Cabinet to the preparation and publication of a generalcollection of documents illustrating British foreign policy from1919 to 1939. A delay of about two years was likely before the firstvolume would be ready. Publication would begin with the volumesfor 1930; and simultaneously work would be carried out on thevolumes covering the period between 1919 and 1929. The necessaryarrangements would be carried out under the direction of theForeign Office, and Mr. Woodward&apos;s services had been obtained inconnection with them.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs as set out in W.P. (44) 49.Broadcasting. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them Future Policy. (a) A   memorandum   by    the   Deputy   Prime   Minister(W.P. (43) 580). .(6) A note by the Minister of Information (W.P. (44) 39).(c) A   memorandum   by   the   Minister   of   Reconstruction(W.P. (44) 45).The Lord President of the Council said that the Charter of theB.B.C. would come up for renewal in 1946 and suggested that inconnection with future broadcasting policy, examination should begiven to the question of foreign stations exploited by commercialinterests. In particular, given the risk that stations adjoining thiscountry might be controlled in the interest of United States businessto the detriment of British trade and industry, attention should bepaid to international policy on this subject before ContinentalGovernments were reinstated. A further important point was thepost-war control of broadcasting on the Continent of&apos; Europe andthe possibility of using it as a positive instrument of peace and forthe spreading of the principles of international co-operation. Hesuggested that there was a case for an expert inquiry as to howthis end could be achieved, and as to howr to ensure that internationalbroadcasting services, if established, should also as a prime dutygive news as far as possible true and unbiased by national interests.
TAe Minister of Information said that, owing to the greatdevelopments in recent years in the field of broadcasting, theCharter of the B.B.C. would be rather out of date when it cameup for renewal.He agreed to the need for an enquiry, but thought that it mightwith advantage be a small body, under an independent Chairman,to look into the general question of broadcasting policy and reportto the War Cabinet.Agreement was expressed with the need for an enquiry, but thegeneral view of the War Cabinet was that, in the first instanceat any rate, the enquiry should be undertaken by a Committee ofMinisters.The War Cabinet Decided that a Committee of Ministers consisting of theMinister of Reconstruction (Chairman), the Lord Presi-dent of the Council, the Minister of Information and thePostmaster-General, with a representative of the ForeignOffice, should be appointed to enquire into the generalquestions of policy raised in these three memoranda, andto make recommendations to the War Cabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,27th January, 1944.
