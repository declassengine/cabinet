Bomber Command had carried out very heavy attacks against(Previous Frankfurt, Berlin and Essen.   Factories and railway centres inReference:        France had also been bombed, and Mosquito attacks made onW.M.(44)36th    Germany each night.   A total of 10,408 tons of bombs had beenConclusions,      dropped.    United States heavy bombers had attacked Berlin,Minute l.)        Brunswick, Frankfurt and Schweinfurt together with &quot; Crossbow &quot;targets.   16,000 sorties had been flown from these Islands duringAir Operations,   the week.  This was the highest number so far flown in any week.Home Theatre.   A total of 12,200 tons of bombs had been dropped on Germanyduring the week.    Coastal Command had made one promisingattack on a U-boat and had probably damaged another.  Enemylosses for the week had been 115 aircraft destroyed and 17 probablydestroyed.   Our losses had been 184 Allied bombers, 48 fighters and6 Coastal Command aircraft.   267 enemy aircraft had been overthis country by night during the previous week, of which 20 hadbeen destroyed.Mediterranean. tn addition to strategic targets, ports, railways and targetsin the battle area had been attacked. Twenty-four small vessels hadbeen sunk and 39 either probably sunk or damaged. Enemy lossesamounted to 217 aircraft (this figure should be accepted with somereserve) compared with 59 Allied.Naval Confirmed shipping losses by enemy action during the weekOperations. amounted to 14,013 tons. The losses for March to date amountedto 106.916 tons. Thirteen German U-boats had been destroyed and3 probably destroyed so far this month.Mediterranean.

A Commando Force had raided Solta Island, where theentire German garrison of 106 had been eliminated, 78 prisonersbeing taken.Military Tn Arakan the situation on the road between Maungdaw andOperations. Buthidaung had been cleared up, but on the previous day someJapanese had infiltrated into the area 7 miles north-west ofButhidaung. Another enemy force was moving north-west fromUkhrul, and was probably directed on Manipur. Our long-rangepenetration groups were inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy,and were hampering their communications.Russia. The Russian offensive continued successfully.   Their forceshad now reached the Pruth on a wide front. The thrust fromTarnopol, which was surrounded, had now also reached theDniester. The position of the 25 German divisions in the Odessaarea was precarious. So far, there had been no signs of the enemyevacuating the Crimea.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Spain.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)26thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to thediscussions which we and the United States were having with theSpanish Government over a number of points, and particularlywith regard to the export of wolfram from Spain to Germany. Itlooked as though the point in dispute was now narrowed to theexport of some 150 tons of wolfram up to the 30th June. Hethought that this was not worth a severe struggle, and he hoped topersuade the United States Government to share this view.The War Cabinet concurred.Air Raids.Casualties andDamage.(PreviousKef erence:W.M. (44) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)[27174-2]3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat there had been two fairly heavy raids in the previous week, onthe nights of the 21st/22nd and the 24th/25th March. Thecasualties for the week had been 97 killed, 383 seriously injuredand 230 slightly injured,b 2
Parliament. 4.   The War Cabinet were informed that Lord Chatfield hadMotion by put down the following motion for discussion in the House ofLord Chatfield. Lords on the 28th March :-&quot; To ask His Majesty&apos;s Government whether they areplanning to improve the administration of Imperial andNational Defence after the war; and, in particular, whetherthey will consider the practicability of obtaining agreement ofall parties that National Defence policy shall in future be anon-party matter; and to move for Papers.&quot;The line to be taken in regard to this motion was discussed,and it was generally agreed that it was unlikely that nationaldefence policy could in practice be treated as a non-party matter.The War Cabinet-Invited the Paymaster-General to reply to this motion onbehalf of the Government.   If the course of the debateshould make it desirable, the Secretary of State  forDominion Affairs would also take part in the debate.Parliament. 5.   The War  Cabinet agreed that the  Chancellor of  theBusiness of the Exchequer should make his budget statement on Tuesday, theHouse. 25th April.Date of theBudget.Parliament.Hours ofSitting.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)28rdConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthere was a wide diversity of view on this matter. On the whole,however, it seemed that the Government should take the line that,as soon as sufficient legislation was available to justify setting upStanding Committees, the House should be asked to change thenormal hours of sittings from those now in force to 2 p.m. to 9 p.m.In the meantime, no change should be made. This would meanthat the hours of sittings would not be altered until, say, afterWhitsun.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this proposal.Parliament.Secrecy as toTimes ofSitting.(PreviousPreference:W.M. (41) 102ndConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The War Cabinet discussed whether any useful purposewas served by the present practice of not making public in advancethe dates of the sittings of Parliament.The War Cabinet-Decided that, in view of the regularity of the sittings ofParliament on certain days of the week, there was nojustification for continuing the present rule of secrecy,which could now be discontinued as regards both the daysand the hours of sitting.ServicePersonnel.PoliticalActivities.(PreviousReference:W.M.(42)56thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Secretary of State for War said that, when the ArmyAnnual Bill was debated later in the week, a motion would probablybe put down by members of the Commonwealth Party which wouldbe supported by the Independents and by some members of theLabour Party. The terms of this motion were not yet known, butit would purport to favour an extension of the political rights ofService personnel.The War Cabinet were informed that the regulations of allthree Services did not permit Service personnel to take an activepart in support of any political organisation or party. Thisregulation had been interpreted with a good deal of discretion. Ablind eye had been turned to minor infringements, but there hadbeen one or two bad cases in which disciplinary action had been
taken. A demand was now likely to be made that members of theServices, if on leave and in mufti, could attend and address politicalmeetings.The general view of the War Cabinet was that it would be veryundesirable to allow Service personnel to address public politicalmeetings, whether in uniform or in mufti. If such permission wereonce given, it would not be possible to lay down conditions as towhat subjects could or could not be touched upon.On the other hand, it was felt that no obstacle should beplaced in the way of members of the Services being adopted asprospective candidates, provided that the steps to that end did notinvolve attendance at public meetings. There was, however, noreason why a member of the Services should not appear before aprivate meeting of the Selection Committee of a political party ina constituency.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Secretary of State for War should state,in the forthcoming debate, that there was no objectionto Service personnel being adopted as prospectivecandidates for Parliament, provided the steps necessaryfor their adoption did not involve their attendance atpublic meetings.(2) Agreed that the existing rule should be maintained wherebyService personnel are not permitted to take part inpublic political meetings, whether in uniform or inmufti.[Note. This conclusion does not apply to the specialcase of a serving officer, or other rank who hasbecome a prospective candidate.]Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,27th March, 1944.
