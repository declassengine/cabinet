1. The War Cabinet heard an account of certain recentdecisions on operational matters. A record is contained in theSecretary&apos;^ Standard File of War Cabinet conclusions.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that Cables andWireless, Limited, had offered a Directorship to Lord Reith, whowas at present employed as a Captain, R.N.V.R., in the Admiralty.Lord Reith had enquired whether he would be permitted to acceptthis appointment.Royal Naval Officers on the active list were of course forbiddento hold directorships in public companies. But under the Regula-tions applied to temporary officers at the beginning of the war, badLord Reith then been a director of Cables and Wireless, he wouldnot, on receiving an R.N.V.R. Commission, have been required todo more than disclose the fact of his Directorship, since the dutiesattached to it did not involve any clash of interest with the PublicService. In the circumstances, the First Lord of the Admiraltythought that assent should be given to this application. But sinceLord Reith had held office as a Minister of the Crown during thewar, the Prime Minister, to whom the matter had been referred,had thought that it should be brought to the notice of the WarCabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that there weretwo Government Directorships of Cables and Wireless, but thejoresent proposal did not affect either of them. He had beenconsulted by the First Lord of the Admiralty, and agreed with hisconclusion.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the First Lord of the Admiralty shouldinform Lord Reith that he could accept this Directorship.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,IQth January, 1944.
