Service Pay andAllowances.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)29thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. At the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion, the War Cabinetagreed that the Lord President of the Council, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor of the Exchequershould undertake, on behalf of the Government, the informaldiscussions on Service pay and allowances with Members of Parlia-ment who were interested in this matter. These Ministers would,of course, act throughout in the closest consultation with the ServiceMinisters.Post-War Relief.PoodRequirements.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 171stConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War about the extent of military responsi-bility for relief and rehabilitation in Europe (WP. (44) 141). TheMemorandum set out the basis on which the United States WarDepartment were preparing for relief under the Directive issuedby President Roosevelt.The Secretary of State for War asked the War Cabinet toauthorise him to accept, on behalf of the War Office and Army, theresponsibility for relief and rehabilitation in liberated andconquered areas in Europe on the same principles as those on whichthe United States War Department were working, subject to thenecessary changes consequent upon the difference between theBritish and United States governmental machinery; and to takeaction in conjunction with the United States War Department asregards agreement on requirements, procurement and allocation ofrelief supplies.The first point dealt with in discussion was whether themilitary authorities should be responsible for relief and rehabili-tation during the first six months, after which UNRRA should takeover. General agreement was expressed with this view. It wasexplained that the period of six months meant six months from thebeginning of effective occupation of any country, and that, unlessthere was a sudden collapse, the period of military responsibilitywould not cover the same period of six months in every liberatedterritory.The next point dealt with was whether the scale on which thesedemands were framed was not much too high.It was pointed out that the food demanded was sufficient toprovide a complete diet on the agreed scale for 23 million peoplefor six months. It was difficult to imagine circumstances in whichall food supplies would have been removed from liberated areas.It was probable that we should not, in fact, have to do more thansupplement the diet of the people of these areas to the extent of,say, one-quarter. If so, we were providing enough food to supple-ment to that extent the diet of 92 million people. This was surelyfar more than we were likely to be called upon to do.Again, if we were now ito underwrite these relief requirements,it was feared that we should then be under strong pressure to agreethat they should be pooled with the United Kingdom needs and apro rata cut in food enforced all round. This might lead to areduction in our food imports.Attention was also drawn to the risk that the United StatesWar Department might go on to the market and buy the food,without the concurrence of the Combined Food Board, and thusdiminish the supplies available to this country.Finally, it was suggested that a more practicable way of dealingwith the matter would have been to have started by an enquiry asto the food which was available and the shipping which could bespared to bring it to Europe, and that in this way definite resultswould have been achieved more easily without prejudice to our ownposition.On the other hand, it was pointed out that as long ago asNovember last President Roosevelt had given a Directive to theUnited States War Department to proceed on the basis proposed,and that it would be awkward for us to proceed on a different basis.Moreover, there was no likelihood that food supplies for relief would
IllFinance.be available in any quantities unless consumption was reduced inthe United States. The prospect of getting such a reduction wouldbe greatly increased if the problem was approached on the lines ofthe Presidents Directive.It was also urged that the interests of this country were fullysafeguarded by the procedure which would be followed.Thus, the estimates of requirements now put forward weresubmitted for planning purposes only. When agreement had beenreached on requirements, the next stage would be for the matter tocome before the Combined Food Board, where availability ofsupplies would be discussed. That Board could not act withoutconsent of our representative, who could refuse to agree to anyallocation which would have the effect of reducing supplies to thiscountry.Thereafter the matter would come before the Combined CivilAffairs Committee, where again our representative could object ifaction was taken contrary to our interests.The matter would also have to come before the CombinedShipping Adjustment Board. The War Cabinet was informed thatthe United States War Shipping Administration had said that theywould cover our import programme before assigning shipping forrelief purposes.In further discussion, it was urged that there was much to besaid for safeguarding our position by setting certain- points onrecord explicitly as a condition of authorising the present proposals;as,- for example, that the present estimate of requirements was putforward&apos; for planning purposes and seemed to be in excess of whatcould in fact be supplied; that before we would agree to theallocation of food and shipping we must have assurances that therewould be no diminution in the supplies to this country of food (andcertain other commodities), which must continue on the scale at leastsufficient to maintain our existing standards, which were notsusceptible to reduction; and likewise, as regards shipping, thatthere should be no reduction in the United Kingdom importprogramme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Secretary ofState for War&apos;s paper did not deal with finance. Discussion onfinancial issues was now proceeding, and it was to be hoped that theAmericans would agree that the cost of relief supplies during themilitary period should be met in the same proportions which hadbeen agreed under the UNRBA agreement. They might ask us toshare the cost of relief during the military period on a fifty-fiftybasis, but we should resist this.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Production, the Minister of Labourand National Service, the Secretary of State for War andthe Minister of Food to draw up, in the light of thediscussion, and submit to the War Cabinet a draft instruc-tiOn to the Secretary of State for War, setting out thepoints which should be safeguarded before authority wasgiven to the proposals set out in W.P. (44) 141.Miners&apos;(PreviousReference :^W.M.(44)18thConclusions,Minute 1.)[27080-3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (W.P. (44) 146) on the wage structureof the coal-mining industry.The Minister of Fuel and Power explained that he had acceptedan invitation to preside over a meeting of representatives of theMining Association and the Mine Workers&apos; Federation on thefollowing day, at which the overhaul of the wage structure of thecoal-mining industry would be discussed. In order to bring abouta closer relation between wages and output and to give mine workers-3] b 2
a greater sense of security for the future, he desired to put thefollowing two proposals before the meeting : -(i) That the existing flat rate addition to wages of 4s. Qd. ashift should, in the case of piece-workers, be merged intothe piece-work rates by means of appropriate percentageincrease in the tonnage or yardage rates; and(ii) That the resulting revised rates and the existing minimashould be continued by an agreement between the twosides of the industry until December 1947, at which dateeither side might give six months&apos; notice of amendmentor termination of the agreement.These proposals would involve an undertaking by the Govern-ment to continue a system of financial pooling on the lines of thatnow provided by the Coal Charges Act and to maintain the priceof coal at a level which would ensure a reasonable credit balance forthe industry. The cost of the proposals, assuming that there wasno increase in output, would not exceed  3,000,000 to  4,000,000per annum, which was no more than the cost of the suggested PitBonus Scheme, which, if the proposals were accepted, could bedispensed with. The Lord Presidents Committee had approved theproposals, but, in view of the Government undertaking involved,had invited him to submit them to the War Cabinet. He wassatisfied that the scheme would provide a real incentive to piece-workers to increase their production and would establish settledconditions on which the future planning of the industry could bebased.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he wasstrongly in favour of the scheme put forward by the Minister ofFuel and Power. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he alsothought that the proposals were on the right lines.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Minister of Fuel and Powerand authorised him to give the undertaking set forth inparagraph 3 of W.P. (44) 146.Washington: 4.   The War Cabinet had a discussion about the need forJoint Liaison continuance of the Joint Liaison Publicity Committee, Washington.Publicity They were informed that about a year ago the then FinancialCommittee. Secretary to the Treasury (Captain Crookshank) had visitedAmerica to examine the staffing of British Government establish-ments and to find ways and means of reducing them. He hadreported in favour of the abolition of this Committee.The question of the Committee&apos;s continuance had then been thesubject of discussion between the Service Ministers and theChancellor of the Exchequer, and the latter had accepted thestrongly expressed views of the Secretary of State for War andthe Secretary of State for Air that, in their considered judgment,the Committee should continue.The post of Chairman of the Committee had been vacantthroughout the greater part of 1943, but had been filled, in December1943, by the appointment of Air Vice-Marshal MacNeece Foster.Early in February 1944, in the early, stages of the Anziolanding, Air Vice-Marshal MacNeece Foster had given an off-the-record talk to the Press. Contrary to the terms on which the talkhad been given, extracts from it had been given wide publicity inthe Press as made on the authority of a &quot; high British source.&quot; ThePrime Minister, whose attention had been drawn to these state-ments, had taken strong exception to them, and had urged thatstatements of this kind should not be made without expressMinisterial authority. He had asked that the. Committee should besuppressed.

The Secretaries of State for War and Air had urged that theCommittee should continue, and the matter had accordingly beenbrought before the War Cabinet.In the ensuing discussion, the Secretary of State for War andthe Secretary of State for Air gave their reasons for favouring thecontinuance of the Committee. In their view, it was an advantageto have this Committee in Washington, the Minister of Informa-tion&apos;s office being mainly centred in New York. They maintained,moreover, that the Committee had done much valuable work, moreparticularly by establishing close relations with the AmericanServices and by getting them to pass information about the BritishServices to the American Press.On the other hand, objection was seen to a Committee whichhandled publicity matter, operating under the aegis of the JointStaff Mission, independently of the Ministry of Information.The War Cabinet supported the Prime Minister&apos;s viewthat it was undesirable that the Joint Liaison PublicityCommittee, Washington, should continue to operate underthe aegis of the Joint Staff Mission, the Head of whichwas responsible to him as Minister of Defence.The War Cabinet also took the view that any organisationin the United States dealing with Service publicity shouldbe subject to the control of the Minister of Information.The War Cabinet accordingly invited the three ServiceMinisters to discuss with the Minister of Informationwhat arrangements should be made to carry on the work,hitherto done by the Joint Liaison Publicity Committee,under the control of the Minister of Information.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7 th March, 1944.
