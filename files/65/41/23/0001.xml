The most serious hadbeen carried out on the 18th February on both sides of the road fromCampoieone to Anzio. The attacks had been held and the linepractically restored by counter-attacks. On the main front ourattempts to take the Cassino monastery had not yet succeeded.The campaign in the Solomon Islands had been completedexcept for a few isolated Japanese garrisons.In the North the enemy had held the Russian thrusts towardsPskov, whilst withdrawing, his forces from Staraya Russa.

The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat on the night the 18th/19th February 179 people had been killedand 484 seriously injured. Figures for last nighfs raid were notyet complete, but so far 109 persons had been reported as killed.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatit looked as though the series of attacks, starting with that on the21st/22nd January, represented the inauguration of a new offensiveagainst London. He also gave figures which suggested that thenumber of enemy raiders which had crossed the coast and penetratedto the London area on recent raids had been rather larger than theestimates at first given by A.D.G.B.The Prime Minister said that he was arranging for a meetingof the Night Air Defence Committee to be held later in the week.Every endeavour should, of course, be made to arrive at the accurateassessment of the strength of enemy attacks.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.[27001-1]

Affairs said that ourAmbassador at Madrid took the view that the Spaniards were nowprepared to agree to a settlement of outstanding issues wherebyno wolfram would be exported from Spain to Germany for sixmonths, the German Consulate at Tangier would be closed, and theAllies would obtain possession of all the Italian ships in SpanishTerritorial Waters except two, which would be the subject ofarbitration. If we could reach a settlement on these terms, thiswould be very favourable to us.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the latest information as to the position in regard to thesefour countries. This information is contained in the Secretary&apos;sStandard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Parliament. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theHours of War Cabinet that it had, at an earlier stage, been agreed that,Business in the beginning in March, the House of Commons would sit for an extraHouse of hour, the normal hour of rising becoming 6&apos; p.m. instead of 5 p.m.Commons. A proposal was also under consideration that, a little later inthe year ?say, from the date when double summer time was intro-duced the House should sit from, say, 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. He wouldlike to know whether, if such an arrangement could be made, itwould meet with the approval of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet were of opinion that there would be greatadvantage in such an arrangement during the period of doublesummer time.5. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that on the 8th December last Lord Cork had moveda Resolution in the House of Lords in the following terms : *&quot; That in the opinion of this House the rate of allowancesfor children of officers killed on service is too low and shouldbe raised.&quot;Lord Cork had received overwhelming support for this Resolu-tion, which he had been able to cany without a division. He hadnow put down a notice for the 7th March to ask what, if any, stepsit was proposed to take on the Resolution. There was very littlepossibility of Lord Cork being induced either to abstain from theMotion or to abstain from pressing his Motion to a division onreceiving a negative reply from the Government.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was anxious thatthe War Cabinet should be aware of the position, so that theGovernment spokesman would be able to inform the House that theCabinet had again considered the proposal, but were unable torecommend any change.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, when service payand allowances had last been settled, His Majesty&apos;s Government hadmade it clear that that settlement would stand,, failing any materialchange of circumstances. The position of the children of officerskilled on service had then had most careful consideration. Anincrease in allowances at this stage would have a most unfortunate&quot;effect on the general position.Allowances forChildren ofOfficers Killedon Service.
Reference was made to the recent decision of the War Cabinetincreasing the pensions payable to widows of Retired Flag Officersre-employed as Commodores of Convoys.The question was raised whether this decision should beannounced, either on the occasion of Lord Cork&apos;s Motion in theHouse of Lords or in a debate in the House of Commons on Servicepay and allowances on the 2nd March. It was felt, however, that,unless the point was specifically raised, it would be better not toannounce this concession on either of these occasions.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he thought hewould have to announce the decision in the debate on the Estimateson the 8th March.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Government Spokesman in the House ofLords on the occasion of Lord Cork&apos;s Motion to take theline that the Cabinet had again considered the questionof the allowances paid for the children of officers killed inaction, but had found it impossible to recommend anychange.6. At their meeting on the 17th February the War Cabinethad had before them a further telegram, dated the 16th February,from the Viceroy about the Government of India&apos;s request for thecontinued importation of food grain, and had agreed that thistelegram should be considered by the Committee, consisting of thePresident of the Board of Education (in the absence of the Secretaryof State for India), the Minister of Food, the Minister of WarTransport and the Paymaster-General, which had previouslyexamined this question, with a view to the submission of a reportfor consideration by the War Cabinet on Monday, the 21st February,1944.The War Cabinet now had before them the Committees report(W.P. (44) 118). The Committee, while impressed by the insistencewith which the Viceroy urged the case for some further degree ofassistance to the Indian Food Grain position, were clear that thedifficulty was the provision of the requisite shipping. The infor-mation available to them was that shipping on the scale necessarycould not be made available, save at a cost of a further dangerousinroad into the British import programme or a serious interferencewith operational plans. The Committee had considered alternativemethods of assisting the Viceroy and recommended consideration ofthe following : (a) a further diversion to India of the shipments of food grainsdestined for the Balkan stockpile in the Middle East.This might amount to 50-000 tons, but would need WarCabinet approval,, while United States reactions wouldalso have to be ascertained;(V) there would be advantage if ships carrying military or civilcargo from the United States or Australia to India couldalso take a quantity of bagged wheat;(c) the Viceroy should be asked to consider to what extentskilful publicity could be used to magnify the effect ofsuch supplies of food grains as could be made available;(d) the Government of India should be asked to use to thefullest advantage such supplies of barley as would bemade available from Iraq, probably 50,000 tons.The President of the Board of Education reviewed the recom-mendations made by the Committee, and added that any diversionof shipping from operational purposes did not lie within theCommittee&apos;s competence and would have to be considered elsewhere.It was suggested that, in view of the opinions expressed by theCommander-in-Chief in India and the Supreme Commander, South-East Asia Command, as to the military importance of maintaining
adequate supplies of food grains for India, enquiry should be madeof the Viceroy as to what military stores now under order for Indiathose Commanders would be prepared to sacrifice with a view tothe space so made available being used for the shipment of wheat.It was made plain that room could not be found for consignmentsof wheat to India except at the expense of other cargo, as all shipssailing to India were fully loaded.The Minister of War Transport informed the War Cabinetthat he had further examined the position. He was impressed bythe Government of India&apos;s reluctance to accept barley if that couldbe avoided. He felt now, after consultation with the Middle EastSupply Centre, that the right course would be to abandon theproposed despatch of 50,000 tons of Iraqi barley to India. Thatbarley could be usefully absorbed in the Middle East. In that event,he could now undertake to provide shipping for the shipment toIndia, in its place, of 50,000 tons of wheat. Any such arrangementwould be entirely independent of the suggestion that a contributionof 50,000 tons of food grains should be obtained from the Balkanstockpile.The President of the Board of Education expressed hisreadiness to accept the proposal of the Minister of War Transport.After further discussion, the War Qabinet agreed as follows : (1) The proposal to ship 50,000 tons of barley from Iraq shouldbe abandoned.(2) 50,000 tons of wheat should be provided for India in placeof the Iraqi barley.(3) The proposal to divert approximately 50,000 tons of foodgrains now en route from Australia for the Balkan,stockpile to India should not be proceeded with.(4) The Viceroy should be asked to report what military storeshe, the Commander-in-Chief in India and the SupremeCommander, South-East Asia Command, would be pre-pared to see removed from cargoes scheduled for Indiawith a view to their replacement in those cargoes bybagged wheat.(5) A draft telegram to the Viceroy embodying these con-clusions of the War Cabinet should be prepared by thePresident of the Board of Education and submitted tothe Prime Minister.The President of the Board of Education said that he oughtto make it clear that the Secretary of State for India, on his return,might wish to raise the general question of India&apos;s future food grainrequirements.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,21st February, 1944.
