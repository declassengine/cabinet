(43) 176thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.MediterraneanTheatre.Pacific.&quot;NavalOperations.ShippingLosses.MilitaryOperations.Italy.Pacific.Eussia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious six days.Bomber Command had carried out three attacks on Berlin :on the 29th December and the 1st and 2nd January. Mosquitosorties had also been made on ten other cities in Germany.During December 1943 11,800 tons of bombs had been droppedby the R.A.F., 11,300 of them on Germany. The United States AirForce had dropped 2,430 tons, half on Germany and the rest onOccupied Territory.During 1943 the R.A.F. had dropped 136,400 tons of bombs onGermany (including 21,000 tons on Berlin) and 21,000 tons on Italyand Occupied Territory, making a total of 157,400 tons. 2,400aircraft had been lost in these operations. United States aircrafthad dropped 24,400 tons on Germany. In comparison, the Germanshad dropped 65,000 tons on the United Kingdom during the wholeof the war, including 9,000 tons on London.&quot; Crossbow &quot; targets had been attacked during the week withfairly satisfactory results.Enemy losses for the week, including claims by the UnitedStates Air Force, amounted to 64 destroyed and 26, probablydestroyed. Our losses amounted to 74 bombers and 8 fighters and1 Coastal Command aircraft. The United States had lost47 bombers and 4 fighters.In the Mediterranean the Allied Air Forces had carried outover 5,000 sorties in support of the land battle.In the Pacific 161 Japanese aircraft had been claimed asdestroyed as against 15 Allied.There had been no confirmed shipping losses during theprevious 6 days, but belated reports of sinkings amounted to16,671 tons. Total losses in December (including ships sunk duringthe air attack on Bari) amounted to 154,295 tons.Operations on the Italian front had been hampered by weather,but on the right the 8th Army had cleared Ortona and were makingprogress towards Tollo. In the United States sector some progresshad also been made.In New Guinea a successful landing had been made at Saidor.In New Britain the landing at Gloucester Bay had beenestablished and the aerodrome captured.The Russians had made very good progress in the Kiev sectorand were driving on to the West and to the South-West. The latterdrive was the more important, as it threatened the main railwaycommunications on which the German troops in the Dneiper salientdepended.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.ForthcomingOperationsAgainstWesternEurope.Proportion ofBritish andUnited StatesForces;(PreviousPreference:W.M. (43) 176thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Deputy Prime Minister said that at the last Meeting-reference had been made to the very misleading statement bySenator Johnson about the proportion of British and Americantroops to be used in these operations. The Chiefs of Staff had beenasked to report whether from the military point of view there wasany objection to a further statement being made on the matter, and,if it were decided to make a statement, what form it should take.On the 29th December, 1943, the United States Chiefs of Staffhad published1 a statement that the exact proportion of British- and1American troops in the joint operations was a military secret, andthat there had been no disagreement in the matter between theAmerican and British Chiefs of Staff.The Deputy Prime Minister suggested that, in view of thestatement published by the United States Chiefs of Staff, the mattershould be allowed to rest where it was.The War Cabinet-Agreed&apos; with, this view.

(43) 176thConclusions,Minute 4.)Poland:UndergroundResistanceMovement.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 137thConclusions,Minute 4.)Italy.SuggestedAdherenceto AtlanticCharter.3. The War Cabinet was given the latest information aboutdevelopments in these three countries. This is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theItalian Government had notified the British and United StatesGovernments of their desire to adhere to the principles of theAtlantic Charter. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat in the nature of the case the present Italian Government couldnot be regarded as having much representative capacity, and itseemed premature for them to take action of this kind at thisjuncture. In the circumstances he had taken the line that adiscouraging reply should be made to the Italian Governmentsproposal.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the view of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.Italy.ProposedPublication ofLong ArmisticeTerms.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet that the Long Armistice Terms had never beenpublished. Hitherto the Chiefs of Staff had been againstpublication.When Parliament met again there would be renewed pressurefor the publication of these Terms. Non-publication inevitablygave rise to suspicions as to what the Terms contained. Unlessthere was some military objection, therefore, he would like to seethe Terms published.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff to give further considerationto this matter and to report to the War Cabinet in time toenable   a  decision  to  be   reached   before  Parliamentreassembled.GermanPrisoners ons.s. &quot;Kerlogue&quot;6. The War Cabinet were informed that, after the action inthe Bay of Biscay which had resulted in the sinking of threeGerman destroyers, the s.s. Kerlogue, flying the Eire flag, hadsignalled that she had 160 survivors on board.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Kerlogue hadbeen signalled and told to put into Fishguard, but had in fact saileddirect to a port in Southern Ireland. The War Cabinet wasinformed that the circumstances suggested that there might havebeen good reasons for this course. The Eire Government had nowgiven an undertaking that the prisoners would be interned.
5 W.M. 1 (44).The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, nevertheless, anopportunity should be taken of interrogating the Master of theKerlogue in regard to these German prisoners. He undertook tokeep in touch with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs inregard to any action taken in this matter.Select 7.   The Secretary of State for War informed the War CabinetCommittee that the Chairman of one of the Sub-Committees of the Selecton National Committee on National Expenditure had circulated a MemorandumExpenditure. (it was thought to the Co-ordinating Committee) about mattersrelating to &quot; Crossbow.&quot; A copy of this Memorandum had beenhanded by this M.P. to a member of the Army Council, who hadshown it to the Secretary of State. He (the Secretary of State) hadmade it clear that he regarded the matter as of such gravity thathe would be bound to hand the Memorandum to the Deputy PrimeMinister. The Memorandum clearly contemplated that what wereoperational issues should be brought within the orbit of theCommittee.Grave objection was seen by the War Cabinet to the circulationto members of the Select Committee on National Expenditure ofmemoranda dealing with these operational issues.The Deputy Prime Minister was invited, as a first step, todiscuss the matter with the Chairman of the SelectCommittee.Siam.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 574) proposingthat His Majesty&apos;s Government should make a declaration ingeneral terms in favour of the restoration after the war of a freeand independent Siam. President Eoovevelt and GeneralissimoChiang Kai-shek had already made such declarations. In defaultof any similar declaration on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government,our organisations were hampered in obtaining information andmaintaining contacts with the Free Siamese Movement.In discussion, the view was expressed that we should not makeany general statement which might hamper our hands in regard toa country at war with us. In particular, we must be careful toavoid specific commitments in regard to boundaries.The War Cabinet-Accordingly asked for an opportunity to examine theterms of the proposed declaration before reaching adecision. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsundertook to prepare and circulate a draft.Civil ServiceLeave.(PreviousReference:W.M.(41)78thConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (43) 588) proposing that annualleave for the Civil Service in 1944 should be extended from 16 to18 working days with the object of securing that, so far aspracticable, all Civil Servants had a break of a fortnight on end.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theremight be some difficulty in settling the date on which annual leaveshould start in 1944. It was agreed that this point should beconsidered later.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals contained in the Memorandum by ;the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,3rd January, 1944.
