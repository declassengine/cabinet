Poland.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)36thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The War Cabinet had a further discussion about therelations between Poland and Russia. A record of the discussionis contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War CabinetConclusions.Demobilisation.ProposedStatement.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)27tliConclusions.)2. Reference was made to the draft White Paper on Demobi-lisation which had been circulated to the War Cabinet by theMinister of Labour and National Service (WP. (44) 162).The Prime Minister said that he had given further considera-tion to this matter and he thought that from the point of view ofmorale of the troops, the present would be an unfortunate time tolay a White Paper on this subject. It was also relevant that, on atwo-stage ending of the war, there would be far less scope fordemobilisation from the Navy than from the other two serviceswhen hostilities with Germany ended. While, therefore, he wasfully confident of the merits of the scheme, he thought it would bebetter not to publish it at the present time; he suggested that hemight give some general indication in a broadcast speech, in thenear future, of the points fundamental to any sound scheme ofdemobilisation.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he wasready to accept this suggestion, but he thought that it would benecessary for the Minister of Information to take steps to dampdown discussion of this subject in the press.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Parliament. 3.   Reference was made to the Debate in the House of Lordson the following day on a motion by Lord Latham on planning.The War Cabinet was informed that the Debate might extendto two days, and the Prime Minister said that he would discusswith the Minister of Reconstruction, who would speak early in theDebate, what other Peers should speak on behalf of the Government.Oil.(PreviousReference:W.M.
