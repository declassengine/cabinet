Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.Pacific.NavalOperations.Mediterranean.South-EastAsia.MilitaryOperations.Italy.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command had made heavy attacks on Berlin andMagdeburg.Coastal Command had attacked two U-boats, possiblydamaging one. Off Norway one merchant ship had been torpedoedand others hit.&quot; Crossbow&quot; targets had also been attacked by our own andUnited States forces.Enemy losses for the week, including claims by the UnitedStates Air Forces, amounted to 41 destroyed. Allied lossesamounted to 106, including 91 R.A.F. bombers.&apos;10,300 sorties had been flown, 97 per cent, on targets affectingthe land battle. Enemy sorties amounted to 850. On the previousSaturday, when the landing around Anzio was taking place,2,000 sorties had been flown.Enemy losses amounted to 34 compared to 40 Allied aircraft.Seven large enemy merchant ships and 28 smaller ones hadbeen claimed&apos; sunk.There had been no shipping losses nor belated reports duringthe previous week. The confirmed losses for January thereforeremained at 35,617 tons. During the month 3 U-boats had beensunk and 2 probably sunk.Naval forces had operated in conjunction with the landing nearAnzio. The weather had deteriorated somewhat, but it wasexpected that the facilities of the port of Anzio would proveadequate.The sinking of a Japanese cruiser by one of our submarines offPenang had been confirmed. This submarine, the Tally-Ho, hadalso sunk a merchant ship.The Allied landing on either side of the port of Anzio wasdescribed. So far, the operation had proceeded satisfactorily, andthere was no doubt that the enemy had been surprised. The exactstrength of the enemy forces in this area was not known, but hismain reserves had been drawn into the battle further south.Vigorous offensive action had been taken by British, United Statesand French troops on the Fifth Army front. Some American forceswhich had crossed the River Garigliano in front of Cassino hadbecome isolated, and the enemy had taken some 500 prisoners. Butnearer to the sea the river had been crossed to a considerable depth,and our positions held against heavy counter-attacks.Mild weather conditions in Russia had interfered withoperations except in the North. The Russian offensives aroundLeningrad had greatly improved the situation in that area. FurtherSouth the Russians had made a considerable advance from Mosyr.In the Dnieper Bend German counter-attacks had only resulted insmall gains of ground near Vinnitsa and Uman.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Air Raids.Casualties andDamage.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 151stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat on the night of the 21st/22nd January 80 bombers and12 fighter-bombers had been used. This was the largest force toattack land targets in this country in any one night since the29th/30th July, 1942. About 30 enemy aircraft had penetrated tothe London area. The attack had been very widespread, and, whilethere had been a number of incidents, the damage had not been ola serious nature. The casualties for the whole country had been28 killed and 106 seriously injured.The War Cabinets-Took note of this statement.26817-2]
Foreign Affairs.Argentina.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 7thConclusions,Minute 3.)Russia.JapaneseAtrocities.(PreviousReference:W.M. (43) 147thConclusions,Minute 3.)Italv.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported to theWar Cabinet the iatest development in connection with relationswith the Argentine. As a result of the arrest of a German agent,the attitude of the Argentine Government towards the Axis hadvery greatly stiffened, and the future relations with Germany werelikely to be decided in the next two or three days. In these circum-stances, Mr. Cordell Hull was suspending all action for the present.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he hadthought it well to telegraph personally to Premier Stalin on twoor three issues that had recently arisen in the field of relations withRussia and to make our point of view in regard to them clear. Hehad asked him to receive Sir A. Clark Kerr on his return to Moscowand allow the Ambassador to give him the fuller background. ThePrime Minister read to the War Cabinet the text of his message.The War Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement and endorsedthe terms of his message.^The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to recenttelegrams showing that the United States Government had decidedon immediate publication of a statement on Japanese atrocities.He felt that we must conform, and was circulating a draft paperto his colleagues. He would welcome any comments as soon aspossible.The Prime Minister said that he favoured bringing out facts,and did not feel that the reactions of this publicity on Japanesetreatment of our prisoners were likely to be bad.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added that heanticipated that there might be some criticism of failure to publishthis matter earlier. The answer was that in a matter of thisgravity and seriousness it was clearly impossible to publish untilthe facts were reasonably well established.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that hehad been asked to serve as the channel (since there was no other wayof despatching the message) for a message of goodwill from someseventy Members of Parliament to the meeting of Italian Liberalpoliticians which was to take place at Bari on the 28th January.The Prime Minister urged that every effort should be made tosecure, if not the cancellation, at any rate a postponement, of themeeting on the ground that the fresh offensive in Italy was a newfactor since the meeting had been arranged and that all energieswere now concentrated on the battle of Rome. We could argue thatpostponement might give the convenors a very much better meeting-place at the cost of a very brief delay. He was averse from usingthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs even as a channel incircumstances such as these.After discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsshould telegraph at once to Mr. Macmillan, asking him todo all he could to secure the postponement of this meeting.If it proved impossible to stop the meeting, it was left tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to settle whatshould be done as regards the transmission of the messagefrom British Members of Parliament&quot; Overlord.&quot; 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecurity Chiefs   of   Staff   (W.P.   (44)   24)   drawing   attention   to  theArrangements, undesirability of public pronouncements about the imminence ofContinental operations, and also to the dangers which flowed fromspeculation in the Press about forthcoming operations.The Director-General of the Ministry of Information said that,since the Memorandum was circulated, agreement had been reachedV JL-^Xs  c^XJ    $, (P,  *^to &quot;i^OLOvS
Preparations for 5. The War Cabinet had before them the following&quot; Overlord.&quot;      documents :  (a) A Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Labour andNational Service and the Minister of Production(W.P. (44) 2). During the period of this operationadditional materials, equipment and labour required forit would have to be diverted from other production orservices. The two Ministers sought approval for aprocedure whereby their respective Ministries shouldact together in examining special requirements of thischaracter, making plans to meet them and deciding indetail how any further needs should be met as and whenthey arose.(&amp;) A Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport(W.P. (44) 11) specifying the additional labour require-ments of his Ministry for railways, road transport,highways and dock labour. This labour would berequired at an early date, before the actual operation.(c) A Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Airand the Minister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (44) 13)setting out certain conditions which they would like tosee attached to the proposals in the Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service and theMinister of Production.The Prime Minister said that he thought that the meetings ofthe Committee on Anti-U-Boat Warfare, which had at one timebeen held weekly and were now held at longer intervals, should infuture only be held about once every two months. In place of thatCommittee, he thought it would be desirable that there should bea weekly meeting to review the impact of the &apos;&apos; Overlord &apos;&apos; prepara-tions on war programmes and on the civil life of the countrygenerally.  The meetings would not, of course, deal with tactical orwith the United States Authorities on this matter. Letters on thesame general lines had been sent by the Ministry of Informationto newspaper proprietors in this country, and by the appropriateUnited. States authority to newspapers in the United States,drawing their attention to the type of article on forthcomingoperations which was attended by risks, and enjoining on them toabstain from speculation.The Prime Minister said that he had been informed by theMinister of Information (who was unable to attend the meeting)that the Supreme Allied Commander intended to take selectedPress correspondents into his confidence to an extent which seemed,in all the circumstances, undesirable. He undertook to send apersonal letter to the Supreme Allied Commander on this matter.The Secretary of State for Air drew attention to an article ina recent issue of the Daily Mail dealing with the use of heavybombers in connection with &quot; Overlord &quot; which was open toobjection. It was understood that the article had not beensubmitted for censorship. This article had been written before thedespatch of the letter referred to by the Director-General of theMinistry of Information.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows : (1) The views of the Chiefs of Staff as to the undesirabilityof public pronouncements on the imminence of opera-tions on the Continent and of speculation in the Pressabout forthcoming operations were endorsed; the actiontaken by the Ministry of Information to deal with thismatter was noted with approval.(2) The Minister of Information was asked to find out why thearticle in the Daily Mail, referred to by the Secretaryof State for Air, had not been submitted for censorship.
strategical issues. The Committee, which had been set up by theWar Cabinet a week earlier, under the Chairmanship of theMinister of Production, to deal primarily with inland transportand the impact thereon of &quot;Overlord&quot; preparations, would, ofcourse, continue. The results of this and of any other similarenquiries would, however, be reported to the new Committee.General agreement was expressed with this proposal.Discussion then turned on the proposals in the JointMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service andthe Minister of Production. Objection was seen by severalMinisters to the terms of paragraph 8, which read as follows : *&quot;It would be our joint responsibility to see that otherDepartments which might be affected by our decisions underthis head were advised as soon as the appropriate proposals hadbeen adopted.&quot;Anxiety was felt lest the effect of the procedure recommendedmight be to interfere with vital arrangements of war production inthe event of an emergency, such as was contemplated, arising.The Prime Minister suggested that the point could be met byrewording the paragraph so as to make it clear that it would be thejoint responsibility of the two Ministers to see that other Depart-ments which might be affected by their decisions under this headwere consulted in good time; and equally that it must be recognisedthat it would be incumbent on all Departments concerned to do theirutmost to give effect to the proposals put to them.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s proposalto set up a new Committee under his Chairmanship todeal with the impact of &quot;Overlord&quot; preparations oncivilian life and the war programmes.(2) Approved generally the proposal in the Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour and National Service and theMinister of Production subject to the modificationproposed by the Prime Minister at &quot;X.&quot; Any pointsof difficulty which emerged from the working out of thescheme would, of course, be reported to the newCommittee referred to in (1).Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,24:th January, 1944.
T.130A/4.(CYPHER) PRIS E/CFROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO MOSCOW      /No.192.January 24th, 1944.MOST IMMEDIATE.DEDIP.,MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL.Please convey following message from Prime Minister-to Marshal Stalin.1.    We-- are sending Ambassador Clark Kerr back toyou at once: in order that he may explain a series ofdifficulties which, although they appear trifling aitthe outset, may ripen into the greatest embarrassments-   ,for us both.2.     I have been much impressed and also surprisedby the extra-ordinary bad; effects produced, here by thePravda. story to which so much official publicity wasgiven by the Soviet Government. . Bven the best friendsof Soviet Russia in England, have been bewildered.    Whatmakes it so injurious is that we cannot understand it.I am sure you know that I would never negotiate withthe Germans separately and that we tell you. every over-turc they make as you have told us.    Wo never thoughtof making ji separate peace ovon in the years when, wewere all alone and could easily have made one withoutserious loss to the British Empire and largely at yourexpense.    Why should we think of it nOw when our triplefortunes arc marching forward to victory?    If anythinghas occurred or been printed in the English newspapersannoying: to you, why can you not send me a telegram ormake your Ambassador come round and see us about it?In this way all the harm that has been done and suspicionsthat have been aroused could, be avoided. N3.    I get every day long, extracts; f r ami &quot;War and theWorking Classes&quot; which seem to make1 continuous Left-wingattacks on our administration in Italy and politics inGreece.    Considering you. haw a. representative- on theCommission for Italy, we should hope /that these ooisplaintswould be ventilated there and we should hear about themand explain our point of view between Governments.  .

a serious Parliamentary issue.    I have delayed, speakingto the House of. -Commons till I see the results of the?battle in Italy which is not going too badly, but in aweek or ten days I shall have to address the? House ofCommons and deal with the matters to which I havereferred in this telegram as-  I cannot allow chargesand criticisms to go unanswered.4,    I hav?e been wry much buoyed up with the feelingI brought back from Tehran, of our good relations and bythe message you sent me through Benes, and I try nightand day to make things go the? way you wish them and theway our triple interests require.    I am sure1 if we hadbeen together these difficulties would not haw- occurred.I am working now constantly at making the Second Fronta success and en an over larger scale, and my work isrendered, more difficult by the kind of pin-pricking towhich I have referred.    Of course a few words spoken byyou would-, blow the whole &quot;hing out of the water.    Weha we always agreed to wrl*e frankly to each other, so Ido so now, but I hope you will see Olark Kerr when hearrives and let him explain more at length the positionas between Allies not only fused together in war butlinked by pur Twenty Years:; Treaty,5.    I haw not yet been able to telegraph aboutmy talks with the Poles&apos; because&apos; I must, in matters ofsuch far-reaching importance, know where I am with the:Unitod States;.
