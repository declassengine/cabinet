He saw noreason, however, why he (the Prime Minister), whenquestioned on the matter, should not give a statement as to the meaning of Article 7 of the agreement on the lines sketched out in the President&apos;s letter.This, of course, would, in form, be no more than our own interpretation;    but we could rely on thefact that it would not be contradicted by theUnited States.The War Cabinet:-Expressed satisfaction at the termsof this document, but deferred a finaldecision until the Ministers concerned had had time to give furtherconsideration to the matter.NOTE.
