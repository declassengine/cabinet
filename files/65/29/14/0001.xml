(42) 95).THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that at thepresent time we had 10 fighter squadrons in Egypt orthe Western Desert, armed with Hurricanes.    There were5s squadrons armed with Hurricanes at Malta,      Therewere also 5 Army Co-operation squadrons in the middle east armed with Hurricanes, making a&apos; total of 18^-Hurricane squadrons in&apos; the Middle EastoOn the plan proposed, and assuming that authority was given to borrow 72 Hurricane II aircraft from those now allotted to Russia, we should still be113 short of our requirements of Hurricanes in theMiddle East over: the period from mid-February to mid^ruly, 1942,   and over 250 short of the numberof fighters of all types required in the Middle East&quot;East in this period.     This was after making allowance for a reduction of the total number of/squadrons inthe Middle East from 52 to 48o fi^ftrAt the present moment our Hurricaneproduction was insufficient to meet the requirementsof Russia and the Middle East0    As a result ourHurricane squadrons in this country were already wasting.Having regard to the information received asto the scale of Russian production of operational aircraft, it was to be doubted whether the Russiansreally attached much value to the monthly deliveries of fighter aircraft which we were making to them,,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he was afraid that this suggestion would create grave suspicion inthe mind of the   Russians., who would think that it wasthe beginning of a general falling off in our deliveries to thenioTHE PRIME MINISTER said that, while he appreciated the view put forward by the Chiefs of Staff,he felt no doubt in his own mind that it was essential,that there should be no interference with our suppliesof Hurricane aircraft to Russia,,   He thought it was ofimportance that we should be in. a position to statecategorically and without qualification that we hadpunctually fulfilled our bargain in this matter,,

viewoThis lod to some discussion on the positionin the Middle EastsTHE PRIME MINISTER said that we had been compelled to denude the Caspian-Levant front in order to reinforce the Par East;    and, owing to shippinglimitations, it was beyond our power to send sufficientre-inforcements to that area to stop a German breakthrough.,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it seemed tohim strategically unsound that we should be withdrawingtroops from this vital area, where they could be usedto support Turkey, and sending them to Australia, whichwas the area which the United States could most easilyre-inforce0THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was inagreement with this view, and proposed to take thematter up at- a suitable opportunity   with president roosevelt.., on broad?  simple lines,,In regard to the position in the western desert, THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the situation in Malta would be critical unless we could recapture Benghazi before May at the very latest,since owing to the naval situation it was no longer possible to get convoys to Malta from the West, and owingto the air situation-  it was equally impossible to get in convoys from the East unless we held the african coast line, at least as far wast as Benghazi,   arrangements had been made to fly out five or six of the bestmechanics available with 2-g- tons of tank spares,,    It was hoped  by this means to get another 100 cruiser tanksinto action quickly, and to restore confidence in the cruiser tank3 which had been somewhat shaken owing to trouble with the belt drive and lubrication..The War Cabinets-(1) Decided that the Chiefs of Staffs1recommendation could not be accepted^and that there must be no interferencewith supplies of Hurricane aircraft to russia(2) Invited the Minister of Labour and national Service, the Secretary ofState for Air, and the Minister of aircraft Production to examine what could be done to increase the outputof Hurricane aircraft toGreat George Street, S,WJ.o

- MOST secret copy No.   IW.1.(42) 24th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(25th February, 1942, 12 noon)jo S o S .R.(previous reference:tY.M.(42)l8thConclusions 9Minute 2)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P.(42) 96) containing an exchange of telegrams withWashington.The main point in discussion was theprocedure for handling the next stage in thenegotiations.The President of the United States had stated(see Telegram No. 1013 from Washington reproduced in w.P.(4S) 96) that he was confident that he could reach agreement direct with M. Stalin, and proposedto set about doing so, through M. Litvinoff in thefirst instance, supporting this action through Admiral .Standley.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that, as thePresident had said that he proposed to deal with thematter direct with M. Stalin, there was some riskof giving offence if we asked him to adopt adifferent procedure.      In his view it was ofadvantage to us that the matter should be handled bythe President, and there was much more likelihood of an agreement being reached if the negotiations were so handled by him.     He also thought that itwas possible that the President had in mind to linkup discussion with the Russians on this matter, withthe possibility of getting them to declare war on japan.In the other hand, the view was expressed that our relations with Russia would be imperilledif we were now to allow the United States to take the lead in these negotiations.     It would be particularly unfortunate if the United States tried to bargainagreement on this matter for a Russian declaration ofwar on Japan.Again, what Russia wanted was an agreementwith this country.     All they hoped for from theUnited States, was that they would not prevent thiscountry from reaching an agreement with the U.S.S.R.There was no doubt that Russia regarded this country as of the greatest importance from the point of viewof the post-war settlement of Europe, and wanted towork with us after the war.It was also suggested that President Rooseveltwas not perhaps fully aware of the difficulties of reaching an agreement on this matter with M. Stalm,and that if he entered into discussions and reached a deadlock the results might be very serious.     On theother hand, if negotiations were started at a lower level:, the President could always be brought in at alater stage.-1-

fliThe procedure favoured by THE foreign secretary was, therefore, that he should have a talk with Mr. Winant, who was returning to the UnitedStates on a short visit on the following day, andshould ask him to explain to the President that wehad some doubts as to the wisdom of the procedure proposed by the President;    and should prefer it if mr. Winant, on his return from the United States,could enter into tripartite discussions in London with       ,   f \ ourselves and the Russians on this question./! Whilenc ****       p*c       we should in his view ask the United States authorities is^Uedt a ia*4*u.*i5m**(tow* / to consider the adoption of this procedure, ifjgI I,  ^ . .       / President Roosevelt nevertheless adhered to hisl^f^^ OUa / scheme of trying to reach agreement direct withAM. Stalin, we should have to let him make theattemptsIn further discussion the importance of reaching agreement with the U.S.S.R. was stronglyemphasised,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that, while we had mentioned the matter brieflyto the Dominion High Commissioners, we had not yetinformed the Dominion Prime Ministers of the approach to the United States.     He thought that the time had come when we   ought to give them a resume of theposition.&quot;the PRIME MINISTER agreed with the course proposed,   ut suggested that action should be deferred until after the further Meeting to beheld that evening.The War cabinet invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to prepare, for consid-eration at a further Meeting to be held at/ I   Aa- i  &apos;    J Pain&apos; that evening, a draft irftlfgrnm to-jua^v^w y m tou^^y     Zj?aohingfe^n setting out the procedure which he suggested should be adopted forthe next stage in the discussions.Great George Street, S.W.1*
