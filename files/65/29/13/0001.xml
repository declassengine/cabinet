(42) 25rd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(23rd.February, 1942, 6.0 p.m.)AUSTRALIAN THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet thatTROOP MOVE-       the 7th Australian Division, now on its way back fromMENTS. Palestine to Australia, had touched at Colombo andwas    in the Indian Ocean.   This Division was   the only, unit, which could be diverted immediately to Burma4where, if   it    could arrive in time,    it   would belikely to turn in our favour the battle for Rangoon.If so diverted,   it     could have arrived on the 26thor 27th February.It had therefore been suggested to the australian government that they should agree to this Division being diverted to Burma, in view of the critical nature Of thefighting there and of the important strategic issues involved.The Australian Government had refused this request.He had, however, thought it right to send another telegram to the Australian Government on 20th February urging them to change their mind.   Sir Earle Page had sent a strongtelegram pressing   them to adopt the same course.In view of the important issue involved, the PrimeMinister had put the facts to President Roosevelt, whohad then also sent a strong appeal to the AustralianGovernmentoWhile awaiting a reply from the australian government to  his second request, he (the PrimeMinister) had taken upon himself the responsibilityof ordering the convoy to turn North, so that, in theevent of the Australian Government acceding to our request, no delay would be entailed.The Prime Minister said that the australian government, after full consideration, had refused   hissecond request.   He read the following extract fromtelegram No. 139    from the Australian Government received on 21st February,&quot;In your telegram No. 233 it was clearlyimplied that the convoy was not (repeat not)proceeding to the Northwards.   From yourtelegram No, 241 it appears that you havediverted the convoy towards Rangoon and hadtreated our approval to this vital diversionas merely a matter of form.   By doing soyou have established a physical situationwhich adds to the. dangers of the convoyand the responsibility of the consequences of such diversion rests upon you.&quot;The Prime Minister said that on receipt of this reply the convoy had been ordered to proceed toAustralia.-1-*   -   *   -

The Prime Minister said that he took full responsi-bility for Iris action in changing the course of the convoy..   As soon as the convoy had turned North, itsescort had been increased, and this increased escortwould, continue to accompany the convoy-    It si happenedthat some of -one transports would now not have sufficient-ent fuel to proceed to Australia without another callat, Colombo to re fuel ,Th   I-ime Minister sc.d.that he ;--egretted that,owing to a misundorstending, Sir Earle Page had notbeen informed when the convoy had been ordered, to turnNorth.   He also said that ib had been hoped, that the reply would, be received from the Australian government within a few hours,.    But. the reply had not beenreceived, for nearly SO hoursSIR EARLE PAGE said that he much regretted the failure  of the efforts that had been made to persuade the Australian Government to send theseAustralian troops to Rangoon,   He felt sure   that theletter ho had now received from the Prime minister would, dissipate any possible misunderstanding on thepart of the Ausoralian Government in regard to thePrime Minister&apos;s action in ordering the temporarydiversion of the convoy,.      He noted, that the transportswould, return to he re--fuelled at Colombo -   He was sure that the greatest importance   attached to astrong force being available in Ceylon in order to matesure that the whole of the island, and. its facilities were denied to the Japanese,   He thought, therefore,that it might be suggested to the Australian Governmentthat the Australian troops should be disembarked, atColombo and used to reinforce the garrison, at anyrate for the present.    If the Prime Minister felt anyreluctance in putting this proposition to theAustralian Government, he (Sir Earle Page) would bevery ready to make the suggestion on his own res responsibility-bility, provided that the&quot;Chiefs of Staff furnished him with an appreciation, which he could quote, setting out the importance of this course.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that this was a valuablesuggestion, and    that the Chiefs of Staff would,furnish a short appreciation,THE CHIEF 0? THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat it would not be possible    to hold the shipping at Colombo.&apos;  it would not be worth while for the troops to disembark in Ceylon unless they stayed for a periodof say a month or six weeks,-.The War Cabinet:-(1)  Invited the Chiefs of Staff to furnishSir Earlo Page, at the earliest moment,. with a short appreciation on the linespropos c&amp;:(2)  Took note that Sir Earle Page proposedto put forward this suggestion to theAustralian Government on his Own responsi-bilaty.reat George Street, S.W-1.
