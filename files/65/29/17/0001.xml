(42) 57th CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex.(25th March., 1942. 12 Noon. )the SECIiETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs reminded the vfar Cabinet that President Roosevelt had expressed a strong wish to discuss the Russian frontierquestion with M0 Litvinoff,   We had throughout doubted the wisdom of this course, but had been unable to dissuadethe president    The latter had had a conversation withMo Litvinoff on the 12th March,   The Soviet ambassador at Washington had now been instructed to inform thePresident, that the Soviet Government had taken full note of this coramunicationo    This was the full extent of theSoviet reply, the reason being that they had not them-selves made any communication to the United StatesGovernment about their negotiations with us, and thatthey regarded the President&apos;s observations as merelyindicating the United States point of view for their information,&apos;    The Soviet Government were now pressing usto resume discussions as soon as possible,,The Foreign Secretary said that he thought thebest course was to explain our difficulties tothe UnitedStates Government and say that we felt bound to go ahead with the negotiations.   He was also satisfied that,if wewere to conclude a Treaty on the lines proposed, the sooner we did so the better.    The existence of these negotiations would become widely known, and delay wasdangerous,\The Foreign Secretary read to the War Cabinetthe first draft of a telegram on this matter to lord halifax,Discussion followed.The War Cabinet concurred generally in theviews expressed by the Foreign Secretary, and agreed that the following points should beincluded in the telegrams to be sent to our ambassador at Washington:-(a) The Soviet Government had informed us oftheir answer to President Roosevelt,.    Itwas clear that they did not wish todiscuss the matter further with theUnited States Government,,(b) Further delay in dealing with the matter would be harmful.   We had reached theconclusion that in present circumstances we felt bound to go ahead with treaty negotiations with the Soviet Government onthe basis of their frontier claims,,

We are therefore faced with a position whereire are bound to take a decision of our own in this matter.   I am convinced that we cannot allow it to drag on any further without incurring grave responsibilities and dangers.   I feel convincedtoo that no continuance of the present discussion, either with thePresident or with Stalin, will lead to any satisfactory result,vrtiereas it may well make it more difficult than it is at present for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take a decision of their own.2.   I fully realise that the President will not like it ifwe now tell Stalin that we are prepared to go ahead v/ith our treaty negotiations on the basis of his frontier claims, and that in doing so we shall be creating trouble for him with his public opinion.   Hadcircumstances been more favourable I should have naturally wishedto spare him this embarrassment, but things being as they are i cannot take the risk of keeping Anglo-Russian relations in a state of suspended animation any longer.   The;war situation has now becometoo serious for such dilatory tactics..3*   I must ask you therefore to take up the matter at once with the President and speak to him on the lines of my immediately following telegram.   Before doing so I hope that you will be able todiscuss the matter with Lord Beaverbrook, who knows all about thisquestion and has taken part in our many Cabinet discussions upon it..ioxi would, I know, find him helpful to you as expressing at firsthand the War Cabinet&apos;s view.[Copies sent to Sir E.

In a word, His.Majesty&apos;s.Government cannot run   ...the risk of allov/ing this question to drag on any longer.Anglo-Russian relations cannot be-left in suspense at this ,orftSal moment in the.war,.-. ..J3till less, can His Majesty&apos;s..;:.Government incur the. danger of antagonising the Soviet   ...,Government at a moment/when the closest Allied co-operation in Europe is of such vital and urgent importance.     they  ..have reached the conclusion therefore that they must in^the.Somrnon interest tell the/Soviet Government that^ they areprepared to negotiate a treaty whereby among 0^rtliingswe would implicitly recognise the Soviet Government&apos;s claimst^the 1940 frontiers (other thair the Russo-Polish frontier),
4.    We hope that the President, whatever his viewsmay be with regard to our policy, will agree that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have taken all possible steps to consult the United States Government before taking action.5,    We fully realise that the President will find it difficult, in view of his public opinion, to expressapproval of the Anglo-Russian treaty which we hope will result from these negotiations.    But even if he cannotapprove our proposed line of action we trust that he willat least understand our reasons, will make due allowance for them and will abstain from any overt action which would indicate that there is any divergence between us...6,    Incidentally, you should make it clear-withreference to paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 1477. thatthere is no question of the President being asked to&quot;subscribe&quot; to any treaty nor has it ever been contem-plated that the treaty should be secret.7.    We hope that the President will in judgingour action bear in mind that we too have our publicopinion to consider.    There is no doubt that if thingsgo ill with Anglo-Soviet relations we should be bitterlyblamed for having rejected Stalin&apos;.s demand, and the- -Position might well become catastrophic if Stalin wereo adopt a policy more or less hostile to our interests. and were to justify it publicly on the ground that owingto the obstinacy and short-sightedness of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment he had been unable, to establish any basis ofco-operation with Great Britain.,8.    Looked at from the practical point of view the concession which we are called upon to make does not involve us in any onerous commitment.9,    I did not fail to observe that thePresident in his communication to Stalin offered at thesuccessful conclusion of the war to support all. legitimatemeasures by the Soviet Government to obtain completefuture security for the territories of the Union.Similar assurances were offered to Stalin by myself during -the discussions of last December,,    The fact that Stalinrejected them then as he rejects them now shows clearly that this matter cannot be dealt with merely as a securityproblem.    It has a psychological character which derives ram the fact that for 20 years the Soviet Government hasnot been in relations of equality or confidence with anyof the great Western Powers.    Stalin&apos;s admittedlydiscreditable deal, with Germany does not affect RussiansJlaim in his eyes.     Indeed he has chosen the case of the940 frontiers as a criterion of our intentions preciselybecause we had at the time refused to recognise the soviet union&apos;s annexation of the Baltic States as a strategicnecessity and because he cannot admit either to himself0i* to 1iie Russian people that the Government with which he is now in alliance still maintains its formal disapproval. of
of the Soviet Government&apos;s action and still declines to acknowledge the Soviet Government&apos;s right to recover fromthe common enemy what they consider to be their ownterritory.10.    Meanwhile the Soviet Government is bearing the brunt of the fighting and Great Britain, apart fromsupplying war material, is not in a position to give direct assistance to the Soviet army in the coming German attack in the Ukraine.    This unfortunate situation at what may-be the crisis of the war makes it all the more necessarythat we should not appear any longer to be refusing to makethe one political concession which the Soviet Governmenthave so far asked of us.The recognition of the Soviet Government&apos;s claim totheir 1940 frontiers can of course be no substitute for thematerial help Which we should like to be able to give themin the battlefields of Europe, but as a timely gesture in.evidence of our. sympathy in the Russian struggle and our confidence in Russian success it may be of inestimable valtie^[Copies sent to members of War Cabinet andSir E.
