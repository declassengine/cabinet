(42) 8thConclusions,Minute 1. )THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS referred to General Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s forth-coming visit to india     Attention was called totelegrams from Sir A. Clark Kerr (No. 10?) and fromthe Viceroy (No. 161-S) in which reference wasmade to the fact that General Chiang Kai-shek had expressed his desire to t?ee Gandhi and Nehru.The view was expressed that it would be most unfortunate if the impression was given thatthe Generalissimo had come to India to visit theViceroy, Gandhi and Nehru.      The right course wasthat he should come to India to visit the viceroy and members of his Council!    the Viceroy should then ask him what   other persons he wished to see,and should take steps to make sure that he sawpersons representative of a wide selection ofcommunities and sections of opinion, in orderthat he might realise the diversity in India.The War Cabinets-Invited the Secretary of State forIndia to despatch a telegram to theViceroy on these linescTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY referred totelegrams Nos. 122 and 126 from Sir A, Clark Kerr,who reported that the Chinese were very depressed,Among the reasons for this were our continuedwithdrawals in Malaya, the rumours that we scornedtheir (Chinese) military help in Burma, and the belief that we did not take thera into our confidence and treat them as equals.In this connection THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet a copy of a telegram (No. 66094)which he had sent to General Wavell on 23rd Januaryon the question of accepting military help fromthe Chinese in Burma, and of General Wavell&apos;s reply(No0 005 &quot;S).One suggestion considered was that theForeign Secretary should invite the Generalissimoto pay a visit to this country.-     It was, no doubt,unlikely that he could do so    but, even so, theoffer of an invitation might please him and help to restore confidence.     The general view taken,however, was that it was probably undesirable forGeneral Chiang Kai-shek to absent himself from china for too long, and the suggestion was not therefore pursued.

Reference was made to the request which general Chiang Kai-Shek had made for a loon of  100millions,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explainedthat there were&apos; difficulties about this proposal,which moreover seemed unlikely to be of much practicalassistance to China.      The view taken had been that,while we were prepared to give China some - financial help,we should first- find out what the United States wereprepared to do in the matter, more particularly now that the Chinese had refused an offer made by president Roosevelt to provide the money to maintain in the field certain Chinese forces.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that,  in view ofthe difficult position which had now arisem, hethought that he and the Chancellor of the exchequer should give further consideration, as a matter of urgency, to the question of giving financial help to china.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.Reference was also, made to the questionwhether the attitude adopted by the Colonialauthorities in the Par East generally, and particularlyin Singapore, towards the Chinese population in their territories, was consonant with the fact that china was now an important Ally.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to consider whether itwould be; appropriate that he should send instructions to the colonial governors in the Par East on thismatter.orge Street, S.W.1. ,
