Although it might be preferable to change certain points in the agreement, the attempt to do so mightdisturb a delicately balanced situation, and he proposedthat ^Admiral Godfroy should be asked to continue theagreemento    The Admiralty concurred in this view? and proposed that Admiral Ounningham should be authorised to request Admiral Godfroy to reaffirm the agreement with thenew Commarider-in-ChiefoIn discussion, the view was expressed that thopresent opportunity ought to be taken to endeavour tosecure an agreement more favourable to ourselves.-..   Wehad one strong card which we could play, namelyf. that wecould offer to agree to repatriation of the French crews,,although care would have to be taken to ensure that doGaulLe-lsts were not forced to return against their- will,-.We might hope, by starting propaganda offeringrepatriation to those who wished to return to France,, toproduce a state of affairs in which we could obtain anagreement more favourable to ourselves, our ultimate objective being to secure, if possible, control of theFrench Warships at Alexandria.As against this, it was argued that the Frenchsailors would know that if they returned to France and left the ships to be taken over by us, they would be punished by the Vichy Government on their returnoThe general view of the War Cabinet was that it-would be right to take the present opportunity toendeavour to secure a new agreement   more favourable to ourselves.    It was felt, however, that it would be undesirable for- the negotiation of this new agreement to be ttaflertaken by the Acting Oammander-in^-ehia-f(,Vice-Admiral Pridham-Whlppell), and that the negotiation of the new agreement should be taken up by the newCommander-in-Chief, Rear-Admiral Harwood, when he reachedAlexandria^

The War Cabinet accordingly -Invited the First Lord of the admiralty to inform Admiral Cunningham that heshould request Admiral Godfroy tocontinue the existing agreement in force during the short interval which wouldelapse until Admiral Harwood arrived in alexandria, when consideration would begiven to the negotiation of a revisedagreement.The First Lord of the Admiralty was also asked to consider whether he could shorten the period before Admiral Harwood reachedAlexandria.Great George Street, S.W.1
