(42)  17th CONCLUSIONS , MINUTE 5.Conf idential Annex^(6th February, 1942 - 12 noon)[, So S o Soreviouseference:.M. (42) 16 thonclusions,minute 5. )Tho War Cabinet continued&quot; their discussionof the Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs on Policy towards Kussia (W.P.  (42^ 48).THE MINISTER OF WAR PRODUCTION said that allthat M. Stalin was asking for was recognition of hisfrontiers as they had existed in June, 1941, when germany had invaded Russia.     At the same- date wehad made a Treaty with Russia which had&apos;wiped outeverything which had passed between our two countriesup to that date.     M. Stalin had, however, qualifiedhis request for recognition of the 1941 boundarieson the West by making it clear that these boundarieswould be subject to a special arrangement so far asPoland was concerned.      Moreover, these frontiers were necessary for Russia&apos;s security and security was one ofthe factors dealt with in the Atlantic Charter.     Weshould therefore (subject, of course,  to views ofthe United States on this subject) agree to IL  Stalin&apos;sreouest.The Minister said that our relations with Russia&apos;,Tere-deteriorating;      we could not afford to wait but should hold out a hand of friendship and seal the bondwith them as quickly as possible.     It was worthremembering that so far Russia had contributed far more to the war effort than the United States- to whom we had made such frequent concessions.      In a numberof matters   we had not acceded, or* not acceded at allpromptly, -co Russia&apos;s requests, e.g.  her requests formilitary aid or her request that we should declare war on Finland.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he wished to ask the Cabinet to look at the matter fromthe point of view of Anglo-Russian relations in theirwider sense.    It was of the utmost importance -that theserelations should uc put on a better basis.     M. Stalinwished to sign Treaties with us relating, not merely to our alliance in the war, but also to post-war co-operation.     Unless we were in a position to signTreaties with him, we should not get any real co-operation.     He felt sure that no treaty could be signed except on the basis of Russia&apos;s June   1941,frontiers with Finland,the Baltic States and Roumania.In this matter our part should be to reconcile the divergent points of view of Russia and the United States.      He thought, however, that suchreconciliation was by no means out of the question.- 1 -

One way of doing it would be to acceptMo Stalin&apos;s&quot; demand as it stood; subject, of course,to success in obtaining &quot;the. acquiescence, of the UnitedOur second course would be to concede toRussia the right to have bases in the Baltic States,.A third course would be a scheme for control by the Soviet Government of the Foreign Relations andDefences of the Baltic States,,The Foreign Secretary&apos;s present view wasthat the grant to Russia of bases in the Baltic States,if agreed to by ourselves and the United States,might be regarded by M. Stalin as  er-;-.aXly. -valuable ..    :wi+h the recognition by this country only of nis1941 frontiers.      It was also to be remembered thatthe acquisition of bases had been the first step which the Russians had themselves taken.     From the.:\tvd  States point of view the acquisition of basesmight well be easy of acceptance, since it was  acourse which they had themselves adopted.The Foreign Secretary concluded by sayingthat the course he favoured was to tell the UnitedStates Government that,in the interests of the broader issues of the war and of Anglo-Russianco-operation, we should like to accept M. Stalin&apos;claim to Russia&apos;s 1941 frontiers.     We realised,however,  that this might present difficulties to theUnited States;    and, in this event, we would ask themto consider the grant to Russia of bases in the baltic states.      He v/ould prefer to adopt this course, ratherthan the formula suggested by Lord Halifax of control by the Soviet Government of the Foreign Relations andDefences of the Baltic States.      This latter proposalwent further... but it was final. &apos; The grant of bases didnot orcclude the cession of the Baltic States at thePeacu.    It was an instalment,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that theproposal outlined by the Foreign Secretary was dangerous and might, indeed, stultify the causes for which we were fighting.      The action proposed was only tooreminiscent of what had been done in the last war.Further, as soon as one claim had been agreed to, weshould be faced with others, and we should be subjected to pressure to make concessions right and left.      Thecourse of action proposed might have a serious effecton the morale of the people of this country.     Itimplied that after the war we should be faced with thesame old problem of strategic frontiers, and so forth.In his view, the course proposed was both wrong initself and inexpedient.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF home security thought that there must be a limit to  theapplication of the principle of self-determination.He thought that after the last war this principle hadbeen allowed too wide application, and had been partly responsible for some of the difficulties which had arisen.

On the larger issue, it was mostimportant that we should maintain good relationswith Mo Stalin, and it was worth a good deal to attain &quot;this.     A successful post-war settlement would depend upon this country, the United States and russia holding to ether and maintaining order for crtime in the worldsTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that,provided we won the war, there was no doubt thatM,  Stalin&apos;s forces would be in occupation of theBaltic States and Bessarabia at the end of the war,and it would not be in our power to get them toleave.      By agreeing to accept these frontiers now,we should go a long way to remove the risk of badfeeling between this country and Russia,THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the uncertainty as to what the position would be at theend of the war.      In his view, the right plan wasthat all these matters should be settled at thePeace Conference.      The immediate point at issue was how this matter should be presented to theUnited States.     For his own part, he favoured a balanced presentation.Several Ministers thought that, if thiswas done, the result would be that the United states would immediately ask what our views were.     Theyfavoured giving the United States some indication of how our minds were moving.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEattached importance to it being clearly understoodwhether M, Stalin&apos;s claim to his 1941 boundaries in finland, the Baltic States and Bessarabia   representedhis ultimate aims in this direction.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that M.  Stalin&apos;sstatement was quite specific on-this point.After further discussion, the War Cabinet:-(l)    Invited the Foreign Secretary toprepare, for circulation to the WarCabinet, a draft telegram to lord halifax, instructing him to explain the whole position to the UnitedStates Government,  and, if possible,to President Roosevelt personally.This telegram should be a balanced statement ,      It should&apos;   set out the strong reasons whyiv was desirable to go as far asre could in the way of meetingMo Stalin&apos;s claims in this matter at the same time, the objectionsto admitting these claims should be stated, and it should be indicated that we realised that these claimsmight well present difficulties tothe United States Government, havingregard, for example, to the terms ofthe Atlantic Charter;    there shouldbe any express recognition of the factthat we were under an obligation to consult the United States before taking any action on M. Stalin&apos;sclaims,- 3 -

ISThe alternative plan of grantingRussian &quot;bases in the Baltic states should be explained, together with astatement of the arguments in fa.&quot;&quot;urof this course(2)     Agreed that the Dominion governments should not... for the  prcsscat, beinformed of the terms of ourcommunication to the United States,and that it was of the utmost importance that this communication should be treated as of the greatestsecrecy, both here and in the UnitedStates.Great George Street, S.W*1.
