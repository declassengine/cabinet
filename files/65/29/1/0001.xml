 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.).MOST SECRET. .WbMa (42)  1st 0ONflLtISTONS , MINUTE confidential Annex,(1st January, 1942, 12 Noon.)TJ.S .S.H.Visit of theSecretary ofState forForeign AffairsPoliticalDis cuss ions *THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had been struck by the absence of constraintbetween Stalin and his advisers as compared with his previous visit in 1935..The Soviet bands had played. &quot;God save the King&quot;on many occasions, and. it was an embarrassment that,we could, not return the compliment by playing the&quot;Internationale&quot;.   He proposed to mention   this point to the Prime Minister on his return.At the first meeting, on the loth December,Stalin had handed him the text of two draft Treaties.(These vould be circulated to the War Cabinet.)   He had.explained to Stalin that he had come to Moscow in thehope of signing a general document, on the lines ofthe Atlantic Charter.rather than a draft Treaty.* yOn the&apos;following day, the 17th December, M, Malskyhad.   handed to him the revised text of two draft-Treaties.    These had been more acceptable, and, forthe most part, had been within the instructions  given him by the War Cabinet,Stalin had, however, made it clear that his chief object was to obtain the Foreign Secretary&apos;ssignature to an -instrument guaranteeing to Russiaher 1941 frontiers.  He (the Foreign Secretary) h-ad.made clear the reason why he could, not sign anyinstrument o^ this kind.After two further attempts,, it had. been agreedthat the difference of opinion could not be overcome,and. the Conference had ended with the foreign secretary&apos;s acceptance of a Press    Communique&apos;drafted, by Stalin.Stalin had. made it    clear that he wished to see strong Poland, but. at the expense of Germany. The foreign secretary thought Stalin had in mind something like theCurzon Line for Poland&apos;s Eastern frontier, Polandbeing compensated, by receiving East Prussia.   ButStalin had. been willing to leave Poland, out of thepresent. Agreement in regard to frontiers.    In FinlandStalin wanted, the 1940 frontier, and as regardsRoumania, he wanted    to retain Bessarabia.From our point of view,    the greatest difficulty would, arise as regards the Baltic States, which.Stalin wished us to recognise as falling withinRussia1 s strategic frontier.  -He had. pointed, outthat we had been friends with   the Czar is t Government,which had. included, the Baltic States within theRussian frontier.

The Foreign Secretary said that this questionof frontiers would,   have to be considered by theWar Cabinet before long0 It raust be rememberedthat, if ve won the war, Russian forces   wouldprobably penetrate into Germany, and that at alater date she might well want more than her 1941frontiers. 53It would seem that Stalin&apos;s keenness on ourrecognition of   the 1941    frontiers   was partly due to Russian suspicion of   this  country, andpartly because he wished to be sure that we wereprepared to treat with Russia on equal terms.There had been no hint that Stalin would have any requirements in the Far North,  except forPetsamo.Stalin&apos;s attitude as regards Turkey had been most rea.sona.ble.   He had. agreed that we should treat-Turkey well, and offer her inducements to remainneutral, since as a neutral she provided, an effective &quot;pad&quot;.   He had expressed, no ambition withregard, to the stroke.its .Stalin had. taken very well our decision thatwe could, not send,   aircraft or troops    to south russia.   He had, however, been very keen that ourNavy and. Air Force should, assist in an operation inthe extreme North.    The possibility of affordingthis help   was being considered..   From the politicalangle it would be very helpful if we could, do so.Marshal Timoshenko had been very optimistic tthe military prospects on the soufti Russian xiwi,   .He had. said,   that the German army had definitelydeteriorated, and. that he    could continue to drivethem back throughout the winter, and intended, todo so.     Stalin had also been confident, butslightly less optimistic than Timoshenko, who hadimpressed, him (the Foreign Secretary) favourably,,While Stalin had. the highest opinion of ourNavy, he thought less of our Army.    He (the foreign secretary) had. pressed him to   send a Mission toour forces in Libya.   He thought   that this invitation would, be accepted..The Foreign Secretary said, that he had. visitedKlin, where heavy fighting had. been taking placesome two or three days before his -arrival.   Therehad. been surprisingly little transport on   theroad (the main road between Moscow and. Leningrad),and most of it had. been horse-drawn.   He had seenno wounded, and. very few German dead.,   or prisoners.The Russian soldiers had. struck him as magnificent.The junior Officers were also very impressive.The clothing of the few German prisoners whom hehad seen was of the poorest material, and. they hadcomplained, bitterly of the cold.litarytters n

Far East. The Foreign Secretary said that this matter hadbeen mentioned twice.   On the first occasion he had only explored the position tentatively, and stalin had said that he was not in   a po&amp;itiorf&apos; to declare war on Japan at the moment, since this would involve him in a Dig land war immediately.   When the matter hadbeen raised at the last interview, Stalin had said,that manv Divisions had been brought over from the East tofight in western&apos;Russia, and that new Divisions were being raised but would not   be ready to fight for three orfour monthsS talin had.indicate ed that, sooner or later, Russo-Japanese relations would   have to besettled, by force;    that he would be ready to starttalks in   the Spring, but not until then.staffers xa.utput ofquipment,Stalin, had been satisfied with   the progress ofei^ents, and thought that it would be wrong to force the pace in regard to   the signature   of a Treaty.Stalin had stated that the oroduction of aircraft and tanks had fallen after the German invasion hut had now risen again.    At the moment Russia was producingmore tanks than at the outbreak of war.The Foreign Secretary said that there was under-lying suspicion of this country in Russia.   He thoughtthat a good deal had been done to overcome it, tautthat suspicions might easily be re-aroused, at anyrate until we had reached a settlement with Russia overthe question of frontiers.   He had found it difficultto -&quot;athom Molotov&apos;s attitude, and had. invited him to cometo London probab3y:in the Spring.   Molotov had seemeddelighted, at this invitation.. Ar-ibas s a dor. Our Ambassador, who   was suffering from ill-health,had been most helpful throughout the visit.   He (theForeign Secretary) had consulted the Prime Minister,and thought the time had now been reached, when theyshould assent to Sir Staff or d&apos;s desire to be recalled,from Mos cow and to be replaced by a djplomate de carriere-THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the War cabinet was much indebted to the Foreign Secretary for what he had achieved during this visit, and also for tl.interesting account which he had given to them..eneralrepressionsf the Visit.Great George Street.
