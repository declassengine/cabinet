January 1942, 6.0 p.m.)THE UNITEDSTATES AND3TRATEGICPROBLEMS.ilovo of U.S,Troops toNorthernIreland.Naval Dis-oositions..ir Rein-rcements.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the disaster a ,Pearl Harbour had had a great effect in the UnitedStates.    They were resolved to settle matters finallywith Japan.   But they realised that the main pressuremust be kept on Germany.    As a means to this end theywere keen on the project of occupying the North and west Coast of Africa.,    He (The Prime Minister) had explained to them that our aim should be to marshal our forces, on a line Iceland - British Isles - North Africa,ready for an offensive in 1943.    But it was clear that shipping was the limiting factor in any plans that weremade.The shortage of shipping would delay the move of U.SU  troops into Northern Ireland.    Everything possible should be done for the comfort of the U.S,;  troops j    and,subject to such secrecy as to actual troop movements as was necessary for their safety, their arrival should befeatured.It would be useful to arrange for the U.S,troops to take a turn at beach defence, a Brigade at atime.As a result of events at Pearl Harbour, theUnited States had lost their naval supremacy,    By themiddle of February they would have 7 battleships in the pacific.    If the two new Japanese battleships were thenserviceable, it was probable that two U.S.  16&quot; capital ships, now in the Atlantic, would be moved to the PacificIf, however, they left these two ships in the Atlantic,it would be for consideration whether the two NELSONS,when available, should be sent out to the Pacific,As regards naval building programmes, the threenew American battleships which had been scheduled for completion in 3.943 had now been brought forward to 1942*A large number of auxiliary aircraft-carriers were to beimprovised.    Of the first 30 delivered, 15 were to be allotted to us0Two columns of heavy bomber aircraft were now on their way to the Far East;    the one^ across africa and India;    the other, across the Pacific^   ,

The Prime Minister said that he had been    * * &quot;impressed by the American attitude towards China.   they held General Chiang Kai-shek in considerable esteem^ andthey intended to assist him in raising and training avery lo.rge Chinese army     They were also keen ondeveloping communi cations&quot;with&quot; China&quot; via the Burma Road.He (the. Prime Minister) felt that we should look at the china problem from a wider angle than.hitherto.   At the back of the United States attitude was the fear that,unless we paid sufficient regard to risk that she might make a separatebe a long stop from such a peace tomovement.China, there was thepeace. It would nota combined AsiaticTHE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Chiefs of staff had. had many meetings with the two American Chiefs of staff and with General Arnold, the head of the Army Air Staff.The secretarial arrangements for these meetings had been undertaken by our own staff.   The American? had as. yet no central secretariat, but they were rotting one un-It nad been -agreed that -onere snouiu&quot;oe meetings at&quot;leastonce a week of the Combined Chiefs-of Staff, i.e., theU.S.. Chiefs of Staffs y-and:-the representatives in Washingtonof the British Chiefs of Staff;    and that the American andBritish Joint Planners should also work together.    the americans had realised the advantages of our system, andwere prepared to work with it and through it.As for the United States Navy, each of itsFleets had three Comnanders-in-Chief, the President,Admiral King and the local Commonder-in-Chief.   The system had perhaps  certain advantages, but was not one to whichwe were accustomed.The Prime Minister had alrdaWp&quot;mentioned thepossibility of   the two United States battleships now inthe Atlantic being moved to   the Pacific, but the americans had agreed to two U. S. 8&quot; eruis ers being stationed, in the Iceland area.   We, on the other hand, had agreed to let them have 10 corvettes as they were very short of all snailcraft oThe War Cabinet took note of these statements.Great George Street,. S.W.I.^-2-
