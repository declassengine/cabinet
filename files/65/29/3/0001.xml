(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may betaken in 9MOST SECRET       ensure the 8ecrecy - ^ C0PYOST. PIERREAND MIQUELON.(previous reference:W.M.(42)5th&apos;Conclusions,Minute 1. )W.M.(43) 6TH CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex,(14th January 1942   -   7,0 p.m0)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY read to the WarCabinet a copy of a telegram to the Prime Minister,giving an account of his interview with General de gaulle that morning.,     He had given General de Gaullethe draft communique (set out in telegram GREY No.305),and had done his best to get the General to accept it,The General had promised to consult his Council andreply that evening,,as regards clause (ii) the General had said that Vie could not accept supervision  &quot;by (Othernationals     of the radio station., though he would accept U.S3 and Canadian liaison officers &quot;attached totheir re-spoctive consulates,,ihe main point to which the General hadobjected was Clause (iii) of the communique, which provided that the island should he neutralised anddemilitarised, and should be considered out of thewar, and Clause (v) which provided that all armed forces should be withdrawn,,     The General had saidthat, if he agreed to this, he saw no reason why heshould not be asked to consider as out :of the war otherFree French territories which he had brought back into the struggle.      The Foreign Secretary addedthat General de Gaulle had sa^d that he never meant to keep naval forces in the islands, and that hethought that if Clauses (iii) and (v) were suppressed,ithod looked as though there was a chance that theGeneral might agree to a declaration that he had nevermeant to keep naval forces there and that they werebeing withdrawn.     He had read to the General thefirst sentence of paragraph 5 of GREY 330 - to theeffect that if the General would not settle on these terms, the Prime Minister would authorise the issueof an amended communique, and it would be for theUnited States to enforce it.     The General had replied,&quot;Will they fire on my ships?&quot;uheSIR OEME SARGENi&apos; men gave &quot;Dtie war J^ineotoist--cif the written reply-which&apos;had just &quot;beenreceived from the Fjtk^ JF-srenoh National Committee,,    TheCommittee could not agree to foreign supervision andcontrol of a radio station in a French ColonyNeutralisation and demilitarisation would be tantamount to reimposing on the Islands the terms of the FrenchArmistice and would be meaningless unless the enemyGovernments, whose word could not in any case be trusted, had agreed to it.    Administration of the islands by an autonomous local Council would be contrary to the: agreement of the 7th August, 1940,between the Prime Minister and General de Gaullewhereby H.Ma Government recognised General de Gaulleas the leader of all Free Frenchmen wherever theymight be who rally to him in support of the allied cause.    General De Gaulle had always intended to remove,his ships but the small body of marines which had been landed would have to remain in order to defend the islands?,,    The Committee could not abandon in any way

French, sovereign rights or agree to neutralisation,,Such abandonment would undermine French moraleeverywhere, especially in the Pacific Islands,,    TheCommittee had not hesitated to expose the safety ofthe latter islands in the common interest of theAllies attacked by Japan,,    Reports showed that theSt0 Pierre and Miquelon affair   was already havingserious repercussions at various pointsa    For themost part the Committee&apos;s reply followed much thesame line as had &quot;been taken by General de Gaulle inhis interview with the Foreign Secretary,,    In certain respects, however, it was somewhat stiffer,especially where it insisted on maintaining a small body of marines in the Islands,    This had not been mentioned at the interview in the morning.THE      jKETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAlKSthen gave the War Cabinet the gist of a telephoneconversation which he had had with the Prime Minister^to whom he had recounted the upshot of his discussions with General de Gaulle,,      (At this time he had not received the reply of the Council of Free France)The Prime Minister had said that it was most important to reach a decision cn the matter that day.      He had arrived at a settlement of a numberof very important questions with the United StatesGovernment.      The issues concerned in regard to these islands were of relatively far less importance, andwe ought to be prepared to make substantial concessions to meet the strong feelings of the UnitedStates Government in this matter.      The Prime minister had added that he strongly condemned General de gaulle&apos;s attitued on the whole affair.     He thoughtthat the communique should be issued on behalf ofall three Governments, (U.S.A*, U.K. , and Canada).If,however s it was necessary to take any act ion;.to enforce the decision reached, that would be leftto the United States.      The Foreign Secretary saidthat he had then told the Prime Minister that he proposed to see General de Gaulle again later that evening, and to endeavour to persuade him to acceptthe communique, subject to the  substitution    forClauses (iii) and (v) of a phrase which admittedGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s intention in practice to withdraw his forces.As regards Clause (ii), he had gathered from the Prime Minister that the United StatesGovernment were not now prepared to agree to theterms of a statement which explicitly recognised the sovereignty of the islands as residing either in the Council of Free France,  or in the vichy government.      If the amendments which General de gaulle was prepared to agree to were unacceptable to the United States Government, the Prime Ministerfelt that, in view of the strong feelings which thatGovernment had in regard to the matter, it would benecessary to agree to the issue of the communiquein its present f&quot;rm0The Foreign Secretary said that he wouldbe grateful if the Cabinet would let him know whatmessage he should give to the Prime Minister as represoitzgthe view of the War Cabinet, as to the action whichhe (the prime Minister) should take, if theUnited States Government were not prepared tqaccept the amendments which he could persuade&apos;General de Gaulle to agree to in the draftcommunique.     His own view was that it was very doubtful whether His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe associated with the issue of the communique luits present form.      In this event the communique ,if issued, would be issued by the United StatesGovernment

THE LOPJD PRIVY SEAL said that in effect the communique. as it stood, asserted the rightof the United States Government to determine what happened in places in the American continent which did not belong to the United States.      These twoislands were in fact very close to our own territories,and a long way from the United States.      Further,he did not think the Monroe Doctrine was applicable.No change in Sovereignty was involved since,in eitherevent,  the Is&apos;..    Is were French territory.      It wasonly a questior. whether Sovereignty over the islandswas exercised by the National Comvaittee of the free french or by the Vichy Government.General agreement was expressed with thisview,nfter further discussion the War Cabinetag:.-eed as follows(1)   The Foreign Secretary would againsee General de Gaulle, and endeavourto persuade him to accept the draftcommunique subject to modification of clauses (ii), (iii), and (v) onthe lines indicated in discussion.(2) The result of this interview would becommunicated by the Foreign Secretaryto the Prime Minister.(5)   The Foreign Secretary was authorisedto inform the Prime Minister that it-was the unanimous view of the WarCabinet that it would be impossiblefor us to support or associateourselves either with the issue of a communique such as was proposed inGREY No. 305 (unless, of courseamendments which General de Gaullewould agree to were accepted) or withthe kind of action proposed.(4)    The Foreign Secretary was asked to remind the Prime Minister of theimportance of Mr. McKenzie Kingbeing consulted before any public announcement was made.      This would beof special importance if we found itnecessary to     dissociate ourselvesfrom the issue of the communique.Great George Street, S.W.I. ,
