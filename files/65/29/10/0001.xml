MINUTE 3.(Confidential Annex).4th February, 1942   -   5r;0 p0m.The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda bythe Lord President of the Council and by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries (W.P.(42) 41 and 49).THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL gave an account of the history of the matter, and suronarieed&quot;the main factors which had influenced his Committee in reaching their conclusions.,    The members of his Committee(the Chancellor of the Exchequer reserving his position)had reached the conclusion   that, having regard to theterms in which the original pledge had been reaffirmedin October, 1941., it would be necessary to advance prices by an amount representing the increased labour costs inrespect of controlled commodities, resulting from therecent increase in the national minimum wage to 60/&quot;*On a generous interpretation, this involved an increasein costs of  20 millions,.      They were, hov;ever, satisfiedthat no increase was called for in costs other than wages,since, in their view, the Government were entitled totake into account changes in the general level of costs and receipts throughout the whole period since the pledgewas given,,      He also referred to the very large increases in farmers net incomes, as compared with increases in wages and earnings of other classes of the community.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESurged that agriculture must be treated differently from industry.    Extensions to munitions factories had beencarried out mainly by funds provided by the State. ; Butthe Government policy had been that the extra working capital and additional equipment required by farmers forthe programme of increased production should be found bythe farmers themselves.     Since the outbreak ofwar,  44 millions had been expended on tractors and extrafarm implements.     Farmers were now being urged to make furiheincreases in production, which would involve theexpenditure of an additional  25 millions on furtherequipments      It had also been necessary to take intoaccount the heavy indebtedness of the farming community in 1938-39,The second consideration to which he drew attention was that, while the large, well-managed farmson the better-class land were making very high profits,such profits were subject to heavy taxation.     He gavenn instance of one farmer who had made a profitin one year of  84,000 on a farm of 9,000 acres, and had paid back in taxation  75,000 to the Exchequer.      But the great majorityof farms were small farms, and it was necessary to fix price at a level which, having regard to their circumstances,would enable the small farmers to maintain,    or to increasestill further,  the levels of production already reached^

It had always &quot;been understood by the^axmirtg^-community tha-c the Government pledge&apos;v^pQl^d to substantial changes in costs of production^nTroxa-whe evercause.     The pledge had, in fact, been renewed inregard to costs, other than wages, in the previoussummer^      The farming community would not be satisfiedthat the pledge was fulfilled, by increases in pricestotalling  20 millions.     Some figure of the orderof  30 millions would be necessary for this purpose0He thought, however, that it might be possible tojustify the exclusion from the calculation of any figure in respect of the remuneration of the farmer and his wife.      This would mean an increase in prices of 26 millionso      This figure was made up of, say,  19to  20 millions for wages costs, together with other costs of  5 to  7 millions^The Minister added that the sum of 86 millions, while constituting the minimum sum which,in his view, would adequate^ fulfil the pledge, alsorepresented the smallest increase which could inpractice be allocated over the various commodities? if,as the Minister of Pood thought was necessary, milkprices were inoreased by  10 millions..The Minister added that he thought it was essential to make sure that the farmers were satisfiedthat the pledge was fully honoured on the occasion ofthe present reviewo     Provided a satisfactory settlement was reached on the present occasion, therewas no reason why the position should not be looked atagain,with a view to matters being dealt with on a revised basis in later yearst,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said thatif the. matter was treated on merits, and not on the strict interpretation of the pledge^ the farmers werenot entitled to any increase in prices,,      If thefacts became knowi, it would have to be admitted thatthe original estimate had contained a bad miscalculation,This tls calculation - had indeed been so serious that therewad a&apos;case for explaining the whole position to the farmers and asking them whether they demanded that theletter of the bargain should be adhere:;, to0In any case, however, he thought that thefigure of  20 millions, given by the Lord presidents committee as the sum required to avoid any accusationof breach of the pledge, was an over-estimate, andthat the sum should be  15-g- or  16 millions,,      Further,he could not accept the view that the fact that considerable sums would be recovered by taxationafforded any justification for giving a larger increasein prices than was necessitated by the pledge,.Moreover, having regard to the fact that most, farmersdid not keep accounts, it was doubtful how much could in fact be recovered by taxation,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL made the followingpoints %-First, in fixing prices it was not possible togive, to individual farmers, increases whichcorresponded with the increased cost of thelabour they employedc     What had been donethroughout had been to fix global increases,which would correspond with the increases in wages falling on, the farming community, but to allocate the increases  in such a way as to stimulate;the products for which the Minister of food had most neeg0

Secondly;    the prices fixed in. 1940 had &quot;been largely in the nature of a guess at what wasnecessary   to ensure from the farming community the increased production required.The element of profit included in this estimate or guess had proved larger than hadbeen anticipated,:Thirdly;    the number of holdings quoted inthe Arpendix to the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries&apos; paper   ..r.ce;&apos;fed   the .number of individual farmers, and thereforerather over-represented the number of marginalfarmersoFourthly;    he saw no justification for the viewthat farmers should be able to acquire allthe new stock and equipment which they neededout of the profits of one year,,He thought the increase of  20 millions offeredrepresented a very fair offer.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that farmers were not over-paid by present prices, and they were entitled to the increase of  26 or  27 millionsproposed.by the Minister of Agriculture andFisherieso     When comparison was made with pre-warearnings, it must be remembered that the farmers had very low profits before the war,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND saidthat he had given a pledge in Scotland on very much the same terms as those given by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries.      His pledge, however, hadrelated more specifically to wages costs.So far as concerned the fulfilment of the pledge, he was prepared to accept the figure of 20 millions arrived at by the Central StatisticalOffice, and to go to the farmers on that basis.The difficulty which he felt arose from theallocation of this sums     If  10 millions wasallotted for milk, he did not see how he could arguewith the farmers that the pledge was fulfilled in thecase of the producers of meat and oats, or the sheepfarmers.     He thought that an endeavour should bemade to reach a settlement with the farmers1representatives on&quot;the allocation of  20 millions.If this proved unsuccessful, it would be necessaryto ask authority for a further increase.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL saidthat the pledge was a pledge to the farming community as a whole.      The first question todetermine was the total increase in prices whichmust be allowed in fulfilment of the pledge.Allocation of the sum was for determination later0

vtTHE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that,if the matter was looked at on the basis of wage increases chanted, he thought the increase of  14millions in prices granted in 1940,together with theincrease of  20 millions now proposed, corresponded to;:/ an increase of wages of 3/- a week in excess&quot;of the increases which had in fact already been given,,    In his view, the question of production on marginal land should be further examined.,,    He also emphasised thattho pledge to the farming community did&quot;not come to anend at the end cf the war, but extended to at least ayear thereafter,.    In the interests of the farming community stability and security were what reallymattered,,    Por this point of view he deprecated undueincreases at the present time0THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES:saidthat, while he agreed with this view, it was of crucial importance to make sure that the pledge was honoured inthe letter on the present occasion,,Further discussion took place as to L: &quot;a total increase of  20 millions would be allocated if it wasdecided to authorise a total increase in prices of thisamountsTHE MINISTER OP POOD explained that he proposed that  10 millions should be allotted to milk,primarily because he attached high priority to milkamong the foods necessary to feed the country properly;and, secondly, because the production of milk involvedheavy labour costs0-THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that hehad always been opposed to the   fixing   of flat contractprices for milk,    In his view, such a system wasinherently unsound,, and milk prices should be fixed onthe basis of ascertained costs, having regard to the differing circumstances under which milk was produced,,He had grave doubts of the wisdom of accepting theincreased prices now proposed,,After THE PRIME MINISTER had summed up thediscussion and invited the views of the ministers present,, the War Cabinet reached the following conclusions:-(l)   The total price increases considered necessaryto fulfil the Government&apos;s pledge   shouldnot exceed  20 millions^.(2)   This decision took no account of theallocation of this sum between the variouscommodities, a question which had not yetbeen fully considered,/jBome Ministers expressed the view that.  the allocation of this sum involvedquestions of high policy^/(3)     Paragraph 8 of the Memorandum by the lord president of the Council (setting outvarious matters which should be communicated tofarmers1 representatives) was endorsed.Great George Street, S.W. 1.
