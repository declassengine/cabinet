Mr. Lyttelton. 1. The War Cabinet asked the Deputy Prime Minister to convey a special message of sympathy on their behalf to theMinister of Production on the death of one of his sons on active service in Italy.Ethiopia. 2.   At their meeting on the 4th August the War Cabinet had(Previous       given general approval to the recommendations of the CommitteeEeference:      on policy in Ethiopia (W.P. (44) 416) as to the lines on which ourW.M. (44) 101st Special  Representatives  should  negotiate  with  the  EthiopianConclusions,     Government as to a renewal of the agreement of 1942.Minute 2.) The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of State (W.P. (44) 581) reporting the present position ofthe negotiations with the Emperor and examining the line to betaken by Lord De La Warr, the head of the Mission, if no extensionof the existing agreement (which expired on the 25th October) was obtained.*The Minister of State informed the War Cabinet that, since his paper had been circulated, the Ethiopian Government had agreed to prolong the agreement for another two months. Theimmediate situation was thus easier. Nevertheless, it would be helpful to Lord De La Warr if he could know the point at whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government would wish him to stand fast. TheMinister of State had accordingly set out in his Memorandum alist of our desiderata, and the various stages by which these mightbe sought.A general discussion ensued, which is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File. At the conclusion of the discussion the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the Chairman of the Committeeon Policy in Ethiopia which had framed the instructions)suggested that Lord De La Warr should be instructed so to conduct the negotiations as to make it clear to the Emperor that, if he didnot agree to renew the agreement on terms which we would give asthe minimum we regarded as necessary, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould take a very serious view of the matter. If this situation wasreached, Lord De La Warr would be instructed to return home andreport progress and His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider thematter further.As to what constituted our minimum requirements, theChancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essential that the grazing rights of the British Somali tribes should be protected.We should continue to seek a lease of the reserved areas. Asregards the Ogaden, it was essential that British administration should be maintained, pending the Peace Treaty, but it should bepossible to secure this in some way which would not prejudice theEmperor&apos;s sovereign rights.A general measure of agreement was expressed with this view,but, in view of the fact that more time was now available forconsideration, it was felt that the most satisfactory course wouldbe that the Committee on Policy in Ethiopia, under the Chairman-ship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should be reassembled toconsider the matter and to submit recommendations to the WarCabinet as to what further instructions should be given toLord De La Warr.The War Cabinet^Endorsed this view, and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to arrange for the Committee on Policy in ethiopia to be reconvened at an early date.
Statistics about 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thethe United Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 574), covering a draftKingdom War White Paper containing statistics relating to the war effort of the effort. United Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in recent monthsa number of Departments had been considering the release of morestatistical information than it had been possible to give in theearlier war years, and that it had seemed convenient that a com-prehensive statistical report should be prepared. One great advantage of a report of this kind was that it would help todispel the widespread misapprehension which prevailed both inthe United States and in other countries about the extent to whichwe bad mobilised our resources for the war, and its publicationnow would be helpful in the discussions in progress on Lend-Leasein Stage II. The draft had been prepared in consultation withall the Departments concerned, and, subject to the points set outin W.P. (44) 574, had been agreed. The Lord Presidents Com-mittee, who had considered an earlier draft, had given their approval in principle.(L.P. (44) 47th Meeting, Minute 1), and thePrime Minister had indicated that, subject to the views of the WarCabinet, he was in favour of publication.The following points arose in discussion : (a) Publication of Merchant Shipping Losses.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was strongly against the inclusion of figures showing the annual merchantshipping losses during the war. The enemy were preparing to launch fresh attacks on our shipping this winter with improvedtypes of U-boats, and although all possible measures were beingtaken to counter the expected attacks, it was possible that at least for a time there would be a considerable increase in shipping losses.If we published figures showing the annual losses, we should be giving the enemy information which might be useful to them inconducting their new campaign. Again, if we published the figuresup to June 1944, we should find it very difficult to resist pressure in Parliament and from the Press to resume publication of monthlyfigures of shipping losses, just at a time when the enemy mightbe inflicting considerable losses on us. Thus we should beencouraging the enemy and strengthening his will to resist.The general view of Ministers was that much of the effect ofthe White Paper would be lost if particulars of shipping losses were omitted. It was very doubtful whether the publication of annual figures would either give any comfc-rt to the enemy orsupply him with useful information for the purposes of a newU-boat campaign. Nor would publication of annual figures forthe period up to June 1944 commit the Government to publishingfigures regularly in the future.The War Cabinet^-(1) Deferred a decision on the publication of statistics ofmerchant shipping losses, arid invited the Chiefs of staff to state the reasons why th^ publication of the figures in Table 20 of the draft White Paper would be ofassistance to the enemy in connection with future U-boat,attacks on our shipping.     j.(b) Munitions Output Figures for January to June 1944.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had been sugestedthat the publication of the figures up to June 1944 might givethe misleading impression that our production effort had slackenedoff in 1944. In fact, our over-all production had increased and insome directions the increase had been very large. The Minister ofProduction was in favour of publishing the figures for the first halfof 1944.[28617] b 2
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, while he would prefer that the figures should not be given beyond the end of 1943,the last sentence of paragraph 34 of the White Paper, which hadbeen added in order to explain the reasons for the falling off in production of certain types of vessels and armaments, went someway towards meeting his objection.The War Cabinet .(2) Agreed that the White Paper should show productionfigures up to June 1944 for all types of munitions.(c) Classification of Items of Production.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the joint intelligence Sub-Committee had suggested that for security reasons the figures relating to the production of naval vessels, merchantvessels and aircraft should show the different types of production in less detail. Discussions had taken place with the Departmentsconcerned, and it had now been agreed that Table 10 would showonly three groups, namely, (i) major vessels, (ii) mosquito craft, and(iii) other minor vessels; and that in Table 14 medium and light bombers should be grouped together, while naval aircraft would be grouped with general reconnaissance, transport, air sea rescue andother aircraft, trainers being shown separately. With regard to merchant shipbuilding, tankers and non-tankers would be groupedtogether in Table 21.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that in Table 10the tonnage figures were not prepared on the same basis, since the landing craft figures were given in terms of war-load tonnage. Hesuggested that the table should show only numbers of vessels and nottonnage.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he attached,great importance to showing the naval aircraft figures separately.He also suggested that it should be possible to retain the tonnagefigures in Table 10, provided that a footnote were added to the tableexplaining the basis on which they had been prepared.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that the questionwhether separate figures should not be shown for naval aircraft should be discussed further by the Departments concerned.The War Cabinet-(3) Approved the changes suggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer in Tables 10 and 21, and agreed that, subjectto the addition of an explanatory footnote, tonnagefigures should be retained in Table 10.(4) Agreed that separate figures for naval aircraft constructionshould be given in Table 14, unless there were over-whelming reasons to the contrary.(d) Lend-Lease and Mutual A id..The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that our representatives in Washington had pointed out that the reception of the white paper in the United States would be spoiled unless it contained some reference to the valuable help which we had had in the form of lend-Lease. The Treasury had accordingly drafted paragraphsdealing with both Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid with the intention that they should form a separate section at the end of the white paper. Since, however, it was not possible to give any statistical information in these paragraphs, it seemed inappropriatethat they should form a separate section at the end, and it had beensuggested that the desired object could be achieved by slightlyamplifying paragraphs 65 and 88 of the White Paper, which alreadycontained references to the effect of Lend-Lease on the mobilisation of our resources, and by adding a new paragraph 89 drawing attention to what we had done in the way of Mutual Aid.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that, if this sugges-tion was approved, it might be worth adding a few sentences to theintroduction to the White Paper in order to draw attention to the references in paragraphs 65, 88 and 89.
Migration. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Minister of Labourand National Service (W.P. (44) 571) regarding the Departmentalarrangements for the administration of post-war migration policy.The memorandum recommended that, while the dominions office should be generally responsible, for migration policy, includingnegotiations with overseas Governments and voluntary societies, theThe War Cabinet-(5) Agreed that the White Paper should not contain a separatesection on JLend-Lease and Mutual Aid, but that a fewsentences should be added to the introduction andparagraphs 65 and 88 should be amplified in order tobring out as clearly as possible the points relating to lend-Lease and Mutual Aid to which our representatives in Washington had drawn attention.(e) Position of Dominions Governments.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that in thepast we had sometimes found it necessary to ,ask the dominions governments to refrain from publishing statistics which might havebeen of value to the enemy. For this reason he felt that we ought togive the Dominions Governments advance information of what we now proposed.The War Cabinet (6) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the Dominions Governments of what was proposed.(f) Arrangements for Publication.The Minister of Information informed the War Cabinet thatit would be undesirable to publish the White Paper until a day ortwo after the United States Presidential Election. He did notthink that the White Paper would have a ready sale in the UnitedStates in the form in which it had to be printed for presentation toParliament, and he would like to arrange to have it printed in theUnited States with larger type and generally in a way which wouldcommend it to the United States public.It was pointed out that there were insuperable objections to the printing of the White Paper in the United States in advance of its presentation to Parliament. After presentation, however, it wouldbe possible for the Ministry of Information to arrange for thepreparation of a popular edition.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that there was likely to bea debate on shipping in the near future and that there might becomplaint if the shipping figures in the White Paper, which wouldbe of interest for the debate, were not published until after the debate had taken place.The Deputy Prime Minister said that it would be appropriate for the White Paper to be presented to Parliament by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.The War Cabinet-(7) Gave general approval to the draft White Paper, subject tothe points referred to above, and agreed that it should be presented to Parliament by the Chancellor of theExchequer on a suitable date after the United StatesPresidential Election.(8) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to explore thepossibility of arranging for the postponement of theproposed debate on shipping until after the publicationof the White Paper.
detailed administration of the arrangements for post-war migrationshould be carried out by the Ministry of Labour and NationalService. There would be close association between the two Depart-ments, and the functions undertaken by the Ministry of Labour and national Service would fit in with their functions in relation toresettlement in this country. Suitable arrangements would be madeto ensure that other Departments were brought into consultationwhen necessary.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he would be &apos;glad if the Ministry of Labour and National Service would also    fjf)undertake responsibility for the detailed arrangements connectedwith any migration which might take place to the Colonies.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals made in W.P. (44) 571.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,20th October, 1944.
