But atthe same time it might be practicable to devise a scheme whereby arepresentative party of Members of the House, possibly representingthe Anglo-French Committee, should go to France..The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security to workout a plan on these lines which should be submitted to theWar Cabinet.Civil air transport.   :ChicagoConference.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet were informed that there was strong pressure in Parliament for a public statement on this matter. thus a motion had been put down in the House of Lords by Lord Portsea,and there was a question for answer by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security on the 7th December.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, if any public statement was made at the present time, it would have ahunfortunate effect on the negotiations with the German government now being conducted through the Protecting Power.The War Cabinet decided that, if it was impossible to securethe withdrawal of the question and of the motion, any reply at thepresent time should not go beyond saying that the matter wasunder consideration, that it would not be in the public interest tomake a full statement on the matter at this juncture, and that itwas hoped that enquiries would not be pressed.Newfoundland.Lord Ammon&apos;sPamphlet.(previous reference:W.M.

At their meeting on the 8th November the War cabinet had agreed that a Committee, comprising persons with expertknowledge of electoral machinery, should be appointed to deviseand submit to the War Cabinet at an early date a scheme for postalvoting for the forces.The question had since been raised as to who should preside over this Committee. The Home - Secretary and Minister of home security had pointed out that political issues were involved and had suggested that it might be more appropriate that the Committeeshould, be presided over by some independent person than by a minister of the Crown.On the other hand, it had been suggested that, in view of thecircumstances of the present enquiry, the balance of advantage layin having as Chairman a War Cabinet Minister.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to undertake theduty of presiding over the Committee.
