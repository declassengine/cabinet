Parliament.electoral reform:VotingArrangementsfor Membersof the Forces.(previous reference:W:M. (44) 147thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The War Cabinet again discussed the voting arrangementsfor members of the forces.The Prime Minister said that the principle aimed at should bethat members of the forces should, so far as possible, have as good a chance as other electors of taking an effective part in the Election.He read out to the War Cabinet a draft minute outlining the kindof arrangement which he thought would provide the right approach to this question.Discussion ensued as to the practical difficulties which wouldhave to be met in order to make fully effective a scheme for postalvoting on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister. It waspointed out that, whatever electoral machinery was adopted, it mustwork sufficiently smoothly to avoid risk of a breakdown.-After some further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed asfollows : (1) A Committee comprising &apos;The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security(Chairman);The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster;The   Parliamentary   Secretary   to  the   Ministry   ofEconomic Warfare; and theJoint Parliamentary Secretaries to the Treasury,should consider the scheme outlined by the PrimeMinister in his minute.(2) The outline scheme as approved by the Committee should then be considered by the military authorities of the three services, and also by a Committee comprising persons with expert knowledge of electoral machinery, on thelines of the Committee which had reported in December1942 with a view to the submission to the War cabinet at an early date of the best scheme which could be devised to give effect to the principle laid down by the PrimeMinister.Attacks by rockets.Publicity.(previous reference:W.M.

The Wax Cabinet were informed that the German high command had issued the following communique on the GermanHome Service : &quot;The V. 1 Bombardment of the Metropolitan area ofLondon, which has been carried out since the 15th June withvariable intensity and only brief interruption, has now been intensified by the employment of another and far more effectiveexplosive, the V. 2.&quot;The Prime Minister said that, in the circumstances, he thoughthe should make a short statement on the subject after questions inParliament on the following day.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed.InternationalCivil air transport.ChicagoConference.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 141stConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Prime Minister referred to a telegram which had beenreceived from the Minister for Civil Aviation, asking that a CabinetCommittee should be appointed to deal expeditiously with questionswhich he referred home. He had accordingly appointed a CabinetCommittee, under- the Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, toconsider day-to-day questions arising out of the Conference and toadvise the War Cabinet.   (See W.P. (44) 621.)The War Cabinet Took note of this arrangement, and agreed that the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade and the Minister of state should be added to membership of the Committee.[28672-3]
Local 4,.   At their meeting on the 1st November the War CabinetElections. had agreed that the proposals in the joint memorandum by the Home(Previous Secretary and Minister of Home Security and the Secretary of StateReference: for Scotland (W.P. (44) 588) should be discussed by the HomeW.M. (44) 144th Secretary and Minister of Home Security and the Secretary of StateConclusions, for Scotland with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chancellor of the minute 2.) Duchy of Lancaster.The War Cabinet now had before them-(1) a report by the Home Secretary and Minister of home security, the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State forScotland and the Chancellor of the^ Duchy of Lancaster(W.P. (44) 617), and(ii) a memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 618)on the preparation of the Parliamentary Register.The Home Secretary and the Minister of Home Security saidthat agreement had been reached on the assimilation of the localgovernment - franchise with the Parliamentary franchise, on theunderstanding that absentee owners in Scotland and occupiers ofproperty in more than one electoral area both in England and wales and in Scotland should retain the local government franchise inthose areas where they paid rates. It had also been agreed thatin England the first borough elections should be held in the autumn of 1945 and the first county council and district council elections inthe spring of 1946; and that in Scotland the burgh, county and district council elections should be restarted in the autumn of 1945.With regard to the exercise of the local government franchisefor Service voters, W.P. (44) 617 proposed that Service votersshould be able to vote at local elections by proxy in the same way asat Parliamentary elections. In view, however, of the decision whichthe War Cabinet had taken earlier that evening (see Minute 1) thata scheme for extending the system of postal voting to members ofthe Forces overseas should be devised, it would be better to omitfrom the proposed legislation with regard to local elections any provisions regarding Service voters and to leave this matter to bedealt with in any new legislation dealing with voting by membersof the Services overseas at Parliamentary elections.The War Cabinet- ,(1) Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of Home^ Security and the Secretary of State for Scotland toprepare legislation dealing with the assimilation of thelocal government and Parliamentary franchises and the resumption of local elections on the lines proposed in w.P. (44) 617.(2) Agreed that the question of voting by Service electors at local government elections should be dealt with in any new legislation dealing with voting by Service electors at parliamentary elections.The War Cabinet then discussed the question of the retirement of Councillors.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security explainedthat it had not been possible to reach agreement on this question.The Secretary of State for Scotland and he were in favour of makinga clean sweep when elections were resumed, whereas the Lord privy seal and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster held that wherethe principle of retirement by annual thirds had previously appliedit should be continued.In discussion it was urged, in favour of a clean sweep, thatcouncillors who had been elected for three years only ought not, ifan election were possible, to be continued in office for a period whichwould amount to nine years. There were special objections to thecontinuance in office of co-opted members who had never been beforethe electorate and who, in certain cases, had been appointed in violation of the party truce. A majority of the councils of the cities
and burghs in Scotland were in favour of a clean sweep, and theprinciple of a clean sweep had always operated in the case ofcounty councils both in England and in Scotland.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Englishassociations of local authorities were in favour of the retention of retirement by annual thirds, and that a substantial minority ofcouncillors in the Scottish cities were not in favour of a clean sweep.Continuity in local government was a matter of great importance,and the danger of a sudden break was all the greater when therehad been a lapse of nine years since the last election.In further discussion it was suggested that the possibility mightbe explored of a compromise under which, when elections were resumed, all co-opted members would retire together with one-thirdof the elected members. Though it was felt that this would lead totoo great a break in councils where the number of co-opted memberswas considerable, it was recognised that in order to meet criticismin Parliament it would be desirable to go some way towards gettingrid of co-opted members.The War Cabinet-(3) Agreed that provision should be made for retirement byannual thirds in councils where this had hitherto beenthe practice, on the understanding that in any wardwhere there was a co-opted member he should retire first.The War Cabinet then discussed the question of the prepara-tion of the register.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security explainedthat his proposal was that a printed register should be published on the 15th May, 1945, with the 31st January as the qualifyingdate. In his opinion it would not be possible to prepare a satis-factory register at an earlier date. In the unlikely event of itproving necessary to hold an election before the 15th May, themachinery under the Parliamentary Electors (War-Time Registra-tion) Acts, 1943 and 1944, could be used.The Lord Privy Seal said that his enquiries had satisfied him that, with the assistance of the newspaper presses and the Ministryof Food, it would be possible to prepare a satisfactory register bythe 15th March with the 1st January as the qualifying date. Theperiod between the decision to hold an election and &quot;the poll shouldbe as short as possible, and for this reason it was desirable to avoid any risk of having to use the machinery of the ParliamentaryElectors (War-Time Registration) Acts, 1943 and 1944, which involved a delay of 7J weeks between the issue of the writ and thedate of the election.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, although itwas desirable to have a printed register at as early a date as possible,it was essential that there should be no breakdown in the arrange-ments for preparing the register; and it was suggested that if thedate by which the register would be available could be advancedfrom the 15th May to, -say, the 7th May the position would be satisfactory.The War Cabinet (4) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security and the Secretary of State for Scotland to consider thepossibility of providing for the preparation of a registerwhich would be operative at the 7th May, instead of the15th May, 1945.(5) Subject to (4), gave general approval to the scheme set outin paragraph 7 of W.P. (44) 617 whereby registerswould be prepared which would come into operation inMay and October, 1945.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Sth November, 1944.
