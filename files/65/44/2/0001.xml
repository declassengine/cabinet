Post-War fire service.(previous reference erence:W.M.(41&apos;)49thConclusions,Minute 8.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum- by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and theSecretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (44) 525) about the post-warFire Service.When the National Fire Service had been created in 1941 a pledge had been given that fire-fighting would again become a localauthority service. In 1943, however,&quot; the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security had stated that in the national interest the pledge might have to be reconsidered.An announcement on the future constitution of the Fire service would have to be made soon after the end of the war in Europe.Four possible courses fell to be considered : - .(i) Reversion to the position under the Fire Brigades Act,1938;(ii) Retention of the National Fire Service;(iii) Organisation on - the basis of larger local government areas; and(iv) Organisation on the basis of ad hoc areas.It was proposed to open exploratory discussions with the associations of local authorities at an early date. These mightproceed on the footing that the progress made during the war mustnot be lost and that the return of the service to the 1,668 authorities under the Fire Brigades Act, 1938, would not be an acceptablesolution. The retention of a National Fire Service should not- be ruled out and, if local authority control were to be reintroduced,central supervision would have to be maintained. No promise of exchequer assistance would be held out.In discussion, it was generally agreed that the very greatimprovements which had been made in the Fire Service during thewar ought to be preserved and that fire brigades should operate overwider areas than before the war. It was pointed out, however, thatit might well be uneconomic to maintain in peace time the samestandard of efficiency as was essential in war time. Attention wasalso drawn to the importance of encouraging voluntary service, andit was suggested that the possibility of combining the retention ofa National Fire Service with arrangements which would enable localauthorities to be associated more closely with the running of theservice should be considered.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the needs which the fire Service was designed to meet were essentially local, and it seemed appropriate that the cost should be met -from the rates.Nothing should be said in the proposed discussions to suggest thatthe alternatives were that the Service should return to the localauthorities and be supported entirely from the rates, or that &quot;theNational Fire Service should be retained with the Governmentpaying the whole cost. If the National Fire Service were retained,consideration would have to be given to some adjustment in the block Grant. aThe general feeling of the War Cabinet was that there-was no objection to the initiation of conversations with the associa-tions of local authorities on the future of the Fire Service, provided&quot;X&quot; j that the conversations proceeded on the basis of ascertaining theI general trend of their views rather than of seeking to secure theirassent to a particular line of policy and that the War Cabinet had reached no decision on the matter.The suggestion was also made that, when the discussion with local authorities had taken place, it might be appropriate for themattercto be considered by a small Committee of Ministers before it was again brought before the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet- (1) Agreed that the&apos; Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Secretary of State for Scotland should undertake exploratory conversations on the future of the&apos; Fire Service with the associations of local authorities onthe lines indicated at&quot; X.&quot;
(2) Took note that the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Secretary of State for Scotland would report back after the conversations with the associations of local authorities had been completed.Shipping.Scheme for purchase ofvessels built onGovernmentaccount.(previous reference:W.M.(41)28thConclusions,Minute 8.)4i &quot;V&quot;   &quot;X2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of War Transport (W.P. (44) 516) proposing certainextensions in the scheme for the purchase by British shipowners ofnew vessels built on Government account.The Minister of War Transport recalled that at their meetingon the 13th March, 1941, the War Cabinet had approved a scheme under which the Ministry of War Transport were able to enter into agreements with British shipowners for the sale of Government-owned ships to replace losses by war or marine risk in war time. Asubstantial number of agreements had been completed, but the uncertainty created in the shipping industry by the prospect of alarge surplus of American war-time tramp tonnage was now leadingowners to hesitate before committing themselves to take over trampvessels. In these circumstances, he proposed that shipowners whosetramp vessels were obsolescent should also be entitled to claim topurchase Government vessels. The Ministry would adjudicate onobsolescence in the light of the circumstances of each ship, and itwould be a condition that the obsolete vessel should be scrapped,unless it was put to a use approved by the Ministry. If after this extension of the scheme tramp vessels still remained undistributed,they might be offered to any British interests who wished to enter the shipping industry.It was also proposed that coasting tankers built on government account should be offered to any existing British owners desirous of acquiring vessels of this type. Should all the coasting tankers notbe disposed of in this way, they might be offered to any british company not under foreign financial control which might wish topurchase.Under the existing scheme vessels  ould not be resold within aperiod of three years after the date of delivery except with thesanction of the Ministry. This restriction was desirable on foreignsales, but there appeared to be no strong reason against sales toBritish buyers at any time after the general requisitioning ofBritish tonnage came to an end. Any such sales would be subjectto restrictions to prevent the transfer of the vessels to foreignownership.The main point raised in discussion was the proposal.that anytramp vessels remaining undistributed after the extension of thescheme to shipowners whose vessels were obsolescent might be offered to any British interest who wished to enter the shipping industry.It was agreed that this part of the scheme should be held in abeyancefor the present until the results of the other parts of the scheme could be seen.It was also explained that it would be a condition of the scheme that any obsolete vessels would be scrapped and in no circumstances be sold to foreign ownership.Subject to the points at &quot; X &quot; and &quot;Y,&quot; the War cabinet approved the proposals in W.P. (44) 516.War Crimes 3    The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theBm- Lord Chancellor (W.P. (44) 550) pointing out that under theexisting law no British Criminal Court could try or punish aforeigner for a crime committed abroad even though the crime were committed against a British subject, and recommending that a Billto remedy this position as respects war crimes, a draft of which was attached to the Memorandum, should be introduced and passed into law as soon as possible. Under the Bill trial would be by a tribunalpresided over by a High Court judge assisted by Service assessors,
4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 555), to whichwas appended a draft telegram regarding the punishment of major war criminals, which had been prepared in Quebec (on the basis ofthe draft drawn up by the Lord Chancellor, with the Attorney-General and the Minister of Aircraft Production) and which it was proposed should be despatched to Marshal Stalin jointly by thePrime Minister and President Roosevelt. The Prime Minister had agreed with the President that he would circulate this draft to hiscolleagues, and that the President should meanwhile discuss it withMr. Cordell Hull.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of further considera-tion since his discussions with President Roosevelt, he felt some doubt as to the case for pressing on with this matter. The dangerof German retaliation against British prisoners in their hands couldnot be overlooked. He thought, on the whole, that it would be best to let events take their course and wait for the President to reportthe result of his discussions with Mr. Hull.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, in viewof the number of Dominion prisoners of war in Germany, he feltthat, if and when any such, proposal was to be given effect to, prior consulation with the Dominions would be desirable.The War Cabinet-Accepted the Prime Ministers view at &quot; X.&quot;Major war criminals.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 116thConclusions,Minute 9.)Argentina. .   5    Tne War Cabinet were reminded that we were anxious to(Previous renew the Argentine meat contract for four years.   At the QuebecReference: Conference the United States Government had pressed us not toW.M.(44)85th conclude a long-term contract, but to buy on a hand-to-mouth basisConclusions, and to reduce our Argentine meat purchases by resorting, to otherMinute 3.) sources of supply.   A recent telegram from Washington indicatedand the court would be authorised to proceed on evidence which wasnot &apos;&apos; first-hand &apos;&apos; evidence.The Lord Chancellor said that eminent lawyers in the Houseof Lords had already drawn his attention to the need for a measureon the lines proposed. He regarded it as essential to make provisionfor relaxing the ordinary British rules of evidence in cases of this nature, given the practical impossibility of securing convictionsotherwise.In discussion, doubts were expressed as to the wisdom oi taking action which might be held to involve a modification of the traditional standards of British justice and of the British judicialsystem. Moreover, if the Bill went through at the present stage, was there not a risk of German retaliation, especially against ourairmen?The right way to deal with those who had committed war crimesagainst British subjects was to set up military courts in Germany.. It was also felt that the case of a German who had committeda war crime, and who attempted to come to England, could be dealtwith in other ways.After further discussion, the Prime Minister said that, while he had so far been favourably disposed to the Lord Chancellorsproposal, he thought in the light, of the discussion that it would bebetter not to proceed with it. There was a risk that it might be misunderstood, and the danger of retaliation against our prisonerscould not be overlooked.The War Cabinet-Agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s view.
that a State Department memorandum on the matter was onits way.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that, after full consideration, he did not see how we could abandon the negotiation of a long-term contract. But, in order to meet the United StatesGovernment, we might contrive not to sign the contract with theArgentine Government for another two months -that is to say, until after the American elections.The Minister of Food said that the Belgians, Dutch and french were all anxious to purchase Argentine meat. We had hithertokept them off the market by informing them that we proposed to buy the whole output ourselves on behalf of the United Nations andsubsequently to allocate it. If we did not continue with our negotiations, there would be keen competition for Argentine meat and the price would go up. To take an extreme case, if we were to lose Argentina as a source of imported meat, the meat ration ofIs. 2d. would have to be reduced by 4d. or 5d. He had consideredthe possibility of reducing the contract to two years, but this wouldnot satisfy Mr. Hull, and would be to our disadvantage in otherways. Mr. Hull fully realised that, if the United Kingdom did not complete this contract, other nations would buy the Argentine meat,and probably at higher prices.The Prime Minister said that he was very reluctant in presentcircumstances, when the United States attitude was so accommo-dating in matters of great importance, to face a dispute over this issue. He accepted, however, the force of the case that had beenmade by the Minister of Food, and suggested that we should put tothe United States Government a strongly argued case in favour of proceeding with negotiation of the long-term contract, but couplethis with an undertaking not to conclude the actual contract until,say, a week after the election.The War Cabinet-Approved the course of action proposed by the PrimeMinister.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,4tth October, 1944.
