(44) 140thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.naval operations.Pacific.MilitaryOperations.Italy.The Balkans.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bad weather had again interfered with operations of bomber command, who had flown 4,600 sorties and dropped 13,000 tons of bombs on Germany and 3,700 tons on Occupied Territory.Thirty-two aircraft had been lost. Targets included Essen,Hamburg, Leverkusen Chemical Works, Cologne and the coast defences around Flushing.  Essen had also been attacked by night.Bomber Command had attacked the Tirpitz. The battleshiphad been further damaged, but it was uncertain whether a direct hit had been obtained.United States heavy bombers had been hampered by the weather and bombing had been by instruments. It was reported, however,that they had succeeded in breaching the important MindenViaduct.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 10,600 sorties,attacking bridges and communications on the Northern Front.Some 1,100 enemy vehicles of all kinds were claimed to have been destroyed. Allied losses amounted to 5 bombers and 84 fighters and fighter-bombers as against 56 enemy aircraft destroyed.4,900 sorties had been flown and 2,300 tons of bombs dropped.Forty-one enemy aircraft had been destroyed for the loss of61 Allied.There had been no shipping losses from enemy action duringthe previous week, and the total for October to date remained at,337 tons.Two U-boats had been destroyed and 1 probably destroyed during October.Aircraft from the Implacable had attacked shipping in theNorwegian leads, sinking 2 merchant ships, a tanker and an aircraft-carrier tender. Other enemy vessels had been drivenashore.Little information had so far been received about the recentnaval actions in the Pacific, but it was thought that the Japanese had lost 2 14-inch battleships, 1 large and 3 converted aircraft-carriers, 2 heavy and 2 light cruisers and 2&apos; destroyers. UnitedStates losses had been 2 escort carriers, 1 light fleet aircraft-carrier, 3 destroyers and a number of M.T.Bs.In Holland and Belgium an advance of some 10 to 15 miles hadbeen made along the whole front between Hertogenbosch and west of Breda. The Canadians had made considerable progress, clearing the banks of the Scheldt. Between Arnhem and Aix a german counter-attack in the neighbourhood of Meijel had gained some ground, but the situation was in hand.The Eighth Army had advanced some 7 or 8 miles on a front of some 30 miles. Some small advances had also been made on the fifth Army Front.The Russians had virtually cleared Ruthenia and had madeadvances north of Belgrade; but the Germans claimed to haveinflicted considerable losses on the Russians north-east of Budapest.The Russians had advanced into East Prussia, but it was not thought that they had yet come up against the main enemy defences.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.BombingPolicy.Flushing.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 130thConclusions,Minute 2.)[28568-2. The Prime Minister said that he understood that it had.been suggested that Flushing should be bombed. He believed thatthere were very few Germans in the town as compared with somethousands of Dutchmen. He thought, therefore, that the bombing of the town should be forbidden unless a decision to the contraryhad been reached and instructions given by the Combined Chiefsof Staff.b 2
The Chief of the Air Staff said that so far the targets attackedhad been German batteries outside the town, and he doubted whether the bombing of the town would prove necessary. TheSupreme Commander had been communicated with and the townwould not be bombed except on the instructions of the combined chiefs of Staff.The War Cabinet Took note of this statement.Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.casualties and Damage.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 140thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The War Cabinet were informed that during the previousweek 30 long-range rockets had been launched against this country,of which 13 had fallen in the Greater London area, 10 in Essex,3 in Kent and 1 each in four other counties.During the week there had been flying-bomb activity on fournights. Sixty-two had been launched, of which 26 had crossed thecoast, 4 reaching the Greater London area. Twenty-eight had been destroyed, 10 by fighters and 18 by anti-aircraft.The total casualties for the week had been : -Long-range rocketsFlying bombs ...Seriously slightly killed. Injured. Injured.

The Prime Minister referred to the discussion of thismatter in the War Cabinet a week ago, and said that he had had itin mind to make a short statement on this matter in reply to aquestion in the course of the ensuing week. On the whole, however,he thought that the balance of advantage lay against making any statement on the matter for the present.The War Cabinet Endorsed this view.5. The War Cabinet were given the latest information aboutthe Polish situation.A record of the discussion and the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The Prime Minister said that, in considering the future courseof operations, the importance of liberating Holland at the earliest practicable date must be kept in mind. Owing to the dire straitsto which the Dutch people had been reduced, the early liberation of holland involved important political as well as military issues.The Prime Minister added that, if the Dutch Prime minister or other members of his Government wished to return to Hollandin advance of its complete liberation, we should facilitate thisdespite any local inconvenience that might be caused.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsconfirmed that the Foreign Office would see no objection to the grantof the requisite facilities.The War Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement and approved the suggestion at &quot; X.&quot;
6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChiefs of Staff (W.P. (44) 449) about the maximum use of air-power in the occupation of Germany as a means of enforcing our control.The Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the suggestion in paragraph 11 of the Annex to W.P. (44) 449, which&apos;seemed to imply that we should not allow Germany to form police forces totake part in the maintenance of order. While he favoured the useof air-power as proposed by the Chiefs of Staff, the matter was one on which world opinion might change quickly, and might be very different within, say, two years of the Peace. On this ground, hequestioned the advisability of attempting to lay down the principlessuggested.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the ChiefsOf Staff did not mean that Germany should not be allowed tomaintain civilian police. Their objection was only to forces onpara-military lines. The proposals before the War Cabinet had animmediate bearing on. the problem of man-power. If approval inprinciple could be given to the use of air-power in occupation tothe extent proposed in paragraphs 24 and 25 of the Annex toW.P. (44) 449, a saving of 50,000 men could be effected.After further discussion, the War Cabinet -Approved in principle the proposal in the Chiefs of Staffpaper (W.P. (44) 449), subject to review nearer the time,and to reservation of the issue raised by paragraph 11 ofthe Annex.7. At their meeting on the 23rd October the War Cabinet had agreed (i) that the President of the United States should be askedwhether he had any objection to the publication ofmerchant shipping losses in the statistical White paper on the United Kingdom War Effort; and(ii) that further consideration should be given to the questionwhether any changes were desirable in the table showingaircraft production.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (WP. (44) 599) reporting that thePresident had agreed to the publication of shipping losses up tothe end of December 1943, and that it had been agreed by theMinisters concerned that the table showing aircraft production should show naval aircraft separately and should include 1944figures.It was pointed out that, if the table of shipping losses were confined to the figures up to the 31st December, 1943, it would benecessary to substitute the words &apos;&apos; the size of the merchant fleetunder the British flag at the beginning of 1944 was only 15^ million gross tons &quot; for the words &quot;the size of the merchant fleet underthe British flag at the middle of 1944 was only 16f million gross tons.&quot;Discussion followed as to the wisdom of publishing suchcomplete and detailed statistical information at a time when we hadto face not only a prolongation of the war against Germany for, itmight be, many months, but also the continuing struggle against japan.The Prime Minister doubted whether the publication wouldhave any lasting effect on American public opinion, and, inparticular, whether we ought to give Japan such a clear picture of the extent of our shipping losses. Might it not be preferablemerely to use the information in our official discussions withrepresentatives of the American Government on Lend-Lease in stage II?
Parliament.Debate on shipping.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 139thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that it had not been possible to arrange for the postpone-ment of the debate on shipping until after the date of publicationof the White Paper The question therefore arose whether in the debate he ought to give the House the figures contained in the white paper.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in the forthcoming shipping debate the FirstLord of the Admiralty should give no figures ofmerchant shipping losses and should give merchantship building figures only to the 31st December, 1943,although he might indicate that the 1944 figures ofmerchant shipping losses showed an improvement on those of the previous year.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he would also liketo announce in the course of the shipping debate the appointmentof a Committee to advise the Minister of War Transport and himself during the transitional period on priorities for buildingas between different types of merchant vessels, and on the allocation of shipbuilding facilities between British, Allied and neutral ship-owners. The Committee would have regard to the promotion ofco-operation between shipowners and shipbuilders in regard to theordering of new tonnage and to the arrangements most likely tocontribute to the well-being, efficiency and stability of the ship-building industry. It would include two representatives of ship owners, two of shipbuilders and one of shipbuilding workers.The proposal had been agreed with the Ministry of War Transport.It was suggested in discussion that it would be desirable tohave two representatives of workers on the Committee.The War Cabinet-(2) Approved the proposal to set up a Committee on the lines indicated by the First Lord of the Admiralty, on theunderstanding that two representatives of the workers would be appointed to the Committee.The First Lord of the Admiralty was still opposed to thepublication of shipping losses, and the Minister of War Transportpointed out that the publication of shipping losses might lead tocomplaints from merchant seamen.On the other hand, it was pointed out that our representatives in the negotiations on Lend-Lease in Stage II had made it clear thatthey were gravely handicapped by the absence of an authoritativebody of statistics on the United Kingdom war effort. If the infor-mation contained in the statistical White Paper were merely tobe used in the official discussions, there would inevitably be leakagesand it would be much better to publish an authoritative document which would influence public opinion in the United States. Thepublication of the statistics in the White Paper would also have an excellent effect in demonstrating in the Dominions and in foreigncountries, other than the United States, the extent of our war effort.So far as objections on security grounds were concerned, the UnitedStates Government already published in great detail statistics oftheir munition production, shipbuilding and man-power, and thePresident had agreed to the publication of shipping losses.After further discussion, the War Cabinet -Approved the publication of the proposed White Paper onthe United Kingdom War Effort, on the understandingthat the figures with regard to merchant shipping losses and to merchant shipbuilding would be confined to theperiod up to the 31st December, 1943.
UNRRA.second session ofthe Council.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 112thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of State (W.P. (44) 589) reviewing the proceedings of the2nd Session of the Council of the United Nations Relief and rehabilitation Administration which took place at Montreal fromthe 16th to 26th September, 1944.In his Memorandum the Minister of State (i) invited the War Cabinet to record its approval of theattitude that had been adopted at Montreal and ofX&quot; I the decisions taken; and(ii) proposed that the resolutions and reports adopted bythe Council should be published        White Paper.Points in discussion : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while theSoviet Union was now not prepared to make any financial contribu-tion to the cost of administration, their representative in Londonclaimed that he should have position at least equal to that of anyother official. If he persisted in this claim it would be difficult forthe Senior Deputy Director-General to establish himself in London.He wondered whether a friendly discussion would help to easematters.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to therisk of expenditure being wastefully incurred in China, though itwas made from American and not British funds. The Minister ofState explained that a very careful watch was being kept on this.(c) The Minister of Production said that he had been disturbed by a recent public statement by Mr. Dean Acheson that U.N.R.RA.should not worry about availability of supplies, since this wouldbe a matter for the Combined Boards. This might lead countriesneeding assistance to apply direct to the Combined Boards andignore U.N.R.R.A.The Prime Minister thanked the Minister of State on behalfof the War Cabinet for his work at Montreal.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the Minister of State&apos;s proposals summarised at &quot;X.&quot;(2) Invited the Minister of State to consider further how best to deal with the Russian attitude to U.N.R.R.A.Argentine 10.   The Prime Minister said that he had just received aMeat Contract, personal telegram from the Paymaster-General urging that any(Previous failure to walk in step with the United States Government over the reference:        proposed Argentine meat contract would have an unfortunate effectW.M. (44) 131st   on the Stage II discussions.   He reminded the War Cabinet that conclusions,      during the Moscow Conference, in deference to reports from ourMinute 5.) &apos;      representatives in the Stage II discussions, he had given instruc-tions to the Minister of Food that no long-term contract should be negotiated with the Argentine during the next couple of months.He had informed the President that this instruction had beenissued.   He enquired what was the present position.The Minister of Food explained that, acting on the authorityof the decision of the War Cabinet on the 4th October, a verbal offerhad been made to the Argentine Government for the renewal of the contract, before the Prime Ministers telegram from Moscow hadbeen received. That offer was still open, but had not been acceptedby the Argentine Government. If and when they should accept it,we did not propose to come to a settlement with them, but should play for time.There were many points still to be discussed and, in particular,the offer made contained no commitment as regards price He was reluctant to withdraw our offer altogether, as in that event theArgentine might open negotiations with the Dutch, French and
Parliament.Ministry of social -insurance bill.Hours ofWork.Belgians, who were keeping out of the market on the strength ofan assurance that we were buying all the Argentine meat whichwould be allocated by the Combined Food Board.In discussion, it was suggested that the actual position differedsomewhat from the position as it had been explained to LordKeynes confidentially, after despatch of the Prime Ministersmessage from Moscow, Further, if the Argentine Governmentshould accept our offer as it stood, might we not find ourselves in avery difficult situation vis-a-vis the United States? It wassuggested, on the other hand, that, so long as the question of priceremained open, there was no likelihood of an Argentine acceptanceand that we could safely take whatever risks were involved.After further discussion, the Prime Minister suggested thatthe matter should stand over until the Paymaster-General&apos;s return,and should then be brought up for further discussion. Meanwhile,matters should stand as they were and no further action should betaken. It was, of course, of the utmost importance that his under-taking to the President should be completely fulfilled.The War Cabinet-Approved the line of action suggested by the PrimeMinister at &quot; X.&quot;11. The Minister of Reconstruction said that he desired tohave the guidance of his colleagues on the question of whichMinister should introduce the Ministry of Social Insurance Bill. Itwas obviously inappropriate that the Bill should be introduced bythe Minister Designate.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Bill should be introduced by the lord president of the Council and that the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury should be mainly responsiblefor the Bill during its passage through the House ofCommons.12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 584) proposing the appointment of a Committee to enquire into the problems connected with the adoption of the double-shift system in manufacturing industry.The Minister of Labour and National Service explained that,although he had power to permit double-shift working by women and young persons in individual factories, the existing law madethe general introduction of double-shift working impossible.If our industrialists were to compete on equal terms with their foreign rivals, it was essential that they should instal up-to-datemachinery and plant, much of which could not be used economicallyexcept on a double-shift system. The introduction of such a system would have far-reaching effects both on industrial organisationand on social life, and it was desirable that there should be an authoritative enquiry into the matter. The President of the Boardof Trade would be consulted with regard to the constitution and terms of reference of the Committee.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Minister of Labour and national Service to appoint a Committee to enquire intothe adoption of double-shift working in manufacturing industry.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,30^ October, 1944.
