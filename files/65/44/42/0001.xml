At the request of the Prime Minister, the War cabinet and Air were given an account of the position on the Western Front, whereOperations. the Germans had effected a penetration-at places to a considerable(Previous depth-r-over a length of the front held by the United States Army.Reference:        The Prime Ministerand the Chief of the Imperial General StaffW.M.

The War Cabinet were also given the latest information aboutthe position in Greece. We were firmly established in Piraeus,where a number of strong points had been cleared, and the roadsfrom Piraeus and from Phaleron Bay to Athens had been cleared.On the other hand, the R.A.F. Rear Headquarters at Kifissia hadbeen attacked, and it was feared that some administrative personnelthere had been taken prisoner.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Man-power. 2.   The Prime Minister said that he thought the present battle(Previous.        on the Western Front might well lead to a situation in which this reference:       country should take action which would show its resolution.  Thus,W.M. (44) 161st   in a few days&apos; time it might be desirable to announce that, by dintConclusions,      of further sacrifices, and in order to make our utmost contributionMinute 3.)        to victory, arrangements were being made which would result inadding 250,000 men to the fighting line in order to nourish existingunits and to increase its strength.  Of this number, about 120,000would be found by the new intake in the next six months, 40,000 bytransfers from other Services, and it was hoped that another100,000 might be found by one means or another. Thus, there wouldhave to be a drastic combing of men from existing units, ofdefensive and static troops and rearward formations.   These men would, of course, require a period of training or retraining.  Therewould also have to be some relaxation of medical standards, thoughit might be found convenient that.the men of lower medical categoryshould serve together in units which would not be employed in themore mobile roles.The Prime Minister said that he had had some preliminary discussion with the Secretary of State for War, who had undertaken to do his utmost in this matter. He asked that, the necessary measures should be examined in detail as a matter of urgency bythe Secretary of State for War, in consultation with the Ministerof Labour and National Service as necessary, in order that anannouncement could be made at a suitable opportunity in the nearfuture.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Local 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGovernment.     Minister of Health (W.P. (44) 734) submitting a draft White paper on Local Government reform.The Minister of Health recalled that in August 1944 he had announced that the Government did not consider that a case hadbeen made out for any drastic change in the existing structure oflocal government, but that consultations would be undertaken withthe Local Government Associations with a view to formulatingproposals for improvements within the general&apos; framework of theexisting county and county borough system. Since then consulta-tion had taken place and the proposals set out in the White paper had been generally accepted. Their main effect was to establish aLocal Government Boundary Commission which would take overthe powers to make alterations in county districts vested in county
councils and the Minister of Health under the Local government act, 1933, and would also, subject to Ministerial and Parliamentarysafeguards, deal with the creation and extension of county boroughs and certain other changes in local authority areas. The promise toput forward proposals with regard to -the adjustment- of localgovernment areas had been reaffirmed in the proceedings on theTown and Country Planning Bill and in The King&apos;s Speech, and itwas known that local authorities were anxiously awaiting thepublication of the White Paper.In discussion, the view was expressed that the proposals in theWhite Paper were likely to be extremely controversial. Their effect,it was urged, would be to enlarge the field of the county boroughgovernment at the expense of the county districts. This would weaken the interest taken in local affairs by the residents in these districts and would tend to saddle them with the burden of services which were Unnecessarily elaborate for rural areas. In thisconnection particular reference was made to the passages aboutlinking town and country on page 13 of the draft White Paper.A further point was that local authorities would lose their freedom to submit proposals to Parliament and would be subjected to the arbitrary decisions of the Boundary Commission appointed by theMinister of Health. In general, the effect would be to favour the creation of large authorities and to strengthen the control ofthe central government over local authorities, tThe following particular points were also criticised: (a) It was suggested that the reference to the National fire service in the last paragraph but one on page 5 of thedraft White Paper suggested a bias in favour of thecontinuance of the service as a function of the centralgovernment.(&amp;) It was urged that it was undesirable to encourage the setting up of joint authorities with executive powers.(c) The effect of the proposals for the review of prders byParliament, set out in page 15 of the draft White Paper,was that any scheme for an adjustment of boundarieswould have to be accepted or rejected in whole, whereasunder the present procedure by Parliamentary Bill itwas possible to make amendments in a scheme.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the proposals in theWhite Paper had been warmly welcomed by the county authorities as a safeguard against the haphazard and unregulated extensionof county boroughs. In the past the most disturbing elements in local government had been the constant pressure from county boroughs to extend their boundaries, and from non-county boroughsto achieve county borough status. Normally, the extension of a county borough could be carried out only by depriving the countycouncil of much of-their rateable value. This had led to proposalsfor extension being fought out before Parliament at great expenseand with results that tended to be fortuitous. The White Paperproposals were designed to substitute a system under which any changes necessary would be considered in a less controversialatmosphere, and from a broader point of view, that would take intoaccount the interests of adjoining areas. The passage on page 13of the draft White Paper on the subject of linking town and countrydid not relate to the extension of county boroughs, but to the enlarge-ment of small country towns to include some part of the rural areasurrounding them. The interests of these towns were closely, bound up with those of the surrounding country, and the proposals would both enlarge the resources of the existing authorities and strengthenthem by the addition of members from rural areas. parliament would still retain full control of any proposals far extending thearea of county boroughs.In further discussion, it was suggested that, while a case hadbeen made out. for the rmbiieation of the White Paper, it might be

PFor this purpose some amendment ofthe introduction to the White Paper would be required.The War Cabinet-Authorised the publication of the White Paper annexed to W P^(44) 734 subject to the deletion of the reference tothe National Fire Service on page 5 and to the amendmentof the third paragraph of the introduction in the senseindicated at: &quot; X &quot; above.world organisation.Voting.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 133rdConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The War Cabinet.had before them the following papers onthe method of voting in the Security Council of the world organisation :  *(a) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (44) 747)..(&amp;) A Memorandum by the &quot;Minister of Aircraft Production(W.P. (44) .667). :.(c) Connected papers circulated to the Armistice and Post-war committee (A.P.W. (44) 117, 120 and 122).A difference of view had manifested itself between the U.S.S.R.,who had maintained that no decision should be taken without the unanimous consent of all the permanent members of the security council, and the United Kingdom and United States, who had feltthat members of the Security Council who were parties to a dispute should not be entitled to vote at any stage of the consideration ofthat dispute. .A compromise proposal had how been put by president roosevelt to Premier Stalin. The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that, as stated in his Memorandum (W.P. (44) 747),there was much to be said for our supporting this compromise,provided the Dominions agreed. On the whole, he thought it wouldbe better that We should not express any view ourselves to premier stalin, even if the Dominions agreed, until Premier Stalin had expressed his. All that was involved at this stage was, therefore,consultation with the Dominions.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs as set out in W.P. (44) 747, subject to&quot;X-&quot; above.;&apos;-&apos; ..:   - - -InternationalAspects of .   &apos;Colonial Policy.   Delegations(previous reference;W.M.(44)58thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. At the Dumbarton Oaks Conference there had been informal discussions between the United States and the United KingdomThis had led to a suggestion for an informal exchangeof papers covering certain international aspects of colonial policy,e.g., the future of the present mandates, regional machinery and&quot;trusteeship machinery.&quot;The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theChairman of the Armistice and Post-War Committee (W.P. (44)738), to which was appended a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, prepared for eventual communication to theUnited States Government as a basis for discussion. This had beenapproved by the Armistice and Post-War Committee, whichsuggested that, if generally approved by the War Cabinet, it shouldbe&apos; referred in the first instance to the Dominion Governments fortheir comments.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that his Memo-randum followed closely the proposals laid before the dominion prime Ministers in May 1944. It was important: that we shouldtake the initiative and should not wait for the Americans to makethe first move, lest they should put forward schemes which wereunsatisfactory from our point of view, but might-attract support.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that paragraph 16 of theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies gavedefinite support to a list of social subjects for which functionalagencies might be usefully established where they-did not already exist. He trusted that care would be taken to ensure that such bodies were not a means of putting pressure on us to spend money which we had not got.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should be referred for comment to theDominion Governments, on the understanding that thematter would again be brought before the War Cabinet,when their comments had been received,&apos;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,20th December, 1944.
