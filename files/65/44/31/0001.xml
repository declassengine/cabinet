On the 23rd March the War Cabinet had considered thefirst draft of the Constitution for a permanent Food and Agricul-tural Organisation. They had then agreed to accept theConstitution, subject to two conditions : The first was that our representatives should put it on record that we did not regard theConstitution as conferring executive functions with regard, to agricultural credit or agricultural commodity arrangements. Adeclaration on these terms had been made. The second had beenthat, if other Governments made amendments to the draft Consti-tution; we should press for certain improvements in the text. Thisalso had been done.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 526) asking for -(a) acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the revised draft Constitution;(6) agreement to the laying of a White Paper containing (i) the. Constitution; (ri) His Majesty&apos;s Governments accept-ance thereof; (iii) the report by the Interim Commissionon the revised draft.The Prime Minister said he had received an assurance fromthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the organisation would have no functions in regard to allocation of food, and couldnot, therefore, in any way interfere with the nation&apos;s food supplies.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet &apos;Approved the proposals at &quot; X.&quot; ,Supplies for 4.

(44) 655, accepted therecommendations in W.P. (44) 687 and 686 and recorded thefollowing conclusions: (1) The- security restrictions governing the employment ofGerman prisoners should be relaxed to the. extentsuggested, by the Security Executive, as set out inparagraph 5 of the Annex to W.P. (44) 687.- (2) Arrangements should be made for the employment of notmore than 20,000 German prisoners in agriculture and forestry on these new conditions, in addition to the15,000-16,000 whose employment in escorted gangs hadalready been approved.(3) Before these arrangements were implemented, the Ministryof Information should be supplied both with a presshand-out and material on which to base a &quot; Private and confidential guidance Memorandum to Editors.&quot;(4) Further transfers of Italian prisoners to this country should be suspended. This decision should be subjectto review if it proved impossible to employ german prisoners to the extent suggested in paragraph 8 of the annex to W.P. (44) 687.(5) The Minister of Information should be invited to do what he could to persuade the press to take a less hostile linetowards Italian prisoners doing useful work in thiscountry.(6) Where prisoners of war were required for urgent work inthe London area they should be housed there, eventhough that sometimes meant taking accommodation which would otherwise be; available for the civil popula- ion. It was estimated that employment could usefully be found for 500-600 Italian prisoners in the london area. &apos; &apos; -  - &apos;(7) At the request of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,the Minister of Labour and National Service undertook to consult with the Minister of Works in order to avoidsurrendering accommodation which had been requisi-tioned by the Government and was being used for housing Italian prisoners engaged on essential work.Demobilisation.Definition ofWar Service.(previous reference: - ,W.M.(44)22ndConclusions,   %Minute.2 (ii).)6.   The War Cabinet had before them-(i) A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (W-P. (44) 673), to which was annexed a reportby the Interdepartmental Committee on release from theForces and Civil Defence Services about the definition of war service for the purpose of determining the orderof priority of release from the Forces,(ii) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security (W.P. (44) 688) about the position ofmen released from the Forces to the National fire service and subsequently recalled.
;- Onthe treatment of service in the^merchant navy, the Minister6f ^Labour dkd,National service said that he was satisfied thafcthigservice could be regarded as a class by itself and ought to be regardedas war service. /r,l\.The following points were made in discussion : (a) Care w6uld have to be taken in defining the kind of service in the merchant navy Which would be regarded as war service;&quot; seamen engaged in sea-goittg.service in registered ships mightbea suitable definition.    ^   ; 1 ;:(p) The treatment of service in the merchant navy as Wkiservice for the purpose of release from the Forces did not mean thatit would count towards any financial benefit, such as war gratuitiesor service increments. ,(c) It was suggested on behalf of the First Lord of theAdmiralty that the concession made to merchant seamen should not extend to fishermen. -(d) The Prime Minister asked whether further steps could notbe taken by the Admiralty to release fishing vessels in order toincrease supplies of fish.The War Cabinet-     ,(1) Agreed that service in the merchant navy should be treatedas war service for the purpose of determining the orderof priority of release from the Forces.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the. Minister of Food what further steps could be taken bythe Admiralty to release-fishing vessels.With regard to the position of ex-firemen released from theArmy to the National Fire Service and subsequently recalled, theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security pointed out thatthese men, who&apos;numbered only 3,900 in all, had been asked to volunteer for service as firemen at a time when that service probablyexposed them to greater dangers thai! service in the Army.  Unlikemembers of the Forces released temporarily for industrial work atindustrial rates of pay, they had merely been transferred from oneuniformed service to another and had received no more than theNational Fire Service pay.  Men who had been in the Fire service or in other forms of Civil Defence from the outbreak of the warand had subsequently been called up to the Forces had not the sameClaim.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that hisdifficulty was whether any concession here might not make it difficultto resist claims from other classes. If, however, the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security was&quot; satisfied that a clear distinctioncould be made between the 3,900 men who had been released fromthe Army and other firemen or Civil Defence workers who had been called up, he would be prepared to treat their period of service inthe National Fire Service as war service.The War Cabinet-(3) Agreed that, unless further investigation showed that a concession to men released from the Army.to theNational Fire Service would make it difficult to resistclaims from other groups of claimants, the period of release should be reckoned as war service for the purposeV      of determining the order of priority of release from the&apos; . . . &apos; Forces.  -The Secretary of State for A ir asked that flying service in civil air transport should be reckoned as war service.The War Cabinet-   .(4) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toarrange for this claim to be investigated by the Inter-departmental Committee.
Relaxation ofLightingRestrictions.In theLondon Area.(previous reference:W.M. (44)150thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. * At their meeting, on the 15th November the War cabinet had agreed to resume consideration of the relaxation of lighting restrictions in the London area.The War Cabinet now had before them-(i) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security (W.P. (44) 664) reporting on the positionin London; and(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power(W-P- (44) 669) regarding the difficulties involved inconverting gas-lit street lamps.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave theWar Cabinet figures showing the progress made with the improve-ment of street lighting since W.P. (44) 664 had been circulated.Action to improve street lighting was now being taken by 69 percent, of the authorities in the County of London and 65 per cent,of those in the London Region. The position of Central london had improved greatly in recent weeks and there was reasonably goodlighting in the central shopping area and near the main lineterminals.With regard to domestic blackout, he now proposed that the requirement of complete blackout On the alert should be abolished.This should greatly encourage householders to substitute dim-outcurtains for blackout curtains. He would also pursue the questionof abolishing all blackout requirements in the less vulnerable partsof the United Kingdom.The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that 60 per cent, ofthe street lamps in London were gas lit and that in order to convertthese a very large number of gas fitters would be required. Therewas at present a large demand for the services of gas fitters for restoring gas services to bombed houses.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested that since the normal gas-lit street lamp was not so powerful as the electric lamp&apos; it might be possible to permit local authorities to use their gas-lit lamps without conversion, even though this would mean that the standard of -02 candles would be exceeded.The War Cabinet- &quot;&quot;(1) Took note of the progress made with the improvement of street lighting in London and invited the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security to consider, inconsultation with the Air Staff, whether full lighting bygas-lit street lamps could be allowed in suitable cases.(2) Approved the proposal that the requirement of completeblackout on the alert should be abolished. .(3) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to&apos;consider, in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, the possibility of abolishing all blackout-   requirements over a large part of the country.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,SOth November, 1944.
