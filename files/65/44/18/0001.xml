[ 28672-2]Relief for 1.   At their meeting on the -16th October, 1944, the WarOccupied Cabinet had given general approval to certain recommendations ofEurope. the Anglo-American Committee in London for the provision of relief(Previous       to countries in Occupied Europe, subject to -WM (44) 137th (*) Consultation with the Russians before relief was-sent to conclusions, ....   m1 Pdf1110^Minute 9 ) v11) ^ne views of the Chiefs of Staff on the military implications-tions of the recommendations in question.The War Cabinet now had before them a report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (44) 613) as to the military implications of theseproposals.The Minister of State said that the Soviet Government had nowindicated that they had no objection to the proposalto send relief to the Poles. The Chiefs of Staff, in their report, expressed the viewthat the small tonnage of supplies involved would not materially help the^enemy, and was militarily acceptable, but they recommended that supplies should be sent by certain routes only.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Prime Minister said that the amount of supplies whichit was proposed to send were very small and would not represent any real relief. On the other hand, to send them would involve a breachin the central principle of the blockade, and he felt grave doubt asto the wisdom of giving effect to these proposals.(p) Moreover, responsibility for feeding the population in the occupied territories rested with the Germans. If we now started to send in food we might be compelled to continue this course.(c) It was also urged that, if any concession was to be made, theChannel Islands had a much better claim; yet even in the case of theChannel Islands grave difficulties were seen by the Chiefs of Staff.(d) On the other hand, it was urged that action taken at thisstage of the war would not constitute any serious breach of theprinciple of the blockade, and that it was right to pay regard to thepolitical advantages which would result from giving help, even on asmall scale, in the sixth winter of the war to the hard-pressedpopulations of the occupied territories.(e) Furthermore, it might be embarrassing vis-a-vis the americans to reject at this stage the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee, in whose work Mr. Hull and Mr. Morgenthauhad taken great interest.(/) The Minister of Food said that we did not know what foodswere, in fact, required. They were likely to be food-stuffs in short supply and, if so, would have to come out of the United Nations&apos;pool of milk and fats. The point was made in this connection thatthere was no advantage in despatching supplies save on a generousscale, which we did not in fact contemplate, and that small doseswere of little value.Further discussion showed that the general sense of the WarCabinet was that, before a decision was taken, further information should be obtained as regards the amount and the nature of  hesupplies envisaged.The War Cabinet accordingly, to enable the matter to be further considered : Invited the Minister of State and the Minister of economic warfare to arrange for a report to be submitted setting outin greater detail &apos;/(i) The amount and nature of the food-stuffs involved,(ii) The tonnage required to carry them.
The channel islands.(previous reference erence:W.M. (44) 140thConclusions,Minute 12.)2. At their meeting on the 23rd October the War Cabinet had decided to defer until the 6th November the question of sendingsupplies to the Channel Islands.   They now had before them \i) A Note by the Minister of Labour and National Service* (W.P. (44) 610), to which was attached a letter writtenfrom the Channel Islands on the 8th October, 1944.(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Information(W.P. (44) 606), inviting the War Cabinet to reconsider their decision on the 23rd October, 1944 (W.M. (44)140th Conclusions, Minute 12), that the Commander and principal officers of the German garrison should be warned that they would be held responsible for the well-being of the civil population, on the ground that a damaging reply might be given to any such message bythe German Commander,(iii) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security (W.P. (44) 615) urging that the WarCabinet should agree that the time had*now come to putin hand arrangements for Red Cross ships to transportsupplies to the Islands.In discussion of these papers, the utmost sympathy was expressed with the people of the Channel Islands, and the following three courses were considered :  The first was a proposal, somewhat on the lines of that whichhad been approved on the 23rd October but had not yet been actedon, that a warning should be given to the ten principal officers ofthe German force in the Islands that, if the population were reducedto needless privation and destitution, their names would be specifically added to the list of war criminals.It was urged that there was some risk that a threat of this nature might react unfavourably on German treatment of british prisoners of war. Moreover, the action proposed might be somisrepresented as to give the impression that we were asking theleading German officers in the Channel Islands to surrender failingwhich thev would be declared war criminals.The second suggestion considered was the German offer thatwe should evacuate the civil population, other than the men ofmilitary age.It was pointed out that while this course might seem preferable to importing into the Islands food which would prolong the resistance of the German garrison, in fact it would prove morefavourable to the Germans. Not only would they be relieved of alarge number of &quot; bouches inutiles,&quot; but they would have the benefitof the food produced by the labour of the men of military age.Furthermore, the problem of housing some 25-30,000 people inthis country would be a serious one from the point of view of theMinistry of. Health.The War Cabinet thereafter considered a third suggestion,namely, the possibility of an arrangement under which we shouldtreat the civil population of the Channel Islands on the analogy ofprisoners of war, to the extent that we would be willing to send inparcels of food, to supplement the basic ration provided by theGermans. Under international conventions, the Germans were bound to provide the civil population with the same scale of rationsas their own troops. Was there.any certainty that an arrangement of this nature would not be abused by the local German Commander ?Could we rely on any Reef Cross Commissioner whom the germans might allow to enter being able to ensure the distribution of suchsupplementary food supplies ? The War Cabinet was informed thatthe Germans were ready to agree to a Red Cross delegation visitingthe Islands to verify the facts.The general sense of the War Cabinet was that this proposal hadsubstantial merits. If accepted, it would to a large extent meetthe difficulties of the civilian population, without materiallyprolonging the possible resistance of the German garrison.   From
the Parliamentary point of view it had the advantage ofemphasising our anxiety to do everything consistent with the war effort to ease the lot of our fellow subjects in the Channel Islands.After further discussion the Prime Minister suggested, and theWar Cabinet agreed on the following proposals : (i) We were prepared to send parcels to our civilian nationals in the Channel Islands in the same way and under thesame conditions as such parcels were despatched to prisoners of war in enemy hands; on the understanding,however, that the Germans would in turn recognise their continued liability, despite the provision of such parcels,to provide a basic ration for the civil population.(2) We should express our readiness to supply the Islands witha sufficiency of medicines (even though they might beused by the German garrison) and soap.(3) Our proposal would be on the understanding that theGermans agreed to Red Cross supervision of the arrange-ments for supply and distribution.(4) Pending the German reaction to an arrangement of this nature, the proposal to warn the Germans that we should hold the ten leading officers of the garrison responsiblefor any deterioration in the physical condition of thecivil population below a certain level should be held in abeyance..(5) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security was authorised to institute the necessary action to give effectto the decisions in consultation with the Foreign Office.Prisonersof War.Employmentof GermanPrisonersof War.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 129thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. In the course of discussion on the previous item as to theshortage of accommodation in this country, enquiry was made as to how many German prisoners of war were now being brought from france to this country.The War Cabinet were reminded that on the 29th september the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary ofState for War had been asked to press the French authorities toretain German prisoners of war in France.The Prime Minister said that he attached importance to further large numbers of German prisoners of war not being brought tothis country.The Secretary of State for War was invited to submit areport showing how many German prisoners of war had beenbrought to this country since the 8th June, the total numberwho were now in this country, and what further arrangements were proposed in this matter.Street Lighting 4, At their meeting on the 26th October the War Cabinet hadin the London decided to resume consideration of the question of street lightingArea. in the London area in a fortnights time when a revised assessment(Previous of the scale of. air attack against the United Kingdom would be reference:        available.W.M. (44) 141st The. War Cabinet now had before them a report by the ChiefsConclusions, 0f Staff (W.P. (44) 600) endorsing one by the Joint IntelligenceMinute 3.) Sub-Committee on the scale of air attack against the UnitedKingdom. This report concluded that, if the blackout restrictions were relaxed in London and South-East England, it was justpossible that the enemy might attempt one or two attacks on theLondon area in the hope that the restrictions would be reimposed.It was doubtful, however, whether he would in practice think thatthe chances of achieving this were worth the effort. In any event the maximum force likely to be employed would probably not exceed40 aircraft carrying 1\-2 tons each, and this scale of effort could
not be kept up for more than two nights in close succession. Attackswould not be concentrated or pressed home, nor need any sustainedattack be expected.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthis report represented a very considerable reduction from any previous assessment of the likely scale of attack. Nevertheless, ifstreet lighting were restored in London, even only up to the standardallowed elsewhere in the country, this might not only tempt theenemy to launch piloted raids against London, but might also assist them-in attacking London by flying bombs. While the public would,no doubt, welcome better lighting if they were sure that this wouldnot increase the risk of attack, they were not yet prepared for substantial relaxations in the blackout. The alternative courseswere  -  &apos;(i) to prohibit increased street lighting in London for thetime being; or(ii) to allow discretion to individual local authorities in theLondon area to instal the same standard of street lighting as was allowed elsewhere in the country.If the second course were adopted there would be wide variations in practice among the various local authorities in the LondonRegion.The following points were made in discussion : -(a) A change in the position with regard to street lighting inthe London area would not involve any change in the restrictionsapplicable to factories.&apos; (b) There was a shortage of labour in the gas industry. Theposition had been aggravated by the need to employ workers on repairs to domestic gas installations damaged through enemy action.If a cold spell were experienced it would be very difficult to main-tain the supply of gas, and any extra demands arising from therestoration of street lighting would increase the difficulties.(c) The standard of lighting permitted in other parts of thecountry was equivalent to the normal peace-time lighting of sidestreets, and had given great satisfaction to the public in the areas where it had been brought into force.(d) If an improvement were made in street lighting it wouldbe desirable to withdraw the present&quot; requirement under whichhouseholders had to blackout their windows on an alert.After some further discussion the War Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to authorise local authorities in the London area to instalthe same standards of street lighting as were allowedelsewhere.(2) Agreed that the Home Secretary and Minister of TlomeSecurity should announce the decision in Parliament,and in doing so should make it clear that this did not mean that the menace of attack by piloted aircraft haddisappeared completely.Controls in the 5. At their meeting on the 2nd November the War CabinetTransitionPeriod.(previous reference:.W.M. (44) 145th- Conclusions,Minute 5.)agreed that a revised statement should be prepared about thecontinuance of controls in the transition period.The War Cabinet now had before them .(a) A memorandum by the Prime Minister (W.P. (44) 620)suggesting that as this matter affected the general policyand outlook of the Government, he should himself makethe statement in reply to a Parliamentary Question.(6) A note by the Prime Minister (W.P. (44) 623) suggesting the terms of the proposed Question and Answer.
Parliament. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a joint memorandumElectoral by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and the reform. Secretary of State  for Scotland  (WP. (44) 590)   about votingVoting arrangements for members of the Forces.fo^MMnbe^s3 ^ome Secretary and Minister of Home Security explainedof the Forces that    e Speaker&apos;s Conference had suggested that, in view of the,p   .        &apos; importance of making effective arrangements for the exercise of the4, ^ V1 us Service vote, the Government should consider the adoption of postalReference&apos;: ,. &apos;..      - n ,j r.     0     - naval (44) 144th vo^mS or voting in the field lor Service men and women overseas,Conclusions    &apos; anc^ 0^ automatic registration for members of the Services.   the minute lT&apos;     Speaker&apos;s Conference had taken no evidence from the Departmentsmu e concerned before making their recommendation.The question of the arrangements for the exercise of theService vote was dealt.with in the report of the Committee on electoral Machinery, dated December 1942, and proposals based onthis report had been approved by the War Cabinet and embodied in the Parliament (Elections and Meetings) Act, 1943. Under thisAct all members of the Forces overseas were given an opportunityof registering and of appointing a proxy. It would be impossibleto operate a system of voting in the field, and the proposal forautomatic registration would lead to many mistakes and greatconfusion. Postal voting had the disadvantage of delaying con-.siderably, the declaration of the result of the election and, whentried for the Forces in France and Belgium in 1918, had largelyfailed. The three Service Ministers supported the view that no*   case had been made for a change in the existing arrangements.The ensuing discussion concentrated mainly on the possibilityof devising a satisfactory system of postal voting for members ofthe Forces overseas.It was pointed out, on the one hand, that there were insuperable difficulties in working a system of postal voting unless the electorsregistered in advance. Without advance registration, unit officers would be given the impossible task of identifying the constituenciesto which their men belonged, and the candidates would have no opportunity of presenting their views to the voters. Even if regis-tration were effected in advance, however, there remained the seriousobstacle that the ballot papers would often not reach the voters intime. Before instituting a system of postal voting, the government ought to be satisfied that it would work, and all the evidence went to show that the result was likely to be a heavy addition to thework of the Service Departments without any improvement on theexisting arrangements.On the other hand, it was urged that the existing method of voting by proxy, though better than nothing, was much inferior toa system under which the voter was able to record his preferencedirectly.   Registration could be carried out in advance and, once the War Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft Answer (W.P. (44) 623) subject to thefollowing amendments (a) First paragraph : delete the words &quot; or three years,whichever ends first &apos;&apos;;(&amp;) Second paragraph : delete the following sentence &quot; There will also be a difficult stage after allthe wars are over.1&apos;(c) Second paragraph, last line:   for  &quot; make up &quot;substitute &apos;&apos; relieve &apos;&apos;.(d) Fourth paragraph:  after &quot;food&quot; insert &quot;trans-port &apos;&apos;.(2) Agreed that the Answer should be given on Thursday, the16th November, and that the proposed White Paper onRe-allocation between civilian employments during the transitional period should be published on the same date.
X&quot;Parliament.Date ofAdjournment,prorogation and Openingof new session.7.   After a short discussion-(1) The War Cabinet agreed on the following programme : Adjournment of the House     ...   17th November.28th November.29th &quot;November.Date of prorogationOpening   of   new   session   ofParliament   ...       ...(2) The War Cabinet also agreed that, while the latter datemight be announced in Parliament without going intosecret session, the Leader of the House would take stepsto ensure that this date was not published in Hansard;and the Minister of Information would.take steps to seethat it was not published in the Press, and that no indication would be given as to the opening of the new session of Parliament by His Majesty the King.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,7th November, 1944.. this had been done, it should not be impossible, given the resourcesof air transport, to ensure that ballot papers reached a very high proportion of members of the Forces in time to allow them toexercise the vote. When the ballot papers were posted they couldbe accompanied by a sufficient amount of election literature to&quot;convey to the voters the views of the candidates. The generalelection was not likely to take place until hostilities in Europewere at an end, and in these conditions the difficulties of ensuring that the ballot papers reached the voters in time would be much diminished. The system of voting by proxy must clearly be retained for voters in remote theatres of war, but it should be possible toenable the great majority of Service voters to vote by post. looking to the great importance of giving as many Service voters as possiblethe opportunity of exercising their vote directly, it was worth goingto a great deal of trouble to devise a convenient&apos; system; and in thecircumstances in which the first general election was likely to beheld a certain amount of delay in the declaration of the result wasnot likely to be serious.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatit might be convenient if the Secretary of State for Scotland andhe initiated an enquiry by an appropriate body into the extent towhich it would be practicable to extend the system of postal votingto members of the Forces overseas. For this purpose it should beassumed that the system would not be operated until hostilities inEurope were at an end. The results obtained by the use of a systemof postal voting in 1918 should be reported on, but account shouldbe taken of the better postal facilities now available through thedevelopment of air transport and of the fact that the conditions inwhich any general election was likely to be held in 1945 would allow of a considerable interval between nomination and the declarationof the poll.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the course proposed by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security at &quot; X &quot; above.
