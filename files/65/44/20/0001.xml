Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 146thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.naval operations.Pacific.MilitaryOperations.Belgium and holland.Italy.Russia.Burma.Philippines.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bad weather had interfered with the operations of bomber command. 2,870 sorties had been flown and 9,130 tons of bombs dropped, practically all on targets in Germany. 32 aircraft hadbeen lost. The targets had included oil plants and Coblenz. the attack on the Dortmund-Ems Canal on the 4th/5th November was now shown by photographs to have been very successful. The Canalwas now empty and impassable. The previous day, Lancasters hadbombed the Tirpitz 4 miles west of Tromso. The attack had beencarried out by 29 Lancasters, each carrying one 5-ton bomb. Three&apos;direct hits and several close misses had been obtained. the battleship had capsized.The War Cabinet Invited the Chief of the Air Staff to convey their congratulate-lations to Bomber Command upon this very successful operation.United States bombers had flown 4,500 sorties for the loss of49 aircraft. 8,720 tons of bombs had been dropped on oil factories and railway centres.The Allied Expeditionary Force had flown 13,100 sorties and claimed to have destroyed 500 enemy vehicles. 11 bombers and87 fighters and fighter-bombers had been lost.In the Mediterranean 13,300 sorties had been flown, for the lossof 67 aircraft. Nearly 10,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on enemy communications, the battle area and industrial targets inGermany and Austria.Shipping losses from enemy action during the month ofNovember amounted, so far, to 5,369 tons.Good progress had been made in clearing the Scheldt. It was thought that the Port of Antwerp should be clear by the 30th of themonth, but this date might be advanced.On the previous night two cruisers and four destroyers had attacked an enemy convoy off Lister Fiord, sinking several ships. Afull report of the action had not yet been received.A number of Japanese transports with reinforcements for the island of Leyte had been sunk.The operations designed to open up the port of Antwerp had now been completed. The fighting had been stiff and in difficultcountry, and the enemy had fought with great tenacity. The island of Walcheren was now clear of Germans and a large number ofprisoners had been taken. The 70th German Division had beeneliminated. Further South the American attack between Nancy andPont a Mousson had made an advance of between 6 and 8 miles on a25-mile front. The Metz-Saareburg railway had been cut 9 miles south-east of Metz.Forli had been captured. Polish forces on the left of the8th Army had made fair progress. There had been no advance onthe 5th Army front.In Northern Finland the Germans continued their withdrawal to Northern Norway. In East Prussia the Germans had recapturedGoldap. The enemy had succeeded in stopping Russian forces12 miles from Budapest. In the Sombor area the Russians had obtained a foothold West of the Danube.In the Arakan, Kennedy Peak had been captured and FortWhite encircled. In Northern Burma our forces were 11 miles fromIndaw.The Japanese had reinforced the Island of Leyte to the extentof about 20,000 men and heavy fighting must be expected in the nearfuture.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.
Attacks by rockets andFlyingBombs.casualties and Damage.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 146thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that during the previousweek 24 incidents in this country, due to long-range rockets, had beenreported, 9 of them in the Greater London area.During the week there had been flying-bomb activity on  nights. Ill bombs had been plotted, of which 36 had fallen on land, 4 in the Greater London area. 62 flying bombs had been destroyed, 10 by fighters and the rest, by guns. Fighters had destroyed 3 (or possibly 4) Heinkels.The total casualties for the week had been : Long-Range RocketFlying Bomb ...TotalSeriously slightly killed.   Injured. Injured. Missing.89 194 452 120 83 191109277643The War Cabinet asked that, unless the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security saw objection on security grounds, the location of the fall of long-range rockets should in future be recorded in the Cabinet War Room Daily Summary.ForeignAffairs.France.(previous reference:W.M. (4.4) 146thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a reportto the War Cabinet on the visit paid to France by the Prime Ministerand himself, on the matters that had been under discussion with theFrench Government.  The visit had been an unqualified success.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Palestine.Use ofTear Gas.(Previous^Reference:W.M. (44) 56thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. At their meeting on the 24th April the War Cabinet had&quot;deferred a decision on the use of tear gas in Palestine in the eventof civil disorder, mainly on the ground that its use by military personnel might be misrepresented, while there was also some doubt about the legal position.The War Cabinet now had before them a joint memorandumby the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (W.P. (44) 616), reporting that the deterioration ofinternal security foreshadowed last April was now evident, andthat there was nothing in international agreements to which thiscountry had subscribed which would prevent the use of tear gas by our troops in enforcing law and order in Palestine. The memo-randum recommended that in these circumstances the Commander -in-Chief, Middle East, should now be given permission to employit in the event of civil disturbances in that country.After a brief discussion the War Cabinet Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State for Warand the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Palestine. 5.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the WarInternal Cabinet of the latest developments in the Palestine situation.Situation. -  There were signs that the Jewish bodies in Palestine were. responding satisfactorily to the representations made to Dr. Weiz-Reference- mann. The High Commissioner who had been consulted as to whatWMrY44U46th father measures could be taken to signalise our view of the- &apos; ,   . assassination of Lord Moyne thought that the only possibilitiesConclusions, J D J   rwere : Minute 1.)(1) A n all-out search for arms. * While this would have a greateffect on Jewish opinion it would also, in the view of the HighCommissioner, cause serious trouble and substantial reinforcements
would be necessary to support it. The High Commissioner wastherefore opposed to it, but wished the War Cabinet to reaffirm theauthority which they had, at an earlier period, given him to makelimited searches in his discretion where he had reason to believethat a cache of arms existed.(2) Suspension of Jewish immigration into Palestine. to suspend the agreement recently reached with the Jewish agency for orderly immigration into Palestine at the rate of 1,500 a monthon the grounds of lack of security consequent on the failure of theJewish community to keep the extremists in order, would have asubstantial effect. The High Commissioner felt, however, that before resorting to this, the Jews, whose co-operation had been invited in putting down terrorism, should be given a chance to showwhat they could do. If the results were not satisfactory we could then consider suspension.(3) A public statement by the Prime Minister himself whichmight end with a solemn warning as to the possibility of suspension of immigration. The Secretary of State for the Colonies had discussed this course, which he strongly favoured, with the PrimeMinister and had sent him a draft for consideration.(4) A statement by the President to support the PrimeMinisters statement.(5) A National Registration scheme under which all shouldregister and carry identity cards. Though this presented many difficulties it was being examined and, if it proved practicable,would be brought before the War Cabinet.A general discussion followed.(a) Suspension of immigration. The general sense of the WarCabinet was that in face of the High Commissioner^ view no decision to suspend immigration should be taken at this stage. Itwould, however, be desirable, if the Prime Minister agreed, thata warning should be given by him in any public statement that he made that we might be driven to this failing an improvement inthe situation.(b) Statement by the Prime Minister. The view of the WarCabinet was that there would be great advantage in a statement bythe Prime Minister such as had been recommended by the HighCommissioner. The text of any such statement might be given inadvance to President Roosevelt, who might be invited on someappropriate occasion, such as a press conference, to associate himself with it.(c) Search for arms. The Secretary of State for the colonies said that while a wholesale search with the prospect of completesuccess would have a great effect, partial success would be a seriousblow to prestige. Without extra troops complete success could notbe guaranteed.The Secretary of State for War pointed out the difficulty of finding the necessary troops and the impossibility of using indian troops in a Moslem country.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested thatthe military implications of a wholesale search for arms should befurther examined.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Prime Minister should be informed thatthe War Cabinet strongly favoured the proposal that heshould make a public statement on the lines recom-mended by the High Commissioner for Palestine, andthat this statement* should include a warning that,* Note : The Prime Minister subsequently decided to omit from the state-ment which he made in the House of Commons on 17th November the threat of suspension of immigration, lest this should play into the hands of the extremists, and reduce the effect of the efforts being made by the Jews them-selves to suppress the terrorist organisations.
failing an improvement in the situation, it might benecessary for us to consider the suspension of jewish immigration;(2) Agreed that there would be great advantage if president roosevelt could in some way associate himself with thePrime Ministers statement, although he would probably not associate himself with any threat as regards the suspension of immigration;(3) Agreed that there should be no immediate suspension of jewish immigration.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in consulta-tion with the Chiefs of Staff as necessary, to prepare a paper on the question of instituting a wholesalesearch for arms, for consideration after the PrimeMinisters return;(5) Took note that the High Commissioner^ proposal for aNational Registration scheme was under investigation.A.T.S. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the compulsory Secretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 609) inviting their agreementPosting to the compulsory drafting to those overseas theatres, in which the overseas. prevailing conditions of service were suitable for women, of singleA.T.S. personnel of 21 years or over. Married women and womenbetween the ages of 19 and 21 would be sent overseas only if theyvolunteered in accordance with the existing procedure.The Secretary of State for War said that there were now anumber of duties in safe areas which could be discharged by A.T.S.There were some thousands of known vacancies and he might be ableto use another 10,000 A.T.S. overseas. Difficulty arose, not with theA.T.S. themselves, but with their parents.The Minister of Labour and National Service doubted the wisdom of applying compulsion at the moment when we were beginning to release personnel from munitions work. He questioned whether sufficient attempt had been made to find volunteers. Beforeresorting to compulsion all possible alternatives should be explored.A broadcast to parents, in suitable terms, might produce the requisite response.He feared a bad reaction in Parliament if compulsion were announced without any such preparatory action.The following points were made in discussion : (i) If an appeal such as suggested by the Minister of Labourand National Service was made, and failed, to produce the necessaryresult it would not, in practice, be possible to fall back oncompulsion. It was argued, on the other hand, that no explanationhad yet been given to parents of the reasons for which more A.T.S.were required for service overseas, and that it should not be assumed that an appeal would not be successful.(2) There was considerable feeling in the country about thelength of time for which men in the Forces had had to serve overseas.It would be important in connection with an appeal that a guarantee of a short term of service overseas should be given. The Secretaryof State for War expressed his readiness to consider a special term.(3) The R.A.F., though admittedly they had operated on a much smaller scale, had experienced no difficulty in finding sufficientvolunteers for overseas from the W.A.A.F., nor had the admiralty in respect of the policy mentioned in paragraph 3 of W.P. (44) 609.(4) The Secretary of State for India enquired whether india would be regarded as a &quot; climate suitable for women.&quot; TheSecretary of State for War said the answer was in the affirmativeso long as the Government of India could provide suitable accommodation.
After further discussion the general sense of the War cabinet was that the matter required further consideration and that adecision should be postponed.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for War to prepare a papergiving further factual information about the method of approach that had been adopted, the target to be aimed at, &amp;c, and to bring the matter up again on the PrimeMinister&apos;s return.Travel 7.   At their meeting on the 16th October, the War Cabinet hadFacilities.       asked that a memorandum should be prepared giving particulars(Previous       of the cases in which passages to France had been refused to ourEef erence:      Nationals by S.H.A.E.F., and evidence to show that AmericanW.M. (44) 137th citizens had obtained passages with less difficulty.Conclusions, The War Cabinet now had before them a report by the MinisterMinute 7.) of State (W.P. (44) 580). This showed that evidence could not beadduced to show that American business-men had been givenfacilities improperly to go to France. Moreover, now that thegreater part of France, including Paris, had been declared an&quot; interior zone,&quot; travellers to that part of France no longer required a military permit, and the situation was greatly changed. In thecircumstances it was not felt that there was any case for making representations to General Eisenhower on this matter.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that during his visit to Paris two suggestions had been made to him.The first was that the Minister of Information should arrangefor a jiumber of French journalists to pay a visit to this country.This was very desirable, since the French people were quite unaware of the conditions which have prevailed in this country since 1940.The second was that an exhibition, containing photographs ofair-raid damage sustained in this country, should be sent over toFrance, to be shown first in Paris and afterwards in other largeprovincial cities.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the Memorandum by theMinister of State.(2) Invited the Minister of Information to consider whethereffect could be given to the suggestions made by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Refugees.measures taken byBritishCommon-wealth toprovideasylum.(previous references:W.M. (44) 107thConclusions,Minute 2, andW.M. (44) 104thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. At their meeting on the 9th August, the War Cabinet had under consideration the so-called &quot; Horthy offer &quot; to allow a numberof Jewish refugees to leave Hungary, and had asked the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to arrange for the preparation of astatement, for communication to the United States Government,showing what we had done to provide accommodation for refugeessince the war.The War Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State (W.P. (44) 608) on the lines proposed.The Minister of State said that the position had, of course,greatly changed since the &quot; Horthy offer &quot; had been made. Never-theless, he thought it would be worthwhile sending the statement to the United States Government.The War Cabinet Approved this course, subject to (a) the statement being communicated to the dominions governments before it was sent to the United StatesGovernment;
(b) the form of the statement being altered so as to bring out clearly the total number of refugees, covered byAnnex I&apos;, for whom accommodation had beenprovided.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 601),reporting that no evidence had been received to substan-tiate the allegation that Erna Heilmann was a sniper, If)and that it was now proposed to transfer her from prisonto internment in the Isle of Man.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs referred toZealand-Australian Conference.  He had circulated a memorandum containing a series of telegrams from our high Commissioner in New Zealand reporting theresults of the Conference (W.P. (44) 630);a memorandum (W.P. (44) 641) in which he had drawn attention to the very unfortunate terms of the declara-tion about Colonial administration.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought we were bound to take strong exception to this declaration. At the meetingof Dominion Prime Ministers in May we had made it clear that we thought control of Colonial administration by a central international body would be most undesirable. Moreover, we had understood thatMr. Curtin (who was now ill) shared our view. % In a matter of thiskind all members of the British Commonwealth ought to co-ordinateas far as possible their respective views before making publicdeclarations of policy.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that thedeclaration had now been published for over a week. While hewould have preferred to have delayed dealing with this matter untilthe Prime Ministers return, he thought, in view of the time whichhad elapsed, he should now despatch the draft telegram printed asan Annex to W.P. (44) 641.The War Cabinet &apos;Approved the course proposed and authorised the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to proceed accordingly.Woman 9.Alleged to bea Sniper.(previous reference erence:W.M.(44)82ndConclusions,Minute 4.)Australia 20.and New        the NewZealand. . .(a)Conference atWellington.(b)Argentine 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the meat Prime Minister had addressed a minute to the Ministers concernedContract.        about the Argentine meat contract.   Attached to this minute was(Previous       a draft telegram which he suggested he should now send to PresidentReference:      Roosevelt, urging that the time had now come when we shouldWM (44)i42ndconcmde a long-term contract with the Argentine Government.Conclusions, After a short discussion the War Cabinet minute 10.) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (orthe Minister of State), the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Food should meet on the following day with a view to considering whether they wished to propose any amendments to the Prime Ministers draft telegram to the President.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,13th November, 1944.
