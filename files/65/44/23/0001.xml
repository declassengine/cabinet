(44) 131stConclusions,Minute 3.)6.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Lord Chancellor(W.P. (44) 648) reviewing the position as regards the machinery for&apos;dealing with war criminals for crimes against British subjects.In reply to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, whosaid that he had received representations from the Dominion high commissioners as to the importance of securing the dossier of war criminals where the actual perpetrator of the crime was notavailable, and as to the desirability of its being within the purview of the Commission to take evidence even when the criminal couldnot be found, the Lord Chancellor said that, while the commission had at first taken a narrower view on this matter, the revisedinstructions which had been issued to them fully covered this point.The War Cabinet approved the proposals in the Memorandum,which were as follows :  (a) The statement made in the course of the discussion at theWar Cabinet on the 4th October was confirmed, namely,that war crimes committed against British subjects orin British territory should be dealt with by military courts set up to try them in Germany (or wherever elsewas appropriate).(b) The Chiefs of Staff were invited (i) to send to the Combined Chiefs of Staff the amendeddirective attached as Appendix A to the paper(authority being given to the Chiefs of Staff toagree such further amendments as they might think desirable); and
7.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (44) 632) describing the situation which had arisen between India and South Africa over the anti-Asiatic legislation in Natal; and(ii) a joint memorandum by the Secretary of State for Indiaand the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(W.P. (44) 653), to which were attached draft telegrams to the Government of India and to the United kingdom high Commissioner in South Africa. The lattertelegram requested Sir Evelyn Baring to convey orally toField-Marshal Smuts a personal message from theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The Secretary of State for India said that the draft telegram to the Government of India appended to W.P. (44) 653 made it clearthat His Majesty&apos;s Government could not, and would not, approve the enforcement of prohibitions by the Government of India on theimport from South Africa of materials required for essential war purposes and which could not be procured from other sources either-at all or without serious disarrangement of shipping programmes orexisting financial arrangements.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs read to the WarCabinet the text of the proposed message to Field-Marshal Smuts.The Prime Minister agreed that this message should issue from theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs and not from himself (thePrime Minister).The War Cabinet-Approved the draft telegrams to the Government of Indiaand the United Kingdom High Commissioner in SouthAfrica appended to W.P. (44) 653.Iadia- 8.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that therehad been an exchange of letters between the Secretary of State forIndia and the Viceroy, which had not yet been circulated to theWar Cabinet and which he thought it was desirable that they should see. He invited the Secretary of State for India to arrange fortheir printing and circulation.The Secretary of State for India undertook to make thenecessary arrangements.Indians inSouth Africa.(ii) to recommend strongly to the Combined Chiefs otStaff that supreme Allied commanders be instructed to establish at once a suitable organisa-tion with an adequate staff qualified to investigatewar crimes and track down offenders. [It was important that Allied national offices should havedirect contact with such organisations established at supreme headquarters wherever this wasnecessary. ](c) &apos;The Secretary of State for &quot;War was invited, in consultationwith the Treasury Solicitor, to consider and give effectto any measures required to carry out the above recommendations, particularly in so far as war crimesalleged to have been committed against British subjectswere concerned.
9. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (44) 643).In his memorandum the Secretary of State for the Coloniesproposed (i) That the Colonial Development and Welfare Act should beextended for a further 10 years as from 1946.(ii) That the annual sum provided should be  10 million a year for the first 3 years, starting in 1946-47;.  15 million ayear for the ensuing 4 years; and  20 million a year forthe last 3 years. These would &apos;be overall sums, andwould include provision for research and certain additional schemes such as higher education, whichwould otherwise have to be brought forward outside thescope of the present Act.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, with whom he had discussed the matter very fully, found himself unable to commit himself to ahigher provision than  10 million a year for development and 1 million a year for research. The matter was accordinglysubmitted for decision by the War Cabinet.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, in supporting his proposals, made the following points : (a) It was essential to work on an overall 10-year plan, and ifthis was to be effective it necessarily meant a rising scale of grant.(b) The figures which he proposed were based on outline plansput forward by several of the larger territories, including Nigeriaand Uganda, and represented a scale of provision which, in his view,was essential.(c) The great bulk of the expenditure would be incurred in theUnited Kingdom and the Colonies and would be subject to strictfinancial control.(d) In framing his estimate of the sums required, he had takeninto account the existing sterling balances of the Colonies. Thesecomprised (1) The backing for the currency. This could not be touched.(2) Colonial Government balances and  investments  in theUnited Kingdom.    These he had assumed would be expended by degrees on development.(3) Holdings of British commercial companies banked in theColonies.   These he hoped would also be used by privateenterprise for development.(e) He was satisfied that the scheme proposed was the leastwhich would be regarded - in Parliament and in the Colonies asmeeting the needs of the case.(/) The Chancellor of the Exchequer fully recognised that theprovision of  5 million a year, with an additional  -  million a year for research, made under the Act of 1940 did not represent a scale of provision which would to-day be regarded as adequate. Hethought, however, that it was unnecessary to do more than doublethese sums.(g) He took exception to the rising scale of grant proposed,which he thought might be taken as implying that our financialposition a few years after the war would be greatly relieved. ThisAvas not the case.(h) The Sterling balances of the Colonies represented very substantial sums. Thus, in West Africa, the excess of those balancesover the currency reserves amounted to  47 million. In East africa the corresponding figure was  50 million.(j) In further discussion, the Prime Minister drew attentionto the extreme gravity of the financial position with which we wouldbe faced after the war, and said that he was very unwilling to see any rate of expenditure authorised in excess of that proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.FutureProvisionfor ColonialDevelopmentand Welfare.
(k) The Minister of Labour and National Service drew attention to the effect, on the working of any scheme of this kind ofthe provision that any unexpended balance, at the end of thefinancial year, of the grant payable in respect of that year must be surrendered to the Exchequer.(Z) It was pointed out in this connection that the totalexpenditure so far incurred under the 1940 Act only. amounted toabout  4 million in all over five years, against a maximum provisionof  20 million under the Act, the balance having lapsed. several ministers favoured an arrangement whereby any unexpected balanceof the grant in respect of a particular year could be carried forward and not surrendered. The Secretary of State for the Colonies shouldbe in a position to plan on the basis of a total expenditure over aperiod of 10 years, irrespective of the exact spread of expenditure between particular years.(m) Other Ministers expressed the view that the criterion whichshould be applied to this expenditure was the purposes on which the-money could be spent; and that if the grants were required for economic development they would prove a sound investment on thepart of Great Britain.The War Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to arrange for the matter to befurther discussed in the light of the views expressed in discussion, a report being made to the War Cabinet.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,21st November, 1944.

He had come to theconclusion that General Sir Maitland Wilson was theright man to fill the gap.     This appointment wouldenable General Alexander to be appointed supreme allied Commander in the Mediterranean.     As suchhe would retain operational control of the Armies in italy.
