(44). ;717/) r^/ v wing, in theligfht&apos; of Lord Killearn&apos;s views, the position as regards the use of tear gas- by the police^and military, as a means of dispersing mobs in EgyptvThe Ambassador; was of opinion that British -forces iir. egypt should be prepared to use tear-gas in the streets Or in driving people. from barricaded houses, but should not actually employ it until theBritish military authorities had been informed that the egyptian authorities had given their consent or, at any rate, had no objection.If British troops were compelled to take action to quell civildisobedience without the assistance of the Egyptian police or armed forces, or even in opposition to them, its use should, in the ambassador&apos;s view, be decided on purely military considerations.-.- The Foreign Office endorsed Lord Killearn&apos;s views, but cou-sidered that the British military authorities in Egypt should, inany circumstances, consult the Embassy before tear gas was used.The Secretary of State for War invited the War Cabinet totake note of the views of Lord Killearn and of the Foreign Office onthe use of tear gas to quell civil disobedience in Egypt. He wasinstructing the Commander-in-Chief accordingly.In discussion, it was suggested that it would be preferable thatthe term tear smoke should be used rather than tear gas.The War Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State forWar  and approved the action proposed by him in w.P.

(44) 731) reporting the viewsof the Lord Presidents Committee on the Eleventh Report of theSelect Committee on National ExpendituresIn this report the Select Committee had recommended-(a) that there should be an enquiry by a Select Committeespecially - appointed for, the ,purpose. .into the means ofsecuring the most effective control by Parliament ofpublic expenditure; ....... :.(&amp;) that the Select Committee oh National Expenditureappointed for the present Session should not be limited in their enquiries.to &quot; services directly connected withthe war &quot;; V:(c) that the Select Committee on National Expenditure in anyparticular. Session should not be limited, to the considera-tion of current expenditure incurred in a single financialyear but should be able to examine the expenditure onany given project as a whole; &apos;(d) that the Select Committee on National Expenditure should present to the House of Commons a general and objectivereview of the distribution of national expenditure on war services during the past five years.
SC 323   &apos; . W;M. 170:k cThe Lord;President&apos; sCommittee&apos; sinclusions- had:&apos;been,LjaS&apos;foltooiarv- r    -   ,       i ,&apos;! Eecpmniendatioiii (a), required further, consideration..   Recommendation (6) should be rejected, hamely, that the.    y  &apos; Committee&apos;terms of reference should no longer be limitedto &quot;services directly connected with the war.&quot;As regards Recommendation (c), it should be made clear thatthe Select; Committee were not limited to enquiring intocurrent expenditure, provided that they did not roam overthe sphere of the Public Accounts Committee.The review referred to in Recommendation (d), if carried out at all, should be carried out by the Government and not by&apos; *       the Select Committee.General agreement was expressed by the War Cabinet withthese views of the Lord Presidents Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired on what grounds heshould rely when informing the Chairman of-the Committee thatthe Government did&apos; not accept Recommendation (b). He thoughtit might well be argued, on behalf of the Select Committee, that,pending the re-establishment of the Estimates Committee (a body which had not given rise to any of the difficulties which had arisenas a result of the activities of the Select Committee on national expenditure), there were strong grounds for extending the terms ofreference of the Select Committee to cover services other than thosedirectly connected with the war. He could hardly disclose to theCommittee that the Government, in rejecting this recommendation,were influenced by the tendency of the Committee to depart fromtheir terms of reference.and to deal with matters of policy.In discussion, it was suggested that the Chancellor of theExchequer could use the argument that it would be necessary, inany event as soon as the war in Europe was over, to give considera-tion to permanent machinery for enquiry, by Committees of theHouse, into current public expenditure, a matter which the Select. Committee had themselves recognised -as ah appropriate subject for a special enquiry; and that it would be a mistake to interpose,for what it was hoped would be a short period, emergency&quot; machinery designed for the special conditions of war expenditure.To extend the Committee&apos;s scope to cover expenditure not directly connected with the war was, on any showing, an importantdeparture which ought not to be dealt with at short notice.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury (Mr. Stuart) saidthat he now thought it would be better to wait for a short period before moving the reconstitution of the Select Committee duringthe current Session.The War Cabinet-Approved the conclusions of the Lord Presidents Com-mittee as set out in W.P. (44) 731 and summarised above;and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to notifythose Conclusions to the Chairman of the Committee,Foreign Affairs. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed thePoland. War Cabinet of the latest developments in connection with Poland..p   .

Consultationwith theEuropeanAllied Govem-ments on the instrument of surrender ofGermany.a7. The &apos;-W&apos;a*----Cabinet -took &apos;i note, - wiQi approval, of memorandum by the Secretary of State for. Foreign Affairs aboutconsultation with; the European Allied Governments on the instrument of Surrender of Germany (W.P. (44) 723). The effectof this Memorandum was that in face of the expressed Sovietobjection we should acquiesce, for the present at any rate, in with-holdine from the present Polish Government in London information about the Instrument of Surrender, although this course would giverise to a protest from the Polish Government.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th December, 1944.
