1. , The War Cabinet resumed discussion of Clauses 45 and 46of the Town&apos; and Country Planning Bill;The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that themain provisions of Part I of the Bill had now got throughCommittee, but that it was clear that if Clauses 45 and 46 remained in the Bill there would not be time to pass it in the current Session,with the result that all the work done in Committee would be lbitiThe Clauses could be removed from the Bill without impairing its main structure and, dealing as they did with compensatioii for theacquisition of land for allpublic purposes, could appropriately formthe subject of separate legislation. If the Bill were passed without these Clauses, local authorities would be able to do much usefulpreparatory work. He accordingly suggested that the Governmentshould announce that they intended to move to omit Clauses 45and 46 from the Bill and should promise separate legislation on the&apos;subject of compensation.In discussion, the following points were raised :-(a) Would not the omission of the Clauses hamper any pre-paratory work by local authorities, who were bound to have regardto considerations of compensation ?It was explained that there was a vast amount of preparatory work which could be undertaken irrespective of a decision on compensation. It would, however, be essential to press On with separate legislation dealing with compensation as early as possiblein the new Session, and it could be provided that the Appointed Dayunder the present Bill should hot be fixed until Parliament hadenacted the system of compensation to be applied.(b) It was argued that the extent to which Parliament had agreed to the new powers of acquisition by local authoritiescontained in Part I of the Bill was related to the provisions for compensation. In omitting Clauses 45 and 46 from the Bill werenot the Government depriving Parliament of the opportunity ofbalancing the wider powers which had been agreed to in Part I byamending the scheme of compensation ?j It, was pointed.out that Parliament would have a free hand indealing, with the subsequent legislation relating to&apos; compensationwhen it was introduced, and that, if the Appointed Day for theoperation of the present Bill was not fixed until the system ofcompensation to1 be applied had been enacted, the position was amplysafeguarded.(c) Reference was made to the suggestion for a possiblecompromise set out in the Memorandum by the Minister of: aircraft production (W.P. (44) 557); and to a proposal by the Minister, ,ofHealth that all occupiers should receive compensation at the 1939value, together with any additional value which they might be&apos; ableto prove at the date of acquisition (or the date of passing Of theBill), provided that the addition should not exceed 30 per cent.The general view of the War Cabinet was that these and other suggestions&apos; required more, time for examination.(d) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that&apos;, ifClauses 45 and 46 were dropped, it must be understood&apos; that LabourMinisters were not committed to the compromise embodied in these clauses, and that the whole question of the basis of compensation would have to be considere&apos;d afresh.This was agreed to.There was general agreement that, in view of the complexityand difficulty of the subject of compensation, it would be unwisefor the Government to -ltt&apos;emp:t to secure the passage of Clauses 45and 46, either as they stood.or in an amended form; and that thebest course would be to move the omission of the Clauses and toamend the Bill so as to provide that the Appointed Day should notbe fixed until Parliament had enacted the system of compensation to be applied.Town and country planning Bill.(previous reference: ,W.M. (44 j 130thConclusions,Minute 6.)
Discussion then turned to the procedure to be adopted in theHouse of Commons. It was suggested that it would be desirable for the Whips to let it be known in advance that the government intended to propose the omission of Clauses 45 and 46 from the Bill,and that when Clause 45 was reached the Prime Minister shouldmake a statement pointing out that the amendment which had beenput down raised complex and difficult questions which required&quot; X &quot; 1 more time for consideration, and indicating that, in these circum-stances, the Government, rather than risk the loss of the Billaltogether, had decided to propose the omission of the Clauses. Atthe same time the Government would re-examine the compensation&apos;problem with a view to legislation early next Session and would putdown an amendment providing that the Appointed Day should notbe fixed until further legislation had been passed dealing with thesystem of compensation to be applied.The War Cabinet-Agreed to the course indicated at &quot; X &quot; above.Future world organisation.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 101stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thePresident 6f the United States was most anxious that the documentrecording the results of the World Organisation discussions atDumbarton Oaks should now be published. The Soviet Governmentwere agreeable to publication, although they had objected to oneparagraph in the communique which was to accompany the document. The publication of the document would have theadvantage of testing public opinion, and it could be made clear thatwe were not in any way committed to its terms.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that,although the Canadian Prime Minister had suggested that publica-tion should be postponed, it should be possible to convince him that publication was desirable. It would also be necessary to inform theother Dominion Prime Ministers in advance that we intended toagree to publication.The War Cabinet-Agreed to the publication of the document recording theresult of the World Organisation discussions, on the under-standing that it was made clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were not in any way committed.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Qth October, 1944.
