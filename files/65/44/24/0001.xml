It was important to know what those measures were. It ought not to be impracticable, if the ramifications of theseterrorists were as extensive as we understood, to take action against them through their contacts. It was for the Zionists to satisfy us that they proposed to take effective steps. If that were not the case,we might, however reluctantly, be driven to consider suspension of immigration despite the arguments against this course.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he hoped to circulate on the following day a paper* on the position generally,and undertook to make the enquiries which the Prime Minister had suggested.&quot;    The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.2. The War Cabinet had before them a personal telegram(No. 654 of the 21st November) from President Roosevelt to thePrime Minister on the position which had developed in the ChicagoCivil Aviation Conference. A record of the discussion is containedin the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions. Inthe light of it the War Cabinet -Invited the Special Aviation Committee to prepare for thePrime Minister a draft of a telegram to serve as a basis for a reply to President Roosevelt.[The text of the telegram, as despatched, is attached as an appendix to these Conclusions.]Civil air transport.ChicagoConference:(previous reference:W.M.

The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat he had come to the conclusion that there ought to be anindependent enquiry into the complaints about Marlesford LodgeRemand Home. Since children were involved, it would be preferableif the, enquiry were held in private, but the report could in due course be published.The War Cabinet-Agreed to the course proposed by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security.commercial policy.(previous reference:W.M.(44)92ndConclusions.)4. At their meeting on the 18th July the War Cabinet had agreed that the United States Government should be informed thatwe should be ready to resume the Article VII discussions on commercial policy in the autumn; and the Prime Minister had undertaken to set up a committee to re-examine the commercial policy scheme, with particular regard to the position of agriculture,and the provisions for bulk purchase thereunder.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 661) containing the report which the Committee had prepared after consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, the President of the Board ofTrade, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministerof Food.Subsequently circulated as W.P. (44) 878.[28736-3]b 2
The main recommendation of the report was that, in resumingthe discussions, our representatives should suggest that foodstuffsdf types &quot;Which enter iiitb international trade should be the subjectof special provisions within a multilateral convention. suggestions were made as to the lines on which these special provisions shouldbe based, and it was thought that it would be possible to devise ascheme which, whilst being compatible with the arrangementsdeemed necessary by the Agricultural Departments to secure stableagricultural prices, would yet have some chance of being acceptable to the principal exporters Of foodstuffs. It was suggested that officials should be authorised to discuss these suggestions on anexploratory and non-committal basis with Mr. Hawkins of the state department, who had arrived in London for an exchange of views.At the same time they might take the opportunity of broachingwith Mr. Hawkins the question of the meaning of non-discrimination.Attached to the Memorandum was a draft telegram to dominion Governments (Annex I) and a note on non-discrimination(Annex II).In discussion, attention was drawn to the suggested provision that, if a country&apos;s production of any group of foodstuffs of typeswhich entered into international trade, calculated as an average over a given number of years, exceeded by more than, say, 10 percent, a given level of the same country&apos;s production during a givennumber of pre-war years, that country would then be obligedgradually to reduce the degree of production or financial assistance given to its producers. Objection was seen by the Lord Privy seal to this figure of 10 per cent:,,which, it was urged, would undulyhamper Our agricultural development after the war.Objection was also seen to the sentences in paragraph 6 of thedraft telegram to Dominion Governments which indicated that avery substantial fall was to be expected in the level of home production of foodstuffs, particularly those formerly imported, andthat imports of foodstuffs to this country would probably not bereduced.It was explained that the reason for inserting these sentenceswas that it was anticipated that the Dominions would be anxious about their market for the import of foodstuffs into this country.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the scheme, as setout in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Memorandum, had beenaccepted by all the interested Government Departments. Thus, theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that he regarded thescheme as a substantial advance on the schemes previously putforward, and was prepared to accept it as a basis for discussion.At the same time, he did not himself believe that the multilateralapproach was the right one, and he thought that the chances ofa multilateral convention being concluded were becoming less and less likely.The Secretary of State for Air asked that his view should be recorded that he would have great difficulty in accepting proposals under which the prices of foodstuffs in this country might rise byas much as 25 per dent.In further discussion, it was suggested that we might welltake the line with the Americans that we had found great difficultyin reaching firm decisions on this matter, that we had many otherpreoccupations, and, furthermore, that it was difficult for us toreach firm decisions without knowledge of what the Americansthemselves had in mind in the way of reduction of their tariffs.There was much to be gained by Opening up discussions withMr. Hawkins and ascertaining, the present views of the state department oh these matters. It was believed that Mr. Hawkinshad brought Over a draft convention with him, and it might bepossible to get a copy Of it from him. So long as the talks were keptstrictly non-committal and exploratory, there could be no objectionto officials exploring with-Mr. Hawkins the possibility of separateprovisions to cover foodstuffs of the types which entered intointernational trade, provided that percentages and details of anyparticular scheme were not discussed.
The War Cabinet (1) Took note of the Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (W.P. (44) 661).(2) Agreed that officials should be authorised to hold explora-tory and non-committal talks with Mr. Hawkins.   In. the course of these talks, the officials should *(a) ascertain the views of the State Department;(b) put forward the possibility of special provisions tocover foodstuffs of the types which entered, intointernational trade, but without giving per-centages or figures, or entering into details;(c) explore the question of non-discrimination dealtwith in Annex II of W.P. (44) 661.     /(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs to send a draft telegram to the Dominion governments on more general lines than the draft shown in Annex I,indicating the basis on which the discussions withMr. Hawkins would now take place.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,22nd November, 1944.APPENDIX.1. We would wish to draw your attention to the course of the negotiations at Chicago, which have been marked by a large measure of concessions on bothsides.2. Whereas in order to reach a common agreement your delegation has agreed to a method of regulating the share of the various countries on thedifferent routes and of regulating the fares, we have agreed to the throwing openof our airfields all over the world to aircraft of other nationalities and to suchplanes being able to carry not only through traffic but local traffic between twoneighbouring countries on the route.3. We had very much hoped that the agreement thus arrived at betweenyour delegation. and ours which was embodied in the form of the draft of the17th November would be a satisfactory document to submit for the approval ofthe whole body of the conference.4. We feel that we have gone to the limit of concession in this draft,especially with relation to the so-called escalator clause, which enabled the shareof operators to be increased if they in fact carry more traffic between terminalsthan they are allotted under the frequency arrangements.5. In our understanding it was only because of the new proposals brought forward by your delegation on the evening of the 18th November, after theagreement had been arrived at, that the present difficulties have arisen. Theseproposals we could not accept, since they demand a share of the local traffic between two neighbouring countries by the -aircraft of a third country far beyond that which the granting of the right to take up traffic on through service would warrant.6. We were prepared to agree to the so-called Fifth Freedom subject to adequate protection of the local operators by a price differential to which yourdelegates agreed in the draft accepted.7. We are, of course, prepared to stand by what Swinton had already agreed with Berle, but we cannot see our way to accept these new suggestions&apos; putforward, which would gravely jeopardise our own position.8. We suggest, therefore, that, if you are unable to confirm the agreementarrived at on the 17th November by our delegations at Chicago, the conference should finalise the valuable technical agreements which have been arrived at andthat the rest of the matters should be adjourned for a time, during which we canconsider the matter more fully and see whether there is some solution of theproblem at which we can arrive.9. We share with you the most earnest desire to come to a fair and satis-factory agreement by which both our countries can play their full part in thedevelopment of world-wide civil aviation.as soon as possible.10. We hope that you will be able to examine this, and I feel sure you will agree that it is a wise and workable compromise between two points of view whichoriginally diverged &apos;widely.
