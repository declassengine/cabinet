BillDiplomatic 1.   The War Cabinet were informed that private explanationsPrivileges had now been given to the Members who had raised objections to(Extension) the Bill in the course of the Second Reading debate on the27th September. The Members concerned had expressed themselves as satisfied, and it was not anticipated that there would be any difficulty in securing the passage of the Bill. It was proposed,however, to make a full statement when the Second Reading debatewas resumed on the following day answering, the criticismspreviously raised.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that it would bedesirable to explain that, although the Bill did not provide immunity from customs duty, this immunity went with immunity from other forms of tax; and that the concession was one which was given asa matter of diplomatic courtesy, subject to suitable administrative arrangements.The Minister of State undertook to make a statement on theselines.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of these statements.Town and 2.   The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Town and country Country Planning gave the War Cabinet an account of their meetingPlanning Bill, with Members earlier in the day.(Previous nReference- -^&quot;e iolkrwmg were the mam points : .W.M. (44) 135th (a) The proposal to provide for an addition to the compensa-Conclusions.)    tion payable to owner-occupiers of buildings and of agricultural.property had been well received, although there had been some criticism of the fact that this concession did not extend to personswho had acquired property as an investment. It had also beensuggested that, instead of fixing a 30 per cent, ceiling for theproposed addition, the Bill should leave the percentage to be prescribed.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that it would be preferable to insert the figure of 30 per cent, in the Bill, subject tothe provision, which had been agreed on at their meeting earlier inthe day (W.M. (44) 135th Conclusions, Conclusion (7)), for varyingthe percentage by means of Orders made with parliamentary approval.(b) Members had suggested that the proposed addition to thecompensation payable in the case of improvements On which expen-diture had been incurred at enhanced prices should not be limitedto improvements carried out during the war.It was pointed out that under the scheme proposed an additioncould be claimed in respect of any improvement carried out betweenthe 31st March, 1939, and the date of the notice to treat.(c) The suggestion had been made that all owner-occupiers ofwar-damaged property, who were entitled to value payments underthe War Damage Act, should be entitled to claim an addition on thelines of that proposed for owner-occupiers whose property wasacquired for public purposes. It had, however, been explained to theMembers that this proposal was outside the scope of the Bill.(d) There had been further pressure in favour of a provision to ensure that the compensation paid to speculators who had boughtwar-damaged land at very low prices should not exceed the prices which they had paid.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, in view of thedifficulties in drafting an effective clause, the Minister of Town and country Planning should adhere to the line approved at the meetingearlier in the day (WM. (44) 135th Conclusions, Conclusion (4)).
Publication of 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thea Report by a Minister of Fuel and Power (WtP. (44) 565) proposing publicationUnited States of the report of a recent United States Mission to the british mission. coal-fields.. The report had been made to the Combined Production and resources Board and dealt with the use by the coal industry ofUnited States machinery sent to this country. It was a secret report and the House had been so informed on the 3rd August. consequent on leakage in W ashington, an official summary drafted in washington, which avoided all contentious points, had been released to the press on both sides of the Atlantic in September. TheMinister of Fuel and Power explained that he was now being pressedfrom both sides of the House to make the complete report available.In his view, refusal would do more harm than good, and on the whole he recommended that, if the Americans agreed, the report should bepublished.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The publication of a secret report, the information contained in which had been made available on the understandingX &quot;   I that it would not be published, raised a serious question of principle.This alone would provide a good answer in the House to any criticism of a decision against publication.(b) Moreover, at some later stage a very awkward situation might arise if the United States Government, whose concurrence to publication would have to be obtained, were to use their agreement to publication in this instance as a reason for publishing in the&apos;United States some similar report that might be very embarrassingfrom our point of view.(c) While the publication of the frank criticisms of owners andmen in the coal industry contained in the report might have a healthy[28438-2] b 2The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the information given by the Deputy PrimeMinister and the Minister of Town and country planning.The War Cabinet then considered the terms of the proposeddraft reply to the following private notice question, which it was intended to put down for Friday, the 13th October, in accordancewith their decision at the meeting earlier in the day (W.M. (44)135th Conclusions, Conclusion (8)) : *Mr. Arthur Greenwood To ask the Deputy PrimeMinister whether he can make a statement on the governments intentions with regard to the revision of Part II of the Townand Country Planning Bill as introduced.A number of amendments were made in the terms of the draft reply.The War Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the Deputy Prime Minister should reply as inthe amended draft (see Appendix to these Minutes). .The War Cabinet were informed that, if Ministers were to havereasonable time to consider the new Clauses, it would not be possiblefor them to appear on the Order Paper before Thursday, the19th October. In these circumstances it would be better to postponetaking the Clauses until a day in the week beginning the23rd October. The result would be that the Bill would not reach the House of Lords until Friday, the 27th October, and that it wouldbe necessary to extend the Session for a further week.The War Cabinet--(3) Agreed that the business of the House should be rearrangedso as to enable the new Clauses to be taken in the week beginning the 23rd October.
effect on the industry, there was the risk that they might give riseto allegations in wider circles of American interference.(d) Publication would tend to confirm the impression that theearlier official summary prepared in the United States had beenunduly favourable.After further discussion, the War Cabinet Decided that the report should not be published, and thata refusal should be justified in the House on the groundsstated at &quot; X.&quot;International 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theCivil Air Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (44) 564), to which was attachedTransport. the draft of a White Paper on International Civil Air TransportWhite Paper    outlining Government policy.outlining At their meeting on the 25th September the War Cabinet hadGovernment deferred a decision on the question whether a White Paper shouldPolicy. be presented to Parliament in the near future outlining the policy(Previous       which we advocated for the future development of air transportReference:      until they had been able to consider a draft.  The Secretary of StateW.M.(44)127th for Air said that there had since been pressure in the House for a conclusions,     statement of our policy. Now that the United States, the Canadian,Minute 10.)     Australian, New Zealand and South African Governments hadeither published their ideas or indicated where they stood, it seemedright that Parliament and the British public should be aware of ourown intentions, and he invited the War Cabinet to approve publica-tion of the draft White Paper appended to W.P. (44) 564.In discussion, the following drafting amendments were suggested : (a) Paragraph 1 Position of the Dominions. Tt wassuggested that, to bring out the position of. the Dominions, thesecond sentence of paragraph 1 should be amended to read asfollows : *&quot;The Canadian Government has already published its proposals, and it now seems appropriate that His Majesty&apos;s&apos;Government should lay before Parliament the plan which it&apos; favours for the ordering of post-war air transport.&quot;(b) Paragraph 7 (ii). -The Chancellor of the Exchequersuggested, with a view to making it clear that the grant of the degree of freedom referred to would be conditional on the acceptanceof the rest of the Convention, the insertion after the words&quot; ratifying States &quot; of&apos;the words &quot; subject to acceptance in full ofthe rest of the Convention.&quot;(c) Paragraph 7 (ii). The First Lord of the Admiralty had suggested, in order to safeguard the effectiveness of blockade in timeof war, the amendment of paragraph 7 (ii) to read : &quot; It is proposedthat this should in normal times of peace extend to (a) the right of innocent passage through a State&apos;s air space. . . . .&quot;(d) Paragraph 7 (v). -The Chancellor of the Exchequersuggested the insertion after the words &apos;&apos; abide by the rulings &apos;&apos; ofthe words &apos;&apos; of the international authority and the operationalexecutive.&quot;(e) Paragraph 7 (v). -The Chancellor of the Exchequersuggested the insertion after the words &apos;&apos; withdrawal of the licence &apos;&apos;of the words &quot; in the event of a breach of obligation&quot; and the deletion of the words &apos;&apos; from any operator who disregarded hisobligations.&quot;(g) Paragraph 13 (ii). The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs suggested that the words &apos;&apos; or unwilling to do so &quot; as draftedsuggested the possibility of an element of compulsion. To meet thispoint the Secretary of State for Air proposed the addition after thewords &quot; do so &quot; of the word &quot; itself.&quot;(h) Paragraph 14. -The Secretary of State for Air suggestedthat, from the point of view of Members of Parliament likely to favour international operation, there would be advantage ininserting after the words &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; the words
&quot; in present circumstances,&quot; which would leave it open, to those who wished, to press for an understanding as regards internationaloperation in the future.After further discussion, the War Cabinet -Approved the draft White Paper, subject to amendmenton the lines indicated above, and agreed that it should be presented to Parliament at an early date.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,12th October, 1944APPENDIX.Reply to be given by the Deputy Prime Minister to a Private Notice question about the Revision of Part II of the Town and Country Planning Bill.The Government intend to maintain the general principle that compensation in respect of land and buildings shall be assessed by reference to prices currentat the 31st March, 1939, and they are not prepared to allow any general increase to be added automatically to the compensation so assessed. They propose, however,that in certain types of case an addition should be made on the following lines : An owner-occupier of buildings or of agricultural property will be entitledto claim from the purchasing authority such an addition to the compensation asmay be reasonable, having regard to all relevant circumstances, whether favourableor unfavourable. This addition will not in any case exceed a sum representing a30 per cent, proportion of value at 1939 prices, and will not include anythingreferable to site value in the case of buildings or to development rights in the caseof agricultural properties.A claimant will be treated as an owner-occupier on the ground either ofactual occupation at the time of notice to treat or of a proved right and intentionto occupy within a limited future period. The provision will be framed so as togive equivalent treatment in the case of property which owing to war damage isincapable for the time being of occupation. Provision will be made for varyingthe 30 per cent, maximum upwards or downwards by means of orders made with parliamentary approval.A right of appeal to a suitable tribunal will be given to any claimant in theevent of his being dissatisfied with the offer made to him.There is one further type of case in which the Government propose an addition. Suitable provision will be made for an addition, within the foregoinggeneral conception, where expenditure has been incurred by the claimant atenhanced prices on improvements to the property concerned during the period between the 31st March, 1939, and the date of the notice to treat, so far as these improvements are not paid for or provided for in other ways. This addition willnot be restricted, as will the other, to owner-occupiers.
