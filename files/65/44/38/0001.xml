(44) 151stConclusions,Minute 5.)-    2.   At their meeting on the 16th November the War cabinet had agreed to resume consideration of-(i) a Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(W.P. (44V 640) proposing legislation to secure a balanced distribution of industry; and(ii) a joint Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal and Ministerof Information (W.P. (44) 652) making certaincriticisms of the proposals in W.P. (44) 640.I. Proposed Power to enable the Board of Trade to build Factories.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was now prepared to limit to the development areas the exercise of the powerto build factories, to establish&apos;and finance trading estates, to- ,   acquire land and to clear sites for industrial development.II.-Proposal that Grants should be given to improve Services onwhich Industry depended in order to encourage the estab-lishment of Firms in the Development Areas.The view was expressed that the effect of giving assistance ofthis kind would be to discriminate unfairly between oneindustrialist and another and to encourage the establishment of uneconomic factories. On the other hand, it was pointed out that;although everything possible would be done to promote the mobility of labour, the shortage of houses and the fact that certain industries, such as coal-mining and steel, must be located inparticular areas would make it essential to retain a considerable part of the population in areas where, unless there was somediversification of industry, serious depression and unemploymentwere likely to develop in peace time.   New industries might be, deterred from settling in these areas because of the absence ofsuitable communications and services, and it was fair that assistance should be given in order to remedy deficiencies of this kind.  There,j, was no intention of doing more than offset the disadvantages of settling in the development areas, and the fraction of the totalindustry of the country which would be affected by the proposals was very small Although under existing legislation it was possibleto give grants direct to industrialists, under the new legislationgrants would be given only to&apos;local authorities. Thus there shouldbe no danger of unfair discrimination between differentindustrialists.III. Proposals for requiring Industrialists to notify the Boardof Trade before building new Factories, extending existingFactories or starting new Businesses in existing Buildings.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was willingto amend his proposals&apos; so that an industrialist who proposed tobuild a new factory need only notify the Board of Trade before the contracts had actually been placed, instead of three months before-hand. So far as extensions were concerned, the only obligationwould be to notify the Board of Trade; and, if necessary, he wouldbe willing to drop the proposal that any change of use of a factory building should be notified.The fear was expressed that this system of notification would inevitably lead to Government interference which would hamperenterprise and discourage private initiative and desirable new developments.[28897-^2] b 2
It was explained,&apos;-however; &quot;that all that was ^intended was thatthe Board of Trade should receive timely warning of any proposals affecting the industrial balance of a particular area: The estab-lishment of a new factory or the diversion of a factory from one use to another might affect considerably the employment position in thearea, and it was desirable that the Government should be hv aposition to take remedial action where it was required.Notification would give the Board of Trade an opportunity, incases where this was desirable, Of making representations toindustrialists. But industrialists would be under no obligation toaccept this advice, &quot;although experience showed that they would,often welcome it. IThe general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, within thelimits indicated in discussion, there was a good case for the giving of grants to local authorities for the improvement of services in development areas, and for requiring industrialists to notify tothe Board of Trade their plans for new developments or changes of use. It was suggested, however, that it might be desirable forthe War Cabinet to see the draft clauses dealing with these mattersonce they had been prepared.The War Cabinet- , x(1) Authorised the drafting of a Bill to carry out the proposals in W.P. (44) 640, subject to Ihe modifications indicatedin discussion.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to bring theBill before the War Cabinet.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (44) 716), to which was annexed the Legislative Programme for the 1944-45 Session, as approved by the Legislation Committee.The Lord President of the Council explained that he had thought it right to revert to the pre-war practice of submitting tothe War Cabinet the Legislative Programme for the Session. Inaddition to the usual number of essential Bills, the Programmeincluded, in Section 4, a number of Reconstruction Bills far inexcess of that for which time could be found in the Session; and, inorder to avoid dissipating the efforts of Departments and ofParliamentary Counsel, it had been decided to fix an order of priority. The Legislation Committee would review the position at intervals in order to make any necessary adjustments in the order and to keep a general watch over the progress made.The following points were made in discussion :- (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that departments were being informec! by the Treasury that the services of Parlia-mentary Counsel would normally be made available only for bills which had been given priority by the Legislation Committee.It was suggested that, in view of the very heavy programme oflegislation with which Parliament was likely to be faCed both inthe present Session and in future Sessions, steps should be taken tostrengthen the,staff of Parliamentary Counsel., The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that he would look into this.(b) The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that he might at a later date have to press for a higher priority for the      QTown and Country Planning (Land Control) Bill, which was atpresent in Section 4 (&amp;).The War Cabinet-Took note of W;P. (44) 716; and approved the procedure&quot; proposed by the Lord President of the Council.legislative programme,1933-45Session.
315.,. W.M. 168 (44).111:., 4, The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the modifications in Chancellor of the Exchequer (W P, (44) 424) putting forwardParliamentary certain recommendations of the Machinery of Government Com-Prpcediire.      mitteefor modifications in Parliamentary procedure.- TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that   in view of the vastmass of legislation which would be necessary before the end of thereconstruction period, the Machinery of Government Committeehad considered what changes might be made in parliamentary procedure in order to facilitate progress, and had approved certain proposals which were set out in a statement annexed toW.P. (44)424. The Committee recommended that the War cabinet should approve^ the draft memorandum annexed to W.P. (44) 424as a statement of the Governments proposals for modification ofParliamentary procedure, in order to meet the exceptional needs ofthe reconstruction period, and should authorise the taking ofsoundings among Members of the House with a view to the appoint-ment this Session of a Select Committee which would be invited toexamine and report on the proposals.    ,It was suggested in discussion that it might be inexpedient to embark on modifications of Parliamentary procedure at this latestage injJie life of the present Parliament. Would it not be better to defer action until a new House had been elected? It was also pointed out that the proposal put forward in paragraph 7 of the1 Annex to W.P. (44) 424, that there should be a return to standing order No. 49A, was open to criticism.On the other hand, it was urged that, if a Select Committeewere appointed in the present Session, it would be able to draw onthe experience of Members with, long service in the House, some ofwhom wOuld not be available in the new Parliament. It was important that the House should show itself ready to adapt itsprocedure to the needs of the time.A possible course would be to have the enquiry by the SelectCommittee in the present Session, leaving it to the new House toreach a decision on the Committee&apos;s recommendations. It was also important that the proposals in the Annex to WP. (44) 424 shouldbe given to the Select Committee informally, and not put beforethem as definite expressions of the Governments views.The War Cabinet-Invited the Joint Parliamentary Secretaries to theTreasury to take soundings among Members of the house in order to ascertain their views with regard to theappointment of a Select Committee on parliamentary procedure.Men released from the armed Forces.Resettlement,Gratuities,Prize money and Bounty,(previous reference:W.M. (44) 128thConclusions,Minute. 4.)5. At their meeting on the 27th September the War cabinet had asked for&apos; a statement on the provision being made for the resettlement of men released from the Armed Forces.The War Cabinet now had before them-^(i) a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (W.P. (44) 602)setting out comprehensively the provisions being madefor resettlement;(ii) a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (44) 700) on War Gratuities for the armed forces;(iii) a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(W.P. (44) 711) on Prize Money and Prize Bounty.In the course of a preliminary discussion the view was expressed that, while prize bounty could well be declared obsoleteand no grants made in this war, it would be impracticable to avoidpayments of prize money in this war to individual seamen.No conclusions were recorded, and the War Cabinet agreed to resume discussion of these papers at an early date.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,ISth December, 1944.
