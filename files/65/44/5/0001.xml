Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 132ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.naval operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.MilitaryOperations.N.W. Europe.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command had flown 3,935 sorties and dropped13,605 tons of bombs (11,000 of them on Germany) for the loss of38 aircraft. The targets had included saarbrucken, the oil plant at Sterkrade, Cleve, Emmerich and the Walcheren sea wall. A .breach&apos; had been made in the Rhine dam at Kemb. It was now known that in the attack of 23rd-24th September on the Dortmund-Ems Canal, 18 miles of waterway had been put out of action. Inan attack on Bergen, 2 U-boats had been sunk and great damage caused to the shipyard.United States heavy bombers had flown 6,095 sorties, dropping12,666 tons of bombs for the loss of 106 aircraft. Their targets hadincluded tank factories, motor transport vehicles and railways.The Allied Expeditionary Force had flown 17,500 sorties at-the cost of 23 bombers and 101 fighter bombers.265 enemy aircraft had been destroyed.5,200 sorties had been flown and 4,100 tons of bombs dropped.48 enemy aircraft had been destroyed as against 52 Allied.There had been no shipping losses from enemy action duringthe previous week. The total losses from this cause for september to date were 43,368 tons. A Russian convoy had arrived in this-country on the 4th October, one British and one United Statesmerchant ship having been sunk.A force had been landed in N.E. Greenland on the 4th october and captured the German meteorological station.In the iEgean, cruisers and destroyers had operated in supportof military operations.Following a landing on the island of Levitha, the garrison had.surrendered. Six enemy landing craft had been destroyed N.W. ofRhodes.United States forces had made slight advances in the neighbour-hood of Belfort against determined resistance; progress had also-been made east of Epinal and in the neighbourhood of Luneville.In the attack north-east of Aachen, United States forces had been unable to follow up their initial penetration of the Siegfried line.British forces had slightly extended and strengthened the bridge-head in the neighbourhood north of Nijmegen. They had also made-advances to the east of the salient and beaten off enemy counter-attacks. On the front held by the Canadian Army, a bridgehead&apos;had been thrown across the Leopold Ganal.It was explained that this attack had been carried out by aBritish corps which forms part of the Canadian Army, but that theimpression given by published reports was that these operations were wholly carried out by Canadian troops.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to enquire into this and, if necessary, to bring it to thenotice of Field-Marshal Montgomery.Italy.Greece andthe Balkans.Eastern Front.North of Antwerp considerable progress had been made and the roadinto Walcheren was now under fire. The air attacks on theWalcheren sea wall had been most successful.The enemy had strengthened his front opposite the 5th army which was now some 12 miles from Bologna. There had been little:change elsewhere.The Germans continued slowly to withdraw their forces by airfrom Greece and the ^aegean Islands. Their withdrawal further north was being harassed by partisans and was now threatened by;the advance of the Russians towards Belgrade. Our recent operations in Greece had been carried out by small forces. Virtuallythe whole of the Peloponnese had now been freed.The Russians had attacked in North Finland, and. german forces were withdrawing northwards. The Russians had capturedDago and most of the island of (Esel. The powerful Russian attack,south of Riga had resulted in an advance on a front of 170 miles[28419]
Attacks bySockets and flying Bombs.Casualties and damage.(Previous .Reference:W.M. (44) 130thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that in the previous week28 long-range rockets had been fired at this country, of which21 had been aimed in the Norwich direction and 7 at London. Therehad been two incidents.in the London, area. During the week52 flying bombs had crossed the coast, of which 10 had reachedthe London area, while 17 had been destroyed. Total casualtiesfor the week had been : &apos;30&apos; killed (8 by long-range rockets).69 seriously injured.193 slightly injured.In reply to a question by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security, the Chief of the Air Staff said that everything possible was being done to overcome attacks by long-range rocketsand by flying bombs. He undertook to enquire into the possibilityof our air forces on the Continent attacking the airfields used bythe Heinkel aircraft which launched the flying bombs.Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.Question of publicity.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 127thConclusions,Minute 5.^3. The War Cabinet were reminded that the Chiefs of staff had approached the United States Chiefs of Staff with thesuggestion that they should take steps to restrain publicity inAmerica about attacks on this country by long-range rockets.Nevertheless an article had appeared in the New York Times on the6th October by Hanson Baldwin, giving information about the long-range rocket attacks. It was for consideration whether, in viewof this, the ban on publicity in this country about rocket attackshould be maintained.The W,ar Cabinet were informed that the Germans had stillmade no mention of rocket attacks against this country, and thatthere was no pressure for the ban to be released.The War Cabinet-Decided that, in the circumstances, the ban on publicityabout rocket attacks should be maintained.The Minister of Aircraft Production drew attention to themaps appearing in the press giving detailed information as to whereflying bombs had fallen in particular parts of the London Region.It was suggested that such detailed information as to the fall ofshot might help the enemy to estimate the accuracy of the weapon,and thus be of use in the event of future flying-bomb attacks against targets on the Continent.The Chiefs of Staff were invited to consider whetherpublication of further maps of this description should be permitted.Egypt.(previous reference:.W.M.(44)56thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Minister of State informed the War Cabinet of thecircumstances of Nahas Pasha&apos;s dismissal from office. The occasionhad been a dispute over the dismissal by the Government of theDirector-General of.Public Security, M. Ghazali. Nahas Pashahad asked for our support, but as the issue had been one of domestic policy only we had declined to give it, although His Majesty&apos;minister (Mr. Shone) had given some purely personal advice in thehope of settling the dispute.to a depth of 60 miles. The underground army in Warsaw hadcapitulated on the 2nd October.The War Cabinet- -   -Took note of these statements.
Prisonersof War.(previous reference :W.M. (44) 122ndConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Secretary of State for War said that evidence wasaccumulating of the murder of prisoners, mostly close to the battle-field or on the way back from the battlefield, by the S.S. elements of the German Army. He enquired what was the position of theproposed general warning to the enemy on this subject.The War Cabinet was&apos; informed that it was now proposed thatthe draft declaration should be cleared with the United States and russian Governments as a matter of urgency, so that if events shouldlater necessitate its issue, this could be done at once.At the suggestion of the Deputy Prime Minister, theSecretary of State for War undertook to circulate to theWar Cabinet a note summarising the facts to which hehad drawn attention.Home Guard,andCftril Defence.Retention ofUniforms afterRelease from service.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (44) 129thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. At their meeting on the 29th September, 1944, the WarCabinet had invited the Minister of Production, the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security, the Secretary of State for War, theMinister of Supply and the President of the Board of Trade toconsider whether the available resources would allow the home guard and members of the Civil Defence Services to retain theirgreatcoats.The Minister of Production now reported that retention ofgreatcoats by the Home Guard and Civil Defence Services wouldnot affect the supply of.army greatcoats in 1945. He favouredretention and the Board of Trade agreed to this course.The Minister added that he thought that an appeal might bemade to those who did not require the greatcoats to hand them over for relief purposes.   This might save 200,000 greatcoats.It was pointed out that the retention of greatcoats by the home guard and Civil Defence Services might cost the Exchequer 2,000,000. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he wouldnot press the financial aspect if the Minister of Production was satisfied on the supply aspect, and had reached the conclusion thatthe balance of argument strongly favoured retention. He favoured the voluntary handing in of greatcoats for relief purposes, providedthat this was not done against a cash payment, and was left entirely to the individual.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that members of the Home Guard and Civil defence services should be allowed to retain their greatcoats.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for War and the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security to makeannouncements in this sense.(3) Agreed that in these announcements no reference shouldbe made to the appeal to those who did not need great-coats to hand them in for relief purposes.It was pointed out that Nahas Pasha had given full support to the Alliance and to our war effort, and that it was unfortunate that any impression should be given that we did not support our friends.On the other hand, while it was agreed that it would have been preferable had no change taken place, the circumstances wereoutside our control. The record of the new Prime Minister AhmedMaher-in recent years suggested that he might work well with us.The War Cabinet-Took note of the Minister of State&apos;s statement.
Palestine.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 104thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (44) 559) calling attentionto the deterioration of the situation in Palestine, and reporting thathe had authorised the Acting High Commissioner to arrange, inconsultation with the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, for the deportation of certain detainees to locations outside Palestine inview of the risk that a successful attack might be made on the campsin Acre and at Latroun in which they were at present detained.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the outragesin recent days were taking a dangerous turn. There was evidenceof increasing activity on the part of the Revisionists amountingto military operations. At the present time, the Revisionist bodyprobably represented about 10 per cent, of the population ofPalestine, and the balance of 90 per cent, would probably take their,lead from the Jewish Agency. The latter body, while prepared to denounce terrorist activities in public and to offer a measure ofco-operation in their suppression, was not prepared to risk an openconflict between two Jewish Organisations in Palestine on the.grounds that this would have a bad effect on Jewish claims for thefuture. &apos; He was considering steps to make it clear to the jewish agency that this was a mistaken view, and that failure to givewhole-hearted co-operation in suppressing these outrages would do them even greater harm.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that the Secretaryof State for the Colonies might consult the Service Departments asregards the finding of volunteers from the fighting forces for policeduties in Palestine. The Secretary of State for the Colonies under-,took to do so, adding that he would be grateful for any suggestions in the matter.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the action proposed by theSecretary of State for the Colonies as described in w.P. (44) 559.ExpeditionaryForceMessages.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 132ndConclusions, -Minute 7.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePostmaster-General (W.P. (44) 560) proposing that the E.F.M.service should be suspended for the period from 6th-25th December..It was explained that the considerations which had made itnecessary to suspend the E.F.M. service during the 1943 Christmasseason were present again this year with even greater force, andthat alternative facilities would be available to compensate for the suspension.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that it wouldbe necessary to inform the Dominion Governments of what was proposed.The War Cabinet-Approved the suspension of the E.F.M. service for theperiod 6th-25th December.International 9.   The Minister of State informed the War Cabinet that the-Trade Union      Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had been asked by Sir WalterConference.       Citrine whether the Government would see any objection to anInternational Trade Union Conference being held in London inJanuary 1945.   The Soviet Trade Union Delegation now in this^        country desired that the conference should be held in January.The Minister of - Labour and National Service said that therewas a risk that any advice given on behalf of the Government might,be misinterpreted, and that it was important not to give any grounds for suggesting that the conference had been postponed at the request.
Mutual aid agreement.The King&apos;sSpeecheson theProrogationand Openingof Parliament.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 135th&quot;Conclusions, .-minute 2.)10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the WarCabinet that he had consulted the Prime Minister about thefollowing Parliamentary question addressed to the Prime minister by Mr. Boothby, M.P. :-&quot; To ask the Prime Minister, whether the Chancellor of the exchequers recent statement at the Mansion House, that we are opposed, in principle, to all discriminatory commercial and currencyagreements of a permanent character, and intend to work for theirelimination, represents the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;The Prime Minister had suggested that the reply should makeit clear that the structure of Imperial Preference was safeguardedand had asked him to bring the terms of the reply before the WarCabinet.He proposed that the reply should be as follows : &quot; My Right Honourable Friend informs me that the purposeof the part of his speech referred to was to call attention to theeffect of the Mutual Aid Agreement which His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment entered into with the United States Government in February1942. In it we agreed to work for the elimination of all formsof discriminatory treatment in international commerce, subject tothe qualification that it is understood that we are not committed to the abolition of Imperial preferences. The policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government is to carry out in letter and in spirit theprovisions of the Agreement, to the terms of which I invite theattention of my Honourable Friend.&quot;The War Cabinet :Approved the draft reply subject to an amendment to bring out that the reservation in respect of Imperial preferencedid not form part of the Mutual Aid Agreement itself.This could best be done by a reference to the statement made by the Prime Minister in the debate in the House ofCommons on Empire, and Commonwealth Unity on the21st April, 1944 (Hansard, Vol. 399, No. 64, Col. 579).(Note.-The answer as given will be found in the Appendix tothese Minutes.)11. The Deputy Prime Minister informed the War Cabinetthat the Prime Minister proposed that the following Committeeshould be appointed to prepare and submit drafts of The King&apos;speeches on the prorogation and opening of Parliament: Deputy Prime Minister (in the Chair),Minister of Labour and National Service,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,Secretary of State for Air,Minister of Education,Minister of Information.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed.of the Government. The presence of some two hundred delegateswould not add appreciably to the accommodation difficulties inLondon.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatit would be necessary for the security authorities to examine the credentials of the delegates who would be attending the conference.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to inform Sir Walter Citrinethat the Government had no comments to make on theproposal that an International Trade Union conference should be held in London in January 1945.
Town and country planning Bill.(previous reference:W.M.(44) 133rdConclusions,Minute 1.)12. The Deputy Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinetthat in Committee on the Town and Country Planning Bill on the6th October the Prime Minister had expressed the hope that,before the Bill left the House of Commons, some agreement mightbe reached which would enable Clauses 45 and 46 to be reinstated inthe Bill. For this purpose it had been arranged that the Ministerof Town and Country Planning should have discussions with members in the present week. He thought it would be convenient if a War Cabinet Committee were set up, which could consider thematter further before the Minister had his discussions with members and could formulate proposals for the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet agreed to this course, and decided that theCommittee should be constituted as follows : * . *Deputy Prime Minister (in the Chair),Chancellor of the Exchequer,Minister of Labour and National Service,Minister of Reconstruction,Lord Chancellor,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,Minister of Aircraft Production,Minister of Health,Minister of Town and Country Planning,Attorney-General.It was arranged that the Committee should meet at 12 noon onthe following day.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,9th October, 1944.APPENDIX.My right hon. Friend informs me that the purpose of the part of his speechreferred to was to call attention to the effect of the Mutual Aid Agreement whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government entered into with the United States Government inFebruary 1942. In it we agreed to work for the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce. As stated by the PrimeMinister on the 21st April last, in the Debate on Empire and CommonwealthUnity, this is qualified by an understanding that we are not committed to theabolition of Imperial Preference. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government isto carry out in letter and in spirit the provisions of the Agreement, to the terms,of which I invite the attention of my hon. Friend.(0&apos;fficial Report, the 10th October, 1944 Column 1563.)
