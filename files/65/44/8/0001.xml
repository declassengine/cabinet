The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command had flown 4,824 sorties and dropped16,800 tons of bombs, of which 14,800 had been on Germany.Forty-six bombers had been lost. The targets included Duisburg(twice), Wilhelmshaven and Brunswick. A direct hit had beenmade on the Sorpe Dam, but it was not yet known what damagehad been caused. The sea wall on the Island of Walcheren had beenbreached in many places. Mosquitoes had dropped 520 tons on targets in Germany.United States heavy bombers had llown 4,270 sorties, dropping9,240 tons of bombs, for the loss of 46 aircraft. Their targetsincluded railway centres, railheads and oil refineries.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to inform the WarCabinet on the following Monday of the effectiveness of blindbombing by United States aircraft.The Air Sea Rescue Service had, during the previous week,rescued its 10,000th airman.The War Cabinet invited the Chief of the Air Staff to convey their congratulations to this Service on this achievement.The Allied Expeditionary Force had flown 16,400 sorties at thecost of 5 bombers and 90 fighters and fighter-bombers.109 enemy aircraft bad been destroyed.9,400 sorties had been flown and 7,400 tons of bombs dropped.118 enemy aircraft had been destroyed as against 116 Allied.There had been no shipping losses from enemy action so farduring the month of October.On the 8th and 10th October M.T.Bs. had sunk 2 trawlers and1 minesweeper off the Dutch coast.The Kiel Canal had been reported blocked since the 8th Octoberby: a ship which had been mined and sunk near the Westernentrance.Naval aircraft had inflicted widespread damage on enemy communications in the iEgean.Between the 11th and 13th October United States naval aircraft had bombed targets in Formosa, claiming 485 Japanese aircraft destroyed and a number of naval and other vessels sunk.The previous week had been uneventful. North of Belfort andin the Nancy area some progress had been made. The mainAmerican attack had been in the Aachen- area, and they nowoccupied the southern outskirts of the town. This had relievedenemy pressure on the Nijmegen salient. British troops were endeavouring to clear the country west of the Meuse betweenGennep and Roesmond. The Canadians carried out a successfullanding on the mainland South of the Scheldt opposite WalcherenIsland.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that,as requested by the War Cabinet the previous week, he hadtaken steps to ensure that in future full publicity would begiven to any operations carried out by United Kingdom troopsforming part of the Canadian Army.Fair progress had been made along the whole front. The8th Army was now within 3 miles of Cesena, but the enemy was still resisting strongly and showed no. signs of voluntary with-drawal.Athens had been occupied on the 14th October, and it was expected that further reinforcements would be landed there shortly.In the extreme North the Russians had captured Petsamo bya combined land and sea attack. Further South the Finns hadcleared the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Riga had been captured,Memel encircled, and the whole of the Island of Oesel was now mRussian hands. North of Warsaw the Germans reported heavyRussian attacks. In the Balkans the Russians had taken Cluj andDej and were within 55 miles of Budapest. Further South theyhad crossed the River Tisa, and fighting had been reported in belgrade.-1] b2
The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 134thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that during the previousweek about 30 Long-Range Rockets had been launched at thiscountry, of which 22 had crossed the coast. Norwich, Harwich and london seemed to have been among the targets aimed at.During the week 99 Flying Bombs had been launched, of which42 had crossed the coast and 9 had reached the London area.Thirty-five had been destroyed, 9 by fighters and 26 by A.A. guns.The total casualties for the week had been 21 killed (none by Long-Range Rockets).67 seriously injured.118 slightly injured.The Chief of the Air Staff said that, as requested by the WarCabinet the previous week, he had made enquiries into the possi-bility of our air forces on the Continent attacking the airfields used by the Heinkel aircraft which launched the Flying Bombs. Hehad ascertained that the air forces in question had not sufficientaircraft to meet all the calls made upon them. He had, however,asked them to clo what they could when the opportunity arose, butfelt that the scale of attack against this country was not so great -asto justify him pressing for air forces to be diverted to this purposefrom support of the land battle.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Attacks by flying Bombs.Question of publicity. .(previous reference:W.M..(44) 134thConclusions,Minute 3.)Attack by rockets.Question of publicity.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 134th&apos; Conclusions,Minute 2.)3. At their meeting on the 9th October the War Cabinet had invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider whether publication in thePress of further maps of sections of London Region showing thefall of flying bombs should be permitted.The War Cabinet now had before them a report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (44) 567) stating that they were of opinion that anyfurther publication of accurate information as to the fall of flyin bombs during the attacks on London should be prohibited.Over 40 flying-bomb sites were being constructed in the Ruhr,and so long as these sites remained in the hands of the enemy theywould be able to launch attacks against Antwerp, which we shouldwant to use as a port and as a depot. - There was good reason to suppose that the publication of maps showing the fall of flyin bombs in London Region would enable the enemy to draw deductionswhich would help him in any future attacks that he might launch.It would also be desirable to avoid publication of any informationshowing in which boroughs of London Region most war damagehad occurred.The War Cabinet-Agreed that any further publication of accurate informa-tion as to the fall of flying bombs in the London Regionshould be prohibited.4. The Minister of Information asked whether it would not now be possible to release the ban on the mention of rocket attacks against this country. Since the fact that such attacks had beenmade had been published in the American Press, it was difficult tofind any security grounds for continuing the ban, and it was wrong-in principle for the Government to use its poAvers of censorshipunless security was involved. The fact that rocket attacks had beenmade could be published while maintaining the ban on the publica-tion of information, which might be of value to the enemy, aboutthe fall of the rockets and the casualties and damage caused by them.
The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe publication of information about the rocket attacks in theAmerican Press had placed the Government in a difficult situation.While he had had at first no strong views against publication, he felt that now that publication had been delayed so long, and in theabsence of any evidence of a strong public demand for the releaseof information, the balance of advantage lay in continuing the ban.It was pointed out that, if the fact that rocket attacks had beenmade on this country were published in the Press, the government might have considerable difficulty in refusing to divulge additional information regarding the fall of the rockets and the casualties and damage caused by them.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the ban on publicity about rocket attacksshould be maintained, but that the matter should be reviewed in a week&apos;s time.Foreign Affairs.Poland.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 130thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Minister of State informed the War Cabinet of thelatest developments in the conversations taking place in Moscow onthe Russo-Polish issue.The War Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of State.S.H.A.E.F. 6.   The Minister  of- Information  drew  attention  to  the publicity announcement made by S.H.A.E.F. about artificial harbours.   Heabout Artificial thought that this announcement gave this country insufficient creditHarbours. for lts share in this very remarkable achievement. The War cabinet were informed that the arrangements for the public announcement about artificial harbours had been the subject of consideration bythe Combined Chiefs of Staff.On the suggestion of the Deputy Prime Minister, the WarCabinet Asked the Chiefs of Staff to report on the previous historyof this matter, and to make recommendations.travel facilities.Visits byNon-OfficialCivilians toFrance.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 126thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. In connection with the previous item, the Minister ofInformation drew attention to the difficulties experienced in securing from S.H.A.E.F. passages for France for responsibleBritish press correspondents. It was also stated that importantcivilians who had good reasons for visiting France had been unableto obtain passages, but that the Americans apparently found&quot; nodifficulty in arranging journeys for American nationals.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, if we hadground for complaint in this matter, the issue should be taken up with General Eisenhower. As a first step, however, a detailed statement should be prepared, giving particulars of the cases inwhich passages had been refused to our nationals and evidence toshow that American citizens had obtained passages with lessdifficulty.The War Cabinet Agreed that this information should be collected by theChiefs of&apos; Staff Secretariat, in consultation with theDepartments concerned, and a report rendered.
Channel Islands.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 128thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Securityrecalled that at their meeting on the 27th September the WarCabinet had agreed that a communication should be sent throughthe Swiss Government calling on the German garrison of theChannel Islands to surrender if they were unable to fulfil the dutyof feeding the civilian population. Over a fortnight had elapsed since the communication had been sent, but no reply had beenreceived. The question therefore arose whether we should nowinform the Swiss Government that we were willing to agree thatfood supplies should be sent to the Islands, provided that agents ofthe Red Cross accompanied the supplies and remained in the Islandsiff order to ensure that they were used only to feed the civil popula-tion. There was considerable pressure, both in the Press and inParliament, in favour of sending supplies, and it would be difficultto resist this if we agreed to send relief to Greece, Poland and other foreign countries, as proposed in the memorandum by the Ministerof State (W.P. (44) 568).The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Economic Warfare,jjointed out that on previous occasions when supplies had been sentto occupied territory the German Government had not objected totheir distribution being supervised by agents of the Red Cross.The Minister of War Transport said that, if it were decidedto send supplies, they would probably have to be conveyed in anEire ship.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff hopedshortly to obtain certain additional evidence as to the situation inthe Channel Islands, which might help the War Cabinet in reaching a decision.The War Cabinet Invited the Chiefs of Staff to furnish a report on thesituation in the Channel Islands as soon as further evidence became available; and agreed to defer a decision until this report was- available.Relief forOccupiedEurope.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 109thConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of State (W.P. (44) 568), to which was annexed therecommendations of^ the joint Anglo-American Committee, the.establishment of which had been agreed by the War Cabinet onthe 21st August, 1944, to draw up a scheme of relief for submission to His Majesty&apos;s Government and. the United States Government.The Minister of State said that the scheme of the Committeeonly contemplated making good a modest increase in the amount of relief foodstuffs sent by Sweden to Norway, and possibly thedespatch of small consignments from Switzerland to Polish cities,ghettoes and concentration camps. The economic benefit to theenemy could only be slight, and, in view of the political importance attached to the matter by the United States Government, hesuggested that the Committee&apos;s recommendations should be approved. In that event, he suggested that it would, on the whole,be better not to ask the Russians for concurrence so far as thedespatch of relief to Poland was concerned, but merely to tell them what we were doing. The arrangements would be made by theInternational Red Cross and not by a British body.The following points were raised in discussion :  (a) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of economic warfare,&apos; raised two points. The first was that the Americansreserved their position as regards monetary relief. (Paragraph 14of the Annex to W.P. (44) 568.) We should try to get a favourablereply on this point from the United States before agreeing finally togo forward.(b) The second point was that the United States Government,in view of the political importance of this matter, would want to
Parliament.Town and country planning Bill.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 136thConclusions,Minute 2.)make a public statement. We should try to agree its terms inadvance with the United States and a draft might be prepared bythe Foreign Office and the Ministry of Economic Warfare whichwould set out the history of this matter in fairly full detail. Inreply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he agreed that theTreasury should be associated with the preparation of any suchdraft.(c) Discussion then turned on whether the Russians should be consulted or informed about the relief proposed for Poland. Itwas pointed out on the one hand that the organisation concernedwas an international and not a British body. There was the risk,too, that the Russians, if consulted, might raise difficulties and delaya decision. It was felt, on the other hand, that no action shouldbe contemplated which might react unfavourably on the PrimeMinister&apos;s endeavours to bring about a friendly solution of the russo--Polish problem, and it was suggested that the position shouldbe put to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who should beasked for his opinion and be invited, if he thought that desirable,to consult the Russians.(d) The First Lord of the Admiralty enquired whether any interference with prisoner of war traffic would be involved. TheSecretary of State for War did not consider that any interferenceof importance need be anticipated.(e) The Minister of Food asked that if any substantial amountof food fell to be made available by way of replacement of the food-stuffs sent by Sweden to Norway, &amp;c, the Ministry of Food shouldbe consulted.(/) The Minister of Food suggested that recommendations (b) and 8 (b) of the Annex to W.P. (44) 568 should be amended to read : &quot; assurances that the present scale of rations.....&quot;(g) The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out with regardto Recommendation 6 that it would be necessary for the PolishGovernment to agree the financial arrangements with the Treasury.(h) The First Lord of the Admiralty raised the -questionwhether acceptance of the scheme would involve the use of theNorwegian coast route by ships carrying, relief supplies.It was agreed- That this and cognate aspects of the&apos; scheme should be examined by the Chiefs of Staff.After further discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to ask the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs for his opinion as regards consulta-tion with the Russians about relief to Poland, and to invite him, if he thought this desirable, to consult theRussians on the matter.(2) Accepted the suggestions of the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Economic Warfare, at (a) and (b) above,subject to the reservation that the scheme should not be .allowed to break down merely because we were unable tosecure a favourable reply from the United States asregards monetary relief.(3) Subject to the reply by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs under (1), and to the points raised in discussion at (e) to (h), gave general approval to the scheme.10. The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for theremaining stages of the Town and Country Planning Bill and fordebating the White Paper on Social Insurance and Workmen&apos;compensation.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : -(1) Subject to the outcome of a meeting to be held on thefollowing day of the Committee of Ministers appointedby the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 9th October(W.M. (44) 134th Conclusions, Minute 12), the Deputy
Social insurance and Workmen&apos;compensation.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 124thConclusions,Minute 1.)Prime Minister would announce on the afternoon ofTuesday, the 17th October, that the new compensationclauses would appear on the Order Paper on Wednesday,the 18th October.(2) In this event, it should be possible to complete the remain-ing stages of the Town and Country Planning Bill bythe end of the week.(3) It would be preferable to have separate debates on Part Iand Part II of the White Paper respectively, and two days should be allowed for each part.(4) The terms of the motions which would be put down shouldbe-(a) Part I Social Insurance.&quot; That this House welcomes the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, declared in the white paper presented to Parliament, to establish an enlarged and unified scheme of social insurance and a system of family allowances.&quot;(b) Part II- Workmen&apos;s Compensation.&quot; That this House welcomes the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government declared in the white paper presented to Parliament, to replace theexisting system of workmen&apos;s compensation by anew scheme&apos;of Industrial Injury Insurance.&quot;(5) On the assumption that the remaining stages of the Townand Country Planning Bill were completed by theend of the current week, the debate on Part I of theWhite Paper could conveniently take place on Tuesdayand Wednesday in the week beginning the 22nd October.The debate on Part II might then take place in the week beginning the 29th October.(6) The Minister of Social Insurance Designate should open the debate on Part I and the other Government speakersshould be the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Education.. In the debate on Part II, the Government speakersshould be the Home Secretary and Minister of home security, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor the Home Department and the Solicitor-General.InternationalCivil air transport.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 136thConclusions,Minute 4.)11. The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the representation of His Majesty&apos;s Government at the Empire talks on civil Air Transport which Avere due to begin in Montreal on the23rd October.It was urged that the importance of the issues which would arise and the strength of the delegations which were being sent bythe Dominions made it most desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should be strongly represented; and it was suggested&apos; that theBritish delegation should be led by Sir Arthur Street and that lord Knollys should accompany the delegation.The Secretary of State for Air said that it was important that sir Arthur Street should be available for consultations with lord Swinton as soon as he arrived in this country, but undertook to arrange that Sir Arthur Street should lead the delegation. Hehad understood that Lord Knollys would accompany the british delegation.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,16th October, 1944.
