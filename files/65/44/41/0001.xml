The War Cabinet had a brief discussion about theB.B.C.

The  War  Cabinet were  informed that  the Minister ofInformation (who was unable to be present) had expressed the viewthat so long as the Governors of the B.B.C. retained the degree of independence which the War Cabinet had agreed to grant to themin 1941, it was difficult to see what more could be done in the way of controlling the presentation of news by the B.B.C.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Information to obtain from theB.B.C. and circulate to the War Cabinet,*the script of the news item about the Trafalgar Square demonstration given. at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the 17th December.Minute 9.)Belgium. 3.   The Minister of Labour and National/SerwW drew attentionSupply to the great importance of bringing supplies of material and food position. to Belgium at the earliest possible date. Unless this was done the(Previous constitutional forces in that kingdom might find it hard to holdReference: the situation. Even one ship would be of great value. The civilWM*(44yi40th population were now at a 1,500 calorie level, i.e., 500 below theConclusions minimum level that had been approved in the case of occupied territories.The.Prime Minister suggested that a committee should be set upconsisting of the Minister of Labour and National Service (in the chair), the Minister of War Transport, the Minister of Productionand;a representative of the Foreign Office, with the assistance ofrepresentatives of other Departments as necessary, with the task of framing a recommendation for urgent consideration by the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet- -S -Approved the Prime Ministers proposal.Spain. 4.   At their meeting on the 27th November the War Cabinet(Previous&quot; had agreed that a reply to General Franco should be prepared on reference: the lines proposed by the Prime Minister, and that the draft replyWM.(44) 157th should be considered by the War Cabinet.Conclusions.) The War Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 735), to which was[28910-3] b 2
Travel 5.   The War Cabinet had before them the following twoFacilities. memoranda relating to an application made by Dr. Negrin forExit Permit    facilities for a visit to Paris : Application by q\ a memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of dr. Negrin. Home Security (W.P. (44) 725); and ,(ii) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (44) 744).It was explained that, with the concurrence of the ForeignOffice, the Home Office had given Dr. Negrin, a former RepublicanPremier of Spain, an exit permit to enable him to visit Spanishpolitical leaders in Mexico and his family in the United States.Dr. Negrin had now asked for facilities to go to Paris for a few days to get personally in touch with his compatriots in France, and had obtained the promise of a visa from the French Ambassador for thispurpose. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security was,on the whole, disposed to approve Dr. Negrin&apos;s application, whilethe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was against granting it;.In favour of the view that no facilities should be given to dr. Negrin, it was urged that Dr. Negrin&apos;s visit could not beregarded as being on urgent business of national importance andthat it was therefore difficult to grant him facilities which werebeing refused to Members of Parliament^ Moreover, the grant of facilities to an opponent of the Franco regime at the present timemight well be misunderstood.On the other hand, it was urged that the claims of a formerPremier of a foreign country could be distinguished from those ofMembers of Parliament. Dr. Negrin was a responsible and moderatepolitician and if facilities were refused at the present time, whenthe Government were being accused of undue partiality to the forcesof the right on the Continent, there might be,trouble in Parliament.In further discussion it was suggested that there would be less objection to the grant of an exit permit to Dr. Negrin if he were tobe provided with transport by the French authorities, who had^ ,, already given him the promise of a visa, or if he were to make useof the facilities for cross-Channel travel by boat which it was hoped to bring into operation in the early part of 1945, and which wouldnot be confined to persons travelling on urgent business of national importance.,* See W.M. (44) 161st Conclusions, Minute 6.annexed a draft reply which had been prepared in consultation withthe Prime Minister and in the light of the War Cabinefs discussion on the 27th November.It was suggested in discussion that in the first paragraph ofthe draft reply the words &quot;relations between the British and spanish peoples&quot; should be substituted for the words &quot; Anglo-Spanish relations&quot;; and that in the last paragraph the words&quot; relations of friendship and co-operation between our two countries are desirable&apos;&apos; should be substituted for the words &apos;&apos; relations of close friendship and co-operation between our two countries are essential.&quot;The War Cabinet (1) Approved the draft letter from the Prime Minister toGeneral Franco in Annex I to W.P. (44) 735, subject tothe amendments proposed in discussion.(2) Agreed that the Prime Minister should send a copy of theletter to Premier Stalin with a covering letter indicating that the letter to General Franco had been consideredby the War Cabinet and had their full approval.(3) Took note that copies of General Franco&apos;s letter and of the reply would be sent to the United States Secretary ofState.
329W.M. 171 (44).The War Cabinet Agreed that an exit permit should be granted to Dr. Negrinto enable him to visit Paris, but that he should not beprovided with any special travel facilities, the question ofhis transport to France being dealt with as at &quot;X.&quot;India. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a report by the india the Committee (W.P. (44) 720.) oh the Viceroy&apos;s proposals for a constitutional  constitutional move set out in the enclosures to W.P. (44) 684.Position. The  Committee  pointed  out  that  these   proposals  were(Previous substantially identical to those put forward by the Viceroy beforeReference- ne assumed office in September 1943. They knew of no change in theWM (44)l52nd Indian situation; since then which would render them acceptable at conclusions *he present time. The matter was now less urgent, since Sir TejMinute 8 and Sapru had convoked a meeting of prominent political personagesWM (44U02nd^n India and action must await the outcome of the deliberations of conclusions,     that body. ,    ^Minute 1) - these circumstances the Committee suggested that all that could be said to the Viceroy at this stage was that while HisMajesty&apos;s Government noted the consensus of opinion to which be referred, they were of opinion that before any proposals on the lines which he had put forward gained currency, it was desirable thatthere should be a discussion with him here, and that the best timefor. such discussion would be when the outcome of Sir Tej Sapru&apos;discussions was known.In the meantime there would be advantage in a stocktaking by ministers in London of the Indian position designed to set out (i) The precise commitments which we had entered into toIndia;(ii) The practicability of a different approach to the solution, of the Indian problem.The Lord President of the Council explained the considerations which had led the India Committee to their conclusions and recom-mended their report for acceptance by the War Cabinet.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The Lord Chancellor said that he could find no justification for the suggestions (which the Committee had repudiated) in theViceroy&apos;s proposals, that there were pledges which we had failedto honour or contemplated dishonouring. The suggestion was made that it would be well to ask the Viceroy to explain what he had hadin mind in making the references in question.(b) The Secretary of State for India explained the background of the recent resignation of the office holders and Committee of theChamber of Prinees.* Pressure to improve the level of administra-tion in backward States, and apprehension of the effect on their independence of the application of the Indian economic plan, werecontributing factors.After further discussion the War Cabinet-(1)&apos; Approved the proposals in the report of the  india committee and invited the Deputy Prime Minister to&apos;   .       circulate to the Committee a draft of the reply to be sentto the Viceroy;(2) Agreed that, at the same time as the reply to the Viceroy&apos; - in (1) was despatched, the Secretary of State for india should ask the Viceroy what he had had in mind incertain passages in his telegrams which seemed to suggestthat there were pledges which we had failed to honouror did not intend to honour;(3) Invited the India Committee to proceed with examination- of a possible solution to the Indian problem on the lines proposed^in their report.* See W.P. (44) 708.
India.Indian FoodGrainRequirements.(previous reference:W.M.(44)59th- Conclusions,Minute 1.)7. The War Cabinet had before them the report of theCommittee on Indian Food Grain Requirements (W.P. (44) 736).The Committee had accepted the recommendations made for thesupply of food grains to India by Sir Henry French^ and were satisfied that the necessary supplies would be forthcoming. their conclusions were in accord with those of the Chiefs of Staff that the availability of food grains in India in 1945 should be regarded asa military necessity. Their recommendation was, however, subjectto a reservation by the Minister of War Transport that largeadditionaroperational military relief and subsequent essential reliefrequirements for shipping were under consideration, the fullsatisfaction of which might not prove easy to reconcile with theproposed undertaking to India.The Secretary of State for India hoped that the War cabinet would authorise him, if possible before Christmas, or, if that was impracticable, when the House reassembled, to reply to an arrangedquestion in Parliament as in the text appended to W.P. (44) 736.In order to maintain confidence, an announcement should be made without delay as regards the opening months of next year. while he accepted the Minister of War Transport^ difficulties, any lossof confidence in India might increase demands for food grains andso involve larger demands on shipping.The Minister of War Transport said that while he was most anxious to give all possible assistance to the Secretary of State forIndia, the shipping position had now further deteriorated owingto the demands of the liberated areas, military requirements andthe difficulty of working ships into position. The first four monthsof next year would be very difficult, and he had no option but toask that any statement as regards food grain for India should be deferred, pending the result of a combined examination of theposition which was now being carried out in Washington&quot;.After further discussion the War cabinet-^-Invited theTndian Food Grain Requirements Committee /to give further consideration to the question whether theSecretary of State for India should make a statement onthe lines proposed, as soon as the further investigationsreferred to by the Minister of War Transport had reached a point at which the shipping situation over the ensuingmonths, could be envisaged as a whole; and, if possible,within three weeks.Housing. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theProposed Minister of Reconstruction (W.P. (44) 733) proposing that authorityImport of should be given for the purchase from Sweden of ipre-fabricatedPre-fabricated timber houses of a type suitable for permanent dwellings, especiallypermanent in rural districts. 30,000 houses could be procured in a year, and timber houses the Minister proposed that we should take two years&quot;&apos; output. the from Sweden, amount to be paid to the Swedes for 30,000 houses would be about 7 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we were faced witha very difficult exchange position. Until normal conditions and exchange equilibrium has been established, we should have to reservesuch relatively small sums as we should be able to spend in hardcurrencies for the purchase of imports which we must have, andwhich we could not obtain in any other way.Furthermore, at the moment we were negotiating an exchangeagreement with Sweden. The Swedes were willing to make anagreement and were prepared to accept an undertaking to holdsterling without any specified limit; but only on the basis of an assurance that our transactions with them would, so far as couldbe foreseen, be near the point&quot; of&quot;balance.* W.P. (44) 562,
. 331 W.M. 171 (44).There was also the consideration that to undertake at this moment to make this large purchase in Sweden, would hardly seem.; consistent with all that we had said to the representatives of theUnited States and Canada in recent weeks about the acutedifficulties of our exchange position.Moreover, we were at the moment negotiating with Canada inregard to Mutual Aid, and he was most anxious to avoid the criticism that we could afford to pay cash to Sweden but not to canada. He hoped that the negotiations with Canada might-be concluded successfully in the course of a few weeks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the negotiationswith the United States for the supply to us of timber nouses onlease-lend terms. He hoped that we should secure a very large* - supply of houses from the United States on lease-lend terms.In the light of all these considerations, the Chancellor of theExchequer asked that there should be a delay of, say, two or threeweeks until the negotiations to which he had&apos; referred had been concluded.The following further points were made in discussion : (a) It was explained that the pre-fabricated houses which we might obtain from the United States were quite different from theSwedish houses. The United States authorities had made it clearthat they could not let us have any houses on lease-lend terms unless they were of a temporary nature appropriate to war conditions, andwould assist us in our contribution to the Japanese war.(b) It was pointed out that good timber houses for erection in rural areas in the period immediately following the end of theGerman war would be of assistance in getting the right type of ex-Service man to settle down in rural areas, and would thus helpour agricultural policy which, in turn, was important from thepoint of view of the exchange position.(c) Several Ministers said they would be glad if particulars ofthe type of timber houses which could be imported from Swedencould be circulated to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle to the desirability of obtaining pre-fabricated timber houses from Sweden.  ...(2) Agreed that in view of the circumstances to which theChancellor of the Exchequer had drawn attention,consideration of this matter should be deferred for, say,three weeks.A.T.S.CompulsoryPostingOverseas.9. At their meeting on the 13th November the War cabinet had considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (44) 609) about the compulsory posting of A.T.S. overseas,and had postponed a decision pending further, consideration.(Previous The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he hadEef erence:      discussed the matter with the Secretary of State, for War and had.M.(44) 149th reached agreement with him as to the basis on which A.T.S. should conclusions,    be sent overseas to certain theatres.  It was agreed that they should minute 6.)      not be sent to Burma or West Africa, either compulsorily or asvolunteers. For the rest, the position would be that, while volunteerswould continue to be welcomed and encouraged, A.T.S. would infuture be liable to be posted overseas only if they were 21 years- of age or over, unmarried and. medically fit.   Agreement had beenreached on the text of an announcement which it was proposed thatthe Secretary of-State for War should make in Parliament.   Thescheme would enable a number of men who could not otherwise bemade available, to be released for operational duties.It was contemplated that most of the A.T.S. posted, overseaswould be employed at the larger headquarters and installations inthe rearward areas.    &quot;
The Prime Minister said that while he agreed that women. should not be posted compulsorily to the forward areas, he thoughtit important that the statement should not be so drafted as to imply that A.T.S. volunteers Would not be employed on duties whichexposed them to any of the risks of active service.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle to the scheme for posting of A.TS.overseas outlined by the Minister of Labour and NationalService and to an announcement being made by theSecretary of State for War.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to submit a draftof the announcement to the Prime Minister&apos; for . hisconcurrence.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,18th December,!^.
