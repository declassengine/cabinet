1. The Deputy Prime Minister, on behalf of the War Cabinet,extended the warmest congratulations to the Prime Minister on theoccasion of his 70th birthday.The Prime Minister thanked his colleagues for their good wishes.2. At their meeting on the 8th November the War cabinet had agreed that the legislation for the resumption of local electionsshould provide for retirement by annual thirds in local councilswhere this had hitherto been the practice, on the understandingW.M. (44) 148th that in any ward where there was a co-opted member he should conclusions,    retire first.Minute 4.) The War Cabinet now had before them a joint Memorandum.by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and theSecretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (44) 672) asking the WarCabinet to reconsider this decision, and to agree that at the firstlocal elections all the existing councillors should retire.The Rome Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe War Cabinet&apos;s decision would involve complicated and lengthystatutory provisions to settle the rotation for retirement, and wouldoften give rise to the anomaly of an elected councillors having to retire while a co-opted councillor remained. Public opinion, asshown by the newspaper extract annexed to W.P. (44) 672, was strongly against: the continuance Of councillors longer than wasnecessary, and he was afraid that the Government would be attackedfrom all sides of the House on this matter. It should be borne inmind that the principle of the clean sweep applied both toParliament and to county councils and local authorities in London.The Secretary of. State for Scotland said, that 80 per cent, ofthe Convention of Royal Burghs, which represented all towncouncils   in   Scotland,   were  in   favour   of  the   clean   sweep.Unfortunately, co-option had sometimes been worked unfairly.  For, example, where a vacancy had occurred in the place of an indepen-dent member, the majority in the council had too often filled theplace by the appointment of a member of their own party. Theresult was that a good deal of bitterness had been created and therewas a strong feeling in favour of getting rid of co-opted member as soon as possible.The Lord Privy Seal urged that, if the decision previouslyreached gave rise to anomalies, it would be better simply to providefor the retirement of a third of the members of each council at thefirst election, without seeking to secure that co-opted members should retire first. This course was favoured by the Associationof Municipal Corporations. The assimilation of the local govern-ment and Parliamentary franchises and the alteration with regardto the business premises vote meant a considerable change, and in-these circumstances it was desirable to do everything possible to preserve continuity. &apos;      v    .The Secretary of State for Air stressed the strength of the- feeling in Scotland in favour of the proposals put forward by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security and the Secretaryof State for Scotland.In further discussion, the Prime Minister suggested that theprinciple of continuity would be adequately preserved if at the firstelection all the co-opted members were to retire, together with those members who had been elected in 1936 (or the Spring of 1937 incertain cases) and had been due to retire under the ordinary rotationin the Autumn of 1939 (or the Spring of 1940).The PrimeMinister.local elections.(previous reference:
The War Cabinet- &apos;Agreed that in the case of those local authorities whereretirement by annual thirds had hitherto been the practice. it should be provided (i) that at the first election allco-opted members should retire, together with all elected members who would have retired under the normalrotation in the Autumn of 1939 or the Spring of 1940; and(ii) that.at subsequent elections retirement should be byannual thirds.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 689)about applications by Members of Parliament to visit France.&apos;   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security recalled that at their meeting on the 2nd July, 1943 (W.M. (43) 92nd Con-clusions, Minute 1) the War Cabinet had decided that the rule thatpermission should be granted for applications to visit neutral countries only where the visit would be of definite public advantageW.M. (44) 149th or the applicant- had urgent and important business to transactConclusions,     should apply to Members of Parliament in the same way as to otherMinute 7.)      persons; and that on the 29th August, 1944 (WM. (44) 112th Con-clusions, Minute 5), it had been agreed that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should state that in present circumstances itwas not possible to arrange for private visits to France by Membersof Parliament.The only method of reaching France at present was by military aircraft, and there was no authority to charge a fare. There was likely to be a greatly increased demand from business men very soon, and there were large numbers of people who had a claim to beallowed to travel to France on compassionate grounds, as well asnumbers of refugees who were anxious to return to their country.In the circumstances he saw great difficulty in agreeing to visits by Members of Parliament merely for the purpose of renewingpersonal and political contacts, though he would, of course, agreeto a Member&apos;s going if a case was made good on business grounds.He had felt obliged to refuse permission to Mr. Ronald Tree,M.P., and Mr. Hamilton Kerr, M.P., who had been invited by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris to visit him, and these members had given notice of intention to raise the matter in the House.Subject to the views of the War Cabinet, he felt that no special facilities should be granted to Members of Parliament to visitFrance until the transport situation was such that the presentrestriction on civilian travel should be relaxed and until they could go by public transport at their own expense. Alternatively,arrangements might be made for an all-party delegation to visitFrance.He also hoped that, when a member of the public applied to a department other than the Home Office to support his applicationfor permission to visit France, care would be taken not to give tohim any indication of the Department&apos;s view on the application.The Minister of State said, that the view of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs was that Members of Parliament who could arrange for accommodation in France should be permitted to go; and the Lord Privy Seal supported the view that permissionshould be granted to Mr. Ronald Tree, M.P., and Mr. HamiltonKerr, M.P., to visit the Ambassador.In further discussion, it was pointed out that it would be extremely difficult to justify allowing Members of Parliament to visit France merely for personaFor political reasons at a time whentravel to France by business men was severely rationed. Moreover,in present conditions visits by Members of Parliament on any large scale were unlikely to be welcome. It would be invidious to base thedecision whether to grant a permit or not on whether the Memberhad been able to arrange for accommodation.[28832-1; ^ B 2TravelFacilities.Visits byMembers ofParliamentto France.(previous reference :*

(44) 152nd anti-Asiatic legislation in Natal.Conclusions, The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum fromthe Secretary of State for India (W.P. (44) 694) reporting that theViceroy had asked that the telegram addressed to him should berecast so as to convey His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s decision&apos;regarding the proposed trade embargo with a more sympatheticintroduction. This would ease his difficulties with his Council. he asked that the first three paragraphs as originally approved shouldbe addressed to him in a private telegram, and gave an assurance that he would do his best to convey their substance to his Council.A small amendment was also proposed in the text of para-graph 4 of the original telegram to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might feel obliged to intervene to prevent prohibitionof exports from India to South Africa as well as ah embargo ofSouth African imports into India.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet &apos;Agreed to the despatch to the Viceroy of the revisedtelegram annexed as Appendix A to W.P. (44) 694, on theunderstanding that the first three paragraphs of theoriginal draft would be sent to the Viceroy simultaneouslyas a private telegram.Newfoundland. 5 The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that(Previous in 1943 his predecessor had arranged that an informal missionReference: composed of three Members of Parliament Mr. Ammon (now LordW.M.(43)158th Ammon), Sir D.

It had been made clear throughout that this was minute 2.) a goodwill mission and not a formal mission of enquiry, and as suchwould not be asked to submit a report for publication.Nevertheless, each of the Members on his return had presented the then Secretary of State (Mr. Attlee) with a report containinghis impressions and recommendations. As much confidential infor-mation had been given to the members of the mission on theunderstanding that the visit was of an informal nature, and as no formal evidence had been taken, it had been clearly undesirable thatthese reports should be published, and the three Members had sobeen informed.   [See WP. (43) 507.]Some time ago Lord Ammon had asked the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs whether it would be in order for him to write. a pamphlet about Newfoundland.  He (the Secretary of State) had replied that, provided it was clear that there was no question of publishing the report, but of writing a pamphlet giving LordAmmon&apos;s personal views and opinions, it was not for him to raise objection. A pamphlet by Lord Ammon had now been published,entitled &quot;&apos; Newfoundland the Forgotten Island,&quot; which consistedalmost entirely of extracts from his report with little or no alteration.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,30th November, 1944.Some of the material contained in the pamphlet was veryunsuitable for publication. For example, it discussed the possi-bilities of Newfoundland being federated with Canada or &quot;theUnited States. The publication of such material at this juncture,when the future policy in regard to Newfoundland was beingformulated, was very unfortunate.The other two members of the informal mission Sir D.Gunston and Mr. A. P. Herbert-had now put down questionsreferring to this publication and asking if it would be in order forthem to publish their reports.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows :-(1) The. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was asked toarrange for the circulation to the War Cabinet of copiesof the reports by all three members of the mission.(2) It was hoped that the questions referred to by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs could be postponed;failing this, a reply should be given to the effect that publication by Lord Ammon of a, pamphlet which so closely resembled the report which he had submitted was contrary to the understanding reached with HisMajesty&apos;s Government that these reports should not bepublished. As, however, Lord Ammon&apos;s pamphlet hadbeen published, consideration was being given to thequestion whether the other two reports should also bepublished.Reference might also be made to the informal natureof the mission and to the extent to which information had been obtained in confidence.
