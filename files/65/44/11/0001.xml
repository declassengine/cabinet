naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (4*4) 137thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Mediterranean.naval operations.iEgean.MilitaryOperations.Italy.The Balkans.Philippines.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bad weather had interfered with operations of bomber command, who had flown 1,970 sorties and dropped 5,450 tons of bombs, of which 4,700 tons had been on Germany and 750 on dykesand coast defences in the neighbourhood of Flushing.United States heavy bombers had flown 4,080 sorties, dropping8,970 tons of bombs on Germany.In reply to the enquiry made the previous week, the Chief ofthe Air Staff said that full information about the accuracy of blindbombing by United States aircraft was unobtainable as it wasimpossible to photograph all the targets. It was estimated, however,that when sending out large formations of bombing aircraft15 per cent, of the bombs dropped within some 5,000 feet and5 per cent, within 2,000 feet of the target. With smaller formations80 per cent, of the bombs dropped within 5,000 feet. The UnitedStates air authorities were examining the possibility of usingsmaller formations.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 11,500 sorties in bad weather and had attacked roads, railway communications and enemy vehicles. Allied losses amounted to 18 bombers and76 fighters and fighter-bombers as against 68 enemy aircraft destroyed.10,000 sorties had been flown and 7,850 tons of bombs dropped.Sixty-three enemy aircraft had been destroyed for the loss of96 Allied.Shipping losses from enemy action during the previous week amounted to 567 tons, the total for October from this causebeing 3,337.One U-boat had been destroyed and 1 probably destroyed during October.The Tirpitz had been located at Tromso.Stores and personnel were now being landed at Piraeus.On the 16th October coastal forces had landed troops atLemnos. During the enemy withdrawal by sea an E-boat and caiques had been attacked, the enemy suffering heavy casualties.The main action in Holland had been attacks towards Bredaand Hertogenbosch, both of which had made some progress. Thebulk of the mainland, south of the Scheldt, had now been cleared ofthe enemy. At Aix-la-Chapelle 12,000 prisoners had been taken,making a total of some 600,000 for the Western front.Some advance had been made on the 8th Army front in spiteof bad weather.Belgrade had been captured by the Russians. This meant thatthe German divisions&apos; to the south would not have the use of anyrailways for their retreat.Near Budapest the Russian attack had apparently been held,but they had made a considerable advance north of Debrecen. Inthe north the Germans had reported a Russian attack north ofWarsaw and near Kovno. The Germans had also reported that theRussians had captured Goldap in East Prussia.The American attack on the island of Leyte had only sufferedlight casualties.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Supplies for 2.   The Prime Minister said that he wished to raise thethe Italian question of the supply of beer and ammunition to the British troopsFront. on the Italian front, and also the question of leave for the troopsin this theatre. He was informed that the American soldiers hadfour bottles of beer a week and the British soldiers only one bottlea week.[28568-1 b 2
The Secretary of State for War said that he thought that supplies could not be increased except at the cost of some reductionin consumption in this country.The Prime Minister said that, if necessary, such a reduction should be made in order to ensure a proper supply of beer to thefighting troops in Italy.As regards leave, the Prime Minister asked whether a scheme could be worked out to allow leave at the rate of, say, 1,000 men amonth to the front-line troops in this theatre, who had hadcontinuous hard fighting.The Secretary of State for War said that this matter and there patriation of long-service troops from, the Italian front were under investigation. He would make a report to the Prime minister on this question, and also on the supply of ammunition.3. At their meeting on the 16th October the War Cabinet had invited the Chiefs of Staff to report on the arrangements made for publicity about artificial harbours.   This had now been submitted.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the report by the Chiefs ofStaff (W.P. (44) 579) explaining the arrangements madein regard to publicity on this matter.(2) Expressed approval of a suggestion made by the Ministerof Labour and National Service that the model of the artificial harbour now on view in the House of commons should later be placed on view in a number of bigindustrial cities, particularly those connected with the shipbuilding industry.(3) Took note, with approval, of a statement by the First Lordof the Admiralty that he proposed to arrange for a visit by representatives of the shipbuilding trade unions tothe artificial harbours.The War Cabinet were also informed that it was intended thatthe artificial harbour off the Normandy coast should, before long,cease to be used by ocean-going vessels, which would be diverted toother ports. The harbour would, however, still be used by landing craft. It was proposed that the Phoenix units which had been constructed to strengthen the harbour off the Normandy coastagainst the winter storms should be diverted to other ports withbetter railway facilities.The Prime Minister said that he would like an opportunity of considering this matter with the First Sea Lord.ArtificialHarbours.(previous reference erence:W.M. (44) 137thConclusions,Minute 6.)Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 137thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The War Cabinet were informed that during the previousweek 10 long-range rockets had been launched against this country,of which 6 had crossed the coast, 2 landing in the London area.During the week there had been flying-bomb activity on everynight but one. Eighty-three had been plotted, of which 34 had crossed the coast, 7 reaching London. About 50 flying bombs hadbeen destroyed, 29 of them over the sea, 9 by fighters and 41 by A.A.The total casualties for the week had been : -Long-range rocketFlying bomb ...Cannon shellSeriously slightly killed.

5. A discussion took place on the question of publicity forattacks by rockets.   -The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security reminded the War Cabinet that at their last meeting it had been agreed tomaintain the ban but to review the matter in a week&apos;s time. APrivate Notice Question on the subject had now been put down byMr. W. J. Brown, M.P., for answer on the following day. He hopedthat it would be ruled out of order by the Speaker, but, in thealternative, it would be necessary to consider what line to take.The War Cabinet again reviewed the arguments for and against publicity. The suggestion was made, and met with general approval, that there would be advantage in the matter beingmentioned incidentally in the course of the forthcoming general statement by the Prime Minister (see Item 6) in terms which wouldnot suggest that any special importance was attached to this formof attack. All necessary security requirements would be met ifreference to localities, numbers of casualties, &amp;c, was avoided.IThe Prime Minister suggested that he should consult with theChiefs of Staff and with the Home Secretary and Minister of home security on the terms of a reference to be included in the statementj which he proposed to make on Friday, the 27th October.The War Cabinet-Agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion at &quot; X &quot; and invited him to proceed accordingly.6. The Prime. Minister informed the War Cabinet that hehad it in mind to make a brief statement in the House of commons on Friday, the 27th October, on the progress of his discussions in moscow and on certain outstanding questions of interest. this statement would be by way of a supplement to the last general statement which he had made in the House; it should not, hethought, be followed by a debate. He proposed to inform the Houseof his intention in this matter on the following day.The War Cabinet-Took  note,   with  approval,   of  the  Prime  Minister&apos;intention.7. The Prime Minister said that in the course of his statement the&apos; would touch on the recognition of the French Committee ofNational Liberation as the provisional Government of France. Hewould state the facts which had weighed with us in reaching thisdecision. Thus it was clear that the present Government was acceptable to the people of France and that there was no effectivealternative to it.The War Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.. 8. The Prime Minister said that a difficult situation had arisen in Syria, owing to a statement by General Beynet to the syrian Prime Minister that, in view of the resolutions of the recentArab Conference, the French Government might consider that the declarations of Syrian independence made by General Catrouxwere invalidated. We might have to make it clear, perhaps in his proposed statement on the 27th October, that we could not accept that view.
The Permanent Vnder-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that there would be advantage in a statement which could beaddressed not only to the French but to the Syrians, who were somewhat over-stating their case.The War Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Belgium, 9.   The War Cabinet were informed that representations hadHolland and been received from Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen over the france. week-end about the Belgian food situation and its possible effectFood Situation. 0.n ^ne stability of the Belgian Government. It was clear that thesituation in some places was serious and the Ambassador had asked that our influence should be used with SHAFF, who were the responsible body, to ease it. We were arranging to informSHAEF of the seriousness with which we viewed the positionand to ask for all possible co-operation on their part. There was some reason to think that the trouble was due more to difficulties of distribution than the shortage of supplies.If the Germans were to flood the low-lying areas of Holland,the food situation in that country might be even more desperatethan in Belgium.The position in many parts of France was also serious for two reasons : first, the absence of adequate transportation facilitiesowing to the injuries which the system of communication had suffered; and, secondly, the shortage of raw materials. Thisshortage was accentuated by the fact that nearly all the availableport facilities were being used by the military.It was recognised that the food situation in Belgium was theresponsibility of SHAEF, who controlled the transport facilities. -In France, owing to the declaration of the &quot;zone of theinterior,&quot; the matter was one for the provisional Government toit y &quot; arrange in concert with the authorities concerned. Nevertheless, itwas felt that there would be advantage in the United kingdom ministers concerned consulting together to see whether there was any action which could usefully be taken in the matter.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note that a report on the food position in France andBelgium was being submitted to the War Cabinet bythe Secretary of State for War.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for consultationwith the Ministers concerned on the Tines indicated at &quot; Y.&quot;Celebration of armistice Day,1944.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 134thConclusions,Minute 7.)10. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat, subject to the approval of the War Cabinet, it was proposedto adopt the same arrangements for Armistice Day this year as forlast year. The 11th November would be Poppy Day, and arrange-ments would be made for services to be held in churches on thepreceding Sunday. There would be no two miuntes&apos; silence and nofunction at the Cenotaph.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the  Home  Secretary and minister of Home Security.

At their meeting on the 20th October the War cabinet had invited the Chiefs of Staff to state the reasons why the publica-tion of the figures of merchant shipping losses in Table 20 of theproposed statistical White Paper (W.P. (44) 574) would be ofassistance to the enemy in connection with future U-boat attacks on our shipping.The War Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff couldnot say that the publication of the figures would give the enemy any direct assistance in connection with future attacks. In the past,however, we had gained through the enemy&apos;s ignorance of the total tonnage available to us for operations. Moreover, the publicationof our losses, which were much higher than those during the last war, would be bound to encourage the enemy, particularly since hewould shortly be in a position to launch fresh U-boat attacks onour shipping. The United States Government had refrained from .publishing the figure of losses at our request, and, if it were decided that we should publish the figures, it would be necessary to consult them.&apos;The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that a securitypoint also arose in connection with Table 14 on page 12 of thedraft White Paper. The security authorities had been in favourof combining the figures for naval aircraft with those formiscellaneous types of aircraft, but it had been urged at themeeting of the War Cabinet on the 20th October that.there was a .case for showing naval aircraft separately. His own view was that,if naval aircraft were to be shown separately, the figures for thefirst half of 1944 should not be given.It was urged in discussion that the enemy were not likely tobe encouraged by the publication of our merchant shipping losses,which showed how successful our efforts to combat the U-boatmenace had been. It would, however, be necessary to consult theUnited States Government before any decision was reached to publish merchant shipping losses, in view of the arrangement madefor joint United States-United Kingdom statements to be issuedmonthly about submarine warfare. Further consideration shouldalso be given to the question whether separate figures of lossesshould be published for the first half of 1944.With regard to the figures of aircraft production in Table 14,there were strong arguments in favour of showing that our produc-tion had not slackened off in 1944, and it would be desirable toretain the 1944 figures if this could be done without givingvaluable information to the enemy.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to send a communication to thePresident of the United States Government asking whether he had any objection to the proposal to publishfigures of merchant shipping losses.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned,whether any changes were desirable in Table 14 of thedraft White Paper in order to avoid giving informationof value to the enemy.(3) Agreed that the draft White Paper should be further considered when a reply had been received from thePresident.
Parliament.Town and country planning Bill.(previous reference erence:W.M. (44) 137thConclusions,Minute 10.)live certainly until the end of the year, and possibly a little longer,with hardships but without actual starvation. The Chiefs of Staffaccordingly recommended that no supplies of food should be sentto the Islands, although there would be no objection to the sending of medical supplies and comforts, such as soap.It was important that the local German commander should beinformed by sure means that he was held responsible for the well-being of the civilian population.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatsome of the information which had reached him suggested that itwould be impossible for the civilian population to hold out beyond.the middle of November. If the population were exposed to serioushardship there would be strong criticism of the Government. Inorder to get more precise information, he suggested that a represen-tative of the International Red Cross might be sent to the Islandsto report.The general view of the War Cabinet was that no steps shouldbe taken for the present to send either food or medical supplies tothe Islands, but that arrangements should be made to make it clear to the German commander and his principal officers that we heldthem responsible. It was undesirable that an)&apos; message to theGerman commander should be conveyed under a flag of truce.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that steps should be taken by means of broadcastsand dropping leaflets to convey to the commander andhis principal officers that they would be held responsiblefor the well-being of the civilian population. Action tothis end. should be taken by the Political WarfareExecutive in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff andr     the Departments concerned.(2) Agreed to consider again in a fortnights time the questionof sending supplies to the Channel Islands.13. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, informed the War Cabinet that among Conservative Members there was strong and fairly widespread dissatisfaction with the new compen-sation clauses, although the clauses were supported by the ToryReform Group. There would probably be a division on an amend-ment to Clause 45 put down by Mr. Hore-Relisha, and it waspossible that a number of Members (mostly Conservatives) wouldvote against the Government. &quot;It was pointed out that the main issue was whether thecompensation clauses should be amended to extend to persons who held property as an investment, the concession which had beengranted to owner-occupiers.In favour of this it was urged that to give no more than 1939value to an owner might often amount to penalising thrift, and itwas pointed out that it might be possible to limit the concession to small property owners.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the right course was to adhere to the new clauses, which represented a compromisereached after much discussion in the War Cabinet and which ministers had agreed to regard as final. Moreover, it would beimpossible to make a concession to small property owners without raising a demand for its extension to all owners.The War Cabinet-^(1) Agreed that it was not possible to contemplate any departure from-the new compensation clauses.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to make a statement onWednesday, the 25th October, defining the governments attitude on this matter.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,23rd October, 1944. -
