(44) 117thConclusions,Minute .8.)3.   The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on the subject of man-power in the first half of 1945 : (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (W.P. (44) 718) dealing with the &quot;general position;(ii) a memorandum by the Secretary pf State for War (W.P.(44) 705) on the Army man-power requirements;(iii) a memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P.(44) 724) on man-power allocations for the Navy;(iv) a memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P.(44) 729) on the Naval contribution to Army man-powerneeds;(v) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air (W.P.(44) 728) on Royal Air Force man-power requirements;(vi) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W-P.(44) 751) * reporting the conclusions of the ministerial committee on Man-power on the requirements for the armed Forces;(vii) a memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production(W.P. (44) 748) on man-power for the aircraft industry;(viii) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P.(44) 755) reporting the conclusions of the Ministerial1 / Committee on Man-power on the requirements of the munitions industries.The War Cabinet considered first the requirements of the armed Forces.The claims for new intakes of men put, forward by the service ministers amounted to 208,500, subject&apos; to some slight adjustmenton account of any excess intakes which might have been receivedby the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force in 1944. Against these claims it was&apos;hoped that there would be available from the call-up140,000 men, including 20,000 fit young men who would be released from the munitions industries as a result of cuts in their programmes. It might be, however-that the numbers available fromthe i munitions industries would be* only 15,000.The Committee on Man-power had reached the conclusion that120,000 of the men available from the call-up should be allocated to the Army and that the remaining 20,000 should be allocated tothe Royal Navy.The Secretary of State for War had also put forward a claim for the transfer to. the Army from the Navy and the Royal Air Force. of 70,000 basically trained men. The Committee recommended thetransfer of 20,000 men from the Navy (11,868 of whom would bein formed units of the Royal Marines) and 20,000 men from theRoyal Air Force, a large proportion of whom should be of highmedical category.
With regard to intakes of women, there was a claim for 3,000women for the W.R.N.S., and a claim for 13,800 women for theA.T.S. If the existing age limits-for volunteers for the Wbmen&apos;auxiliary Services were maintained, only 10,000 women could besupplied in the first half of 1945. But by raising the age limit forvolunteering, about 5,000 additional women might be made available.The Committee proposed that of the 15,000, 3,000 should be allocated to the W.R.N.S. and 12,000 to the A.T.S.- The Secretary of State for Air said that the proposed transferof 20,000 basically trained men of high medical category from theRoyal Air Force to the Army would present great difficulties. Thedemands which&apos; the Royal Air Force would have to meet in Stage IImeant not only the conversion of bomber and coastal commandsquadrons to transport work, but also the conversion of existingoperational squadrons for use in new operational roles. Althoughthe Royal Air Force had received intakes of the highest medicalcategory for the air crews, they had in return accepted large numbersof low grade men as ground staff, with the result that they were having great difficulties in finding fit men to send overseas. More-over they were faced with the withdrawal of substantial numbersof men from the Dominion Air Forces and would have to train mento replace them. Everything possible was done to replace men by women in posts for which women were suitable. Would theSecretary of State for War not agree to the transfer of 20,000 menof low medical category from the Army to the Royal Air Force inreturn for the 20,000 men of high medical category whom the army would receive from the Air Force?The Secretary of State for War said that he would be preparedto consider this suggestion, but that in view of the effort which wasbeing made to get a very large number of men into the fighting lineit might be difficult to meet it.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that in preparing for Stage II the Navy were faced with very similar problems tothose facing the Royal Air Force. It seemed probable that the navy would only be able to release about 20 per cent, of their strength in Stage II as compared with much bigger percentages for theother Services. Nevertheless he had accepted the Man-power committee&apos;s proposals.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatit had been estimated that during the first half of 1945 the numberof whole-time workers employed in Civil Defence would be reducedby 94,000 to a total of 152,000. Every effort would be made to secure this reduction, but it might not prove possible to achieve the target.Moreover, in 1945 there would probably be a wastage of some 500to 600 police per month, and at a later date he might have to putforward proposals for the replacement of this wastage.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in W.P. (44) 751 for intakes intothe Armed Forces and for transfers to the Army fromthe royal navy and the Royal Air Force in the first six months of 1945.The War Cabinet then discussed the question of man-power for the munitions industries.It was explained that the original estimates made by the JointWar Production Staff had provided for an increase in the man-power required for the Admiralty of 10,000 and for reductions inthe Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Aircraft Productionman-power requirements of 99,000 and 523,000 respectively. It was now estimated that the Admiralty would require no increase. TheMinistry of Supply would, however, be able to release only 49,000as against 99,000, and the Ministry of Aircraft Production, if theycontinued to work on the present aircraft programme, could releaseonly 400,000 instead of 523,000.   Thus on the new basis the net
343W.M. 173 (44).release from&apos;the munitions industries in the first half of 1945 wouldbe 449,000 instead of 612,000. This meant that there would be areduction of 5,000 in the manpower available for intakes for the armed forces. The effect on civilian industry would be much more marked, and before further consideration could be given to theman-power requirements of industries in Groups II and III firm,estimates must be made of the man-power requirements of the munitions industries. It.was, therefore, a matter of great urgencythat the aircraft programme should be reviewed, and it wassuggested that the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of aircraft Production should submit revised proposals which wouldtake into account the aircraft which were being made available byLend-Lease. &apos;The Secretary of State for Air said that every effort was beingmade to work out a revised programme and that his proposals should.be available not later than the end of the first week inJanuary.The War Cabinet^-. (2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister.of aircraft.Production to submit revised proposals relatingto the aircraft programme as soon as possible.Man-power. 4.   The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on the(Previous 20th December it had been proposed that, at an appropriate time,Reference: we should announce that arrangements were being made which.M. (4.4) 172nd would result in adding 250,000 fighting men to the fighting line.Conclusions, A draft announcement had been prepared. If the War cabinet minute 2.) approved, he would make the announcement on some suitable occasion after Christmas. .-There was general agreement that it was most desirable thatan announcement on the lines proposed should be made, both as a gesture to our Allies and for its effect in this country, particularlyin the factories. Recently there had been a tendency to assume that serious fighting was over and the pressure on the Services to release men had increased very markedly.The Secretary of State for Air said that it would &quot;help incarrying out the transfers of trained men from the Royal Air force to the Army if the Prime Minister could make it clear in the. announcement that those involved in the transfers were being moved in order that they might be able to serve where they were most,. needed at this time. &apos;The War Cabinet-Agreed that at a suitable opportunity the Prime minister should make a statement on the lines proposed.Civil air transport. ,requirements for Progress in design and manufacture.(previous reference: :W.M. (44) 114thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. At their meeting on the 1st September the War cabinet had recorded the view that great importance attached to steps beingtaken to accelerate the design, development and production of aircraft for civil use. The Minister of Production, the Minister ofLabour and National Service, the Secretary of State for Air, andthe Minister of Aircraft Production had undertaken to examine,as a matter of urgency, the steps necessary to achieve this end, andto report to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet now had before them a report from theMinisters concerned (W.P. (44) 649).The report showed that quicker progress depended mainly onearly supply of draughtsmen. The War Cabinet were invited toagr^e to the following measures to meet the requirements of the
Ministry of Aircraft Production for draughtsmen,to the fullestpractical extent&apos;* .(i).TW&apos;Mitiiat*y. df LabouramiNational Service should,withoht publicity ehde^pur to -obtain: volunteers fromother branches of the engineering; industry, with due regard to the claims of re^yerdiotf^ot^hier importantWork. &apos; &apos;(ii) The Minister Of-Labour and National Service should examine &quot;with majesty&apos;s^vfcef Ministers - th!fc&apos; possibility of releasing further draughtsmen from the Forces.(iii) The Ministry of Aircraft Production, should continue topress forward with internal transfers, up-grading andtraining in the aircraft industry, and should examinewith the Ministry of Labour and National Service thepossibility of expanding that Departments schemes fortraining draughtsmen.(iv) The Ministry of Supply should examine as a matter of urgency the possibility of transferring draughtsmen -from their establishments.Points in discussion Were(a) The Minister of Production said that action on the lines proposed was already in hand.(b) The Secretary of State for Air said that he had had great success in finding draughtsmen in the Royal Air Force. He invited the other two Service Ministers to do all they could to release furtherdraughtsmen from the Army and the Royal Navy.(c) The Minister fof Civil Aviation stressed the importance from the point of view of the development of British civil aviation,of preceding as rapidly as possible with the design stage, and thussaving time in the introduction of new British types.The War Cabinet-Took note of the discussion and approved the actionrewmmended in W.P. (44) 649 as summarised above.Civil Industry.        (j.   Arising out of discussion on the previous item, theSupply of       President of the Board of Trade said that he had pressing demandsdraughtsmen;   from civil industry for 600 draughtsmen fOf work which would beof the utmost importance for the export trade.. The Minister of Labour and National Service said that in 1940there had been only 14,000 draughtsmen in the whole country. this number had been brought up to about 26,000, but there was still needfor the number to be increased, by training of further draughtsmenand by dilution. If the Board of Trade would consult his Depart-ment, he would consider what steps could be taken to increase thesupply of draughtsmen for eivil industry.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Civil air transport.comparison of British aridAmericanTransportAircraft.7. The War Cabinet took note of a memorandum submitted bythe Minister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (44) 690) comparing sixBritish and six American transport aircraft likely to be available in numbers fOr commercial airlines between January 1945 and January;1947.
v 345 WM. 173 (44).Future 8.   On the 21st November the War Cabinet had considered aProvision for memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on thisColonial subject.(W.P. (44) 643),&apos;and had invited the Chancellor of theDevelopment Exchequer and the Secretary of State to arrange for further and Welfare,   discussion in the light of the views expressed.(Previous The War Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the reference:     Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (44) 753).   The memo-W.M. (44) 152nd randum explained that he had now agreed with the Chancellor of conclusions, . the Exchequer that, subject to confirmation by the War Cabinet, the minute 9.)      proposed Act amending the Colonial Development and Welfare Act,1940, would authorise total expenditure not exceeding  120 million over the ten-year period, starting on the 1st April, 1946, subject tothe actual expenditure under the Act in any one financial year notexceeding  17^ million.  This figure of  120 million would include expenditure on research, at present separately provided for, andexpenditure on higher education which was in contemplation.There would De no limit of time on research expenditure, but, afterthe expiry of the ten-year period, research expenditure would belimited to  1 million a year.The War Cabinet-Approved this proposal.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,21st December, 1944.
