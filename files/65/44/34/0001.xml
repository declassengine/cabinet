(44) 162ndConclusions.)3. The War Cabinet were given the latest information aboutthe position in Greece. A telegram from Mr. Leeper, dated the10th December (No. 548), reported a conversation which he &quot;had had with M. Svolos, who, although he had resigned from the GreekGovernment at the time of the crisis, had not joined the communists in their armed revolt. Mr. Leeper had made it clear to him thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were determined to go on until the revoltwas finished, and that those who were leading the revolt should realise that their only sensible course was to surrender.A telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Consul, Salonika (No. 130), wasalso read. This showed some improvement in the situation, thegeneral strike having been suspended.Attention was drawn to a telegram from Athens, reporting thata B.B.C. Greek broadcast had contained an unhelpful comment on the speech made by the Prime Minister, in Parliament on Friday,the 8th December. -Anxiety was expressed lest the efforts which we were makingto restore order in Greece should be hampered by statements of this character.  It was agreed that this report should be investigated.The War Cabinet were also informed that arrangements hadbeen made to bring General Plastiras from the South of France to greece. -M. Papandreou had been strongly in favour of this course.General Plastiras&apos;s record showed that he was an anti-Monarchist.It was thought that he would exercise a considerable influence in greece, and that there could be no reasonable grounds on which his return at this juncture could be criticised.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Ethiopia.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 151stConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the latesttelegrams from Lord De la Warr showed that the negotiations withthe Emperor were now likely to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The Emperor had, however, rejected an offer of 3 million for development purposes.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.accommodation for ReturnedDominionPrisonersof War,5 The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 706) about accommodation for returned Dominion prisoners of war.It- was explained that accommodation would have to beprovided in this country for about 27,000 prisoners of war from australia, New Zealand and South Africa between their release from Germany and the time when shipping was available, to take them to their homes. The original plan had been to accommodatethem in the Eastern, Scottish and Northern Commands; but, inorder to meet the views of the Dominions&apos; representatives in thiscountry that accommodation should be provided near London, the
War Office had subsequently requisitionedpremises in South-Eastand SoUth coast holiday resorts, and administrative staffs and acertain number of prisoners of war were already in occupation ofsome of the accommodation. Objection had been raised, particu-larly in Brighton and Eastbourne, on the grounds that, if hotel sand boarding houses in South-East and South coast resorts were notreleased very soon, these resorts, which had been hard hit duringthe war, would not be able to benefit from the resumption of holidaysafter the end of the war in Europe. On the other hand, theDominions had extended generous hospitality to members of theBritish Services and might feel resentful if we did not meet their desire that their prisoners of war should be accommodated near london.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that hesympathised with the case made on behalf of the South-East and(South coast resorts and that, if it was felt essential to yield to their objections, he was prepared &quot;to take the matter up direct with theDominion Prime Ministers concerned. He hoped, however, that itwould be possible to reach some arrangement which would allow theDominion prisoners of war to be accommodated near London.In discussion, reference was made to the pressure on accommo-dation in South coast towns for other purposes. Thus many of thestaff of H.M.S. Vernon, were now in schools and colleges whichmight have to be vacated. It was pointed out, however, that themaximum demand on accommodation at any one time was a relatively small fraction of the total accommodation for holidaymakers in the resorts, and that, if arrangements could be made to spread the burden evenly among the various resorts and to avoidrequisitioning all the best accommodation for the prisoners of war,no serious difficulty should arise.The War Cabinet- .Agreed that the Dominion prisoners of war should be accomodated in South-East and South: coast resorts, and invited the Secretary of State for War tb arrange that- the War Office, in consultation with the other Departmentsconcerned, should ensure that the distribution of the prisoners of war among the several resorts, and the selection of the types of premises, should be made in sucha way as to cause as little interference as possible with theuse of the resorts for holiday purposes.6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 624) about reinstatement inthe Civil Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of the reinstatement in Civil Employment Act, 1944, it was necessary tomake an announement about the position of Civil Servants who had left the Service to join the Forces without the permission of their departments. It was also necessary to consider the position of CivilServants who were called up, but registered as conscientious objectors.He proposed that men and women who had resigned to join theForces without, permission should be reinstated and that their service in the-Forces, should count for pension and&quot; for incrementalprogression up the salary scales. The only loss which they wouldincur would be that they would not receive the balance of civil payduring their service in the Forces. Legislation might be necessary toenable their service in the Forces to count for pension.With regard to conscientious objectors, those who had objectedonly to combatant service and had served in non-combatant units would be treated in exactly the same way as fighting men. .A secondclass of conscientious objectors those who had obeyed a direction
to take up some form of national service, e.g., civil defence,agriculture, &amp;c. would be reinstated and their period of nationalservice would count for incremental progression up the salary scales.It would not, however, count for pension, nor would they receive anybalance of civil pay. The third class of conscientious objectors those who had refused to obey directions given to them by a tribunal-would be dealt with individually by the employing depart-ment and the Treasury in consultation; when application for theirreinstatement was made. It was impossible to lay down any general rule to cover cases in this class;The Treasury had undertaken to arrange that the three service departments should not be asked to re-employ their ownconscientious objectors, but that these men, if reinstated, should be&apos;transferred to some other department.The War Cabinet-Agreed that instructions should be issued to departments on the lines proposed in W.P. (44) 624.Apsley House.(previous reference:W;M.(44)75thConclusions,Minute 5.)7, At their meeting on the 12th June, 1944, when, the WarCabinet had considered an offer made by the Duke of Wellingtonto the Government of part of Apsley House and the Wellingtonheirlooms, the Minister of Works had been invited to ascertain whether the Duke of Wellington would be willing to agree (i) to some limit on the period for which his family would retain the right to occupy part of the premises free of rent and rates; and(ii) to fen arrangement under which the pictures would beavailable for loan to public galleries.The War Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 701) reporting the resultof the approach to the Duke of Wellington.The Duke of Wellington wished to retain the right to occupypart of the premises, free of rent and rates, only for so long as therewas an heir to the title; and he would not be willing that the picturesshould be loaned to other galleries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he now proposed tha,tthe offer should be accepted, subject to the approval of the Trustees.The Lord President of the Council and the Minister of Works werein agreement with this. This proposals was not based on the viewthat Apsley House would be a suitable place for government hospitality, since the War Cabinet had agreed that the offer should&quot;be considered apart from this question.The War Cabinet-Agreed that, subject to the approval of the Trustees, theoffer made by the Duke of Wellington to give to the nationthe site and buildings of Apsley House; the Wellingtonheirlooms and certain other objects, should be accepted.Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,11th December, 1944.
g,r. 136HO CIRCULATION RECORDW.M.(W 163RD CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1MONDAY. 11TH DECEMBER 19hh - 12 NOONIn the course of the review of the military situation,the Minister of Labour and National Service said that he thought&amp; there was a general impression in the country that the plan of attack on the Western Front during the last month or so hadnot yielded the results expected.    In Trades Union circles therewas an impression that the position was slipping and was not beingproperly gripped.   He himself had no information about thepresent strategy on the Western Front, but feared that a continuance of the present position might have serious effects on the Coalition Government.   The Minister of Labour concluded by saying that he hoped that the War Cabinet would before longhave a report on the present situation and future strategy.The Chief   of the Imperial General Staff said that general eisenhower was talking the matter over with his Commanders andwould have a definite scheme to submit in the near future.     he mentioned that General Eisenhower would shortly be coming overto this country, but did not give any specific date.It was left that the views expressed should be reportedto the Prime Minister.     The Deputy Prime Minister suggested thatthe matter might be considered at a meeting of the DefenceCommittee before long.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.^Note:   This was reported to the Prime Minister on the  12th December, 19*44.     As a result a special meeting of the War Cabinet only with the Chiefs ofStaff was held at 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 13thDecember, 19kh - see note appendedZtheretopY
