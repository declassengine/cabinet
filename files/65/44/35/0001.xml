Broadcast.B.B.C.Broadcast.(previous reference:W.M.(44)163rGonclusions,Minute 3.)1. The War Cabinet, gave further consideration to the state-ment issued by the B.B.C. in connection with&quot; the Debate in theHouse of Commons on the Greek situation.Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart read to the War Cabinet the text of the statement &quot;to which exception had been taken. It had; he explained, been prepared for issue, and had actually issued,before the Debate ih the House. It was designed to explain theworking of democracy in this country. The B.B.C. had been instructed in terms to deal with the Debate on a strictly factual basis,and to avoid comment of any sort. A factual summary of the Debatehad been broadcast in accordance with these instructions. But byan unfortunate misunderstanding the statement how under discus-sion, which had, as he had explained, already issued prior to the debate, had again been used to make up time at the end of thecomment on the Debate.The Prime Minister-said that the result had been to give a wholly misleading impression abroad, namely, that the decisionof the House of Commons was not important and that on the mainfacts the opinion of the nation was against His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. The unhappy effect of such a statement on the local situation,already so difficult and delicate, was a very serious matter. he proposed to take the matter up with the Minister of information on his return. -The War Cabinet---Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Foreign AffairsGreece, ItalyaridYugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet had a discussion on the foreign situation,and, in particular; On the latest developments in Greece, Italy and yugoslavia.In this connection the War Cabinet also discussed a note bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs covering a memorandumon Policy in Macedonia (W.P.

5.   The War Cabinet considered a memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 645), to whichwas annexed a note setting out the personnel requirements of the -four main political parties for the impending general election.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that the requests of the four main political parties had been discussed between their representatives and the Joint Parliamentary Secre-tary of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. He had circulated the note of these requests for consideration by hiscolleagues and had indicated in his covering memorandum how farhe thought it reasonable to meet the requests.I. Requests relating to candidates.The proposal in paragraph 2 of the Annex to W.P. (44) 645was that, subject to overriding military considerations, short specialleave should be granted to enable properly proposed and endorsedpotential candidates to appear before selection committees; andthat adopted candidates should be released from the Forces inadequate time before the election.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he saw no difficulty in agreeing to these proposals so far as the main political parties, were concerned. It would, however, be extremelydifficult to deal with applications&quot; for the grant of special leave to appear before selection committees in the case of potential candi-dates belonging to parties other than the main parties or potentialindependent candidates.There was general agreement with the proposal that adoptedcandidates should be released in adequate time before, the election;and it was pointed out that if candidates were released at the timeof the decision that a general election mfist take place, this would allow them an interval of about two months before the poll.     with regard to the grant of leave to attend selection committees,the position was more difficult. Clearly any concession would haveto be subject to overriding military considerations, and it wouldnot always be possible to provide facilities for men serving in themore distant theatres. The main problem, however, was how to besatisfied that applications from potential candidates who did notbelong to the main parties were genuine. While it would be extremely difficult to deny facilities to such potential candidates,it would be almost equally difficult to devise any criterion by which to decide on their applications. The suggestion was made that theproblem might be solved by the appointment of a tribunal or an advisory body to assist the Ministers concerned, It was also suggested that it might help in reaching a decision if some estimateof the numbers of potential candidates likely to be involved couldbe made.II. Release of agents and organisers and key staff of headquarters and regional party offices who were at present in the Forces, in national Service or in industry.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that, while he was prepared to agree to the release of recognised agents,organisers and staff, he could not agree to the release of &quot;personstp be appointed to the posts of agents and organisers,&quot; since this might be open to abuse, and he was doubtful whether the releaseof partly-paid or unpaid agents could be justified,It was suggested in discussion that if, as seemed likely, thewords &quot; persons to be appointed&quot; were primarily intended to cover the appointment of recognised agents to constituencies other thanthose in which they had previously served, no difficulty should arise.With regard to partly-paid and unpaid agents, it was urged that so long as the persons concerned were recognised constituency agents,as distinct from area agents, the fact that they were partly paidGeneralElection.PersonnelRequirementsof thePour Main&apos; political parties.
op unpaid should not,be a bar tq their release, in some areas itWas usual for th^Labqurpar-ly argent ^ be unpaid/Tfe g^er^l feeling. 0/ the War Cabinet was that it would be reasonable to release a recognised constituency agent or organiser,irrespective of the basis of his or her remuneration,&apos; las well as the key staff of headquarters and regional party offices.III. Officers, and men in the Indian Army.There was general agreement that these should receive the same treatment as officers and men in the British Army and that this. should not be confined solely to those whose service with the indian army was temporary and arising out of War conditions.The War Cabinet-CQ Invited %,.lfinjjter q$ Labour and National Service andthe three Seryipe Ministers, together with the ChiefWhips, to arrange a meeting with the Chief PartyAge&amp;tsi a&amp;d the Party Chairman in order to explorefaster the problems, connected with the requestsrelating to, candid a tes. .(2) Iflvited the. Ji/tiit^ster of Labour $nd National Service, whenthef meeting referreid to, in (1), had been held, to submitrevised pr-proposals to the War Cabinet on all the matters dealt with in the annex- to W.P, (44) 645, consulting withtfee Chancellor qf the Exchequer on the candidature ofTeWPftrajy Civil Servants (see Minute 6).Civil Service.TemporaryCivilServants&quot; andParliamentaryCandidature.6. The War Cabinet had before them the following papers onthe subject of temporary Civil Servants and parliamentary candidature  - &quot;(i) A memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer;     (W.P. (44)685);(ii) A memorandum by the Lord President of the Council(W.P. (44) 695);(iii) A memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power(W.P. (44)702).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposal madeby the chief agents of the four main political parties was that menand women employed as temporary civil servants who desired tosubmit themselves to selection committees as parliamentary candi-dates should be allowed to do so. He had reached the conclusionthat this request should not be granted. The question whether anydispensation, in favour of temporary civil servants, should begranted from the Servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candi-dates) order 1927, had been raised in 1941, and the War Cabinet(W.M. (41) 41st Conclusions, Minute 8) had decided that theexisting rule should not be modified. The basis of the rule was that persons who in the course, of their work had to interpret and applypolicy should not openly participate in political activities, and since temporary Civil Servants were employed on the same type ofwork as permanent Civil Servants he did hot see how any distinctioncould be drawn in their favour.It. was urged, on the other hand, that, as pointed out in the memoranda by the Lord President of the Council and the Ministerof Fuel and Power, many persons who would normally have put themselves forward^ as candidates were at present serving as. tem-porary Civil Servants and should not be debarred from standingat the next general election. In many cases it was not possible to distinguish between the work done by temporary Civil Servants andthe work done by officers in the Armed Forces, who were entitledto become candidates.In further discussion, it was suggested that a compromisemight be reached under which a temporary Civil Servant would beallowed to appear before the selection committee but should be
debarred from active promotion of his candidature so long as he retained his&apos;post. When the date for the general election had been fixed, he could be given the choice of abandoning his candidature orresigning his post. -The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be further considered (see conclusion to Minute 5).Parliament.   .       7.   The War Cabinet agreed that an announcement should beArrangements   made as follows ;  .for the (1) The House would adjourn for the Christmas Recess on christmas Thursday, 21st December.Eecess- (2) The- House would re-assemble on Tuesday, 23rd January,1945.   (This would allow a recess of four clear weeks,.. as in the last four years.)(3) In view of the probable demand that the House should re-assemble a week earlier to deal with the volume of&apos; impending legislation, the Leader of the House might suggest that the House could meet on Mondays, to theextent necessary to make up for the additional time which would have &quot;been available had Parliamentre-assembled on Tuesday, 16th January, 1945.(4) Note was taken that it might be necessary for the Houseof Commons to pass a further Vote of Credit as their first business when the House re-assembled on the23rd January, 1945.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
