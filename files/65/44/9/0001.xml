Housing. 1.   At their meeting on the 25th September, the War Cabinet(Previous       had approved the programme of Portal Uniseco and Arcon housesReference&apos;:      proposed in the memorandum by the Minister of ReconstructionW.M. (44) 126th (W.P. (44) 536), and had agreed that the possibility should be conclusions,     explored of supplementing the programme by the production of minute 2.)      houses of the Tarran and other types, in so far as this could be done without substantially interfering with the programme of permanent houses.    This conclusion had been based, so far as concerned theTarran bouse, on the fact that the Tarran firm was faced with financial difficulties.The Minister of Works informed the War Cabinet that satis-factory financial arrangements were now being made which would ensure that the firm were in a position to participate in theprogramme, and the financial guarantors were nominating newdirectors to the firm. He therefore asked authority to include theTarran house in the prefabricated house programme as soon as thedetails of the financial arrangements had been settled to hissatisfaction.The Tarran house could be prefabricated and erected by theordinary building contractor. Its production would not, therefore,impinge on the production of other types of prefabricated house.In discussion some doubts were expressed as to the wisdom of including the Tarran house in the programme, having regard to thefinancial difficulties through which the firm had passed. It was stated that the firm had not the organisation behind them with whichthemselves to produce any considerable number of houses, and itwould be important to ensure that they did not secure payments asa result of the inclusion of the Tarran house in the prefabricatedhouse programme which were out of scale with the services whichthey were in a position to render.It was explained that the services for which it was contem-plated that the firm would be paid were : (i) instructing other firms in this type of construction;(ii) managing depots for the components of the Tarran house;(iii) licensing other firms to build Tarran houses.In addition the firm would be allowed themselves to contract forthe erection of a certain number of houses.After further discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the Tarran house should be included in theGovernment&apos;s temporary house programme on the under-standing that all the proposed financial arrangements withthe firm were submitted for the prior approval of theTreasury.Munitions 2.   At their meeting on the 19th September, the War CabinetProduction. b.ad reaffirmed their decision that, for the purpose of estimating(Previous man-power requirements in the second half of 1944, it should be reference: assumed that the war with Germany would not continue beyond theW.M. (44) 129th 31st December, 1944. It had also been agreed that this conclusionConclusions, should be translated into definite action, as outlined in the memo-Minutes 2 &apos; randum by the Minister of Production (W.P. (44) 517).ana 3.) This conclusion had since been varied in certain respects.The position of the Army Programme was as follows. At theMeeting of the War Cabinet on the 29th September (W.M. (44)129th Conclusions, Minute 2), the Prime Minister had said thathe thought that, with enemy resistance stiffening, the war might continue until the end of February, 1945, and that it was forconsideration whether any of the cuts in production decided uponwere too drastic. The Minister of Production had undertaken tosubmit a memorandum on the tank position, and in W.P. (44) 553had pointed out that, as regards Army supplies generally , thereduction already proposed would enable our Forces to continue without any appreciable reduction in&quot;their striking power until theend of March  1945.    On tank  production,  however, he  had
recommended a revised programme, planned on the definiteassumption that the war would continue until the 31st March, 1945.Tank production was now proceeding on this basis.The position as regards aircraft was set out in a memorandumby the Minister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (44) 572), which theWar Cabinet had before them. This showed that production was continuing on the basis of what was known as the Augustprogramme, which covered the period to the 31st December, 1946,and was based on the indefinite continuance of the German war.Effect had not yet been given to the September programme, whichwas based on the assumption that the German war would not continue beyond the 31st December, 1944, and that the Japanese war would last 18 months after the end of the German war.The Minister of Aircraft Production pointed out that thecontinuance of production on the August programme would involvegreat waste of resources. As, however, there might be objections tothe immediate introduction of the September programme, he proposed a compromise, which was in effect equivalent to theassumption that the German war would end about the 30th June,1945.The War Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (44) 573) pointing out that instruc-tions could not be issued to put into operation forthwith reductions in programmes to the considerable extent implicit in the decisionsalready reached by the War Cabinet, without this fact becomingwidely known. The Americans were making elaborate preparations for programme adjustments in Stage II, but had said that no action would be taken until the end of the German war. For us to make substantial cutbacks immediately after they had promised usassistance in Stage II might give rise to serious embarrassment. he accordingly proposed that we should proceed on the basis that suchcuts as were made between now and the end of 1944 should not carryus beyond the man-power adjustments which we had planned in july to make in the last half of 1944. Postponement for at least a monthof the additional cuts proposed offered no difficulty to the Ministryof Supply, while the proposals put forward by the Minister of aircraft Production in his paper seemed a satisfactory compromise.The Minister of Production proposed to explain the position in aletter to Mr. Philip Reed, a draft of which was annexed to his memorandum.The following points were made in discussion : (a) -The Minister of Production said he thought that the supply departments ought to proceed on the basis of keeping theirinventories and stocks of components rather on the low side, andshould review the position from month to month.&apos; At the same time they should ensure that, should the war against Germany continue until the 30th June, 1945, no serious shortages in ground equipment would develop.(b) The Minister thought that it would be desirable that nolarge-scale type changes or expansion of new types which would notyield an immediate dividend should be made.without reference to.the Ministry of Production. If serious divergences of viewdeveloped, he would, of course, bring the matter before the WarCabinet,(c) The Minister suggested that the Board of Trade should prepare shadow plans for reconversion on the basis that the earliest date on which the war was likely to end was the 31st December,1944, and the latest date the 30th&quot; June, 1945. No doubt the Boardof Trade would submit reports from time to time on the progress ofthese shadow plans.(d) The Minister of Supply said that his Department were proceeding on the basis that hostilities would not continue beyondthe 31st March, 1945. Should the war continue a month or so longer,the rate of production in progress would enable demands to be met.
It must be understood, however, that certain cuts in production hadbeen made which could not be replaced and which would lead toshortages if the war with Germany should last for any considerable period beyond that date.(e) The Minister of A aircraft Production said that the essentialneed in his case was that an immediate decision should be reached as to our future programme, on which we could base our demands on United States production. A decision once reached must be adhered to, and could not be altered quickly.(/) The President of the Board of Trade said that the Minister ^of Production^ proposals meant that he could not increase civilianproduction or prepare for the resumption of exports to the extent which he had hoped. This was rather a disappointment to him.He proposed to prepare a list of priority firms to whom increasedman-power should be allotted as soon as this could be arranged.This list would be kept under review, and he would keep in the closest contact with the Minister of Production.(g) The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor War expressed agreement with the Minister of Production^proposals.(h) The Secretary of State for Air said that when the WarCabinet had decided that for man-power purposes it should beassumed that the war with Germany should not continue beyond the31st December, 1944, he had pleaded for a larger aircraft productionthan would be possible under that hypothesis. The Minister of aircraft Production^ compromise proposal gave him more aircraftthan he had then asked for, but not exactly in the types for whichhe had asked. His requirements in heavy bombers had, however,been more than met, and he accepted the present proposals.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) The proposals of the Minister of Production, as set out inhis memorandum (W.P. (44) 573), were generally approved, subject to the points recorded in discussion.(2) The Ministers were invited to send to the Minister ofProduction any comments on the draft letter toMr. Philip Reed, the final text of which&apos;would be settled in consultation with the Foreign Office.(3) The modified &quot;September programme,&quot; set out in theMinister of Aircraft Production^ memorandum, and theAppendix thereto (W.P. (44) 572), was approved.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,17*A October, 1944.
