Ethiopia.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (44) 141stConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 647) reporting theprogress of Lord De La Warr&apos;s negotiations with the ethiopian government which had reached a deadlock over the OgadenProvince and the Reserved Areas. The Emperor had suggested a compromise under which we would retain administration over the ogaden, while Ethiopia would recover all the Reserved Areas,special arrangements being made by the Emperor to safeguard theposition in those areas of the British Somali tribes who enjoyedgrazing rights there by treaty.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recommended in his memorandum that, subject to certain modifications, the compromiseput forward by the Emperor should be accepted.The Minister of State, in the absence of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, said that since the circulation of W.P. (44) 647Telegram        further proposals had been received from Lord De la Warr, whoDW 80. recommended that he should make a further endeavour to persuade the Emperor to come to an arrangement which would meet our views as regards both the Reserved Areas and the Ogaden, subjectto certain provisions designed to reassure the Emperor as to hisposition.   These were as follows : *(a) that we would make it clear in all proclamations, &amp;c, inthe Reserved Areas that the British authorities exercisedadministrative powers by specific delegation by theEmperor;(b) that in place of an Ethiopian Governor, appointed by theEmperor, a British Administrator of the Reserved areas should be appointed jointly by the Emperor and byHis Majesty&apos;s Government; - and(c) if this proved essential to secure the other two points, thatwe should agree to withdraw our troops from Jigjigaand to their replacement by Ethiopian troops.The War Cabinet first discussed whether Lord De La Warrshould be authorised to put forward a suggestion on these lines, and agreed that he should be so authorised.The War Cabinet next considered what Lord De La Warrshould say if the Emperor declined to accept this proposal. It was strongly urged that Lord De la Warr should say that his mission was at an end and that he was returning to the United Kingdom.The Minister of State suggested that Lord De La Warr shouldbe authorised, if his own proposal was not accepted, to accept theEmperor&apos;s compromise proposal as modified in W.P. (44) 647.(a) In favour of this course the Minister of State urged thatwe should be in an impossible position if we failed tosecure an understanding with the Emperor, but never-theless tried to maintain our position in the Ogaden andthe Reserved Areas, to which, once the Agreement withthe Emperor had run out, we would have no legal right.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, even afterthe expiry of the Agreement, we would retain grazingrights under the Treaty of 1897; and that we should bejustified, if necessary, in using force to secure theexercise of those rights.(&amp;) The question was also.raised whether there was any riskof misunderstanding on the part of the United states or of an appeal by the Emperor to the United States.The Ethiopian Government appeared even to have adopted a suggestion by their American Adviser thatthe future of the Ogaden should be referred to UnitedStates arbitration. It was urged, on the other hand,that Ethiopia was under the most substantial obligations.   [28736-1] b 2
to His Majesty&apos;s Government, which had liberated herand set her on her feet. If the negotiations broke down,we should have nothing to reproach ourselves with. Itwas not necessarily to our interest to remain in Ethiopiaor to uphold the Emperor. If the United States were ready to relieve us of our burdens there, we need not object to their doing so.(c) While the scheme put forward by the Emperor was a clumsyone it could not be discarded as unworkable. A similarscheme had been working quite well in the BuranaProvince.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, in dealing withan Oriental, it was bad tactics to be driven from one position toanother. We should make up our minds at what point to ceasebargaining, and decline to allow ourselves to be drawn any further.Lord De La Warr should not go beyond the proposals in his telegramDW 80. A stiff attitude might well produce the necessary result.If it did not, we should bring the negotiations to an end.The War Cabinet next considered the tactics to be adopted byLord De La Warr.After discussion, the general sense of the War Cabinet wasthat Lord De La Warr should refrain from informing the Emperordirectly that, in the event of the offer he was now to make not being accepted, the negotiations would come to an end and he would return home. He should, on the other hand, discreetly let it be known in advance that this.was, in fact, his last word.On the question whether any warning should be given to theEmperor of the effect of a breakdown on the subsidy, &amp;c, theMinister of State suggested that there would be great advantage inthe Emperor being informed, at the same time as the negotiationscame to an end, that if His Majesty did not want an Agreement, wewould not force one on him; that the Mission was being recalled,that the subsidy would come to an end, and the railway wouldrevert to the Custodian of Enemy Property, and that we would withdraw from the Ogaden and the Reserved Areas. That wouldmake the Emperor consider his position seriously, while it would leave us in an unassailable position. The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would strongly favour action on these lines.On the other hand, it was urged that certain of these conse-quences would follow automatically from the expiry of theagreement on the 25th December, 1944, but that in any case thebalance of advantage rested with postponing any such communica-tion until after Lord De La Warr had returned home and reportedto the War Cabinet.After further discussion the Prime Minister summed up theview of the War Cabinet as follows : *(1) That Lord De La Warr should be authorised to put to theEmperor the proposal contained in his telegram DW 80.(2) Before doing so, he should discreetly let it be known thata failure to reach settlement on these lines would mean the end of his negotiations and his return to this country.(3) If the Emperor refused to accept Lord De La Warr&apos;sproposals, Lord De La Warr should express his regretand say that he was returning to the United kingdom as his instructions were now at an end.(4) If the Emperor enquired as to the position in thesecircumstances of the Military Mission, the subsidy, the lump sum grant, the Ogaden or any other matter,Lord. De La Warr should reply that he had no instruc-tions on these points.(5) In the meantime, arrangements for the preservation of orderin the areas in dispute in support of our unquestionedrights should be considered.
cCivil Ail&apos;Transport.ChicagoConference.(previous reference:W.M..(44) 148thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLord Privy Seal (W.P. .(44) 654) as chairman of the SpecialCommittee on Civil Air Transport. The Committee recommendedthat, subject to a satisfactory reply from the Colonies concerned,Lord Swinton should be authorised to negotiate a satisfactoryExecutive Agreement at Chicago with the following terms : (a) National Quotas to be allocated on the basis of &quot; trafficembarked &quot; and a 60 per cent, load factor.(&amp;) During an Interim Period of three years from the end ofthe War with Germany, &quot; War &quot; Nations to be free totake up their national quotas at any time, withoutprejudice.(c) A Fifth Freedom to be conceded by. all Great Powers,providing the right to pick up and set down traffic between two foreign territories.Concession of the Fifth Freedom would be subject to thefollowing safeguards : (i) It would apply only to through services.(ii) Fares for  intermediate  journeys on  through services must be higher than those on parallel local services.(iii) Such fares and other conditions to-be determined and enforced by international machinery.(iv) There should be a trial period of three years, after whichthe Executive Agreement could be revoked at six months&apos;notice.The conclusion of an Executive Agreement on these principleswould be subject to an assurance that it would be adhered to by all nations in the same way as a Multilateral Convention.The Lord Privy Seal said that the recommendations of theSpecial Committee were unanimous, and were substantially in line with those received from Lord Swinton. Certain supplementarysafeguards for the Fifth Freedom had, however, been suggested bythe Special Committee, while they had not thought it necessary, as recommended by Lord Swinton, to exempt the metropolitan terri-tory of the United Kingdom from the grant of the Fifth Freedom.In respect of Australia and nations in the Eastern Zone, theperiod of three years referred to in (&amp;) above would run from theend of the Japanese war, and not from the end of the war withGermany.On the suggestion of the Paymaster-General he proposed toadvise Lord Swinton that &quot; Great Powers,&quot; for the purpose of(c) above, must include all European Powers.The Lord Privy Seal invited the War Cabinet, on theunderstanding that the Final Act would not be completed untilsatisfactory replies had been received from the Colonies consulted,to inform Lord Swinton that he was authorised to accept an executive Agreement on the terms proposed in W.P. (44) 654.The War Cabinet-Approved the Lord Privy seal&apos;s proposals and invited himto proceed accordingly.[28736-1;(6) The position should be explained to the United StatesGovernment by a Memorandum, which should be sent to washington by air mail.The War Cabinet Approved the above line of action.
Exchange ofPrisoners ofWar withIsolatedJapaneseGarrisons.(previous reference:W.M.(44)98thConclusions,Minute 4.)X &quot;3. On the. 28th July the War Cabinet had considered proposals by the United States Government for an exchange of Japanesesoldiers in the Central Pacific against a corresponding number of japanese-held United States prisoners of war.The War Cabinet had felt that this was - a very one-sidedarrangement, and had asked the United States Government to agreeinstead that Japanese garrisons in the Central and South-west pacific area should all be treated as exchangeable for British, UnitedStates and Netherlands prisoners of war on an equitable basis.The War Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 650), to whichwas attached a letter from the United States Embassy. This statedthat the United States Chiefs of Staff now &apos;(i) agreed to include British and Netherlands prisoners ofwar in the exchange;(ii) gave good reasons for confining the exchange to theCentral Pacific area; but(iii) did not agree to repatriation on a proportionate basis.The United States Government asked for a very early reply.The Prime Minister thought that we should accept the arrange-ment proposed, but that in doing so we should make it clear that wehad hoped that a proportionate arrangement might have been.established, as being more consistent with a fair sharing&apos;betweenAllies of the hazards of war.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed out thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the last paragraph ofhis memorandum, proposed that our reply should state that, whilethe United Kingdom Government was consulting the Dominionsand the Government of India, in the short time available we had notlearnt their views; and that the reply therefore represented theviews of the United Kingdom Government only, and was subject to modification in the light of the exchange of views with the Govern-ments of India and the Dominions.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs feared that a reply on these lines would create an unfortunate precedent, since, on occasion we had had to take exception to replies being sent byDominion Governments to the United States Government without prior consultation with us.It was pointed out that the United States Government had decided that, in any event, they would send the amended planforthwith to the Japanese Government through the Swiss Govern-ment, and there was therefore no reason why our full reply shouldnot be delayed.The War Cabinet accordingly decided as follows : (1) An immediate reply should be sent to the United StatesGovernment to the effect that we were grateful to themfor having amended their plan on the lines proposed;that we were consulting the Governments of theDominions and India, and would send a reply as soon aswe had heard from them; and that in the meantime, weoffered no objection to the United States Governmentproceeding with the amended plan on the lines proposed.(2) When the reply from the Governments of the Dominionsand India had been received, a full reply would be sentwhich would incorporate a statement on the lines proposed by the Prime Minister at &quot; X.&quot;
Prisonersof War.BritishPrisonersin Siam.(previous reference:4. At their meeting on the previous day the War Cabinet haddeferred a decision on the memorandum on this subject by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 646), but had agreed that thematter should again be brought up for discussion when the views ofthe Australian Government had been received.The War Cabinet were informed that the Australian Govern-ment now proposed to publish their statement on the followingW.M. (44) 150th day, the 17th November.Conclusions,Minute 2.)The Secretary of State for War accordingly proposed that thestatement appended to his memorandum as Appendix D shouldlikewise be made on the following day.In discussion some regret was expressed that more attentiondid not seem to have been paid to the views of the United StatesGovernment, who, according to a telegram of the 11th Novemberfrom our Ambassador in Washington, viewed the proposed state-ment at the present time with some concern as they feared that itmight adversely affect the hoped-for exchange of nationals. Thequestion was raised whether, even at this late stage, an attempt should not be made to get the Australian Government to postponemaking their statement, so that further consideration could be givenby them and ourselves to the views of the United States Government.The War Cabinet was informed, however, that on the14th November a letter had been sent by the Foreign Office to theUnited States Embassy informing them that it was proposed to makethe statement on the 17th instant. The United States Governmenthad therefore been given full warning of our intentions. Further-more, The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for foreign fairs expressed the view that publication of the proposed statement at this juncture would not in the view of the ForeignOffice have any serious effect upon the position.In the light of this information the War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for War to make on thefollowing day the statement appended as Annex D toW.P. (44) 646; and also to publish the Australian State-ment in full.Distribution 5.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the succeedingof Industry.     minute,   the  War  Cabinet  had  a  preliminary   discussion  onDistribution of Industry, having before them (i) a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(W.P. (44) 640) proposing legislation on the balanceddistribution of industry; and(ii) a memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister ofInformation. (W.P. (44) 652) making certain criticisms of the proposals in W.P. (44) 640.The President of the Board of Trade said that legislation was required to give effect to a number of proposals in Part III ofthe White Paper on Employment Policy. The principles set outin W.P. (44) 640 had been substantially agreed by the Distributionof Industry Committee. Both the Minister of Reconstruction andhe had stated that they hoped to introduce legislation in the coming session and it was clear that all parties were in favour of actionto prevent a recurrence of the problem of the distressed areas.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that it was most important that early action should be taken to ensure thatareas which were dependent on a single industry did not lapse intodepression when the war demands for the products of the heavy industries slackened, off. If this were not done during the transition from war to peace production the opportunity wouldbe lost.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the President of theBoard of Trade had not secured complete agreement to his proposals
when they were before the Distribution of Industry Committee. Inparticular, the proposals for the exercise of powers outside theDevelopment Areas and for the prohibition of the establishmentof industries in certain areas were open to question. It was, there-fore, desirable that the War Cabinet should have an opportunityof giving further consideration to the memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (W.P. (44) 640) and by the Lord Privy Sealand the Minister of Information (W.P. (44) 652) before any decision as to legislation was reached,The War Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of W.P. (44) 640 andW.P. (44) 652 at an early date.Parliament. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a note by the LordKing&apos;s President of the Council (W.P. (44) 635) covering drafts of the speeches King&apos;s Speeches on the Prorogation and Opening of parliament on the prepared by the Committee appointed by the War Cabinet on the prorogation 9th October.and The following points arose in discussion *ParHament (a) The President of the Board of Trade drew attention to(Previous tne suggested addition to paragraph 9 of the draft Speech on the reference- Opening of Parliament of the following words: &quot;You will beWM (441134th invited, to pass legislation to secure a balanced distribution of conclusions     industry, and to investigate and control restrictive practices in minute 11.) recognised that the War Cabinet would have to give furtherconsideration to the proposals which he had put forward in w.P. (44) 640 on the balanced distribution of industry and thatthey had not yet had before them his proposals with regard to the investigation and control of restrictive practices. Nevertheless, he felt that some reference should be made to legislation on these subjects in the Opening Speech. A reference in the terms which hehad suggested would not commit the Government to detailed proposals. If nothing was said, there were likely to be amendmentson the Address.The Prime. Minister said that he saw considerable difficulty in giving a definite promise to introduce legislation on subjects whichhad not yet been fully considered by the War Cabinet. Moreover,there might prove to be very little time for legislation during thecoming session.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that it would be preferable to make no reference to legislation for the investigation and control of restrictive practices and that any reference to proposals for securing the balanced distribution of industry shouldnot constitute a definite promise of legislation.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the words : &apos;&apos; They are considering the methods by which the policy for the maintenance of a high levelof employment can be implemented, especially withregard to the distribution of industry in the development areas &apos;&apos; should be inserted after the second sentence ofparagraph 6 of the draft Speech on the Opening ofParliament.(b) The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, drew attention to the statement in paragraph 7 of the draft Speech onthe Opening of Parliament that the Government intended that progress should be made with legislation arising out of the proposalsfor a comprehensive health service, an enlarged and unified schemeof national insurance, a new scheme of industrial injury insurance- and a system of family allowances. These words seemed to holdout hopes of more legislation than could be undertaken in the forth-coming session.    Could the paragraph not be redrafted so as to
specify those measures (e.g., the Family Allowances Bill) which therewas a reasonable hope of passing ?It was pointed out that the words in the first sentence ofparagraph 7 had been deliberately chosen so as not to commit theGovernment to legislation on all the topics mentioned, and that therewere objections to specifying at this stage on which subjects theGovernment intended to legislate in the coming Session.The War Cabinet (2) Agreed to insert the words &apos;&apos; as opportunity serves &apos;&apos; afterthe words &quot;My Government intend that.&quot;(c) The question was raised whether, in paragraph 8 of thedraft Opening Speech, it was wise to promise to lay beforeParliament proposals for the adjustment of local government areasin England and Wales.It was explained that, in the proceedings on the Town and country Planning Bill in the House of Lords, assurances had beengiven that this matter would be dealt with in the coming session.Moreover, discussions with the associations of local authorities had indicated that the proposals would not be controversial. Only ashort Bill was involved.The War Cabinet (3) Agreed that the reference to proposals for the adjustment of the local government areas in England and wales should stand.(d) The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, said that he doubted whether a promise should be given to introduce legislation for the regulation of wages and conditions of employment.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that his proposals on this matter had been agreed by the reconstruction committee and were about to be laid before the War Cabinet. he hoped that the War Cabinet might agree that the reference inparagraph 10 to this matter should stand, pending consideration ofhis proposals.The War Cabinet^-(4) Agreed to the suggestion made by the Minister of Labourand National Service.(e) On paragraph 11 of the draft Speech on the Opening ofParliament the Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out thathe had circulated a memorandum (W.P. (44) 643) to the WarCabinet about the Colonial Development and Welfare Bill, whichwas referred to. If agreement was not reached on the proposals inhis memorandum it might be necessary to delete this paragraph.The War Cabinet (5) Agreed that paragraph 11 should remain in the draft speech on the Opening of Parliament, pending a decisionon W.P. (44) 643.The Lord President of the Council said that since the draftshad been circulated a number of drafting amendments had beensuggested. These would be incorporated in the revised drafts whichwould be circulated to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-(6) Approved the drafts of The King&apos;s Speeches subject to thepoints made in discussion, and. agreed that the lord president of the Council should have authority to incor-porate the minor drafting amendments suggested.(The amended drafts are being circulated to the WarCabinet as W.P. (44) 663.)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,17th November, 1944.
