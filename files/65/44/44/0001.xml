The chiefs of Staff recorded the principal events of theprevious ten days.Bomber Command had dropped 13,000 tons and flown 4,000 .sorties for the loss of 39 aircraft. By day they had attacked targets in support of the land battle, railway communications and enemyairfields.   Targets by night had included Duisburg, Munich andCoblenz.United States Bombers had dropped 9,000 tons on railway centres and&apos; tactical targets on the battlefield for the loss of27 aircraft.Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 22,000 sorties forthe loss of 40 Bombers and 232 Fighters and Fighter-Bombers.During the last four days they had inflicted great damage on thespearhead of the enemy attack, on his motor transport, and his communications; 65 tanks and 2,398 other enemy vehicles were claimed to have been destroyed in addition to a great numberdamaged. There were sighs of some disorganisation in the Germansupply system.709 enemy aircraft were claimed to have been destroyed.13,000 sorties had been flown and 8,200 tons of bombs dropped,-mostly on oil targets and in the battle area.Shipping losses due to enemy action in the week ended the24th December amounted to 21,442 tons.

Six midget submarines operating in this area had been destroyed and two abandoned., The German offensive which had started on the 17th Decemberhad consisted of three thrusts. The Northern thrust had been directed through Malmedy on Liege; the second thrust throughBastogne on Dinant, and the third towards Luxemburg and ArlonThe northern, thrust had been held in the neighbourhood of Malmedyand the troops comprising it had tried to work their way westwardsand had delivered a heavy attack near Hotton. The northern flank of the enemy break-through was now securely held on a line runningfrom near Monschau to Dinant on the Meuse. On the south theAmerican Air-borne Division had held the important communica-tion centre of Bastogne, and had for some time been cut off butcontact had now been restored.Some little time must elapse before the battle was stabilised,,but the enemy must by now be feeling some anxiety about, the main-ten ance of his troops and the risk of counter-attack against theflanks of his thrust. At the outset of the attack our air forces hadbeen grounded by the weather, but Field-Marshal Montgomery had said that in the last two days the air had been of the utmost importance and had blunted the enemy thrust.During the last eight days there had been rather an -improve-ment in the military situation and we had established a secure lineof communications from the Piraeus to the centre of the city. about half of Athens was now in our hands. Detachments of our outlyingforces elsewhere in Greece had been withdrawn to Salonika andPatras. ,The Canadian Corps on the right had gained ground and captured Bagnaoavallo. &apos;&apos;The Russian advance north of Budapest had been resumed andLovice had been captured.

The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (44) 759) about the transfer ofcertain warships to Canada. The Canadian Naval Staff had suggested that two lend-lease escort carriers, which had beenmanned by Canadian personnel, should be exchanged for two of thehew light fleet carriers which would shortly be going intocommission, and that Canada should man a further flotilla of fleetdestroyers. The Admiralty were wholeheartedly in favour of bothsuggestions. The Canadian Naval Staff wished to have a firmassurance from us that the ships would be available before putting the proposal to their Government.Until the Canadian Government had been consulted it was hotpossible to say much about the financial side of the transaction.The First Lord of the-Admiralty therefore proposed that our initialoffer to the Canadian Naval Board should merely state that twolight fleet carriers and a flotilla of fleet destroyers could be madeavailable for loan to the Royal Canadian Navy. If the Naval Boardwished to acquire those ships permanently, the terms of transferwould be a matter for discussion.The First Sea Lord said that these proposals were based on discussions with the Canadian Naval Staff and that the Admiraltysaw great advantage in them. The question of terms would have tobe considered later, but the possibility that the Canadians might wish to pay for these ships need not be excluded.   ,
351 W.M. 174(44)-The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he concurred in theproposals on the understanding that they were without prejudice toany longer term arrangement.The War Cabinet Authorised the Admiralty to make an approach to theCanadian Naval Mission in this country, on the lines proposed in W.P. (44) 759. v3Ministry of Fuel      5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theand Power.     Minister of Fuel and Power (W.P. (44) 732) pointing out the(Previous       difficulties with which his,Ministry was faced in handling the post-Reference:      war problems of the fuel and power industries owing to the fact that.M. (43) 137th the Ministry had been created by an Order in Council underConclusions,    Ministers of the Crown (Emergency Appointments) Act, 1939, for minute 6.)      the purpose of exercising functions connected with the prosecution of the war, and recommending that a Bill should be preparedforthwith to create a peace-time Ministry of Fuel and Power andto give the Minister the necessary powers for the exercise of his functions both during and after the war.The Minister of Fuel and Power pointed out that a Bill forthis purpose had been included in the legislative Programme for the session, in the category of &quot; Essential Bills connected with the prosecution of the war or arising out of the conclusion of the warwith Germany &quot; (W.P. (44) 716).The Minister of Fuel and Power added that he had considered&apos;.   whether a Bill to provide for the continuance of his Ministry afterthe war should also include provision for taking over the functionsassigned to the Coal Commission, by Part II of the Coal Act, 1938,.&apos; in regard to the reduction of the number, of coal-mining under-takings, where necessary in the interests of efficiency. In fact, theCoal Commission had not exercised these functions during the last four years. He (the Minister) had suggested to the Chairman cfthe Coal Commission that, in order to avoid overlapping between thefunctions of the Coal Commission and of the Ministry in regard toreorganisation of the industry, it would be advisable that the coal commission should not take any active steps in this matter for thepresent. He thought, however, that it would be wiser not to include in the Bill to create a peace-time Ministry of Fuel and Power any provision in regard to the powers of the Coal Commission, and toleave the matter to be dealt with as part of whatever legislative proposals might be submitted to Parliament later on for dealingwith the reorganisation of the coal-mining industry.The War Cabinet         . .(1) Agreed that a Bill should be prepared and presented toParliament to extend the present Ministry of Fuel and power into peace-time on the lines proposed.(2) Agreed that this Bill should not include any provision forthe transfer to the Ministry of the powers entrusted tothe Coal Commission by Part II of the Coal Act, 1938,and that this matter should;be dealt with on the lines proposed by the Minister at &quot;X.&quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,27th December, 1944,
