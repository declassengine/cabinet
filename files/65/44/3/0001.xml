Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 130thConclusions,&apos;Minute 1.)Civil air transport.(previous reference:;W.M. (44) 129thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The War Cabinet asked the Secretary of State for Air to convey to the Commander-in-Chief, Bomber Command, theircongratulations on the successful attacks on the Dortmund-EmsCanal and on Walcheren, which had resulted in the breaching of the canal and the flooding of the enemy defences on the Island.2. The War Cabinet had a further discussion on questions inthe field of air transport, and in particular on the question of ministerial responsibility.A record of the discussion and the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Parliament.ProposedDebate onBretton WoodsAgreement.(previous reference:W.M.(44)62ndConclusions,Minute- 1.)3. Reference had been made in the House of Commons to thedate on which there should be a debate on the draft agreement whichhad been drawn up at the United Nations Monetary and financial conference at Bretton Woods.The War Cabinet agreed that the balance of advantage was against holding a debate on this matter until after the presidential election in the United States. The Chancellor of the exchequer said that this would also have the advantage that it would enableLord Keynes, who was now in America, to clear up certainambiguities in the text of the draft agreement.It was, of course, clearly understood that the Government wereuncommitted to the draft prepared at the Conference.Avoidance of 4.   The Prime Minister said that at this stage&apos; of the war itWaste. was very important to make sure that man-power and resources didnot continue to be locked up in enterprises which could now bewound up or greatly reduced in scale. This called for an attitudeof constant vigilance on the part of all Ministers, and particularlyperhaps the Ministers in charge of Service or Supply Departments.He gave as an instance the development of a particular typeof tank (C.D.L. tanks) which had absorbed considerable man-powerand resources, but which it seemed the British High Command inFrance did not intend to use. He had made arrangements to see whether it could not be employed elsewhere. .In discussion, reference was also made to certain of the stocks which had been accumulated. The Minister of Reconstructionreferred to a reserve stock of 50,000 tons of beans. It was thoughtthat sfome of these stocks could now be liquidated or reduced andthat public interest would be served by doing this now. the liquidation of such stocks would also have an important result infreeing storage space.The War Cabinet-Took note of the discussion, and invited the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to arrange for a circular on the matter tobe issued drawing the attention of all Ministers in chargeof the relevant Departments to this matter.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,5th October, 1944.
