Considerable advance had been madein the Metz area and further to the south Mulhouse had been taken.Discussion ensued as to the probable development of thesituation, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to ascertain the views of Field-Marshal Montgomery on certain points raised.Satisfactory progress had been made on the Eighth Army Front.A satisfactory advance had been made on the Kalemyo front and Gangaw had been occupied.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.2. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat during the previous six days there had been 38 incidents fromlong-range rockets, 22 of them in the Greater London area, 12 inEssex and 2 each in Hertfordshire and Kent. The worst recordedsingle incident had occurred on the previous Saturday during themidday shopping hour, when a rocket had hit a Woolworth store atDeptford.

It was most important that theenemy should get no information as to where these rockets fell, andthe Air Ministry agreed with him in limiting the information toas few people as possible, and he did not, therefore, favour includingthis information in the Cabinet War Room Daily Summary.[28754-3] b 2Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 152nd!&apos;Conclusions,Minute 3.)
After discussion, it was agreed that the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security should deal with the matter by makingspecial arrangements to inform Ministers concerned of the location of notable incidents.channel islands.(previous reference;W.M. (44) 152ndConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the German Government had stated that theywould be prepared to permit the International Red cross committee to send medicine, soap and foodstuffs, in the form ofprisoner-of-war parcels, to the civil population of the channel islands, but that they were not willing that a representative of theInternational Red Cross Committee should land on the channel islands to supervise the distribution of the supplies. They had,however, indicated that they would be prepared to allow the distri-bution to be supervised by a representative of the local population,such as the bailiff. He pointed out that the despatch of supplies tothe Channel Islands might create certain difficulties with the dutch and Polish Governments.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security urgedthat the offer made by the German Government should be accepted.There were two Parliamentary Questions on the paper about theprovision of supplies for the Channel Islands.The First, Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that, so far as was known, the only available neutral ship which could carrysupplies to the Channel Islands was now at Lisbon and was about to take a consignment of prisoner-of-war parcels to Marseilles for distribution in Germany.The Prime Minister said that, while he agreed that supplies should be sent to the Channel Islands, it was desirable to give as little publicity as possible to the arrangements. The Home secretary and Minister of Home Security might try to have the parliamentary questions on the subject removed from the paper.The War Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toagree to the proposed arrangement for sending suppliesof medicine, soap and foodstuffs to the Channel Islandsfor the civil population in the form of prisoner-of-warparcels, notwithstanding that it might not be possibleto secure the assent of the German Government to arepresentative of the International Red Cross Committeelanding on the Island in order to supervise the distribu-tion of these supplies.(2) Invited the Minister of War Transport to consider what arrangements could be made to convey these supplies tothe Channel Islands.A decision should be reached on the following dayas to whether the neutral ship referred to at &quot; X&quot;would be required for this purpose. Every endeavourshould be made not to interfere with the arrangementsfor the conveyance of prisoner-of-war parcels for distribution in Germany.Parliament. 4.   The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the debate on the    Debate on the Address and-Address.  &apos; Agreed that the Prime Minister should speak on the29th November; that no Government spokesman shouldtake part in the Debate on the 30th November (unless some special circumstances rendered this necessary); and thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should wind upon the 1st December.
5. The Secretary of State for War said that, in order to ensure a more effective deterrent against desertion, he was anxious that anannouncement should be made that there would be no amnesty fordeserters at the end of the war.He also proposed that service prior to desertion should not count for purposes of the Governments release plans. The repre-sentatives of his two Service colleagues and of the Minister ofLabour on the McCorquodale Committee were willing that such a rule should apply to all deserters after the date of the publicationof the release scheme, but he (the Secretary of State for War)thought it should apply to all deserters back to 1939.In discussion, the Prime Minister expressed himself as infavour of the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposals.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of Statefor Air asked for an opportunity of considering the point at issue,which had not previously been brought to their notice.The War Cabinet-Asked the Minister of Labour and National Service toarrange a meeting at which the matter could be examined in consultation with his Service colleagues, so far as concerned the Governments release plans, a report beingmade to the War Cabinet.6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (44) 668) about Post-WarFinance for Industry.The Memorandum recalled that the Steering Committee intheir report on Post-War Employment had drawn attention in an appendix (which was reprinted with the Memorandum) to the needfor the provision of special financial arrangements to assist smallindustrial firms, including farmers, and also major schemes ofindustrial reorganisation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that he had now received a letter from the Governor of the Bank of Englandinforming him that, as a result of discussion with the appropriateinterests, he was now in a position to make the following two proposals : (i) Company &quot;A,&quot; to provide capital for small businesses,would be created by the Clearing Banks with a capital of  10 to  15 million and with borrowing powers oftwice that figure. The Bank of England would con-tribute part of the capital, but neither that Bank northe Clearing Banks would control the Company,(ii) Company &apos;&quot;B,&quot; to provide finance for industrial reorganisation -satioh, would be financed mainly by Investment Trustsand Insurance Companies, the Bank of England takingan important participation. The capital proposed was 20 to  30 million, with&apos; borrowing powers of three times that figure.These proposals had been discussed at the reconstruction committee, which had welcomed both plans.In discussion, some doubt was expressed as to whether theseproposals were such as required, or indeed could appropriately besubmitted, for the approval of the War Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the schemes were of such a nature that he would expect to be consulted on them bythe Governor of the Bank of England. He agreed that he could have dealt with them without coming to the War Cabinet. In view,however, of the general interest which had been expressed in thesematters,- he had thought it right to bring them to the attention ofthe War Cabinet.
The view was also expressed that the present scheme seemedto be analogous to the Bankers&apos; Industrial Development Company,and that the policy of that Company in the years before the war had not always been wise.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the present schemefor the finance of industrial reorganisation had been devised onsomewhat different lines. It was contemplated that the activities ofthe Companies concerned would at all times be fully correlated toGovernment policy in the national interest.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Chancellor of the Exchequers MemJKrandum (W.P. (44) 668).(2) Noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed todeal with this matter on his own authority on the lines set out in his Memorandum.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,21th November, 1944.
