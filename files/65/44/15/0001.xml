Parliament.electoral reform.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 94thConclusions,Minute 2.)Reform of the franchise.1. The War Cabinet had before them, a joint memorandumby the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and theSecretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (44) 591) dealing with therecommendations of the Speakers Conference on the subject of (i) reform of the franchise; and(ii) conduct and costs of Parliamentary elections and expensesfalling on candidates and Members of Parliament.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security recalled that at their meeting on the 20th July the War Cabinet had agreedthat the proposals of the Speaker&apos;s Conference on the subject ofthe reform of the franchise should be left over until the final report of the Conference had been received. This report had nowbeen received and it was necessary to consider what legislation was required to carry out the recommendations of the Conference. Itwas proposed that the recommendations of the Conference withregard to the assimilation of the Parliamentary and local govern-ment franchise should be dealt with in legislation dealing with the renewal of local elections, and that the remaining recommendations should be included in a separate Bill.The War Cabinet considered first the recommendations relatingto the reform of the franchise.Business Premises Franchise.It was explained that under the existing law a husband orwife was entitled to a business premises&apos; vote by virtue of the busi-ness premises qualification of his or her spouse. The conference had recommended that this right should be withdrawn; with a consequent reduction of about 140,000 in the present business premises electorate of some 345,000 in England and Wales.The War Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal to remove the right of a husbandor wife to the business premises franchise by virtue ofthe qualification of his or her spouse.-University Franchise Registration Fees.The Conference had recommended that the registration feewhich university electors had to pay should be abolished. If thecharge were transferred to the universities, it would probably merelyresult in an increase in graduation fees. It was accordingly proposed that the cost should be borne by the Treasury.The War Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the university franchise registration fee shouldbe abolished and that the cost of registration, accordingto an approved scale, should be borne by the Treasury.Double Registration.The Conference had recommended that no person should beentitled to be registered in respect of more than one residence ormore than one business qualification if this were administrativelypracticable. There were administrative difficulties in effecting thisreform and it was proposed not to adopt the recommendation.The War Cabinet-(3) Agreed that the recommendation of the Conference with-      regard to double registration should not be accepted.[28618-2] ,  b 2
Conduct and costs ofParliamentaryelections andexpensesfalling oncandidatesand Membersof Parliament.. The War Cabinet then considered the recommendations relatingto the conduct and costs of Parliamentary elections and expensesfalling on candidates and Members of Parliament.Legal Maximum of Candidates&apos; Expenses.The existing maximum rate was Qd. for each elector in a countyconstituency and 5d. for each elector in a borough constituency,The Conference had recommended that the new maximum shouldbe a basic figure of  450, with an allowance of l\d. for each electorin a county constituency and of Id. for each elector in a boroughconstituency.It was pointed out that the adoption of this proposal might mean a very considerable reduction in the legal maximum in certainconstituencies and might give rise to difficulties in sparsely popu-lated county areas, where candidates might be unable to present their views properly to the electorate. The difficulties would be aggravated if the recommendation of the Conference, that agents&apos;fees should be included in the legal maximum, were adopted.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the issue of pollcards by returning officers would effect a saving in candidates&apos;expenses, and that a reduction of the maximum would make it easier for candidates to obtain voluntary help. There was alwaysa tendency for candidates to be forced to spend virtually up tothe maximum, and if the maximum were reduced it was probablethat there would be some reduction in the charges made to candidates.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security suggestedthat the Bill, as introduced, should be based on the recommendationof the Conference but that, if it were found that the House fely strongly that the maximum should be higher, the Government shouldbe prepared to reconsider the matter.The War Cabinet-(4) Approved the course proposed by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security.A gents&apos; Fees.The Conference had recommended that agents&apos; fees should beincluded in the legal maximum of election expenses. It was urgedin discussion that this recommendation would bear hardly on candi-dates who employed agents, particularly in view of the decisionto reduce the legal maximum of candidates&apos; expenses. The normalagenfs fee was 100 guineas and it was suggested that a paymentof up to 50 guineas to an agent might be excluded in reckoning the candidate&apos;s expenses.The War Cabinet-(5). Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to consider the possibility of excluding from the legalmaximum of election expenses any payment up to50 guineas in the form of agents&apos; fees.Issue of Poll Cards.The Conference had recommended that poll cards should beissued by returning officers instead of, as at present, independentlyby each candidate. This reform would impose a heavy burden onregistration officers in theTmmediate future and it was proposedthat it should not come into force until a date to be appointed byOrder. It was hoped that the appointed day would be fixed beforethe date of the next General Election.The War Cabinet-(6) Approved the proposal that poll cards should be issued bjreturning officers.
Lodging of Nomination Papers.The Conference had recommended that it should be lawful tolodge nomination papers at any time between the issue of the writand nomination day.It was urged that the acceptance of this recommendation would do away, for no very good reason, with the ceremony of the nomina-tion of the candidates.On the other hand, it was pointed out that under the present law the period during which nominations could be lodged was very limited and there was a risk that an accident or unavoidable errormight deprive a candidate of the opportunity of contesting theelection.The War Cabinet-(7) Agreed that the recommendation of the Conference withregard to the lodging of nomination papers should beadopted on the understanding that if there wereopposition to it in the House it would be reconsidered.Return of Deposits.The Conference had recommended that where there were morethan three candidates (or, in a double member constituency, morethan six) the deposit should. be returned if the candidates polledmore than one-tenth of the votes. In other cases the law should remain as at present, viz., the deposit would be returned if the candidate polled one-eighth of the votes.Although the Conference had not dealt with the points, it was proposed to take the opportunity in the Bill to remove certain legalobscurities with regard to the return of deposits where electedcandidates died or were raised to the peerage prior to takingthe oath.It was pointed out that if the provisions with regard to theforfeiture of deposits were relaxed too far, there was a danger thatfreak candidates would be encouraged. The proposed relaxation,however, appeared to be justified.The War Cabinet-(8) Agreed that in cases where there were more than threecandidates (or, in a double member constituency, morethan six) the deposit should be returned if the candidatepolled more than one-tenth of the votes.(9) Took note that the proposed Bill would remove certainlegal obscurities with regard to the return of deposits. where candidates died or were raised to the peerageprior to taking the oath.Hours of Poll.The Conference had proposed that the hours of poll should bestandardised from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Under the present law thehours were from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., but could be extended by an extrahour in the morning and in the evening on the application of anycandidate. Since it was open to any candidate to secure an extensionof the hours where this was desirable, it seemed unnecessary toaccept the recommendation.The War Cabinet-(10) Agreed that the recommendation of the Conference withregard to the hours of poll should not be accepted.A bsent Voting by Persons Physically Incapacitated.The Conference had recommended that a registration officers should be authorised to place an elector on the absent voters&apos; list,if he was satisfied that the elector was&quot; unlikely to be able to vote in person because of physical incapacity. It seemed unreasonable,however, to impose on registration officers this duty of assessing the physical incapacity of. electors.
The War Cabinet-(11) Agreed that registration officers should be required toplace on the absent voters&apos; list any elector whoproduced a medical certificate to the effect that on thegrounds of physical incapacity he was unlikely to beable to vote at a forthcoming election.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security explainedthat in the final report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference it had beensuggested that a Committee, with which the Chief Party Agentsshould be associated, should be constituted to undertake an examination of certain detailed suggestions for the amendment ofthe electoral law which had been brought to the notice of the Con-ference and which were set out in the Appendix to W.P. (44) 591.It was proposed to set up a Committee for the purpose with thefollowing terms of reference :  &quot; To examine the existing law relating to the conductof Parliamentary and local government elections, withparticular reference to the provisions of the Ballot Act, 1872,and the law relating to corrupt and illegal practices; and toconsider in what aspects it would be desirable that the law relating to the above matters should be amended so as to render it more appropriate to modern conditions and to make recommendations thereon.&quot;Under their terms of reference the Committee would also beable to examine certain recommendations of the Conference which did not appear to be in a form suitable for immediate legislation.These recommendations were set forth in sub-paragraphs (a) to (/)of paragraph 6 of W.P. (44) 591.The War Cabinet-(12) Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Secretary of State for Scotland toappoint a Committee on the lines proposed.local elections.Assimilationof LocalGovernmentandParliamentaryFranchise&apos;.2. The War Cabinet had before them a joint memorandumby the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and theSecretary of State for Scotland (W.P. (44) 588) regarding (i) the assimilation of the local government franchise with theParliamentary franchise, and(ii) the revival of local elections.It was explained that the Speaker&apos;s Conference had unanimously recommended that the local government franchise,which had hitherto been confined in general to ratepayers, shouldbe based on the same qualifications as the Parliamentary franchise.The distinction between residents who paid rates directly and sowere entitled to the local government franchise and other residentswho had no local government vote because they paid rates indirectlywas unreal and would have the effect of debarring many ex-service-men from voting at local government elections when they firstreturned from service. It was accordingly proposed that therecommendation for the assimilation of the two franchises shouldbe adopted.The adoption of this recommendation in an unqualified formraised certain difficulties, particularly in Scotland where, owingto the division of rates between owners and occupiers, persons whoowned property in an area other than that in which they residedwere entitled to vote in that area as ratepayers. It&apos; would bedifficult to withdraw this right and, if a concession was made tothe absentee-owner in Scotland, it would be necessary to extendit to the occupiers of properties in more than one electoral areaboth in Scotland and in England and Wales. It was accordingly suggested that in assimilating the franchise, provision should be
Bevival ofLocalElections.185W.M. 144 r44).made for the inclusion of the occupier in England, Wales and scotland (and, in addition, the non-resident owner in Scotland) inthe register for the purpose of local government elections, providedthat he made claim and satisfied the requirements for registrationas a local government elector.The assimilation of the franchises would also give rise to aquestion with regard to service voters. At present service votersnormally voted at Parliamentary elections by proxy, althoughvoters in the United Kingdom at the time of the election mightvote by post or, if they happened to be stationed in the constituencyat the time of the poll, in person. Postal and proxy voting had never been operated for local elections and the application of either system to such elections would give rise to serious difficulties.It was accordingly suggested that no provision should be made for service&quot; voters at local elections. If, however, the matter was pressed in Parliament, the Government might make a concessionproviding for proxy facilities.The proposals in W.P. (44) 588 relating to the revival of local elections were not based on recommendations of the Speaker&apos;conference. It was, however, desirable to pass legislation on thesubject of local elections before the end of the year. It would be politically difficult to continue the legislation passed in 1939suspending local elections, and, if this legislation were merelyallowed to lapse, the result would be that local elections for county and district councils in England and Wales would have to be heldin the spring of 1945 on the 1939 register.&apos; The War Cabinet-Agreed that before further consideration was given to theproposals in W.P. (44) 588 the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland should discuss them with the Lord privy seal and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The Horse- 3.
