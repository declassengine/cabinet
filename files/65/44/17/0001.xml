Attack on lord Moyne.1. The Prime Minister said that he deeply regretted to informthe War Cabinet that an attack had been made at 1-15 p.m. that day upon Lord Moyne as he was alighting from his car at his houseat Zamalek in Cairo. Lord Moyne had been seriously wounded andhis condition was reported to be grave. The attack had been carriedout by two assailants who had since been captured.&apos; The description of these assailants would be consistent with their being members ofIrgun Zwai Leumi.(Previous The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that Irgun ZwaiReference: Leumi was a secret Jewish organisation. It had no affiliation with.M. (44) 134th the Jewish Agency. In his opinion, however, if the Jewish AgencyConclusions, was determined to put down terrorist acts of this kind it could doMinute 7.) so, but only at the risk of serious conflict between the Jewishorganisations in Palestine. He thought that the attack on LordMoyne might be connected with the action approved by the WarCabinet in deporting certain detainees to locations outside Palestine.Although the attack on Lord Moyne had taken place in Cairo,the Secretary of State for the Colonies suggested that he shouldX&quot; I ask Lord Gort whether there were, in his view, any further measures which could be taken in Palestine to suppress the activitiesof the terrorist gang.The Prime Minister suggested that the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should see Dr. Weizmann and impress upon him thatit was encumbent on the Jewish Agency to do all in their power-to suppress these terrorist activities.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should communicate with Lord Gort as suggested at &quot; X &quot; above,and that he should also speak to Dr. Weizmann on thelines proposed by the Prime Minister.India.         ; 2.   The Prime Minister drew attention to a statement in theFinancial Press to the effect that the Viceroy&apos;s Reconstruction Committee in questions. their Second Report on Post-War Planning expected that some(Previous  775 million would be available for schemes during the first fiveReference: post-war years, half from Central Revenue Surpluses and half from.Mi.(44)102ridloans.   He hoped that this statement did not in any way prejudgeConclusions, the ultimate settlement in regard to India&apos;s sterling balances, the minute 2.) continued growth of which caused him increasing anxiety.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this issue was notinvolved; and that the statement in the Press referred to the budgetary problem with which the Government of India would be faced if its Reconstruction Committee&apos;s proposals were accepted.He thought, however, that there ought to be a reduction in India&apos;scurrent expenditure, and he hoped that the issues concerned mightbe considered by the War Cabinet at an early date.The War Cabinet 1.Took note of these statements.3.   The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Bomber Command and United States Heavy Bombers hadNaval, Militaryand air operations. ^_________(Previous dropped a record total of nearly 32,000 tons of bombs during the reference: . previous week; the total of Bomber Command being just overW.M.(44)142nd21,000 tons, and that of United States Heavy Bombers just overConclusions, 10,000 tons.

These mines had resulted in 476 enemy ships being sunk and 394 being damaged.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 13,500 sorties,attacking bridges and communications on the northern part ofthe front. Some 380 enemy vehicles were claimed to have been destroyed. Allied losses amounted to 6 bombers and 83 fighters and fighter-bombers as against 286 enemy aircraft destroyed.Shipping losses from enemy action during the month ofOctober amounted to 11,688 tons, the lowest total for any month ofthe war. There had been no confirmed losses from enemy actionduring November.A number of small-craft actions had taken place off the dutch coast which had resulted in enemy vessels being either sunk or damaged.The Warsfite and two monitors had bombarded enemy batterieson Walcheren Island.The Prime Minister said that, although our forces had sufferedheavy casualties in the recent attack on Walcharen Island, this hadbeen a glorious episode.When speaking at the Mansion House on the followingThursday he proposed to give some account of this fight and wouldbe glad if the Chiefs of Staff would jointly supply him with thenecessary information.The First Sea Lord, continuing, said that two out of the fivepetrol and oil pipelines across the Channel to the Continent were now delivering some 100,000 gallons a day.The Prime Minister said that Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd deserved thefullest credit for the success of this scheme which owed much tohis tenacity.A considerable advance had been made on a 100-mile front andour line was now on the Maas. Walcheren was not yet entirelyclear. The remnant of the German forces at Knocke had beeneliminated. The Scheldt had now been opened up and our salientleading up to Arnhem greatly widened and strengthened.There had not been much progress owing to exceptionally bad weather.During the last month a substantial advance had been made towards Bhamo from which the Japanese showed signs of retiring.Russian &quot;attempts to work into the Latvian salient had so farnot had Much success. In East Prussia the Russians had been held,and the Germans had counter-attacked heavily at Goldap. north of Warsaw the Germans claimed to have held Russian attacks. Inthe South substantial Russian progress had been made in Hungary,south of Budapest, though there was no confirmation as yet thatthey were in that city.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Attacks by 4.

A substantial number of flying bombs bad crossed the coastover a southern area from which gun defence had now been removed.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security asked that the replacement of these defences should be considered. The Chief ofthe Air Staff said that this matter was already under investigation.The total casualties for the week had been : Seriously   slightly killed.    Injured.    Injured.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theEuropean        War Cabinet that the working of the European Advisory Commis-Advisory        sion had been discussed at Moscow when certain memorandaCommission.    containing suggestions designed to improve Russian co-operationwith the Commission had been given to the Soviet Government.  TheRussian Ambassador had that afternoon informed him that theSoviet Government accepted in full all the suggestions we had put to them, including one for a large increase in the Russian staff.  TheSoviet Government now favoured the addition of France as apermanent member of the European Advisory Commission, and he proposed to take this matter up accordingly with the United StatesGovernment.Poland.(previous reference:The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of the detailed arrangements contemplated in connection with the proposed visit to France of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and himself.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the latest information as regards the Russo-Polish situa-tion.   A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;sW.M.

(44) 117thConclusions,Minute 11, andW.M. (44) 115thConclusions,Minute 3.)The Prime Minister said that it was proposed that a delegation from the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party should go to Paris to carry their greetings to the Social Democratic Partyin France. The question had also been raised whether the Parlia-mentary Secretary to the Ministry of War Transport should go asa member of this delegation.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet *Agreed that there was no reason why a delegation fromthe Labour Party should not go to Paris, but that on balance it was not desirable that a Minister should go asa member of the delegation.
Greece. g.   The Clvancellor of the Exchequer informed the War CabinetFinancial Aid. 0i&apos; the latest developments in connection with the arrangements to.be made for financial aid to Greece. The Greek currency situation was critical. It had been under investigation by Sir David Waleyand the Financial Advisers of the Greek Government. A newcurrency was to be introduced on the 10th November and any action,for its support must be taken at once. The difficulties were as muchpsychological as economic. If confidence could be restored and thespeculators frightened, all might be well. Supplies were coming in and the Greek Government was doing its best to hold the position.The Greek Government proposed a new drachma at the rate ofexchange of 400 drachmae to the pound. The question was how theGreek Government should be assisted to find the requisite backing&apos;for the proposed currency. Without such backing Sir David Waleyand the Financial Advisers felt that such chances as there mightbe of saving the situation might be lost, and if the economic situationcollapsed, it was likely that the political situation would do thesame. The most effective help we could give would be the cancellation-tion of the Greek War Debt of  46 million to this country. Wehad no hope of securing repayment of it, and it was arguable thatit would never have arisen if, at the time when it was contracted,the principle of reciprocal aid had been established. There wasthe precedent of the cancellation of the French and the Polish Debts,and we had also treated the Italians with great liberality.In the ensuing discussion the following points were taken : -(a) The effect on the lend-lease negotiations with the UnitedStates of any unjustified liberality on our part to the Greeks orother debtor countries might be serious. Even though there mightbe little prospect of the Greeks in fact repaying their debt, were&apos;we wise at this stage to wipe it out altogether ? Should it not beheld as a book debt, to be dealt with perhaps as part of a widersettlement, after the war ?(&amp;) Given our financial, embarrassments, ought we not to ask the United States Government to provide the requisite backing, forthe Greek currency ? The answer to this was that it was contraryto general policy to ask the United States Government to take ashare in the burdens in Greece, which was regarded as in our sphere.On the other hand, it was suggested that the cancellation of the debtwas unlikely to be misunderstood by the United States government as they had been kept in close touch with all proposals.(c) It was not clear whether cancellation of the debt had beenasked for by the Greeks themselves.(d) The total Greek pre-war currency had been  17 million.Was there any reason why the Greek Government, who had 45 million to their credit (including  20 million in gold) shouldnot themselves operate on that credit for the purpose of backingtheir currency, without bringing in His Majesty&apos;s Government?(e) In reply to this, it was stated that the Greek funds inquestion were not under our control, or hypothecated against theGreek debt to this country. But &amp; question of confidence was involved; and if it was felt that the funds in question might haveto be withdrawn in order to meet the Greek debt to His Majesty&apos;s. Government, public confidence in these funds, as a backing to the..... new Greek currency, would be lacking.(/) Was there not a risk that if. the new drachma was to beconvertible into B.M.A. notes, the latter would be hoarded ? It wasagreed that this risk existed, but that it was not one which couldbe avoided. i(g) It was also explained that, to the extent that B.M.A. noteswere issued, sterling would be put into a suspense account andcharged, in order to cover our responsibilities, for the ultimateredemption of the B.M.A. notes.The view of the War Cabinet was that, while it was inadvisable to cancel the Greek debt of  46 million to His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment at this juncture, we should agree that the  45 million of funds
and gold held by the Greeks should be regarded as free of any claim in respect of that debt, in order that it might be used asbacking for the new Greek currency.The War Cabinet accordingly authorised the Chancellor of theExchequer to arrange for the despatch of a telegram on thefollowing basis : (1) The proposal that the new drachma should be convertibleinto sterling for all purposes could not be accepted.(2) Sir David Waiey&apos;s recommendation should be accepted thatthe new drachma should be convertible into B.M.A. notes,provided that the necessary equivalent sterling was definitely set aside by the Greeks in a suspense accountunder our control against any B.M.A. notes handed overto the Greeks under this arrangement.(3) Given our own position vis-a-vis the Americans and theunlikelihood that the cancellation of the 1940 Greek&quot; Debt to His Majesty&apos;s Government would make any practical difference (since it was probably the commonassumption that, in any case, we should never be repaid),we should inform the Greeks at the right moment thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to regardtheir present sterling and gold in London, amounting to 45 million, as entirely free of any claim by them inrespect of the Debt of  46 million owing to HisMajesty&apos;s Government by the Greek Government, thusenabling the Greek Government to emphasise publiclythe very substantial backing behind the proposed newcurrency.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,6th November, 1944.
