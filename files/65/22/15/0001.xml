MINUTE 3.Confidential Annex.(21st April, 1941 - 5. 0.  p.m. )HE BALKANSND THE MIDDLEAST.aval andilitaryOperations.ibya.reece.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War cabinet of a Naval operation which,  it had been intended shouldtake place at dawn that day.    No reports had yet beenreceived.There was no special news from the western desert front.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF read to the War Cabinet a personal and most secret, telegram,dated that day, from General Wavell (No. 22 51 )t     this telegram reported the position of General Blarney&apos;s Corpsas follows:-The Nev/ Zealand Division had one battalion cut offin the Vale &quot;of Ternpe, but was otherwise practicallyintact except for the loss of a number of anti-tank guns. -The 6th Australian Division had lost two battalionsNorth of Larissa during the retreat.    Two otherbattalions were reduced to fifty per cent or less of strength, having suffered severe losses in theearlier fighting.    A large proportion of anti-tank guns had been lost.    The remainder of the division was in good shape.    General Blarney&apos;s Corps had nowwithdrawn south of Lamia to the Thermopylae position.Our rear guard had not been heavily pressed theprevious evening, but contact was likely, to be resumed early that day.    Enemy air bombing had beenvery heavy and continuous throughout the retreat;though it had done comparatively little material damage it had had some moral effect.    The road and.railway between Thermopylae and Thebes had been -heavily attacked all the previous day, and Thebesstation had been set on fire.General Wavell had explained to General Blarney thesituation as regard? the Greek army and the GreekGovernment.    General Blarney was quite clear that wecould not hold the Thermopylae position indefinitelyin the circumstances, or even for very long, and thatthe only policy was early re-embarkation.THE PRIME MINISTER then read to his colleaguesAthens telegram No. 772 J dated that day.    It consisted ofa report drafted by General Wavell of a meeting of himself,General Wilson, M, Tsouderos and Sir Michael Palairet withthe King of Greece.

The main points in this telegram were asfollows:-General Wavell had asked the King of Greece whetherthe Greek Army could give effective aid to the left flank of the Thermopylae position, since without this.....the British forces could not hold the positionindefinitely;    in fact, possibly not for very longQ-The King had agreed that the time factor made itimpossible for any organised Greek forces to supportthe British left flank on the Thermopylae position before the enemy could attack;    and agreed that itwas General &quot;avell^ duty to take immediate steps for the re-embarkation of such po&apos;rtion of his army as he could0    The King had spoken with deep regreton having been the means of placing the british forces in such a position.    The need had been impressed on the King and his Ministers forabsolute secrecy,, and for all measures to be taken which would make the re-embarkation possible0The Prime Minister said that General Blarney&apos;sCorps had fought with distinction a rearguard battleagainst heavy odds   - the most depressing form of action for soldiers0    They had added one more glorious page tothe history of the Anzacsc    They had borne the mainbrunt of the fighting.; and must have inflicted serious losses on the enemy.    They could not hope to defend the Thermopylae position successfully with their left flank in the airc:    It locked as though they would shortlyhave to meet the renewed onset of three German armoureddivisions0The R0A, Fr,  in Greece were outmatched in number so if the War Cabinet had been asked to decide thecourse of action bo be taken, he thought that they wouldcertainly have&apos; decided, that the British Imperial force must be evacuated,,    That decision had already been taken at the meeting that morning of General Wavell, general wilson and Sir Michael Palairet with the King of GreeceThe War Cabinet agreed that the decision takenin Athens that morning must standsTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thoughtthat the Greeks had behaved very fairly to us and that weshould recognise this in the reply to Telegram 772 fromAthenseDiscussion followed on the preparations for re-embarkation,,    In reply to a question by Mr. Menzies, whoasked whether careful preparations had been made for thiseventuality, THE FIRST SEA LORD said that a telegram to this effect had been sent to the Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean Fleet at an earlier stage.    The Commander-in-Chief would have to decide on the practicability ofdisembarking troops in Crete, in order that the shipsmight return to the mainland and thus speed up evacuation,,

MR. MENZIES said that he assumed that concejrfcexLair attack during the critical two or three days of re-embarkation was the greatest danger.    Could additionalair support be provided during this period?THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the air officer Commanding-in-Chief would have to judge whether he could spare additional air support to cover theevacuation, in the light of the situation in Libya andthe Western Desert,THE PRIME MINISTER said that it should be made plain to the Commanders-in-Chief that the main thing wasto get the men away, and that we should not worry aboutsaving vehicles^The Prime Minister commented on the fact thathe had received no adequate situation reports from Greecereporting any of the heavy fighting of the last ten days.A short discussion followed as to the need fora statement in Parliament that week.    THE PRIME MINISTERhoped that there was no need for making any statementduring the next day or so.    In any case, public discussion in Parliament was to be deprecated at this stage.    he hoped to give a broadcast when more material was available.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that a steadyingstatement later in the week might be desirable,MR. MENZIES thought that it was most important to make it clear that the sending of forces to Greecehad been based apon overwhelming moral grounds.    Weshould keep it clearly before the public mind that itwould have been impossible for us to have deserted Greece.The War Cabinet:-Took note of these statements,,   great George Street, S.W, 1.
