(41)  51stConclusions,Minute 4.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought wemust now consider the contingency that the vichy government might take warlike action against us.    he did not think that they would declare war on us, &quot;butthat they might do everything short of that to help the Germans.    Plans should he prepared on this assumption.  Vife ought So have ready at hand some formof effective action against this eventuality.   Amongthe matters which should he considered were:&quot;-(a) The possibility of attacking Vichyand Toulon from the air,(b) Unlimited submarine warfare againstFrench shipping (unless provided withnavicerts) in certain zones, whichwould be laid down.The Prime Minister then read a telegramfrom the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (3344C of 4th June)/ in regard to the French Fleet at alexandria, asking for instructions as to the actionwhich he should take if the situation developed asthe result of our forces entering Syria,The Prime Minister thought that no action should be taken vis-a-visitors the French Fleet at alexandria until we had. marched into Syria, as there was a chance that Admiral Godefroi would come over to our side.    A reply to Admiral Cunninghamshould be drafted on these lines.The War Cabinet:-(1)   Invited the Ohieffe of Staffs toconsider What effective action we could take if the vichy government took warlike actionagainst us.(2)   Agreed that the Defence Committee(Operations) should consider, attheir Meeting that afternoon, whatinstructions should be sent to theCommander-in-Chief, mediterranean fleet, in regard to the french fleet at Alexandria.

From C. in C. Mediterranean. Date. 5.6.41.Reed 0407.Naval Cypher (I.T.T.) &quot;by W/T.Addressed Admiralty.IMMEDIATE.692.The attack on Syria is almost certain to raisequestionable situations as regards French squadron at alexandria.2.     The present situation is that the ships are evidentlyfully alert and they will not he seized without fighting withinevitable casualties to our own officers and men and the chances of preventing scuttling are slender as the ships are known to have been prepared for so doing ever since last July.3.     There seem to be two courses of action(a) Accept the situation and rush the ships with consequent bloodshed and virtual certainty that they will he scuttled.   There will also he inevitable repercussions      ashore) frommmbattle in Alexandria harbour (? if it be) held.(b) Avoiding drastic measures and extracting anagreement on considerably more (?costly) lines.4.     I consider it possible such an agreement can bereached though one cannot be certain.   The main line wouldbe reduction to care and maintenance basis, (? guided by)ammunition, and fuel.   In return crew would be repatriatedand ships returned after war and a guarantee given that ships would be destroyed if there were ever any chance of falling into enemy hands.-\5.     in order to obtain compliance it would be statedthat if not accepted all (? squadron) pay ana communication(? afloat) would be forbidden and Officers and men of any shipscuttling would be interned whereas j(? those) who agreed would go;; home.     Ships would be kept under observation and fireopened unhesitatingly at the sign of any hostile act.
