COPY No. //W.M. (41)  51st CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(19th. May, 1941, 5.0 p.m. )THE MIDDLE EAST. THE SECRETARY OF STATE   FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  said that the Germans were making a strong diplomaticTurkey, Syria      offensive against Turkey,   von Papen, knowing that and Iraq. a direct approach would fail, was warning the Turksof the unreliability of Russia as   a friend, and using the fate of Poland as a warning.   Until we hadcleared up the situation in Iraq it was difficult, tosee how we could give any strong reassurance to turkey.    The Turks were reported to be moving troops to the borders of Syria and Iraq.    They were treatingus in a frank way, and were asking what our militaryplans were in regard to Syria.   He thought that weshould respond to these inquiries on a high level.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had prepared a first outline- of his views as to the policy which weshould adopt in   regard  to Syria, and was sending acopy to the Foreign Secretary for his observations .He thought that we might give the French one last-chance of stopping the passage of the German airforce through Syria.    If they did not take thischance, we should proclaim Syria to be an independentArab State.    It was relevant that Syria was territorymandated to France by the League of Nations, andthat France had ceased to be a&quot;member of the League.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said  t hat he understoodthat- General do Gaulle had been consulted,    and was prepared for Syria to be proclaimed independent.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Chiefs of staff had discussed the Syrian situation   that moaning.In view of the need for urgent action,    they haddespatched a telegram (No. 108) to the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, asking them to make proposalsfor improvising the largest force which could be managed without prejudice to the security of theWestern Desert, with a view to a move into Syria atthe earliest possible date.   The Chiefs of Staff,in   their telegram, said that, it must be left to  theCommano.^-1. .^&apos; - j -, ^ hlef on   the spot to determine whetherthe initial action should be undertaken by Britishtroops alone, by an Anglo-French force, or by theFree French.It was pointed out that the greater part ofGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s force in this area consisted of black troops .   This would be unfortunate from thepolitical point of view vis-a-vis the Arabs.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.Great George Street, S.W*1.

ANNEX I.TELEGRAM TO COMHANDSRS-IN-CHTEF. MIDDLE EAST.Following from Chiefs of Staff No, 108 force commander s-in-Ch i ef.Reference General Wavell&apos;s No. 0/65182 of17th May to C.I.G.S. , we do not think that the Turksare double-crossing us.     Their fear of encirclementis real and in particular their communications throughIraq are of vital interest to them.     Moreover they are reported to be already moving troops to the Syrianborder.     If we are not able to act quickly from thesouth, the effect on the Turks will be unfortunate andany possibility of their acting in conjunction with uswill disappear.2. It appears from Cairo telegram No. Ih08of 19th May that atmosphere is at present favourable.It will certainly deteriorate if we do nothing, and weshould soon have the Germans in complete control of Syria with all that that entails.3. In these circumstances it appears to us that thereis no option but to improvise the largest force    that you can manage without prejudice to the security of theWestern Desert, and be prepared to move into Syria at theearliest possible date.     Whether the initial operation should be undertaken by British troops alone, as suggestedin paragraph U of General Wavell&apos;s telegram under reference, or whether it should be undertaken by an anglo-French force or even by the Free French must beleft to you.

h*       Air action on largest scale temporarily achievablewithout endangering Western Desert would encourage friendlyelements, impress local population and might enableoperations to be undertaken with smaller land forces than would otherwise be necessary.5* In addition naval action in co-oporation with any advance made would have real moral and material effect.6. Your proposals are requested.
