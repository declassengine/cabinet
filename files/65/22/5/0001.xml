Thiswas a most secret and personal telegram fromthe Prime Minister to the Foreign Secretaryto the effect that the latter&apos;s reply(Cairo telegram No. 455) would be brought before the War Cabinet that day.    Meanwhile,all preparations and movements should go forward at the utmost speed.    Two points were dominant:First, we must not take on our shouldersthe responsibility of urging the Greeksagainst their better judgment to fighta hopeless battle.Secondly, it happened that most of thetroops who would be involved at the startwould be the New Zealand Division and,after March, the   Australians.    We mustbe able to tell the Australian and NewZealand Governments that the campaignwas undertaken, not because of any commitment entered into by a british cabinet Minister in Athens, but becausethe Chief of the Imperial General staff and the Commanders-in-Chief in the middle east were convinced that there was areasonable fighting chance.So far, few facts or reasons had been suppliedwhich could be represented to these Dominionsas justifying the operation on any groundsbut noblesse oblige.    A precise militaryappreciation was indispensible.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that since the Chiefsof Staff had prepared their Appreciation dated 24thFebruary, 1941 (wcPo(420 83)* the situation had changedconsiderably.    In the view of the Chiefs of Staff, theprincipal new facts were the following:-(l)    It now appeared that Yugoslavia and Turkeyintended to keep out of the War in the Balkans.(2)   Our shipping difficulties had increased;in particular, the Suez Canal was being putout of action for considerable periods bymining from the airQ(3)   The &quot;Mandibles&quot; Operation could not be carried through before the opening of the BalkanCampaign;       .We   should   thus   have   aweak position in our rear and considerable airforces would be prevented from taking part inthe initial operations on the mainland.

We must expect mining at pyr*aeuS and Volo, J&apos;which would increase the difficulties ofdisembarkation and of maintaining supply,,The Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East had told us that they had made due allowance forthese additional difficulties in the irrecommendation that the Balkan Campaign should go forwardoThe Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle Easttook the view that we had under-estimated tyfrom one to four days the time which it wouldtake the Germans to reach the Aliakmon Line,We had not received the revised estimatewhich we had called for of the Greek ammunitior.situation,,    If the Albanian Front should &quot;break,this would be a most important fact in deciding whether the Greek Campaign could continue,,The conclusion of the whole matter was thatour Military Advisers on the spot were convinced thatthe Greek campaign would not be a hopeless venture.    TheChiefs of Staff were prepared to accept their judgmentsAccordingly they adhered to their 5)rmer opinion that the campaign should go forwardoIn reply to a question, the First Sea Lordagreed that this   opinion was based mainly on the views nthe Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East, reinforced by the replies they had sent to the searching questionsput to thempTHE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that the advice from the Commanders-in-Chiefgained greatly in value for the reason that it had notbeen given under political pressure,,    Indeed, thepolitical pressure had been in the opposite direction,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the following considerations seemed to him to be of importances&quot;(a) Vife had a fair prospect of reaching theAliakmon line in time to check the german advance,,    If so there might be a pause whilethe enemy brought up new forces,,(b) The Yugoslavs were adopting a cryptic attitude^but we need not despair entirely of theirentry into the war on our side(c) If the Anglo-Greek forces were compelled to retire from the Aliakmon line,they would beretiring down a narrowing peninsula, which contained a number of strong defensive position:(d) We should shortly have strong air forcesin Greece,      They would be outnumbered bythe enemy&apos;s air forces but the odds wouldnot be greater than they had been on many(4)(5)(6)(?)

occasions in the last few months in which wehad &quot;been able to inflict heavy punishment.(e)   Our policy had been so developed that nobodycould represent us as having forced a hopelessresistance on the Greeks.His view was that we should go forward witha good heart.MR. MENZIES said that he found himself inagreement with the Prime Minister.    Telegram Nop 623to Cairo had expressed his own views with precision.The Foreign Secretary had stated that he considered thatwe should be taking a justifiable risk.    nevertheless it was curious that,while the decision was being takenin virtue of the trust we reposed in the judgment ofour advisers in the Middle last     the Foreign Secretary,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the threeCommanders-in-Chief - the arguments with which they hadsupplied us told against, rather than in favour of,their advice.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a consideredmilitary appreciation was on the way home from Cairothat would supply the detailed arguments;   but we knew the conclusions already.    The time had now come for taking a decision.    In his view it was our duty to go forward, making the necessary communications to theDominions whose forces were to take part in the campaign.The War Cabinet:-(i) Confirmed the decision to give military assistance to Greece, and agreed that all thearrangements to this end should proceed.(ii) Invited the Prime Minister to telegraph tothe New Zealand Government informing them of the latest developments in the situation,and asking for their assent to thedecision at (i) above.(iii) Invited Mr. Menzies to telegraph to theCommonwealth Government informing them ofthe latest developments in the situation,and asking for their assent to thedecision at (i) above.The following further telegrams were read tothe War Cabinet(i)   Telegram No. 458 dated 4th March/from theForeign Secretary (in Cairo), stating that theKing of Greece, the President of &quot;file Council endGeneral papagos had asked that we should refrain from bombing operations over Roumania and bulgaria, from Greek bases, until a state of warexistedbetween Germany and Greece.    The Greekswould impose no restriction on us once germany had committed aggression against Greece,    Inthe meantime they did not wish to provoke Germanretaliation   on Greek towns or on the Anglo-Greek forces during the period of concentration.-4*r

(ii)   Telegram No0 4677from Cairo stat;*ng thatin -cne view or tne Greek Government theproper moment to break off the irrelations with Germany would be uponthe Germans first taking military actionagainst Greece.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was veryunfortunate that we should be deprived of theopportunity -(a) To bomb the Roumanian Oil Fields.(b) To bomb the German communications andso delay their advance, while ourconcentration was being effected,,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said thay if theGermans refrained for a time from bombing Greece,it was because they wished to avoid retaliation against their own advancing forces,,     He did notthink that we ought to wait until Greece wastechnically at war with Germany.     It seemed tohim that the German seizure of Bulgaria was a sufficiently flagrant offence to Justify retaliation.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that themilitary argument in favour of bombing over bulgaria and Roumania was unanswerable.     It was difficult,however, to over-ride the wishes of the Greeks, moreespecially since at present our air forces in theii&apos;country were not numerous enough to give us muchstriking power,,     The position would be altered onthe arrival of three squadrons of Wellingtons onthe 9th March.MR. MENZIES said that it was a cardinalpoint in our policy that we should not force the greeks into any position from which they would be unable to extricate themselves.     We should have gone a &quot;.ong way in that direction if we used Greekaerodromes for offensive operations, while Greecewas not yet at war with Germany,,The War cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff toconsider whether there was any wayof meeting the point raised by the lord privy Seal, neroly, that there was a risk that the initiative in bombing operations would be left to the Germans,who would therefore start such operations at the moment which suited them best. ^The War Cabinet considered a personal telegram from the Foreign Secretary to His Majesty&quot;ambassador at Ankara dated 6th March (Cairotelegram NOo 453)/stating that the Greeks were muchdistressed at the realisation that the Turks might

not, in spite of their previous undertakings, regard aGerman attack on Greece as a oasus belli.   The turkish ambassador in Athens had &quot;been unable to give the Greeksany comfort, while German propaganda was carrying ona war of nerves in Greece, alleging that she was beingdeserted by her friends.   Could not the TurkishGovernment be induced to make a declaration ofsolidarity now that Bulgaria had declared her attitude?Failing that, could not the Turkish Government beprevailed upon to take over the positions in Thrace,now to be evacuated by the seven Greek Battalions?The War cabinet took note of this telegram.Great George Street, S.W.I.,

Following for C.I.G.S. and Commanders-in-Chief from Chiefs of Staff No.64.

Begins.   Time is obviously dominating factor in Greek enterprise. The estimate that we have formed of German advance on such information as we have here is that one Armoured division and three Meterised divisions could reach Bulgar-Greek frontier by 6th March, and that in addition an infantry division could reach frontier by 11th March. This is thought to be the maximum number of troops that Germans could maintain on frontier until the weather improves normally about 15th April. Thereafter assuming weak delaying action by the Greeks in the Roupel area in order to cover withdrawal of detachments east of the Struma and inconsiderable air action by R.A.F. we estimate that Germans could have two divisions up against Veria line by about 15th 

March and a concentration of all five divisions on this line by about 22nd March.

In light of your knowledge of Greek intentions and preperation for delaying German advance do you agree with above estimate. We must know whether you now consider that allied forces will arrive Veria line in time to hold on it.

We should also like information on the following points:-

(a)Is the necessary shipping for your movements north of the Canal or is it dependent on Canal being kept open.

(b)What is the Greek munition situation?

(c)What ports of disembarkation is it intended to use?

Grateful also for fullest possible appreciation on all points raised in this telegram to enable us to present a clear picture to the War Cabinet. ?ds.

Our calculation which broadlyagrees with those of Greek General Staff based on composition of one quarter of force as follows;-   1 armoured division 2 motorised and 2infantry divisions.    Your subs this.it ion 3rd. mot or is ed for 2nd.infantry division will speed up move by 3 days provided all roadsare passable.    On other hand Military Attache&apos; Sofia reported 28thFebruary that heavy snowfall had probably blocked mountain roadsin Northern Bulgaria.    We have no confirmation that report receivedmajority of divisions which originally crossed Danube had horsedrawn transport (indicates they were infantry divisions) but we areinclined to accept this view.    We adhere to belief that at least 2infantry divisions will be employed original force if opposition onGreek frontier is anticipated.    Even assuring your composition ourtimings for rail and road movement as follows:-   By D. 8 one armoured and 2 motorised divisions.    By D. 10 one armoured and 3raotorised divisions.  By D. 11 one armoured 3 motorised and 1 infantry division.    If 1 Infantry substituted for 1 armoured above concentrationall 5 divisions completed D.   14 instead of D.11.    Our estimate abovegives optimum conditions in favour of German move.    No interferenceby air road completely cleared and snow and mud and all capable ofwithstanding heavy road movement over minimum period of 3 days.    Weshall be surprised if such optimum conditions apply in the event.The express speed of your calculation suggests possibility that yourconcentrations are at railheads Smitli, Sssenovgrad and Mastanli andthat you have not allowed for difficult movement from these railheadsto actual frontier.

Lampson (Cairo),Foreign Off ice.   7th March, 19U.   2.55 a.m.No. 623.rrrrrrrrMOST IMMEDIATE.Following from Prime Minister for Mr. Eden.MOST SECRET AND PERSONAL.1. I will bring your measured and deliberate reply to my607 contained in your V55 before Cabinet today. Meanwhile allpreparations and movements should go forward at utmost speed.2.   I am deeply impressed with steadfast attitude maintained by you and your military advisers Dill Wavell, and I presumeWilson, on the broad merits after full knowledge of local andtechnical situation and in view of the memo by the CCS.Committee.3.   Two points are dominant.   First we must not take onour shoulders responsibility of urging Greeks against theirbetter judgment to fight a hopeless battle and involve theircountry in probable speedy ruin.   If however knowing how littlewe can send at particular dates they resolve to fight to the death obviously we must as I have already said share theirordeal.   It must not he said and on your showing it cannot besaid that having so little to give, we dragged them in by over-persuasion.   I take it from your attitude and Athens telegrams89 and 90 that you are sure on this point.it-.   Second point.   It happens that most of the troops tobe devoted to this solemn duty are the New Zealand Division andafter March the Australians.   We must be able to tell theNew Zealand and Australian Governments faithfully that thishazard from which they will not shrink is undertaken, not because of any commitment entered into by a British cabinet minister at Athens and signed by C.I..G-.S., but because Dill,Wave]! and other Commanders-in-Chief*    are convinced that there isa reasonable fighting chance.   This I regard as implied by yourpositive reactions to our questioning telegrams5.   Please remember in your stresses that so far you havegiven us few facts, or reasons on their authority which can be presented to these Dominions as justifying the operation on any grounds but noblesse oblige.   A precise military appreciationis indispensable.6.   You know how our hearts are with you and your greatofficers.

At the meeting on March 4th at which the King of greece, President of the Council and General Papagos werepresent, we discussed the question of bombing the Roumanianoil targets as well as German concentrations and communications in Bulgaria.2.   Greeks made it clear that during concentration of anglo-Greek forces, unless Germany committed an act of aggression by land or air against Greece, no action shouldhe taken by the Royal Air Force from Greek bases whichmight invite retaliation on Salonica, Piraeus or Volos.This would rule out all bombing of targets in Roumania and bulgaria.3.   From the moment when Germany commits aggression against Greece there will, of course, be no restriction of bombing from Greek bases.     Selection of targets will thendepend on resources available to Air Officer Commander-in-Chief and on the progress of German concentration and advance in Bulgaria.4.   Meanwhile during the current moon period available,Wellingtons which are due in Greece on March 9th can beemployed in particular on Rhodes and on Albanian ports.Repeated-to Athens telegram No. 50.

Intention of GreekGovernment is to &quot;break off relations upon the first act of aggression against Greece by Germany.    We were assured that necessary arrangements had been made for lockingup suspicious Germans and pro-German Greeks as soon asrelations had been broken off.    Similar steps wereeffectively taken on the outbreak of war with Italy.Repeated to Athens No.  49.

Athens telegram No. 47, Belgrade telegram No. 52.Following from Secretary of State,Most Secret.Greeks are much distressed at the realisation that hasdawned upon them that if Greece is attacked Turkey may not,after all, regard this as casus belli in spite of previousundertakings.     From my own observation here I am convincedthat turkey inaction in face of a German attack on greece would have a most demoralising effect on the Greek people,and armies in the field.     Turkish Ambassador has been unableto give the Greeks any comfort and, though we have done ourbes&quot;c, our hand was too weak to &quot;olay with any real hope ofsuccess,     Meanwhile German propaganda is carrying oh nerve war against the Greeks by every possible means and, in particularsby alleging that Greece is being deserted by her friends.Hitler&apos;s message to Turkish President, and the fact that theGreek Government have not been informed of what passed, arebeing used to foment this fear.     &apos;Ve have warned&quot; the Greeks ofthis insidious German game by every means in our power but thisis not enough.2.     In so far as Turkey is-concerned, the effect ispsychologically most harmful.     The Greeks have grown to count upon Turkey and. arguments that Turkey can, in fact, do littlein a military sense unless herself attacked, are without effect.You will remember that I warned the Turkish Government of this danger.5,     The Turkish Government must [grp. undec.? make an]effort to meet the situation, which is dangerous to us all.Ynn win judge whether they can be induced to make declarationof solidarity with Greeks now that Bulgaria has declared herattitude.     This would immediately have heartening effect on the greeks and with steps we are taking, would give Yugoslaviargrp. undec. ? a] lead which might have far-reaching consequences.It is my conviction that time is ripe for such a declaration bythe Turkish Government and that by making it now they would best serve themselves, and peace, in the Balkans.4.     If the Turkish-Governjnent cannot be prevailed upon todo this, could they not at least take over positions in Thracenow to be evacuated by 7 Greek battalions (see Athens telegram.0. 72 to you).     Such action would be a [grp. undec. ? shape of]solidarity of which the Greeks sorely stand In need at thismenacing hour, and to which the Turkish Government&apos;s previous   *assurances to the Greeks clearly entitle them.i Tills-- telegreorr Is. -of particular secrecy and should be   (    51retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on!,.MENDED DISTRIBUTION.SPECIAL (EDEN - DEFEyfevjjscypher.

5.     If you see no objection I shall be glad if you couldspeak to the Turkish Government urgently in the&apos; sense of this telegram.     In any event, I hope you will make the suggestion in paragraph 4.     The Greek Government know nothing of myapproach oh this subject to the Turkish Government and Ishall prefer any Turkish move to apnear to be spontaneous.
