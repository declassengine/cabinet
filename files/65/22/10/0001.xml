(41) 55th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(3rd April, 1941, IS Noon.)THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet   thatsecret information had been received that Admiral Darlanhad obtained permission from the German armistice commission at &quot;Vies b a den to take the DUNKERQHE acrossto Toulon.   Once at Toulon, the ship would &quot;be, forall. practical purposes, in German hands.   This, ofcourse, was the exact opposite of the course which we and President Roosevelt had asked the French to adopting regard to their fleet.The question at issue was whether we should giveorders to&apos; ivo of our submarines, which were in theneighbourhood, to attack the DTTNKSROJ.TE on the wayacross.    The Admiralty were a&amp;jfious to take no actionwhich might bring the French Fleet- into the war against us.    On the whole, however, the Prime Minister favouredordering our submarines to take action.   We should not,however, adopt this course without knowing that it hadthe concurrence of President Roosevelt, to whom he had telegraphed on the previous day to ascertain his views.If we decided to take action  against this -ship,he thought that, it would not be safe to give gny&quot; warning of our intended action, since the ship would certainly be escorted by French Naval vessels.THE FIRST SEAhands so full thattake any action whithe war against us.submarines and destbe use^ with effect the DTJNKEROUE couldrepairs, as she had he thought, therefojLORD s^ir&quot; that the Navy had itsthey would be most reluctant toch might bring the French Fleet intoThe French Fleet was strong inroyers, while the STRASBOURG &apos; couldon the trade routes against us.only have been riven temporaryremained in the anchorage at Oran.re, that from three to eight months&apos;work would be necessary before she could be fullyrepaired.THE PRIME MINISTER sai^ that his personal view was that the sinking of the DUNKERQUE would not enable the Viehy Government to &quot;bring the French peopleinto the war aeralnst us.   The matter was, however, one on which we must clearly await President Roosevelt&apos;views.     He aefced his colleagues to give considerationto the matter in the meantime.The War Cabinet took note of this statement,- and agreed that a decision must be deferred, pending receipt of a reply to the message sent to PresidentRoos evelt.reat George Street, S.y.l,
