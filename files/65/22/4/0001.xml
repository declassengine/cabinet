r MOST1 SECRET. -THE BALKANS ANDTHE MIDDLE EASTFuture Military-Pol icy .(previous reference :W.M.(41) 24thConclusions,)The War Cabinet had before them the following further telegrams:-(l) Telegrams 607/and 608/from the Prime Ministerto the Foreign Secretary in Athens, despatchedafter the Meeting held the previous&quot;, night. .y(2) Telegram 314/from Athens.   This was a personal telegram from the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff to the PrimeMinister, giving estimates of:-(a) the German concentration on the frontier and the time which the Germans wouldtake to advance from the Roupel pass to the Aliakhmon position:(b) the concentration of Greek and british forces on the Aliakhmon position.(3) Telegram 326/from Athens. This telegramgave details of the decisions reached withthe Greeks at the meeting on the 4th March.(4) Telegram 327/from Sir Michael Palairet,addressed to the Secretary of State atCairo and repeated to the Foreign Office.This telegram gave Sir Michael Palairet&apos;sreaction to telegram 601 from the PrimeMinister to the Secretary of State at Cairo.(5) Telegram 33o/from Sir Michael Palairet, at athens, reporting that the King of Greecespoke with great confidence and determina-tion, and emphasised the importance of adequate air forces.(6) Telegram 343/z5:from Belgrade, reporting thefirst reactions to the message which mr Campbell had delivered to the Yugo-SlavGovernment.No reply had yet been received from the foreign secretary to telegrams 607 and 608,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the aspect of thesituation which had caused him most anxiety was lest the Greeks might feel that we had put undue pressure on.them and had persuaded then against their betterjudgment to put up. a hopeless resistance against theGermans.   It must he remembered that- it was only possible to send small forces to Greece in the timet c*(miS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY[8 GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY No. 11W.M.

available.     We should only have one infantry brigade and one Armoued   Brigade in Greece by themiddle of the month, and only one complete Divisionby the end of the month.     He did not wish us to expose ourselves to the charge that we had causedanother small nation to be sacrificed without being able to afford effective help.x D was for this reason that he hadinserted the words in Telegram 607 that &quot;wc i:ist &quot;liberate the Greeks from feeling bound to reject the German ultimatum0     If, however, the Greekswere really determined to fight knowing the limitations of the help which we could give them,then we had no choice but to carry out theagreement reached at Athens.Wo decision could be reached until theWar Cabinet had received the answer to the verysearching questions put in Telegram 607.     ThePrime Minister felt fairly confident that Mr. Edenand his military advisers would send an answer onthe same lines as Telegram No. 327 from Athens.In this telegram Sir Michael Palairet had taken the line that there was no question of &quot;liberatingthe Greeks from feeling bound to reject the ultimatum.&quot;     They had decided to fight Germany,alone if necessary, and the question was whether we would help them or abandon them.The Prime Minister also felt that the chances of success in this enterprise must be greater than would appear from Telegram 313/from athens.     It was inconceivable that the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff could have cZrp.o8.the Military Agreement with General Papagos if he regarded the chances of success in the operation ashopeless.MR. MENZIES stated that the problem had been presented in a way which made it unnecessarilydifficult.     When the War Cabinet had arrived attheir earlier decision to send military aid to greece, our military advisers in the Middle East had stated that the operation, though hazardous,offered a reasonable chance of resisting the german advance.     All the new factors brought out inrecent telegrams added to the difficulties of theoperation, and no reason was offered why theoperation should succeed.

2! 5The War Cabinet had not, he thought, been wellinformed of the facts&quot;,    and the action of theForeign Secretary regarding the military agreementbetween General Dill and General Papagos was embarrassing-rassing.   He (Mr Menzies) had had considerabledifficulty in obtaining the consent of his colleagues in Australia to the despatch of Australian troops to greece when the operation had first been proposed;but the Commonwealth Government had finally decided in favour of the operation, on his advice.   He was now in the position of having to tell his  colleagues that every new factor that had. arisen since their previous  decision told against the operation.Although it might be trixe that our position vis-a-vis the United States would be prejudiced if we did not go to the help of Greece, it must be remembered thatif we did so and rere driven out, the effect on our prestige might be   worse.There were two ways in which the situation might be presented to the Dominions.   The first wasto tell them that the proposition did not now lookas good as it had before;    but as the Greeks had decided to fight on in any case, we could not leave them in the lurch;    and that our military adviserson the spot still thought the operation had a chanceof success.   If the proposition was presented in thisway, he was confident of the reception it would receive.The second way was to say that the propositionwas a bad one, but that it must be proceeded withbecause -re had been committed by an agreement signed in Athens, which had not been referred home.    Tt mustbe remembered that the Dominions had a vital interestin this matter, as they were providing three-fifths of the forces to be used.    If they were told thatthey &quot;ere now committed to the use of their forcesin a situation which had definitely woreened,withoutfurther effective consultation, he feared that therewould be a good deal of resentment.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Chiefs of staff had that morning limited their discussions to thetime-table.   The Greek-Bulgarian frontier was 100miles from the Aliakmon line, and the Greeks proposedto delay the Germans on the frontier with a force ofthree divisions.   Our military advisers in the middle east thought that the Germans would not reach thefrontier in force until about the llth/l2th March.By this date the Greeks would have three divisions in position on the Aliakmon line, and they would be; able to get some further battalions there by the16th/7th March.   We could get one armoured brigade and a New Zealand infantry brigade to this line bythe 16th.    To sum up:    Three Greek divisions could get to the Aliakmon line in plenty of time, while it-was probable that our forces would arrive there at about the same time .as the Germans.   The German forcemight    consist of one armoured division plus threemotorised divisions, and one infantry division..In reply to a question regarding the strength ofour air forces THE CHIEF OF THE AIR&quot;STAFF said that wehad a total of loj- Fighter squadrons in the middle east. Of these, three squadrons were in Greece andone Flight in Crete.   The extent of the reinforcementswhich the A.0.C.-in-C, Middle East, would be able tosend to Greece depended on   other operations.

Air Marshal Longmore hoped to form two newfighter squadrons &quot;by the end of the;   month, and he might be able to form thai?.-earlier.     The germans had a total of 475 aircraft in Boumania of which160 were fighters and 160 bombers.     We had 5bomber squadrons in Greece.     If the Germans were to reinforce their air rCorce in Roumania, they would of course have to weaken their forces elsewhere.THE VICE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFthought that the chief weakness in the Greekposition was that they had left the Yugoslavfrontier uncovered.     He feared that the germans might push through this gap.The following further points were made in discussion:-(1) The Lord Privy Seal asked if itwould be possible to send even a token British force to strengthen the Greek resistance on theNestos-Rupel line.(2) The Lord Privy Seal also enquire whether it was necessary that weshould refrain from bombing theGerman communications until they hadbombed ours.      (See paragraph 7 of telegram 314).     This was felt to be somewhat disconcerting.(3) It was suggested that we ought to look at this operation from thepoint of view of its effect on our capacity to win the war.     Both forthe Greeks and for ourselves whatreally mattered was that we shouldwin the war.The War Cabinet were reminded that the Chiefs of Staff had expressed the opinion that if wesent military help to Greece and theoperation was unsuccessful, it wouldnot affect the ultimate issue of thewar or our successful defence of thiscountry.(4) It was also argued that if in theview of our military advisers theventure was bound to prove a failure,we owed it to the Greeks to make thisplain.     To this argument it wasreplied that the Greeks had throughoutmade it clear that they would resista German attack even if we did not goto their helpe

Summing up the discussion, THE PRIME ministers aid that no decision was called for   that evening,or* indeed, could be taken until a reply had beenreceived from the Foreign Secretary.    It would perhaps be as well, in order to avoid any risk ofdivided counsels, to send Mr Eden a telegram to makeit- clear that the War Cabinet could take no decision until a reply had been received to telegram No.607.The fact that a decision was deferred would notin any way imperil the operation, since action was proceeding and our troops were on the move;   but thefirst flight would not reach Greece until the 8thMarch.The Prime Minister said that his own view was clear, that we could not now go back on the agreementsigned hy General Dill and General Papagos, unlessthe Greeks themselves released us .The proposition in its new aspect must, ofcourse, be put to the Australian and New zealand governments.    It would, however, be better to wait until a reply had been received from the foreign secretary and the matter could be seen in betterperspective, before making these communications.The War Cabinet:-(l) Authorised the despatch of a telegram to the Foreign Secretary, at Cairo,informing him that, with reference tothe final paragraph of telegram 607,the War Cabinet would take no decision until they had received his reply tothat telegram:(2) Deferred a decision until the following day, when it was expected that theForeign Secretary&quot;s reply would havebeen received.Great George Street, S.W.1,

Following ontheir No. 54-582 CM.0.5), to which reply has not yet beenreceived, Chiefs of Staff have presented serious commentarywhich follows in my next.   Failure of Papagos to act as agreed with you on February 21st, obvious difficulty of hisextricating his army from contact in Albania and timetable ofour possible movements furnished by Wavell in his 0/k5h$l of3rd March, together with other adverse factors recited by chiefs of Staff e,g. postponement of MANDIBLES and closing ofCanal, makes it difficult for Cabinet to believe that we now have any power to avert fate of Greece unless Turkey and/orYugoslavia come in which seems most improbable.   We have done our best to promote Balkan combination against Germany.   We mustbe careful not to urge Greece against her better judgment intoa hopeless resistance alone when we have -only handfuls oftroops which can reach scene in time.   Grave Imperial issues are raised by committing New Zealand and Australian troops to an enterprise which as you say has become even more-hazardous.We are bound to lay before the Dominions Governments your 313 andChiefs of Staff appreciation.   Cannot forecast their assent tooperation.   We do not see any reasons for expecting success exceptthat of course we attach great weight to opinions of Dill andWavell,Vfe mist as indicated in my telegram No,396 to Athens liberate Greeks fromfeeling bound to reject a German ultimatum. If aa their own they resolve to fight,we must to some extent snare their ordeal.     But rapid german advance will probably prevent any appreciable British imperial forces from being engaged.Loss of Greece and Balkans by no means a major catastrophefor us provided Turkey remains honest neutral.   We could takeMANDIBLES and consider plans for INFLUX or TRIPOLI.. We are advised from, many quarters that our ignominious ejection from greece would do us more harm in Spain and Vichy than the fact ofsubmission of Balkans which with our scanty forces alone we havenever been expected to prevent.I send you this to prepare your mind for what, in the absenceof facts very different from those now before us, will probablybe expressed in Cabinet decision tomorrow.

Lampson (Cairo).Foreign Office.   6th March, 19U.   -1.20 a.m.No. 608.rrrrrrMOST IMMEDIATE.MOST SECRET.Following from Prime Minister for Mr. Eden.   Begins.Reference my immediately preceding telegram, following iscommentary of Chiefs of Staff,   Begins.The following appear to us to be the principle changesin the situation since the decision was taken to go full speedahead with the Greek enterprise.1.   Our envoys at their first interview with the King of greece and General Papagos reported that they were &quot;greatly impressed by the attitude&apos; and spirit&quot; of Papagos.   At their recent interview, they found him &quot;unaccommodating and defeatist&quot;,though he appears to have cheered up towards the end.   this change of attitude on the part of Papagos was perhaps only tobe expected, in view of the German arrival on the Greco-Bulgarfrontier and of the failure of any support from Yugoslavia orTurkey.     Nevertheless, it is bound to react unfavourably on thefighting spirit of his Army.2.   The Greeks undertook on February 21st to begin with-drawing their advance troops to the line which we shouldhave to hold if the Yugoslavs were not willing to come in,and to start work immediately on improving communications in greece to facilitate the occupation of this line.   Today (twelvedays later) we learn that no withdrawal has commenced and wegather that no work&quot; has been done.   In view of the paramount importance of the time factor, this is serious.3.   We were to have had 35 Greek Battalions to help us hold the line.   We are now told that we are to have three Greekdivisions and seven Battalions from Western Thrace but thatthese only amount to 23 battalions at most,.   With the exceptionof the 12th Division these are all newly formed and. have not yetfought.   One of the divisions can hardly have any guns, while theremainder can only have captured Italian material.   But, inaddition to the 35 battalions for which we had hoped, we had contemplated that the Greeks would be able to withdraw somedivisions from their Albanian front^   General Papagos now says that/
that this cannot be done as they are &quot;exhausted and outnumberedif.   We have always contemplated that MANDIBLES would becaptured before - or at least simultaneously with - the move to greece. .... It-now-appears that MANDIBLES cannot be undertakenuntil the movement&apos;to Greece has been complated.   This means that instead of being able to concentrate all available airforces against the German advance, considerable air operationswill have to be conducted against MANDIBLES in order to protectour lines of communication to Greece.5.   The mining of the Suez Canal has become a more acutehandicap.   It was to have been open on 3rd March, but theGermans put in ten more mines that day.   The Canal is nowcompletely closed, and on past form may not be clear until11th March.      Only half of the M.T. ships required for themovement to Greece,are North of the Canal, and all personnelships are South of it.   Even if the personnel for Greece are carried in men-of-war, the whole force cannot be dealt within this manner.THE TIME FACTOR.6.   We have estimated that one armoured and threemotorised divisions could reach the Bulgar-Greek frontier onthe 5th March, and in addition an infantry division by &apos;11th March.   We further estimate that, assuming weak delayingaction by the Greeks in the Rupel area, the Germans could havetwo division on the Alyakmon Line by about the 15th March,and concentrate the.whole five divisions there by 22nd March.7.   We are now told that General Papagos intends to fight in the Rupel area with three divisions.   Until we receive an answer to our telegram 6K we have no means of knowing how much delay will be imposed on a German advance, since much will depend on the strength of the position, the equipment and morale of the Greek troops, and on whether an effective scheme of demolition&apos;tions has been prepared and can be executed.     If the delayimposed, is short, - we should at. the best have one armoured brigade and one.New   Zealand brigade to oppose the first two German divisions on the .Alyakmon line., CONCLUSION.   .8. Our conclusion is that the -hazards of the enterprisehave considerably increased.   Nevertheless, despite our misgiving!and our recognition of a worsenings of.. the general&quot;situation weare not as yet in a&quot;position to question the military advice      .of those on the spot,, who in their latest telegram, describe theJenterprise as not by afty means; hopeless.&apos;:  Ends,Repeated to Athens No. 4-38.&quot;-     \ j:; &apos; &apos;     \[Copies sent to Members of War cabinet,    .

Military problem is essentially one of time and space.2.     Reports from Bulgaria suggest that the Germans mayarrive on the Greek frontier in sufficient strength to deliveran attack during the next six or seven days.     Rate of german advance will of course depend on the weather and the date of attack may also be affected by need of building up dumps ofsupplies and ammunition near the Greek frontier.5.     Resistance which Greek divisions can be expected toput up in prepared positions on Nestor-Rupel line should delay the Germans for some days.     There will then be further advanceof 100 miles from Rupel Pass before contact is made on Aliakmonposition.     Time required for this advance should be consider-ably increased by demolitions which Wilson will prepare as rapidly as possible.-4.     Concentration of three. Greek divisions on Aliakmonposition should be complete within five days.     The sevenbattalions from Thrace require a further five or six days tocomplete concentration, Aliakmon position itself needsconsiderable work on communications and defences.5.     Concentration of British forces on Aliakmon position will be as followsBulk of one armoured brigade and one New Zealand infantry brigade between March 16th and 19th.     Bulk of a second NewZealand infantry brigade about March 26th.   New Zealand infantry division should be complete in essential men and weapons by theend of March.     Subsequent programme is not yet arranged.6.&apos;    All possible measures are being examined to speed upthe programme including the use of Greek ships for transport ofBritish forces from Egypt.
7.     The question of bombing German communications in bulgaria was discussed yesterday with the Greeks.     Theirattitude is that to avoid retaliation no attack should bemade during concentration of Anglo-Greek forces.     Ift how-ever, Germany attacks Greece by land or air&apos;during thisconcentration bombing will begin at once.8.     Thus the margin is narrow and. the risk is considerable.Nevertheless as we stated in our telegram No. 513 March 4ththis risk appears to us the least dangerous of the threepossibilities with which v/e were faced.[Copies sent to Members of Har Cabinet]
