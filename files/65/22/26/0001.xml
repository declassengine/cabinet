MOST   SECRET.It is requested that special care may betaken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.W.M.(41) 6QTH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5,Confidential Annex.(16th June, 1941 -- 5.0 p.m.)U. S. S. R&apos;.(previous reference:W.M.(41) 59thConclusions,Minute 2.)Soviet Policyduring thelast year.Arguments fromthe Germanpoint of view in favour ofan immediateattack on russia,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said, that, since the last meeting of the War Cabinet,he had again seen M. Maisky, and had informed himwhat we would do, if hostilities broke out between russia and Germany.       This had been supplemented by further information given by Sir alexander cadogan.At the invitation of the War Cabinet sir stafford Cripps then made a statement on the present state of Soviet-German relations.Sinoe he had been Ambassador the soviet policy had been directed to maintaining peace withGermany.     Fundamentally, the Soviet were hostile to both Germany and ourselves.     Probably they regarded us as the more stable of the two, butGermany as the more dangerous from a short-term pointot view.     Within the last few weeks the Soviet hadbeen subjected to increasing pressure from Germany,while the German Army had been concentrating on russia&apos;e Western Frontier.The facts were well known in Moscow.     no attention need be paid to M. Maisky&apos;s denials inLondon.      Stalin&apos;s decision to take over the officeof Prime Minister was probably due -(i)    to the need for placing the higher command on a war basis.(ii)   to a belief that large concessions toGermany would be necessary, and thatnobody feut himself would be strong enough to make them.The general belief in well informedeircles in Moscow was that Hitler would pitch hisdemands so high that it would be impossible for theSoviet Government to accept them.       His reasons forthis might be as follows:-(a)   In a year&apos;s time his own military position was likely to be weaker and the Soviet&apos;s6 tronger.(nWTR DOCUMENT TS THE PROPERTY OF HI^ BPTTAWWTC8 MAJESTY &apos; S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.

Soviet Policyin the present emergency.MilitaryEfficiency ofthe SovietArmed Forces.(&quot;b)    If he made war on Russia now he couldcount on considerable sympathy incertain quarters in the-United.States*(c)   He might argue that his Russiancampaign would be over in time toallow him to stage an invasion of theUnited Kingdom in the autumn.Sir Stafford Cripps said that in his judgment the Soviet Government would go to considerablelengths to appease Hitler,      They were prepared tomake both economic and territorial concessions?provided always that they still retained the economicand military strength to stage a &quot;come back&quot; beforethe end of the war.     Failing that, they would fightnow.      Accordingly, any terms which included the partial disarmament of the Russian Army or Air force would, he thought, be unacceptable;    as would any economic concessions which included the surrender of Russia&apos;s granary (the Ukraine) or her main source of oil (Baku)u      The retention of Batoum and theother secondary oilfields would not make up for theloss of Baku9       The installation of German technicalcontrol in the Russian factories would not necessarily be a casus bellig      The Russian Secret Police couldalways be relied upon to eliminate outside control,if ordered to do socIt was impossible for any foreigner toestimate the military efficiency of the Russianarmed forces.     The Army was in good heart.      Itpossessed a considerable quantity of armoured fighting vehicles, but their quality was unknown.    sir stafford Cripps said that his own guess was that themilitary machine might break down owing go failureof organisation and supply.      The Russian Air force was strong numerically.      It was said to possess a formidable new fighter.     Probably the Russian staffwork would be poor.All th--&apos; young officers and young soldierswere imbued withna strong anti-German feeling.The prevailing view in diplomatic circlesin Moscow was that Russia could not hold out againstGermany for more than three or four weeks.      By theend of that time the enemy might be in Leningrad?Moscow and Kieff.      It remained to be seen whetherthe Russian Armis - on the Western Frontier would beable to maintain themselves in being, and to fallback on Siberia.      The Russia railway system remainedinefficient and the rolling stock was largely wornout.     The prospects of the Russian Army extricatingitself were therefore poor.     Nevertheless, if any considerable part of it was able to reach Siberia,it might have a good chance of holding out.    MilitarilySiberia was a   separate entity from European Russia.

They were regarded, as the most efficient of the Russian Armies.A German ultimatum to Russia was likely tohave one. at three ;?-osults.(i)    The Russians might surrender and become the vassals of Germany.(ii)    The Russians might fight a short campaign and be defeated.(iii)    They might be able to buy peace on terms which would not mean their military andeconomic subjection to Germany.0.1he thoughtshsse (i) would be the worst and (iii)for us.Russian Oil.x i.oilfield itits outputbecoming exsecondary oin a campaiBefore thatestimated aMuch of thisurplus ofa t only oneGermany obtained control of the Bakuwould not be in her power to increasegreatlyc     The oilfield was graduallyhausted;    hence the opening up ofilfieldso      The Russians were now engagedgn for building up their oil reserves,campaign began their reserves had been-c between two and three million tons,s was stored near the Volga.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had juntseen the American Charge&quot; d&apos; Affaires, who had told him how the American Ambassador in Moscow viewed the situations     His appreciation tallied very closely with that of Sir Stafford Cripps.The War Cabinet thanked Sir stafford cripps for his statement.Great George Street.-  S.-W-1
