(T^HJ? PJfflENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.MOST .SECRET -ihe balkans andIhE middle eastjjilitaryituation.It is requested that spe; ial ca-e may be Uken toensure the secrecy oi this uucu...e;ii.COPY No.W.M.&apos;(4l)  56th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.&apos;(7th April, 1941, 5 p.m.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that the situation hadundergone a serious  change since the War cabinet had last met.   He read to the War Cabinet the latesttelegram from General Wavell (0/54815)&apos;*&apos;.   general wavell reported that the position in the western desert had greatly deteriorated on&apos;the previous day,owing to the enemy moving on Me chili by the desert&apos;route, and to further vehicle losses of the 3rdArmoured Brigade, which had now little fighting valueThe state of the Indian Motor Brigade was not known.The 9th Australian Division, less one Brigade inTobruk, had been withdrawing on the previous nightto the Gazala area, west of Tobruk, and did notappear to be pressed.    A further Australian infantry brigade group and an imp3rovised armoured unit werelanding at Tobruk that day, and it was hoped to stabilise the front there.&apos;A telegram had also been received, from Mr Edensaying that the position was serious and that theGermans were advancing in greater strength and more rapidly than had been anticipated.The Prime Minister said that this deterioration inthe position was clue to our relative weakness inarmoured units,  caused by the 7th Armoured Divisionhaving been sent back to Cairo to refit.   He had not realised that this Division would be so completelyout of action.    The German forces opposed to usconsisted, of all or pa.rt of one   armoured and. twomotorised. Divisions.Tobruk was a strongly fortified place, and theGerman force which had. advanced so rapidly could hardly possess the necessary artillery to reduce it.If we could hold the advance at Tobruk, we could bewell satisfied.   But we must recognise thatthis might not be possible,,Large reinforcementshad, however, reached General Wavell in the last fortnight, and with events moving, in our fa.vourih Abyssinia it should be possible to move up units from this area in the near future,,The Prime Minister then read, to the War Cabinet atelegram?&quot; dated 2nd Ma.rch, from General Wavell, inwhich he had given a hopeful appreciation of thesituation in Cyrenaica and the scale of attack likelyto be expected from, the enemy.   The War cabinet decision regarding assistance to Greece had largelybeen founded on this appreciation.

MR. MENZIES said that he had received atelegram from his colleagues in Australia expressinganxiety about the situation.     They had stated quite clearly that he (Mr. Menzies) when asking for consent to send Australian troops to Greece, had said thatour military advisers discounted the likelihood of athrust in Oyrenaica by the enemy.     The possibilityof a German advance had been underestimated by general wavell and it had been perhaps unwise to attempt tohold Benghazi with only partly trained troops.     TheGerman advance in Cyrenaica would upset the plansmade for sending further troops to Greece.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this was so.It was also unfortunate that it would be impossibleto proceed in the near future with plans for operations against the Dodecanese which would continue to be a threatagainst our sea communications with Greece.     The lossof the NORTHERN PRINCE in the Eastern Mediterranean was serious,as the ship had contained material badly needed by the Greek powder factory.     The loss of shipping inthe Piraeus and the damage to the .pe3M^-lhrp.ugh air attack would also hamper us in sending reinforcements&quot;to Greece.     He thought we had no strategic errorwith which tc reproach ourselves, although we had nodoubt underestimated the likelihood of serious enemy attack in Cyrenaica.Discussion then followed on the position inthe Balkans.The War Cabinet were given such limitedinformation as was available regarding the dispositions of the opposing forces. Our land forces in Greece (which werenot yet in action) comprised the New Zealand Division,the 6th Australian Division and one armoured brigade.     we had occupied Lemnos with one battalion. rThe War Cabinet took note of this information.reat George Street, S.W. 1.7th April, 1941.

Position in Western Desert greatly deterioratedyesterday due to enemy moving on Meehili by desert route and further vehicle losses of 2nd Armoured Division bymechanical breakdown and air bombing.     3rd Armoured   Brigadehas little or no   fighting value and losses and state ofIndian Motor Brigade not known.2.    9th Australian Division (less one brigade in Tobruk)was   withdrawing last night to Gazala area ?/est of Totoruk,does not appear to be pressed.3.    18th Australian Infantry Brigade group and improvisedarmoured unit landing at Tobruk today.     It is hoped tostabilize front there.4.     Latest reports indicate that German force in cyrenaica may consist of all or part of one armoured and twomotorized divisions.

Copy of a telegram dated March 2, 1941, from Commander-in-Chief,Middle East, to the War Office.(0/45279.    2/3.      53929 (M.0.5).     27/2)1.     Latest information indicates recent reinforcements to Tripolitania comprise two Italian Infantry Divisions, two italian Motorized Arty. Regts., and German Armd. Troopsestimated at maximum of one Armd. Bde. Gp.   No evidence ofadditional M.T. landed, and enemy must still he short oftransport.     Latest air reconnaissance, however, showsconsiderable increase in M.T. on Tripoli-Sirte road.2.     Tripoli to Agheila is 471 miles and to Benghazi 646miles.     There is only one road and water is inadequate over410 miles of the distance;    these factors, together with lackof transport, limit the present enemy threat.     He can probablymaintain up to one Inf. Div, and Armd. Bde. along the coastroad in about three weeks, and possibly at the same time employ a second Armd. Bde., if he has one available, across thedesert via Hon and Marada against our flank.3.     He may test us at Agheila by offensive patrolling andif he finds us weak push on to -Tadabya in order to move up hisadvanced landing grounds.     I do not think that with this force he will attempt to recover Benghazi.4.     Eventually two German Divisions might be employed in alarge-scale attack.     This with one or two Inf. Divs. would bethe maximum maintainable via Tripoli.     Shipping risks,difficulty of communications and the approach of hot weathermake it unlikely that such an attack could develop before theend of the summer.     Effective interference by sea with convoys and by air with Tripoli might extend this period.5.     Cyrenaica Garrison will shortly consist of 3 Armd. Bde.,9 Aus. Div., 3 Indian Motor Bde.   Latter two incompletelytrained and equipped.     Additional A/Tk. units are urgentrequirement because one Inf. Bde. Coy. only at present available.     Am withdrawing some from Sudan.6.     The Italian air threat to Cyrenaica is at presentalmost negligible.     On other hand Germans already well established in Central Mediterranean and have now availablefor operations against Malta, sea communications, Cyrenaica andfor defence of their convoys and Tripolitania approximately,bombers 170, dive bombers, 90. fighters 60, reconnaissance 18,transport aircraft 1C0.       These strengths can and are likelyto be increased.     Prom bases in both Tripolitania and Sicilyheavy scale air attacks are being carried out in our forward troops, bases and line of communication in Cyrenaica.   Aerialmine laying ports, especially Tobruk, particular menace.     Inview of other commitments our own air forces permanentlyavailable to counter German land and air activities againstCyrenaica and to provide support for our land forces are not likely to exceed 1 fighter squadron, 1 medium bomber squadron,1 army co-operation squadron, though bombing effort will be augmented periodically by heavy bombers working from Malta and

Cyrenaiea. For time being, however, second fighter squadrondestined for Greece has been retained Gyrenaica. Also, withother commitments A.A. defence is inadequate.7.     As regards Egypt, air attacks from west now unlikelyin immediate future, but German and Italian aircraft, especiallyformer, operating from Mandible, are becoming increasinglyactive in EastemMediterranean and are succeeding, for present at any rate, in virtually closing canal by aerial mines.Alexandria and Delta area also within easy reconnaissance and bombing range from Mandible.     Therefore, until Mandibleliquidated, must maintain strong air defences in Egypt.   Onefighter squadron only available whole area.     Special measures,including fighters and balloons, having to be taken in canal zone.     Necessary also divert portion heavy bomber effortfrom other most important tasks for reduction air threatEgypt by bombing air bases Mandible.8.     German parachute troops might be landed on our L.S. of1. in combination with Armed forces.     I do not anticipate thatparachutists will be used with the scale of attack likely tobe developed in near future, but they are a possibleaccompaniment of a large-scale attack at later date.9.     Paragraphs   6 and 7 above were drawn up by A.O.C.-in-C.
