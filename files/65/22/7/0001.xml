Following is substance of longconversation.    You knew nature and intensity of his own feelings.His wife was Greek,    But he was not free to decide as he might wish.   He was one of three with six months to go before handing over their charge.     He certainly had, and had exercised, a gooddeal of power.    But decision with which he was now faced was aterrible one which would decide the fate of the country and people.He must make sure what was the will of the country and consult the people who could claim to represent public opinion.    He was doing this.     Decision he would take is not to be one which shouldbe regarded as his.     It would be based on these consultations and enquiries.     For instance, if the people wanted to join the tripartite Pact (which he did not suppose anybody v/ould wish todo and which Yugoslavia could not in his opinion do) he could not stand in its way:   and vice versa.     He was not in a position tosay yet what would be the action of Yugoslavia.     Sufferings from war for a small country ranged against a great one were such thathe must find out whether there was no way out.     Similarly he mustfind out the chances of military resistance.    This was the reasonfor despatch of officer.     If on that basis he could be given full information so much the better.     If not he would understand,Yugoslav military authorities told him now Yugoslavia could not hold out for more than a week;   nor in their opinion could Greeks,even with British help.   He had always been frank with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and me and never told us a lie:   he did not lie:   hehad told us things he had told no one else.     For this reason hewould not tell us he would take action he might find impossible inthe end.    He repeated that he was not in a position to say more, .
2,-  2.   F. spoke, even more earnestly than I have yet known himdo.     I used the usual arguments and told him I was convincedthat public opinion was in favour of action.     But he did not go further than statement of his position in paragraph 1 above.a       3.   Confidentialo     Tupanjanin saw F. on March 8th.     HeIf bummed up his impression as being that some amicable declarationilZQ Germany was under consideration, perhaps in order to gain timeIIbut that F.&quot;had reached the conclusion that Yugoslavia would have i to fight in&quot;the end.

SPECIAL (EDEN-PRIME MINISTER).Decypher.      Sir M.  Lampson,  (Cairo).10th March, 1941.D.  11.33 t).m. 10th March, 1941.R.    1.05 a.ra. 11th March, 1941.No.  505.MOST IMMEDIATE.MOST SECRET.Following from Secretary of State and Chief ofImperial General Staff for Prime Minister.PERSONAL.Major General Arthur Smith and Brigadier Mallabyreturned from Athens today.    Their discussions with Mr. Hopewere attended throughout by General Papagos and on March 9thby General Wilson, who had just returned from Haliakmohposition.2.      Hope was most friendljr but on the plea of ignorancewould not, or could not, give any information about Yugoslavplan of operations or even the initial concentration.    his attitude was markedly defeatist when conversations began andthis presumably reflects the attitude of Yugoslav General Staff.He had been charged by Yugoslav Minister of War with askingseven questions, all which were designed to find out what helpYugoslavia might expect for her armies when they retreated partSouthwards and part Westwards.3.      To reply to these questions in detail was not possible without knowing the Yugoslav plans, and British and Greekrepresentatives therefore gave their answers in general terms.This wariness had the advantage of avoiding giving away knowledgeof our own plans.4.      It was clear that Yugoslav General Staff attachesthe greatest importance to three things.    First,  the use ofSalonica as base for their Southern armies.    Second, naval assistance for the evacuation of their Northern armies fromthe Adriatic coast if cut-off by German thrust across thecountry from East to West.    Third, the weakness of their forcesin aircraft, tanks and anti-tank weapons.5.      British and Greek representatives did everything possible to infuse Hope with a spirit of determination and desireto take the offensive.    They stressed the importance of actionimmediately on the outbreak of war by Yugoslavia against Italianrear in Albania.    They also emphasised our own expectation ofsuccess not only in the Balkans but in the final outcome of thewar,6.      Hope was apparently fully satisfied with the repliesreceived.    He went back this morning to Belgrade in a muchmore confident and cheerful frame of mind.    This does notnecessarily mean that he will succeed in altering the attitudeof the Yugoslav General Staff, but it is the best that could have been expected in view of the limited authority with which he came to the discussions.7.      See also my telegram No.  50 to Belgrade.

[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should beretained by the authorised recipient and not passed: on].SPECIAL (EDEN)Sir He Knatchbull-Hugessen, (Angora)12th March 1941.D.     6.29 p,mo 12th March 1941.R.     5.20 a.m. 13th March 1941.No. 520///////IMMEDIATE *Addressed to Cairo No. 113, repeated to Foreign Office,Athens No. 156 and Belgrade No. 131.Your telegram No. 81.Following for Secretary of State.I have spoken to Minister for Foreign Affairs in the sense of the above telegram and also in the sense of Athenstelegram No. 109 to Cairo.2.   Minister for Foreign Affairs in principle fullyunderstands importance of avoiding anything likely to depressGreek and Yugoslav morale.   But in practice he sees littlethat the Turkish Government can do in view of the impossibility of Turkey taking up any attitude which is not purelydefensive in the present circumstances.5,   He told Wi that the decision as regards occupying the bridgeheads at Demotika and Dedeagatch had not yet beentaken but that it would be &quot;negative&quot;.   I said that in that case it might be better to take no decision but to leave theGermans guessing.   He agreed and I think therefore no decision will be announced.4.   Having heard reports from   Turkish General Staff -that they intended to ask the Greeks to blow up the bridgeat Demotika I urged inadvisibility of this as it would be giving Germans an invitation to descend into territoryevacuated [group undec: ?by] Greek troops.   Minister forForeign Affairs agreed and said intention now was that thebridge should be ruined but not blown up until circumstancesnecessitated this.5.   When I informed him that Yugoslav attitude seemed tobe stiffening he told me that he had information thatYugoslavs were moving munitions from northern to southernfrontier.   He nevertheless said he was &quot;sick of Yugoslavia15,neither of his very definite approaches (my telegram No. 155and my telegram No. 580 to Foreign Office) having receivedany answer whatever.6.   Yugoslav Ambassador tells me that he has received noinstructions from his Government since the message given youat evening reception here (my telegram No. 420 to ForeignOffice).     -

department and I, ( S ECRST )Decipher.    Sir S. Gripps,  (Moscow).10th March,  1941.D. 4. 10 p. m. 10th March,  1941.R.  7.50 p.m. 10th March,  1941.No.  204.MOST IMMEDIATE.Your telegram No.  191.VERY SECRET.1.      Vyshinski called on me at midday today to give me the reply to my question.2.      lie informed me that he had summoned the turkish ambassador yesterday to communicate the substance of it tohim.3.      He read the reply and begged me not to let itget into the Press.4.      The opening; paragraph was to the effect that,as a result of my communication, the Soviet Government gatherthat the Turkish Government feared that in the case of anattack upon Turkey by a foreign power, the U.S.S.R. might take advantage of the difficulties so created and mightattack Turkey itself,5.      The following is verbatim text of the declaration with followed:    &quot;I am authorised by the President of theCouncil of the People&apos;s Commissaries and People&apos;sCommissary for Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S. R.  to announce that this version does not at all (? grp.  omit.) with theattitu.de of the Soviet Government and that, should Turkeyon the contrary really be subjected to an attack on thepart of any foreign power and be obliged with arms in herhands to defend inviolability of her territory,  then Turkeyrelying on the non-aggression pact existing between herand the U.S..S.R. may count on full understanding andneutrality of the Soviet Government&quot;.6,      The manner of the communication and its strongtone without any suggestion whatever that this was not the concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government (which I had expected),are, I believe indicative of a decision taken during thelast few days by the Soviet Government to increase theirresistance to German penetration in the Balkans ratherthan of any compliance by the Soviet Government or any decision to reach a fresh arrangement with Germany on thequestion.Repeated to Angora telegram Ho.  57, Cairo: telegramNo.  6, Belgrade telegram No.  6,(Advance copies sent to Prime Minister andGeneral Ismay).
