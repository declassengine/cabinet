*D*0 (41^ 22nd Meeting.TO be kept UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may betaken toensure the secrecy of this document.- MOST SECRET - COPY No . 6,W.M.(41) 48th CONCLUSIONS,, MINUTE 6Confidential Annex.-(8th May,- 1941, 12 Noon.)[7.S.A.&apos; The War Cabinet were reminded of the proposal--put forward by the United States Government (and/Fleet outlined in telegram GLEAM 42, of the 29th april^) thatDispositions.      certain units of the United States Fleet should&apos;now be moved from the Pacific into the Atlantic.As arranged at a Meeting of the Defence Committeeon the 1st May* the views of the Australian and NewZealand Governments had been obtained^ A telegram had now been despatched to Washington (No* 2453  of the8th May) informing our Military Mission that these twoGovernments had now expressed, their general concurrence in our view that any marked, advance by the United states navy into the Atlantic was, on the whole, more likelyto deter Japan from going to war than the maintenanceof a very large American Fleet at Hawaii.   Further,such a movement into the Atlantic might exercise a profound influence on the present critical position in spain, Turkey and Vichy France;    and American actionin this sense should accordingly be encouraged.   Owingto an oversight, this telegram had not been seen by theForeign Secretary before despatch.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY drew attention to telegram757 from Sir R. Craigi^v in which the view was -expressed that a movement of the United States Fleet-such as was  contemplated would, be regarded as evidencethat we were very hard, pressed in the Atlantic and mediterranean, and might well constitute a temptation to southward expansion by Japan which would be too strong to be resisted.THE PRIME MINISTER di&quot;1 not share the view putforward in Sir R. Craigie&apos;s telegram, and adhered to theviews lie -had expressed earlier.In discussion,  it was pointed out that if partof the United States Fleet were now to move from the pacific into the Atlantic, this would mean that weshould not. have to wa.it for this movement, to take place before ships were sent from Home Waters to the Far East.THE FIRST SEA LORD also thought that the UnitedStates Fleet left at Hawaii would be as capable ofraiding the Japanese coast as1 the whole Fleet nowconcentrated&quot;there.The general view of the War Cabinet was,therefore, against any modification of the instructionsto our Military Mission contained in telegram 2453to Washington^*     * * *

[Cypher] MCIALXaHERICAN) .;.)FROM WASHINGTON TO FQRE3M office.Viscount Halifax. .  - D. 1flL39 p.m. 29th April, 1941.No. 1883. R./6V5 a.m. 30th April, 194129th April, 1941..qqqdddddddggg.MOST IMMEDIATE.MOST SECRET.Gleam 12.Following from Military Mission for Chiefs of Staff.Secretary of the Navy Knox to-day summoned Admiral Danckwertsand Captain Clark to Navy Department.    Others present at the meeting were:   Mr. Stimson, Admiral Stark, Rear-Admiral Turner, General. Marshall.2.    Colonel Knox said that he wished to consult us about our views on the following proposition.    What did we think would he theresult if the United States now moved almost the whole of theirPacific Fleet into the Atlantic, leaving Hawaii to defend itselfagainst any attack, and leaving only, such forces as Chief of naval operations might consider necessary for the protection of the Westcoast sea communications?   (Subsequently Admiral Danckwerts ascertained from Rear Admiral Turner that the forces that would be left in the pacific would he of the order of 3 or 4 battleships, 4 6 inch cruisers,&apos; 5. old 6 inch cruisers, 30 to 40 destroyers, number of lying boats, 20 long-range submarines).3.    In the discussion it became clear that the upshot was that united States would remain non-belligerent for the time-being, andthat the forces thus transferred would not act more belligerentlythan those now employed on the Western hemisphere defence plan No. 2.\ 4.. . Admiral Danckwerts replied that from a strictly naval andstrategical point of view he must assume that Japan would seize theopportunity presented to her to carry out aggressive actions to the southward, and that therefore, it was not sound to leave the Pacificwithout-either a United States or a British Fleet.     If this movewas made, therefore* it would be desirable for the United Kingdom tosend to the East a fleet of not less than 9 capital ships, since thatwas the least number that the Chiefs of Staffs judged necessary inthe absence of the United States co-operation in the Pacific.     If,however, as many as 6 United States battleships were left in the pacific it would not be necessary to send more than 6 British .capital ships.to Singapore, and-that generally speaking to checkJapan it was necessary to have in the whole of the Pacific areaeither a fleet of the strength of 9 capital ships concentrated at singapore or Hawaii or a fleet at each base of not less than 6 shipse(Note:-   &quot;capital ships&quot; in this discussion were used purely as aI measure of strength of a balanced fleet).-y
m2.      O5.   No British&quot;Capital Ship Fleet could he sent to theEast at all without, abandoning Eastern Mediterranean and orstripping the Atlantic trade&apos; routes of Capital Ships&apos;protection.   It was not anticipated that the abandonment ofthe. Mediterranean would.be. forced upon us, and it would notbe possible to take British Capital Ships away from the.Atlantic unless their functions were performed by the UnitedStates ships.   This would necessitate escorts and belligerencyby the United States, which was not a hypothesis underconsideration.6.   In a subsequent discussion it was agreed that from a strictly naval and strategical point of view therefore, it wouldnot be sound to reduce the United States Pacific fleet below9 battleships unless the United States came into the war.   Thiswas also the view of the Chief of Naval &quot;Operations and admiral Turner. .       &apos;7.   Mr0 Stimson then raised the discussion to a widerplane, and urged the tremendous effect that such a move might produce.   He suggested that the. Japanese would take a long &apos;range view, and would interpret movement of United States &apos;Pacific, fleet to mean that United States must be shortly about :to enter the war, and that in consequence the addition of the -whole weight of her navy to a decisive theatre of the Atlanticwould definitely foreshadow victory in &quot;Battle of the Atlantic&quot;and the. ultimate defeat of the Axis Powers.   Under thesecircumstances he suggested that the Japanese would refrain from any action for fear of being on the losing side in the longrun.8.   Mr. Stimson also stressed the important psychological effect the proposed move would have in encouraging the UnitedKingdom and her Allies and correspondingly depressing the Axispeoples,, and the stirring effect it would have on the american people who would realise great importance of such a move.   .9. Admiral Danckwerts suggested that if Japanese choose to-seize this opportunity of temporary freedom from any naval threatthey might establish themselves in North&quot;Borneo and Dutch East .,&apos;Indies in such.a&apos; way as to facilitate their subsequent operations against Singapore or as a threat to Australia,&apos; even if UnitedStates Pacific fleet eventually turned to the Pacific and a UniteKingdom&apos;fleet was sent to Far East. Admiral Danckwerts suggestedthat they propose to. calculate on some two months before their operations were seriously Interfered with./10.   At
SoHP      10.   At the end of the discussion it seemed to hegenerally agreed that on purely questionable [sic] andstrategical grounds the move of nearly the whole of the pacific fleet would be unsound, but that from a widerpoint of view there might be considerable force in mr. Stimson&apos;s arguments.     Decision would be a gamble onthe reaction of Japanese.     If they react belligerentlyit was tolerable [sic] they would achieve nothingirreparable before the naval situation was rectifiedby redistribution of naval forces which would be possible with the entry of the United States into the war, though there was no guarantee   that United States intervention would be immediate.11. Mr. Stimson and Colonel-Knox both suggestedthat the matter might be referred to higher authority in United Kingdom,12.   The discussion[s] had no direct connexionwith the question[s] put in Gleam No. 59 although theywere obviously a further development of line of thought of those questions.     United States Naval Staff were inpossession of the reply contained in your Boxes No. 55,but it had not yet reached the Chiefs of Staff orSecretaries of Navy and War.

OUTWARD TELEGRAM 143/rThls Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should be    /&quot;^kept under Lock and Key.][Cypher]. SPECIAL (AMERICAN). ^FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO WASHINGTON.No: 2455.-   D:   1.20 a.m. 8th May, 1941.8th May, 1941.IMMEDIATE.Following for Military Mission from DefenceCommittee.     Begins:MOST SECRET.Telegrams Nos:   2270, 2336 and 2347:-Inform United States authorities that issues raised in your Gleam 42 have been considered by theDefence Committee of the War.Cabinet, and that as sucha move vitally affects Australia and New Zealand&apos;wehave obtained their opinions.2.     Our opinion, which is concurred in generallyby both Australia and New Zealand, is that any markedadvance by the United States navy in or into the atlantic is on the whole more likely to deter japan from going to war than the maintenance of the presentvery large United States fleet at Hawaii, and further thatit might exercise a profound influence on the presentcritical situation in&apos;Spain, Turkey and Vichy France.You should, therefore, strongly encourage Americanaction in this sense,3,     The problem for the United States authorities is so nicely to judge the degree of transfer that while still retaining the deterrent effect of a strongUnited States fleet in the Pacific, there will also hethe deterrent effect of an increased United States fleet in the Atlantic.4.     It is not only the strength but also the composition of the fleet in the Pacific which will actas a deterrent, and in our view the necessary effect willnot remain unless the fleet in the Pacific consisted of not less than 6 capital ships and two aircraft carriers.The inclusion of the latter is considered of the greatest importance.

[Cypher].DEPARTMENTAL (SECRET)FROM TOKYO TO FOREIGN OFFICE.Sir R. Craigie.No. 757.Vth May, 1941.D. 5.25 p.m, 7th May, 1941.R. 4.10 p.m, 7th May, 1941.////////MEDIATE.Most Secret.Your telegram No, 536.Japanese would regard either contingency as evidencethat the United States was about to enter into the War againstGermany and would prepare for action under Article 5 ofthe Tripartite Pact.2. In the case of contingency (a) I hope, though I cannotbe too sanguine, that Japan would find some pretext for avoiding actual hostilities in virtue of the TripartitePact provided that any subsequent United States armed actionagainst Germany could with some show of play be made to appear here as defensive (i.e, not as an &quot;attack&quot; underArticle 3).     The sending of strong British fleet to theFar East would of course be widely heralded as provocativeto Japan but this risk can be taken provided that it ismade perfectly clear that we are acting in full strategicalunison with the United States.3. Contingency (b) would be regarded as evidence that weare so hard pressed in the Atlantic and the Mediterraneanthat the United States can no longer risk keeping her[?gp.omitted] in the Pacific when the opportunity would beprovided which Japan has long awaited.     The deterrent effect of the presence of the United States fleet in the pacific has been very obvious here and were this removedwithout simultaneous and equivalent reinforcement of british naval strength, the temptation for further southwardexpansion (even in advance of and independently of actionrendered necessary under the Tripartite Pact) would he too strong to be resisted.    Moreover the belief in extremistcircles that Japan could attack us without becoming involved with the United States would he greatly strengthened.    Themore moderate elements would foresee that a Japanese attackon British territory or on Siam (Thailand) or theNetherlands East Indies must eventually involve Japan ina disastrous war with the British Empire and the UnitedStates combined, hut I believe that they would he overruledon the grounds that the initial gains to he derived frommoving while the Pacific was .empty of war forces could, beretained in the event of German victory or on stalematein Europe.4. If your contingency (a) is based on the assumption ofour withdrawal from the Mediterranean or the loss of Suezthis introduces new factors which I have not taken intoaccount in the above observations.
