[Begins].   The Turkish Government for their part are determined to resist with all their forces anattack directed against Turkey.   The Turkish Governmentare convinced that Yugoslavia would do the same if shefor her part were attacked.   It is possible however that other eventualities may arise in which Yugoslaviawould find herself threatened with Turkey.   The most likelyof these eventualities is an attack upon Salonika throughBulgarian territory.   The Turkish Government consider such an attack would constitute for the two countries  catastrophic danger requiring decisions and action to betaken in common.   If the Yugoslav Government share thispoint of view, the Turkish Government suggest to the yugoslav Government that it would be advisable toproceed at once to an exchange of views on the situationenvisiaged.

Discussion centred round Yugoslavia.    Sarajoglu,like ourselves, considers it vital that Yugoslavia should hold.    His view is that unless Germans can come throughthe Monastir Gap, they will not risk attack on Greece.    Ifthus headed off, he thinks that Germans would attackTurkey but is prepared to face this eventuality.3. At our suggestion, Sarajoglu agreed to sendmessage to Yugoslav Government contained in Cairo telegram to Belgrade  101.    He will inform the Greek Government ofhis action.    On my return here this afternoon I have seen Belgrade telegram to Angora 157 which shows YugoslavPresident of the Council [is] urging that Turks shouldmake an approach to Yugoslav Government which they havenow agreed to do.
