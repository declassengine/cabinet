- MOST SECRET -It is requested that special care may re tai-;en to insure the secrecy of this document .COPY No.W.M. (41) 56th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex&apos;. -(2nd June, 1941, 5.0 p,a.)CRETE.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the tragic sequence of events in Crete had now reached their conclusion.Some 17,000 of our troops had been evacuated.   Thedefence and evacuation of the island raised a numberof. questions which should be enquired into.   Forexample, why had not long-range guns &quot;been fixed where theycould fire on the aerodromes? Why had not the aerodromes been mined, and more tanks landed? Again,the public would ask why, if we had taken 17,000 menoff, we could not have sent adequate reinforcements to hold the island. The answer was that, once we had lost the aerodromes, we no longer had it in our powerto bring in reinforcements and supplies except atexcessive cost to the Fleet.As for the evacuation itself,    after 5,000men had been embarked on the first night, the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, had telegraphed home emphasis-ing the serious losses the Fleet might suffer if furthertroops were removed.   We had insisted, however, on theevacuation proceeding, and a further 12,000 had beengot away without any further serious naval losses.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Commander-in-Chief had made it clear that he was prepared to carryon w ith the evacuation until the last ship.   But hehad thought it his duty to inform the Government of the .lar^e Naval losses which the operation might entail,in view of its repercussions on out position in theMediterranean generally.THE PRIME MINISTER said that on Saturday nighthe had heard that it was proposed to abandon furtherevacuation and to leave 5,000 men on the beaches.   He(the Prime Minister) and the First Sea Lord had taken the view that further efforts should be made toeva.cuate these men.   But before the order could begiven, General Weston had reported that the men/woresshauctod,and had ardcrccT tliam %o capitulate.In discussion, there was some criticism thatwe had not prepared sufficient aerodromes in Crete,and a comparison was drawn between the speed with whichthe Germans made aerodromes available.   It was pointedout that the Ge:labour for thisrmans used what was, in effect , slavework.   While we had been preparing-1-/ . piiw, o^oi   1LaJ^      a&amp;c^yatciA. cc   ^n&apos;/4 &amp;UU ( CCSXSTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY, 4 cc155

aerodromes in Crete we had had to contend with winterconditions.   We had also been making aerodromes in Turkey,and only a limited number of engineers had been available.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the loss ofour aerodromes in Crete was basically due to our havinginsufficient light A.A. defences..It was also urged that there was a risk that if our troops were repeatedly asked to undertake operationswithout adequate air protection, this might, in time,have a demoralising effect on them.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement, and invited the Secretaryof State for War to arrange for a full report to be submitted on the operations in Crete, after due inquiry..Great George Street, S.W.I.-2-
