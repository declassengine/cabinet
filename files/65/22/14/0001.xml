(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT). 120TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.- MOST SECRET -)It is requested that special care may be takeninsure the secrecy of this document-COPY NoJlW,Mo  (41). 41st CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(17th April, 1941, 12 Noon.)THE BALKANS ANDTHE MIDDLE EAST.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet atelegram received from General Wavell late on theprevious night (No. 0/57341 y7   This telegram reported a message received from General Tilson.   The latter had just had a conversation with General Papa go s, who had said that the Greek Army was severely pressed, and had agreed to withdraw to the Thermopylae position.General Papagos had also suggested to General Wilsonthat &quot;as things might become critical in future, weshould re-embark British troops and save Greece fromdevastation&quot;.   General 7avell asked for instructions on General Papagos&apos;s suggestion   that we should re-embark our forces .   In the meantime, arrangements to this end were being me.de.The Prime Minister said that the clear implicationof General Papagos&apos;s statement was that the Greek Armymight be unable to continue the struggle.   We had always taken the view that we should not go to help the Greeks unless they wanted us to do so.    If the greeks now decided that they did not wish to continuethe struggle on the mainland, we should fall in withtheir views .    This view was reinforced by the factthat Air Vice-Marshal D&apos;Albiac had reported that the aerodromes we occupied in Eastern Greece had been shot up and that he was withdrawing some of hissquadrons to Crete.The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committeewhich had been meeting the previous night when this telegram had been received, had decided to despatch a reply to the effect that if the Greek Governmentendorsed General Papagos&apos;s request,  evacuation should proceed, without, however, prejudicing withdrawal t-the Thermopylae position in co-operation with theGreek Army.    In the meantime, preparations for evacuation should proceed (Telegram No. 836rto Athens).In this telegram, General  Tavell had also been told that Crete must be held in force, and that it was important that strong elements of the Greek army should establish themselves in Crete, together withthe King and Government.The War Cabinet expressed their agreement withthe line taken in this telegram.Discussion followed as to the prospects of wj.thdr.aw-ing our forces .THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had 59,000k men in-Greece.   He was afraid that we should lose most ofour artillery and tanks in Greece, but he hoped thatthe anti-tank guns could be taken off.

Yugo-Slavia.The difficulties of the withdrawal would beincreased by the strength of the air force opposedto us . \THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he assumed, IfGreek resistance, eollapse&amp;y the armistice would be signed between soldiers,: and that we should get theGreek King and Government to remove to Crete..&apos;The War Cabinet were informed that the extricationof the Yugo-Slav Air Force was not being attended with much success.&apos; A somewhat corrupt telegram appeared toindicate that 44 of their aircraft had arrived atlanding-grounds in North-west Greece,- but that thegreater part of then had afterwards been put. out ofaction by enemy low-flying attacks.&apos;THE PERMANENT UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that Mr R. Campbell had refused to leaveYugo-Slavia until the many British subjects wereevaluated.   All possible steps were being taken toprovide means of transport, but it was not possibleto send a surface ship to Kotor.The War Cabinet:-fl) Endorsed the instructions sent to general wavell by the Prime Minister,   afterconsultation with the Defence Committeeon the previous nicrht:(2)the Secretaryof State for DominionInvitedAffairs to keep the Dominion Governmentsinformed of the position, In strict confidence:Situation in libya.(3) Took note that, for the moment, no indication could be given to the Pressregarding the withdrawal of our forces from the mainland of Greece I(On the previous night the PrimeMinister had told. Sir Walter Moncktonthat, he might indicate to the press that the situation in Greece was not likely to be resolved in our favour,owing to the collapse of Yugo-Slavresl stance.)-(4) Attached importance to the Greek king and Government removing to Crete as soonas possible.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet telegram/57255&apos;from the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,giving particulars of the distribution of enemy forcesin the forward, area&apos;x .e.between Tobruk and Sollum.The Prime Minister thought that the situation in libya was considerably   better than it had appeared aweek ago..   There were:, however, reports of a furtherGerman&apos;Armoured Division, which might be concentratedeither in Tripoli, or near Benghazi&apos;, waiting for supplies to move forward&apos;.   The military authorities inthe Middle East thought it was more likely to be inUp

Tripoli, .whereas opinion here was that this  -Division might be further forward *   Nevertheless,. theGerman thrust seemed to be of manageable proportions,and there was a good chance that it might be liquidated.The sinking of five enemy supply ships on theprevious day had been most opportune, and reconnais-sance reports by our Fleet, from   the air, showed no enemy supply ships between Bardia and Sollura. -Tank Situation. Discussion followed as to the number of tanks whichhad recently arrived in the Kiddle East or were due toarrive shortly.Details v-ere given of the numbers of heavy tanksnow in the Cairo workshops, and the dates by whichthey were likely to be available for service.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEreferred to the troubles which had been experiencedwith the treads of our tanks .    It was suggested thathe right discuss this natter with the Minister ofSupply.In discussion of the general situation, thefollowing points were madet-(l) If the Greek resistance collapsed, german air strength in the Eastern Mediterraneannight develop dangerously.   But it wouldprobably take the Germans a month to buildup the services required for a la.rgeoperational force.(S) Meantime, we were taking steps to strengthen the Air Force in the Kiddle East.   From-November, 1940, to May, 1941, inclusive *the number of aircraft which had alreadybeen despatched or would be despatched tothe Middle East was 1,785.    Of these, 905had already been sent, and 377 had alreadyarrived.(3) Mr MENZIES referred to the somewhatexaggerated character of the Co&quot;.zmniouesissued in the Middle East.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had askedGeneral &quot;Yavell to telegraph home hisOorrunlaues before they were issued-   Thisschema, however, had not worked well, andhe had now authorised General &apos;7avell toissue factual Co^-runjques on his own responsibility, but to telegraph home forapproval the text of any Communiques which gave general appraisements of the situation.(4) There would, no doubt, be criticism, bothin Parliament and. in the Press, of thefailure of our military effort in the Balkans..But it was reasonable to assume that bothParliament, and the public would behaveworthily of the situation^ -&apos;previous reference&apos;.M.(41) 36thConclusions,Jinute 1.)

m(5) There was no ground for the charge that wehad been lacking in common prudence in not .rounding off the winter campaign by an advance to Tripoli.   The arguments putforward by the Chiefs of Staff against suchan advance were unanswerable.(6) There would probably be criticism that our intelligence Service had been defective. Whilethe development of our Intelligence Service in italian territories had been hampered by political considerations before italy s entry into thewar, the fact remained that there had beenvarious indications of a. German move intoLibya,   but that the military authoritiesin the Kiddle East had discounted thepossibility of a serious German thrustdeveloping before the summer.The War Cabinet took note of theab ov e s t at em ent s ,Great George Street, S.-.7.I.-4-

Two. Capuzzo Sollum Bardia. Composite forces taken from Ariete Armd. Div. and 5 German Colonial Armd. Div. Probably under command Gen. Rommel. Possible composition. Ariete. Tanks fifty M13 twenty CV33. Two Bersaglieri Regts. consisting two lorry borne battalions each strength 600. Two groups twelve 75/27 field guns six 100/17 Hows. 5 Colonial Armd. Div. tanks possible fifty or sixty light tanks Mark 11 9 ton.Twenty wheeled tanks mounting 37 m.m. gun. Reconnaissance unit now disposing not more than fifty side car combinations. Enemy intention appears to be to mask Tobruk and contain forces there by local offensives so as to enable mobile force under Rommel to penetrate as deeply as possible into Egypt. His mechanical transport is inadequate but Rommel evidently hopes to exploit soft spot so far as his transport situation and our resistance will allow him. His belief that he has defeated enemy in front of him may lead him into difficulties.
