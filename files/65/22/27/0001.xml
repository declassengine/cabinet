This project would be gone into withthe British Air- Marshal in charge of the Atlanticferry service.The President1s message had ended on a verycordial note.     He had referred to the steps takento freeze German and Italian assets and to closeGerman Consulates in the U.S-.A.     He (the President)judged that the reaction in the United States wasninety per cent favourable.Iceland. The Prime Minister also informed the WarCabinet that the United States were sending a forceof Marines to Iceland to reinforce the british garrison.     Later they proposed to send about 25,000American soldiers, who would relieve the british garrison, which ,we should then be free to useelsewhere.

PRIME MINISTER5SPERSONAL TELEGRAM.Serial No, T. 304.SECRET.For the Former Naval Person from the President.&quot;Army is studying possible ferry from Natalwith idea that African landing places might be three in number -Bathurst, Freetown and Liberia,   I see noreason for any United States lease, but if the planworks oat we would deliver the planes either in Natalor on African coast.   Also we would undertake thebuilding of any necessary servicing facilities,   i feel there should be three possible landing placesbecause of proximity of Bathurst to Dakar.   When yourAir Vice Marshal arrives our people will immediatelyconfer with him.   I find a feeling here that up torecently there has been a great deal of delay indelivery between Takaradi and lower Egypt, chieflythrough difficulty in s erving the small I bopping stoneson the way across the Continent.   Please let me knowhow you regard the working out of this problem,I have a distinct feeling in my bones thatthings are looking up with you and with us.   Afterfreezing the German and Italian assets on Saturday,I closed   the German consulates and agencies yesterday,and the reaction here is, I should say, ninety percentfavourable.
