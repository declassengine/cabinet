(41)  55RD CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1,Confidential Annex.( 26th May,  1941      5a 0 p. m. )THE FIRST SEA LORD described the dispositions of H. M.  ships which had been ordered when aircraftreconnaissance had reported on the evening of 22nd Maythat a battleship and cruiser, which had afterwardsbeen identified as BISMARCK and PRINZ EUGEN,  had leftBergen.The German ships had been sighted later inthe evening of 23rd May by H. M.  Cruisers NORFOLK andSUFFOLK in the Denmark Strait..    The two cruisers hadshadowed the enemy until the following morning whenPRINCE OF WALES and HOOD had gained touch,,    TheBISMARCK had been engaged by HOOD and the PRINCE of wales early in the morning of 24th May0      HOOD hadbeen the first to open fire,  at a range of about24,000 yards,    BISMARCK had&quot; replied^    Her shootinghad been effective from the starts    The R,. Dt. F.  rangefinders on both our ships had been jammed;    this wasone of the matters into which inquiry would have to bemade.    After about twenty minutes fighting HOOD hadblown up and sunk    The BISMARCK&apos;S fire had then been concentrated on the PRINCE OF WALES,    THE PRINCE of wales had been hit on OTM her bridge, and the mainfire controls had been put out of action.,    She had alsobeen hit in Y turret which had been temporarily put-out of action.    Later, however,, all but one of the guns in the turret had again been in action,    THE PRINCE of wales had also been hit on the water line.    A certainamount of water had been taken on board above hersteering compartment,.THE PRINCE OF WALES had then broken off.action.    Whether she had been right in doing so couldnot be judged on the information so far availableOur information did not show whether THEPRINZ EUGEN had taken part in the action,At 8 a.m.  on 24th May the enemy ships hadbeen 18 miles to the westward of the 1st Cruiser Squadron,steering a south-westerly course at 26 knots, while theCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, in KING GEORGE V     withREPULSE, VICTORIOUS, four cruisers and nine destroyers had been 300 miles east south east of the enemy, steeringa south westerly course to close,,    At 1.30 p. m.  the enemy had altered course to the south.    At about 6 p. m.  the prince OF WALES had renewed action,,    The enemy had thenturned away westward and the engagement had again been broken off.    THE PRINCE OF WALES,&apos;NORFOLK,  and SUFFOLKhad maintained touch with the enemy during the evening,,

At 2 a.m,  on. the following day (25th May)nine torpedo aircraft from VICTORIOUS had attacked theBISMARCK.    One hit had been observed on the enemy.    Touchhad been lost with the enemy at about 3. a.m.BISMARCK had been heard making a short signal,followed by a succession of signals, which might indicatethat she had sustained damage andbeen compelled to alterher plans.The following day (25th May) at about 8 a.m. asignal, believed to be from the BISMARCK had indicated that she was on an easterly course and might be making for a Biscay Port.    Orders had been given to Force H,including RENOWN, ARK ROYAL and SHEFFIELD, to move intoposition to prevent BISMARCK entering the Bay.BISMARCK had again been sighted by aircraftreconnaissance that marning, 26th May.    She was stillmaking eastward and it was conjectured that she mightbe attempting to take shelter in St. Nazaire.    Herspeed that afternoon had been estimated at 25 knots,although it had been reduced to about 20 knots at about  p.m.    It was hoped to carry out a torpedo bombing attack on her that afternoon.    If she were not interceptedshe might make St. Nazaire on the following day.    Therewas no indication of the whereabouts of the PRINZ EUGEN.- It was hoped that BISMARCK might be brought to action by our ships before they came within effectivestriking distance of German shore based aircraft from the-Biscay Ports.    Bcaufighter escorts were being sent out to protect oixr vessels.    KING GEORGE V had already engaged- a Fnkko Wulfe based on Bordeaux.   When the lastreport had beon received RODNEY had been about 35 milesfrom BISMARCK and KING GEORGE V about 100 miles.Great George Street, S.W. 1.
