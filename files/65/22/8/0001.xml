MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(17th March, 1941, - 5.0 p.m,)In answer to a question, THE VICE-CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that he had no recent newsas to the progress of the movement of our troops to greece.   He thought that the reason why the germans had not moved over the Graeco-Bulgarian frontier wasprobahly due to a combination of factors, e. g. doubt as to yugoslavia^ attitude, the weather conditions in bulgaria, and perhaps the desire to await the resultof the Italian offensive in Albania.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in view of theuncertain position he thought it was important thatthe Foreign Secretary should not hurry home.   Atelegram had therefore been sent suggesting that heshould stay in the Middle East for the present and delay his departure (Telegram No. 722/to Cairo).The Foreign Secretary had since telegraphedto Angora suggesting a further meeting with th$ turkish minister for Foreign Affairs (Telegram No. 574&apos;from cairo).The War Cabinet were given the following information as to diplomatic developments in the balkans: -Particulars had been given orally of theTurkish Government&apos;s reply&apos;to Hitler&apos;s letter.    Inreply to German assurances that they would not attackTurkey unless action on the part of Turkey changed thesituation, the Turkish Government were giving exactlysimilar assurances conversely.   The reply ended by an expression of hope of some normalisation of German-Turkish relations (Telegram No. 55&amp;from Angora).The indications of the position in Yugoslavia-were somewhat conflicting.   The Yugoslav    Government had asked us to take charge of M, Stoyadinovitch.    On theother hand, the Yugoslav. National Bank were givinginstructions for their gold and dollar reserve in theUnited States to he transferred to other countries.This seemed to indicate action to prevent Yugoslavbalaneesin the United States being blocked (TelegramNo. 4367frora Belgrade).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may betaken to16

Our Minister in Belgrade had had a ratherunsatisfactory conversation with the Minister fForeign Affairs (Telegram No0 43^ from Belgrade),The Minister for Foreign Affairs had stated thatthe situation was very delicate, hut that no decision had been taken,,    He had added that hethought there were possible forms of &quot;collaboration&quot;with Germany,,    It would seem that the Yugoslavs hadresisted the German demands to accede to the TripartitePact, but they were still hankering after signingsome kind of document with Germany,,The War Cabinet took note ofthe above information,,Great George Street, S.W01C

State from Prime Minister,,To be decyphered by Mr, Eden or his PersonalAssistant,, &apos; &apos; ..&apos;1n    I have come to the Conclusion that it is better for you to stay in Middle East&apos;until the openingphase of this crisis has matured.   Your instructionsgive you the means of concerting .the political andmilitary action of all the factors involved.   The attitudeof Yugoslavia is still by no means hopeless and situation may. at any moment arise which would enable you to go there0,Turkey requires stimulus and guidance as events develop.No one but you can combine and concert the momentous.policy which you have pressed upon us and which we have adopted,,   The War Cabinet needs a representative on the spoand I need you there very much indeed.20   j saw Sikorski this morning and asked for thePolish Brigade.   He agreed in the most manly fashion^hut he asked that this Brigade., which was one of the few remaining embodiments of Polish nationality, should not belightly cas^ away or left to its fate0   I promised fullequipment and no greater risks than would he run by our ownflesh and bloody   He ;said you have millions of soldiers,we have only these few.,Units.   I hope you appreciatewhat we are asking of these valiant strangers and thatGeneral Wavell will have this in his Bind always,3*   I feel very much&quot;the fact that we are not using asingle British Division,,   I am arranging to send the50th Division with Convoy W. S.8 leaving April 22.   Aspecial convoy would only have saved a week, and wecannot afford the extra escort,,in. We have not been told by Wavell whether Glens gotthrough Canalp hut presume this will be regarded as urgentin the highest degree.   A source, of which you are awarePshows
2,shows that preparations are being made to withdrawGerman personnel from the big Mandible in expectationMbf its British occupation.   You ought not to be[I easily contented with delaying Mandibles indefinitely^We need to take it at earliest moment, and thereafterj we need the 6th Division, whether things go well or ill,; We must not be. reproached with hazarding only other people&apos;s troops,,   You ought to press hard and long for  taking-Mandibles before the end of this month,5,   Can you tell me why Papagos does not drawthree or four Divisions from Albania to strengthen his right front,.   Recent check which. Italians are saidto have received and fact that German advance has notyet begun may still give time for this,.   Presentstrategic layout of Greek Army looks to me most dangerous,.   Papagos must have good reasons, and if you have learned them pray let me know*.6.   Of course if Yugo came in this would justifyGreek strength, in-Albania,;   But this, is not yet known,,   Presume you and Dill have studied carefullypossibilities of a Yugo attack on Italians in Albania,,Here they might win victory of the first order, and at thesame time gain the vast mass of the equipment they need to preserve their independence and oan never find else-where in time,7,   Do not let Lemnos be picked up by the Germans as an air base for nothing.   See Naval Attachd Athens telegramNo, 1253/12,8,   It seems right to obtain a decision at Kerenand open Appearance before withdrawing Air Squadrons you have thereabouts,9,   Your 54-7 containing Longmorefs complaintsoverlooks what is on the way.   Fifteen cased Hurricanesreached Takoradi today.   Sixteen more should be therein next few days*   Forty flying Hurrioanes in Pageantshould land within the next two or three days.   Allthese should reach Egypt before end of March,   Afurther thirty-three cased Hurrioanes are already at sea,total Hurricanes one hundred and four,&apos;   Parts tocomplete twenty Tomahawks are in Pageant and in flyingboat due to leave for Takoradi tonight.   Arrival of these should enable flow of Tomahawks to begin.   Parts to equip other Tomahawks have left this country.   Everyeffort will be made to fly twenty-two Wellingtons to middle East in next fortnight.   Only weather will prevents10;
1.0.   Project of flying a Squadron of HurricaneII1a to Malta from the west is full of danger,&quot;because approach of aircraft-carriers will bedetected by German reconnaissance planes, and repetitionIllustrious in a worse form by dive bombers fromOagliari may occur.   Admiralty are however stillstudying it.   Gain over sending them via Takoradi is a fortnight to three weeks,11,   Lastly publicity.   Increasingly hard holdPress in view of American reports and many rumourshere.   We know from special source that german military attache&quot; has telegraphed approximate size ofexpedition oorreotly to Berlin,, though he is in errorin other respects.   Am having gist of this telegramrepeated to you.   You need not feel under any obligation, to issue communique at presemt.   It would indeed be a diplomatic error to aid Hitler to foundhis aggression nominally upon an admission of thiskind by us,12,   Fact that Longmore thinks you ought tocome home via Lagos, in which view Portalconcurs, is final reason for my wish for you andDill to remain, on scene.   For otherwise, apart fromlarger considerations in my paragraph 1, you willboth be out of action&apos; at either end during a most critical seven days,,   Everything is going 1940.4j&amp; &quot;quietlyhere, and we have begun to claw the Huns down in themoonlight to some purpose,   God bless you all,(Ends)e

I feel that it would be most use-ful for us to have another talk.   Since our meeting in Angoravarious new developments have taken place particularly the twodevelopments mentioned in paragraph 3 of Cairo telegram No. 90and I should also like to give M. Sarajoglu the latest information regarding prospects of executing our military plans which I know,would be of interest to him,   My idea would be to have a fullgeneral [grp. undec.] horizon so that we may be sure before mydeparture for England that all matters of mutual interest are well understood between us.2.   I should be delighted to welcome M. Sarajoglu as my guestin Cyprus or Haifa.   Alternatively I should be prepared to meet him in Adana.   Dixon would accompany me.3.   Unless you see strong objection please at once extend the invitation to Minister for Foreign Affairs to meet me in Cyprus orHaifa explaining that as my departure is only delayed for a fewdays I much hope that it will be convenient for him to hold ameeting on Tuesday March 18th.4.   It is preferable that the fact of any further meeting should be kept secret and for this purpose Cyprus is the moresecure meeting-place.

[This telegram is of particular secrecyvand should &quot;be retained &quot;by the authorisedrecipient and not passed on]. S\SPECIAL (EDM).Decypher.Mre Campbell,(Belgrade)16th Harch, 1941.D.R*10.30 p.m.2*25 aam.16th March, 1941. -17th March, 1941.No. 436.ggggggggggAddressed to Cairo telegram No* 141 repeated to ForeignOffice, Athens telegram No. 180, Washington unnumbered^Secret and Confidential,Tupanjanin has told S.0.2 representative here that national Bank have this afternoon telegraphed to Presidentof the Bank in New York giving instructions for Yugoslavgold and dollar reserve in the United States to be transferredas follows;   12i million dollars to Buenos Aires, 124 million dollars to Rio de Janeiro, 3 million dollars to Angora,1 million dollars to Moscow, 1 million dollars to [2 grps.emitted] New York..2.   Official who gave instructions has confirmed theabove information to Tupanjanin.3.   This has the appearance of indicating some actionwhich might lead to blocking of Yugoslav credits in theUnited States by United States Government.4.   After interviews this evening with F. and Presidentof the Council, I have the impression that decision has notyet been taken to sign some arrangement with Germany, thoughdecision to seek an arrangement may be a matter of days.5.   When I asked F. how the matter stood he said thatYugoslavia was confronted with three alternatives (l)   tomake some arrangement with Germany   (2)   to be encircled andlie at the mercy of Germany   (3)   to declare war.     He couldnot get his people (the Government) to see the necessityfor (3).     In particular Croat1s had receded from their goodstand of a few weeks ago and the Army Chiefs continued to hisastonishment to urge that from military point of view action was impossible,6.   F. told me that he was about to receive UnitedStates Minister who had applied for interview most urgently,President of the Council is also to see the United StatesMinister this evening.7.   Further report follows.

[This telegram &amp;s of particular secrecy and should he retained by the authorisedrecipient and not passed on].SPECIAL (EDEN)Decypher*     Mr. Campbell (Belgrade).16th March, 1941.D.     2.25 p.m. 16th March, 1941.R.   10.35 p.m. 16th March, 1941.No. 453.hhhIMMEDIATE.Addressed to Cairo Ho. 139.     Repeated to Angora,Athens and Foreign Office.My telegram No. 136.Following for Secretary of State.I had a long and unsatisfactory conversation withMinister for. Foreign Affairs.     I asked what[?information] he could give me on the situation for transmission to.His Majesty s Government.     He said all he could tell me was that the situation was very delicatebut that no decision had been taken:   Yugoslav Governmentremained in contact with the -Germans.     Saying that according to Military authorities position of Yugoslaviawas such that it was impossible to make war, he went on -that if Yugoslavia collaborated with Germany ( and hethought there were possible forms of collaboration) itwould not mean that she was hostile to us and our allies,on the contrary (thrice repeated).     I said that Istrongly disagreed.     Once &quot;collaboration&quot; of any kindbegan, she would be drawn as sure as fate to this position where she would be entirely in hostile camp.     I thenspoke extremely frankly and as cogently as I could onthe fallacy of arguments that what had happened elsewhereneed not happen here, that the- question was one to bedecided by Military considerations only, that Yugoslaviacould conceivably be less badly off after unresistingencirclement than after resistance to encirclement,and more that it would take too long to enumerate.I said also that popular opinion was highly excited and waslooking to the dynasty to refuse to put the country in aposition where Germany could do as in Roumania;   if this were not done there would therefore be a strong reaction.He said that this was of course being taken intoconsideration;   but popular opinion did not know allthe facts and might easily change later as in France and demand how it had been possible that Government had chosen to go to war.     Minister of Foreign Affairs at one pointsaid that whatever was decided, Yugoslavia would try notto harm Greek and allied cause.     I said that I had beentalking
talking hitherto of harm to Yugoslavia of yieldingattitude towards Germany.     I would now talk ofharm to the cause of Democracy to which Yugoslaviasubscribed.    Such attitude must have seriously dis-ecouraging effect on Greece and Turkey, and must thereforeharm the Democratic cause.,   He said he realised this butYugoslav Government must think of interests of Yugo-slav people.     I maintained that to collaborate withGermany and to permit encirclement would shut the dooron [grp, undec.J outer world.     He doubted this.     Inany case there were some who argued as I had and others who [?argued] differently.     Government must weighpros and cons and were daily racking their brains to solve dilemma which was a terrible one.     I said Iadmitted dilemma but Yugoslavia could solve it if she collaborated with Greece and with us who wouldfulfil obligations to help the Greeks.    He said thatYugoslav military authorities doubted possibility ofthisD     Like President of the Council, Minister forForeign Affairs asked whether Yugoslavia was to declare war on Germany.     It --as clear to- that Turkey was beingtaken as an example.   I ended by begging him to looktowards the light rather than towards the darkness.     i expressed serious doubt that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldunderstand &quot;if she did otherwise.&quot;2c     Above is typical of Minister for Foreign Affairs&apos;defeatism, and views he expressed and endorsed may not bedeciding factor.     But they are clearly being urgedstrongly by a section of the Government and I feel thatthere has been retrogression.30     May I spread discreetly amongst robust circlesthat British troops are landing in Greece in considerable numbers, that we are confident of Yugoslavia-   andfeel certain of conspicuous success if Yugoslavia is .at our side?
