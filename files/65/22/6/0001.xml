The War Cabinet were informed that there hadbeen no definite diplomatic developments in the balkans *     The Yugo-Slav government had sent anofficer to Athens to consult with General Wavell&apos;sChief of Staff but had made it clear that this stepdid not mean any definite commitmentc.     The UnitedStates Minister at Belgrade had received a message from President Roosevelt instructing him to use his influence with the Yugo-Slav Government.The Wa,r Cabinet were informed that our military Attache at Athens had asked for guidance asto whether we should communicate information as to our intentions to the U.S. Military Attache.

PRISEC.Decypher.Sir M. Larapson (Cairo).7th March,1941.D. 10.43 a.ra. 7th March,R.    11.20 a.m.    7th March,1941.1941.No. 461.MOST IMMEDIATE.MOST SECRET.Following personal message for the Prime minister from General Smuts Cairo 7th March.I arrived here noon yesterday and saw Mr. Eden a couple of hours later on his return from Greece.I have seen the correspondence between you and him.7/e have fully discussed the situation and spent hours in conference with high Staff Officers and Commanders.These are my impressions.     We should not leave Greecealone at this grave juncture and the consequences of sucha step now might he worse in their effects in the balkans and on our cause generally than even a possible setbackin action.But the risk of such a setback is very real andarises mostly from our time-table.     Greeks&apos; and our owntardiness and the situation on the Canal may createserious position on Aliacmon Line in the next week or two.On the other hand the weather and Greek divisions at thefrontier may slow down the German advance.     If ourposition on Aliaemon Line does not break in the next fewweeks we have reasonable chance to build up a stablefront in Greece and immediate danger will pass.sueh a front would be a most important development andmay possibly become decisive.      I build no great hopes on Turkey and Yugoslavia in the immediate future but feelthat a firm British front in the Balkans would transformthe situation in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean basingenerally.      A dangerous situation would thus arise for germany which may even serjpusly affect her invasion plans.I would thus urge most strongly that this new frontI   be supported with all our strength.     Our chief immediateneed here is more aeroplanes and they should be sent asi   quickly as possible.      I am expediting another bomberfv squadron from South Africa and Beaverbrook should surely!   also disgorge from his hoard.Next in order I place tanks and guns for us and ourAllied.We are already grievously late and should now movewith all possible speed and not think too much of thatinvasion.Black as the prospect looks here at the moment I thinkit is still possible to transform this apparently promisingsituation for the Germans into disaster for them and fromthis front pave the way to victory.message.Kindest regards and thanks for your last personal(Copies sent to Prime Minister.)

In any case   .when all the British, troops available are operating with the greeks the position^ must;at all times be one of extreme gravity.(c) The Germans have, an almost unlimited number of divisions which in time they can utilise for an attackthrough Bulgaria through Yugoslavia or through Albania, andto these forces must be added the possibility of further reinforcements from italy (a).
(&amp;)   The Axis are moving oh interior lineswhile British reinforcements (apart from those -obviously limited in numbers - which may be available from African theatre of war) can arrive only at the endof a very lengthy sea-voyage except in the unlikely event of the Mediterranean route being available.Similar remarks apply to supplies, munitions andequipment of all kind. -(e) The German Air Force aided by Italian AirForce can be brought to bear in very great force upontroop concentrations, communications, port   of landing,transports and supply ships, and the Suez Canal.   british air action must necessarily be weak. .(f) The Italian fleet, perhaps reinforced by units ofGerman fleet, may be expected to make constant attacks uponsea communications, and these attacks both by sea and by-air will be facilitated by enemy control of islands flankingsea communications.(g) The Suez Canal may be expected to be the objectof constant attack and it might be prudent largely to discountthe use of the Canal.(h) His Majesty&apos;s*Government in Few Zealand.are not without apprehension that pressure by Germans might perhapslead to a rapid collapse of the Greeks, leaving the British Force in the air04.   Nevertheless having taken all these considerationsinto account His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand regard the first and last of the alternatives set out in paragraph6 of Secretary of. State&apos;s telegram No. SIM: as completelyunacceptable.   In particular they cannot contemplate thepossibility of abandoning the Greeks to their fateespecially after the heroic resistanoe with which theItalian invader has been met.   To do so would be to destroy .the moral basis of our cause and to invite resultsgreater in their potential damage to us than any failureof the contemplated operation.   In the circumstances there-fore they find themselves in agreement with the conclusions reached by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs nowapproved by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom which they consider to have been.the correct decision in amost difficult situation.:. ....... * -    . . &apos;   &apos; * *5.. With a full knowledge of the hazards to be run HisMajesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand align themselves withHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and agreewith the course new proposed.   In this dangerous enterprisethey are confident that the New Zealand troops will worthilyuphold their traditions and indeed would be the first to approve the decision now taken.6.
3.\Qo   In the light of the hazards involved howeverthey urge His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomand the authorities on the spot to direct the most careful attention firstly to the provision of the strongest possible sea and air escort for the transports and, secondlyto a full and immediate consideration of the means of withdrawl both on land and at sea should this courseunfortunately prove to be necessary.7o   Finally, His Majesty&apos;s Government in Few Zealandassume that the operation will not be undertaken unless thefull British Force contemplated can clearly be made available at the appropriate time eRepeated to Prime Minister of the Commonwealth ofAustralia No. 54 and repeated by Foreign Office to Cairo

SPECIAL (EDEN - PRIME MINISTER).Decypher.Sir M.

In Cairo telegram No. 463 we have given in full thereasons for our conviction that we must go ahead on the &quot;basisof the decisions reached in Athens.3.     Answers to your two points are I think implicit inthat telegram.4.     As to (l), the Greeks have throughout been determined to fight.      In these conversations they have consistently made it clear that they welcomed our help andfrom the first I was careful to make it plain that we wouldnot send help except in such conditions.     The question a tissue during the Athens discussions was not whether we shouldfight together, but where and how.5.     As to (2), we are all convinced not only that thereis a reasonable fighting change but that we have here anopportunity if fortune favours us, of perhaps seriouslyupsetting the German plans.     Very much depends on the air andit is our earnest   hope that you will be able to devise waypand means of supplying Longmore with the reinforcements he so badly needs.6.     Dill and Wavell have seen this telegram and concur.7.     We hope to leave here for home early next week

CABLEGRAM FORMiy ^ ^ ^Fadden 1 / H^CSindlier ]j -- ^Canberra ^ .-5*-I am sending you a complete copy of telegrams that have been passing on the question of aid to Greecet  ode wordsrefer to islands which it is proposed to take.     I have hada most anxious time over this matter but think I can say thatI have fully put to War Cabinet the points which would troubleyou.     Our military advisers discount the possibilities of a successful thrust by a German armoured force in North africa and there is complete confidence that the Benghazi front can beheld without interfering with the new project.     There is nodoubt that having regard to the facts stated in the telegramsthe proposition is not as good as it was.     In my opinion two considerations affected the decision of the War Cabinet here.The first was that Eden and Dill had made a written agreementwith the Greeks and the consequences of dishonouring such anagreement would be disastrous.     The second was that on theintrinsic merits of the matter great weight was to be attachedto the fact that notwithstanding the new and adverse circum-stances Eden Pill and Wavell   all of whom were on theap.ot&apos;111

2. mstill considered that though the adventure was hazardousthere was a reasonable prospect of success.     I pointed out to the Cabinet that while Australia was not likely to refuseto take a great risk in a good cause we must inevitablyfeel some resentment at the notion that a Minister not authorised by us should make an agreement binding upon us whichsubstantially modified a proposal already accented by us.     ThePrime Minister accepted this criticism very generously andin fact sent a private cable to Eden to the effect that he must be able to tell the Australian and New Zealand governments that the campaign was undertaken, not because of any commitmententered into by a British Cabinet Minister in Athens, but because the Chief of the General Imperial Staff and the commanders in Chief in the Middle East were convinced thatthere was a reasonable fighting chance.     In reply to thisthose in the Middle East have strongly re-affirmed their belief in the proposal.     They have also informed us that both Blarney and Freyburg are agreeable.     Subsequently avery strong cable has come in from Smuts at Cairo, after hehad fully discussed the situation with Eden and had spent

arranged is such that the first Australian units will not go into position in Greece much before the end of the month by which time many things may have happened. I should tellyou that -s* r anxieties on this matter have been fully appreciated by those here and the fullest consideration hasbeen given to the various? points not only in Cabinet but in long private discussions with the Prime Minister himself.One is still left with the final conclusion that though thehazards are considerable the proposal is by no means hopelessand that under these circumstances the overwhelming importancehours *n con*erence with high Staff Officers and Commanders.He expresses the very strongest view in favour of theproposal and thinks that it is still possible to transformthis apparently promising situation for the Germans intodisaster for them and from this front pave the way to victory.I attach high value to Smuts&apos; opinion and should add that though he is at present prevented by his Parliament fromadventuring South African troops outside the African continenthe intends to transfer South African troops to the Delta andso strengthen the defence of Egypt and Libya.     The timetable

4. 68to our position in relation to the world at large andparticularly America of not abandoning the Greeks who have of all our Allies fought the most gallantly should be the decisive consideration.     As the first echelons of troops are already on the water and will at regular intervals befollowed first by New Zealanders and then by Australians Iwould appreciate your early concurrence.     The utmost secrecyis of course,the essence of this adventure.MESIZIES8th March 1941.
