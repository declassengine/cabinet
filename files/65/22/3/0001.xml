MOST SECRET.It is requested that special care may betaken toensure, the secrecy of this document.COPY NO,ifW.JU  (41)  24th CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex0(5th March, 1941 - 50 30 pcmo)THE balkans and THEMIDDLE EAST,Future military policy,The War Cabinet had before them two personal and secret telegrams from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to / the Prime Minister (Athenstelegrams Nos0 312/and 313/J&quot;0The main facts recorded in these telegrams(previous reference:Wo Mo (41) 23 rdConclusions,Minute 3*)were as follows:-(1)(2)Ho Mo Ambassador in Belgrade had been to athens to meet the Foreign Secretary0    the ambassador had been sent back to Belgradewith a letter pointing out vrhat would beYugoslavia1s fate if she succumbed to german pressure0     If asked about thediscussions in Athens, Mr.  Campbell was authorised to reply that we knew the greeks intended to fighto     If Yugoslaviaintended to take this opportunity of co-operating,  the British military authoritiesin Athens would be ready to join in discussion with a Yugoslavian staff officer,,We had decided to support the Greeks with land and air forces as strongly and speedilyas possible3     Our effort would be a seriousone, and we considered that we had goodhopes of holding a line in   Greece.,The situation in Greece had deterioratedconsiderably,,     Deprived of the guidance ofGeneral Metaxas, General Papagos seemed tohave lost confidence.     He had not,  as wehad expected, begun the withdrawal of his troops in Macedonia to the Aliakhmon Line,,The Forsign Secretary and the Chief of theImperial General Staff had telegraphed tothe Commander in Chief, Middle East,  tocome to Athens for discussiono      He had arrived on 3rd March, and discussions hadbeen practically continuous during the afternoon and evening of 3rd March and during the 4th Marchc     The foreign secretary and his advisers had been faceiiwith the following alternatives(a)    To attempt to dribble up our forcespiecemeal to the Macedonian FrontierThis was the course which GeneralPapagos wished to see pursued,    We had refused to consider itDj   CopTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. &quot; g

(b) To accept the Greek offer of 16 to 23Battalions for the Aliakhmon line,instead of the 35 battalions which wehad been led to expect;    and to buildup our concentration behind this.(c) To withdraw our offer of military-support altogether,(3)   After some misgivings, the foreign secretary and his Advisers had reached agreement with the Greeks on solution (b)with the proviso that the command and organisation of the Aliakhmon line shouldbe entrusted to General Wilson.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Chiefs ofStaff had studied Athens Telegrams Nos. 312 and 313,He read an aide-memoire which contained their appreciation of the main changes in the situation.(See Appendix).The First Sea Lord recalled paragraph 7of their Report to the Cabinet (w.p .(4l) 39 Revise)dated 24th February, which read as follows:-&quot;0ur considered opinion is as follows:-The possible military advantages to be derived from going to the help of Greeceare considerable, though their achievementis doubtful and the   risks of failure are serious.     The disadvantages of leavingGreece to her fate will be certain and far reachxngo     Even the complete failureof an honourable attempt to help Greeceneed not be disastrous to our futureability to defeat Germany,,     A weightyconsideration in favour of going to Greeceis to make the Germans fight for what they want instead of obtaining it by default.,On balance we think that the enterpriseshould go forward&quot;.The First Sea Lord added that we were nowin possession of the Views of the three Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East, on our own time-table for taking up a position on the Aliakhmon line.But we had not received their appreciation of thetime it would take the Germans to reach that line.The Chiefs of Staff had now telegraphed to thethree Commanders-in-Chief -(a) Pressing for this appreciations(b) Asking for a report on the SuesCanal position.(c).   Asking for a report on the probableammunition situation during the proposedcampaign.      (The ammunition aspect had recently tended to disappear into thebackgrounds)

inUntil they had at least received an answer to (a)the Chiefs of Staff would he without the informationnecessary for a reasoned revision of their previousconclusions..TEE PRIME MINISTER recalled the written instructions given to the Foreign Secretary before he left London,70M.(41) 19th. authorising him not to hesitate to act on his own authorityConclusions,    if the urgency was too great to allow time for referenceMinute 1.        home.The Prime Minister said that over the week-end two new factors had. come into play-    First, the Castellorizzooperation had been a fiasco, and news had been received that the MANDIBLEsOperation could not be carried out untilthe movement of our forces to Greece was complete.   this meant that we should not be able to concentrate all ouravailable air forces against the German advance intoGreece.   Secondly, it had become evident that the airmenace to the Suez Canal had in no way been mastered.On the 3rd March he had sent a Personal telegram tothe Foreign Secretary,, ^This was read to the War Cabinet./The purport of this telegram was that the Foreign secretary should, conduct his negotiations on the basis that prepara-tions for the despatch of troops to Greece should proceed.On this basis the Foreign Secretary would, have a better chance of obtaining the co-operation of Turkey and Yugo-Slavia.   The Foreign Secretary&apos;s main appeal should beaddressed to the latter.   If Yugo-Slavia could be persuaded to make a sudden move into Albania, this might well meandisaster to the Italian forces.Although it had been decided that arrangements for the despatch ofour forces should proceed, the situation in the Balkanshad already deteriorated.   The Prime Minister had therefore suggested to the Foreign Secretary that he should so handlematters that it would still remain open to us to take a finaldecision on the despatch of forces to Greece and to liberate the Greeks from their undertakings .The Prime Minister then read a further personal telegram received from the Foreign Secretary.   The main points were that the Foreign Secretary saw no alternativebetween encouraging Greece to the best of our power to resist, and standing by and allowing her to collapsebefore German threats:   while the proposition was a toughone. neither he nor his advisers sa-vy any alternative todoing our best to see it through.The Prime Minister added that if the Greeks hadtaken any action, or entered into any commitments,on thestrength of undertakings received from us, then we shouldhave no alternative but to go through with the plan.But, so far as we could see, they had taken no such action.Indeed, they had not taken the steps which we had expected in withdrawing divisions from the Albanian and Macedonianfronts.   In his judgment it was still open to us, if on consideration this seemed the wisest course, to tell the greeks that we would liberate them from any undertaking which they had given to us.    It would follow, of course,that the Greeks would, be free to make terms with Germany.

The Prime Minister added that in the lightof the statement in telegram No. 313 our forces wouldhe engaged in an operation more hazardous than it had seemed a week ago.     It would certainly be necessaryto consult the Australian and New Zealand Governmentsagain before v/e committed them to a Balkan campaign. Itwould not, however, be right to put the main burden of adecision on those Governments.In the course of discussion, the followingpoints were made;-(1)   A further telegram (No. 314)&apos; from theForeign Secretary addressed to Belgradehad been received in a very corrupt state.It contained an additional argument which mr. Campbell had been instructed to use with the Yugoslav Government.(S)    T.HE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out thatMr. Campbell had been instructed to delivera message to the Yugoslav Government, in-forming them that we had decided to supportthe Greeks with land and air forces as strongly and as speedily as possible.   Weshould not be free to take a new decision until we knew the result of this move.(3)    THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thoughtthat Hitler&apos;s message to the TurkishGovernment was significant.     Probably hewas waiting until he knew what actionTurkey would take if the German forcesmoved into Greece.     As soon as he was certain on this point, an ultimatum wouldprobably be delivered to Greece.(4)    THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that if weabandoned Greece, this might have a bad effect on the position in Spain which was uncertain, and in North Africa  whereGerman infiltration was increasing.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the effect in Spain and North Africa would be worseif we landed in Greece and were drivenout, than if we remained masters of theDelta and seized the Dodecanese.(5)   General Papagos had said that it was quite impossible to make any withdrawalsfrom the Albanian Front, since his troopsthere were exhausted and greatly outnumbered.Was the significance of this that his troops could not face being taken away fromthe Albanian campaign and being put up against german forces?     Might not Greece, collapse inthe face of a German ultimatum?(6)   Doubts were expressed whether it would infact be possible for us to effect a concentra-tion on the Aliakhmon line. Although our first  light, of troops had left on 4th March, thetime-table of the despatch of troops wouxctnot be complete until 18th April.     As we saw the position, there seemed no hope that the -bulk of these troops could arrive there intime.

(7)   It was very difficult to reconcile the position,as seen from this end, with the very positivestatements in telegram 313; e. g, that our military advisers did not consider it &quot;by any means a hopelessproposition to check and hold the German advance on the Aliakhmon line.    This indicated a telegramof enquiry to the Foreign Secretary.(8)   It must &quot;be remembered that an undertaking to sendmilitary assistance to Greece had been made aspart of our effort to galvanize the Balkan Statesinto a combined resistance against Germany,Probably the Foreign Secretary had felt that unless he had reached definite decisions in had discussions at Athens, the Greek Government mighthave weakened, and the last chance to bring abouta combination of the Balkan States would inevitablyfailj   and that for this reason he had enteredinto a specific undertaking to send military support to Greece.    There was no reason why weshould not await the result of Mr. Campbellsmessage to the Yugoslav Government, although the answer was likely to &quot;be unfavourable.   Our troops would not begin to disembark until the 8th March,The War Cabinet decided as follows:-(i) It was generally agreed that the position had changed for the worse in several important respects, since it had beendecided to proceed with the despatch ofmilitary forces to Greece;   and that itmight well &quot;be necessary to reconsider thatdecision.    An immediate decision was notcalled for.    in the meantime the jpositionshould ho kept fluid and no further commitments entered into - more particularlyuntil we knew the Yugoslav Governmentsanswer to the message taken to them &quot;byMr. Camphell.(ii) The Prime Minister was invited to draft and despatch to the Foreign Secretary atCairo, a telegram setting out the doubtsexpressed in discussion in the War Cabinet,as to the wisdom of proceeding with the enterprise?- in particular did theprospects generally, and the help whichwe could bring to &quot;bear in the time available,justify   us    in persuading the Greeks to resist a German attack, if it was clearthat our own attempts to raise a Balkancombination had failed?(11-0 It was left to the Prime Minister todetermine whether a copy of the telegram in ($) should &quot;be sent to Sir   MichaelPalairet at Athens for his informationonly, hut with instructions not to acton it for the present.Great George Street, S, w, 1.

APPENDIX.AIDE MEMOIRE BY THE CHIEFS OP STAFFS,(See Page 2).The following appear to us to &quot;be theprincipal changes in the situation since the decision was taken to go full speed ahead with the Greekenterpriseo(l)   Our   envoys at their first interview withthe King of Greece and General Papagos reportedthat they were &quot;greatly impressed by the attitude and spirit&quot; of Papagos.     At their recent interview,they found him &quot;unaccomodating and defeatist&quot;, though he appears to have cheered up towards the end.    this change of attitude on the part of Papagos was perhapsonly to he expected in view of the German arrivalon the Greco-Bulgar frontier and of the failure ofany support from Yugoslavia.     Nevertheless, it is&quot;b&amp;und to react unfavourably on the fighting spiritof his Army,(2)   The Greeks undertook on February 21st to begin withdrawing their advance troops to the line which we should have to hold if the Yugoslavs werdnot willing to come in, and to start work immediately on improving communications in Greece to facilitate the occupation of this line.      Today (twelve days later) we learn that no withdrawl has commenced andwe gather that no work has been done.     In view ofthe paramount importance of the time factor, thisis serious.(3)   We were to have had 35 Greek battalionsto help us hold the line.     We are now told that weare to have only 16/23;    and it is very doubtfulwhether even all of these will arrive, since their withdrawal has &quot;been prejudiced hy the rapidity ofthe German advance.     But in addition to the 35battalions for which we had hoped, we had alwayscontemplated that the Greeks would be able towithdraw some divisions from their Albanian front.General Papagos now says that this cannot be done as they are &quot;exhausted and outnumbered&quot;.

(4)   We have always contemplated that MANDIBLESwould he captured before - or at least simultaneously with - the move to Greece.     We are now told thatMANDIBLES cannot be undertaken until the movement to greece has been completed.     This means that insteadof &quot;being able to concentrate all available air forces against the German advance, considerable air operationswill have to he conducted against MANDIBLES in orderto protect our lines of communication to Greece.(5)   The Greek enterprise has always &quot;been regarded as a hazardous operation.     In his telegramof the 21st February, the most that Mr. Eden could say of it was that &quot;they were not without hope thatit might succeed&quot;.     In his latest telegram he says that &quot;the operation is to be more hazardous than it seemed a week ago, though still not by any meanshopeless.&quot;(6)   The mining of the Suez Canal has become amore acute handicap.     It was to have &quot;been open on 3rd March, but the Germans put in ten more mines that day.     The Canal is now completely closed, and on past form may not he clear until 11th March.     this does not affect M.T. ships for the movement to greece, since they are North of the Canal, hut allpersonnel ships are South of it.     Consequently,until the Canal is open, personnel for Greece arebeing carried in men-of-war.     The whole forcecannot he dealt with in this manner.THE TIME FACTOR.We have estimated that one armoured andthree motorised divisons could reach the Bulgar-Greekfrontier on the 5th March, and in addition an infantry division by 11th March.     We furtherestimate that, assuming weak delaying action by the greeks in the Rupel area, the Germans could have two divisions there by ahout the 15th March, and concentrate the whole five divisons on the line &quot;by22nd March.We are now told that General papagosintends to fight in the Rupel area with three divisions.     We cannot think that this will imposeany great delay on the Germans, but we should knowP

more when we receive an answer from the Commandersin Chief, Middle East, to our telegram asking themfor their appreciation of the time factor.If our appreciation is correct, we should at the best have one armoured brigade and one NewZealand brigade to oppose the first two Germandivisons on the Veria line.

[THIS TELEGRAM IS OF PARTICULAR SECRECY AND SHOULD BERETAINED BY THE AUTHORISED RECIPIENT AND NOT PASSED ON]SPECIAL (EDEN-PRIME MINISTER)Decypher.     Sir M. Palairet, (Athens).March 5th, 1941.D.     4,5,a,m, March 5th, 1941,R,    9.55, a,m, March 5th, 1941.No. 512.    IMMEDIATE.------oOo------[Gr.ij.ndec.] Angora, Cairo.Following from Secretary of State for Prime Minister:Personal and Secret.My telegram unnumbered of March 1st to Belgrade fromIsmet.2.     His Majesty1s Ambassador, Belgrade, met me here on my arrival on March 2nd.     Mr. Campbell s view was thatYugoslavs are unsettled owing to internal political difficul-ties and frightened of Germany.     He thought, however, therewas a chance they might be ready to help if they knew of our plans for assistance to Greece.     He did not exclude thepossibility that our friend in his heart of hearts mayalready have made up his mind to act but was too nervous ofthe consequences of publicly committing himself yet.5.     At Tatoi we had considered informing our friend ofour plans for assistance to Greece but finally rejected theidea owing to the danger of leakage to the Germans.     Mr.Camphell&apos;s vie?/ was that if indication of our plans was givento our friend for his own personal and secret information, hecould he relied upon to keep it to himself.   In view of this and of the vital need to ascertain whether Yugoslavia wouldtake any action, I decided to send Mr. Campbell back toBelgrade by air today and to make the following communica-tions through him to our friend.4.     As soon as he can see our friend he is to hand him the letter from myself of which the following i&apos;s summary.After sympathising with our friend s difficult position Iemphasised Yugoslavia&apos;s fate if she succumbed to german pressure.   Turkey and Greece, if attacked, would resist by force.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and I had come out to discuss with our Greek and Turkish allies thedecisions to he taken.   I had hoped to meet him so as toinform him of the decisions reached, hut in the circumstancesMr. Campbell would bear a message.   I finally urged our friendto resist the Germans and join us and Greece in the attemptto withstand them*5.     If asked about our discussions in Athens, Mr.Campbell will reply that the British military authoritieshave been holding discussions with Greeks who we know intend
to fight.     If our friend intends to take this oppor-tunitv of co-operating and will send a staff officer to athens, the British military authorities will he veryreadv to join such discussions.6.    Mr. Campbell will add that we have decided tosupport the Greeks, with land and air force as stronglyand speedily as possible.   As the concentration of ourforce will take some time, we must, for the present,deploy it behind a covering position west of Salonica.Salonica itself will he covered by the Greek army in macedonia and as soon as we are in a position to do so,we intend to operate forward in co-operation with the greeks.     The prospects of a successful defence ofSalonica must largely depend upon the attitude of Yugo-slavia.   i*r. Campbell will emphasise that our effort insupport of Greece Ydll he a serious one, that we considerthat we have good hopes of holding a line in Greece and thatthe Yugoslav army will have the British army at its side.7.     A-r. Campbell also has discretion to make state-ment about Istria on the lines of paragraph 2 of ForeignOffice telegram Mo. 405.

We had&apos;expected that this withdrawal to the Aliakhmon line had already begun.     Instead we found that no movement had in fact commenced,Papagos/alleging that it had been agreed that the&quot; decision taken at our last meeting was dependent on the receipt of an answerfrom Yugoslavia as to their attitude.     He now stated that in viewof the German entry into Bulgaria the withdrawal was no longer -. -possible since his troops would risk being caught on the move..&apos;.&apos;    *.Moreover both he and the King stressed the fact that a withdrawal &apos;from Macedonia now must have serious internal political consequences by causing panic among the civil population.    Papagosalso stated that it was quite impossible to make any withdrawals   .from the Albanian front since his troops there*were all exhausted...,and greatly outnumbered. .     &quot;&apos;,-&apos;,3. &apos;     Papagps&apos;therefore ,proposed to hold the line offortifications near the Macedonian frontier with four divisions in Macedonia, although he [grp. undec.] they could not hold but -for long, and also simply to remain where he was on the Albanianfront..;    This: seemed an. admission of despair as : he-himself ....practically admitted. * &apos;&quot;4.     He proposed that British troops should, as they arrived,be moved up piece-meal to the Macedonian frontier line although ;it-was -unlikely&apos; that they could arrive in. time.    We. naturallyrefused&apos; to accept this ,prbposal which was so. entirely different from the conditions under which we had agreed to send our forces&apos;.,:We telegraphed to the Commander-in-ChiGf Middle East to come to athens for discussion.   .&apos;.&apos;.He\arrivedyes.terdtayt&apos;March .5rd and&quot; --.-discussions have been practically.continuous during afternoon and.,evening of March 3rd &quot;and tb-day March 4th.    As attitude of &apos; -&apos;----&apos;--&quot;Papagos was unaccommodating and defeatist, we had to enlist the aid*Gf-the King who was, throughout the very trying discussions which followed, calm, determined and helpful.
5.     By a process, which at times painfully resembled thehaggling of an oriental bazaar, we were finally offered 5 Greekdivisions (12th..from Macedonia, 20th from florina and newlyformed motorised division) together with battalions from WesternThrace, provided Turks would agree to release them,- and they arrived in time to hold position on Aliakhmon line until reinforced .byBritish troops.6.     We were thus faced with following alternatives:-(a) To accept the plan of Papagos to which he constantlyreturned, of attempting to dribble our forces piece-meal up to Macedonian frontier.(b) To accept 3 Greek divisions offered for Aliakhmon line,the equivalent of about 16-23 battalions instead of 35we had been led to expect on our previous visit and tobuild up our concentration behind this.    Against this we had to set the delay likely to be imposed by defenceof Rupel and other passes by the three, divisionsremaining in Macedonia.(c) To withdraw our offer of military support altogether.7.    We were agreed that course (a) could only lead to militarywavering while course (c) seemed equally disastrous, because it would inevitably lead to the rapid elimination of Greece from the war and because of the effect which the abandonment of Greece would have throughout the Near and Middle East as well as in the Empire and america..    Moreover we should have been faced with considerable&quot;difficulties in withdrawing our Air Force and other troops already in Greece.8. We therefore agreed Qfter some misgivings to solution (b)but with the proviso that the command and organisation of the wholeAliakhmon line was entrusted to General Wilson as soon as he was ina position to take it over.     This was agreed to.9.    Military Adviser while recognising the dangers and difficulties of this solution, did not consider it by any means ahopeless proposition to check and hold the German advance on this line which is naturally strong with few approaches.    At the worstit should always be possible to make fighting withdrawal from this line through country eminently suitable for rearguard action.10.    Most depressing feature of the situation is the attitudeof Papagos who. deprived of guidance of Metaxas, seems to have lostconfidence.    At final interview, however, after we had taken thedecision, he seemed to recover.11.    We are all sure that we have in a ver,y difficult situationarrived at correct deoision.     These two days have been indescribablyanxious.but now that decision has been taken there is a marked improvement in the general atmosphere on Greek side.     The hard fact remains that our forces, including Dominion contingents, will been gaged in an operation more hazardous than it seemed a week, ago. &apos;jYou will no doubt decide on any communications to be made to theDominion Governments.12.   Seo o o o o
12.     See also my immediately following telegram..15.     We will telegraph separately the agreed Frenchtext of decisions reached at the final meeting.14.     Later.     We have just heard that the TurkishGovernment agrees to release of the Greek troops mentionedin paragraph five above.

Prime Minister to,, Mr. Eden.Reference my immediately preceding telegram, followinis commentary of Chiefs of staff     Begins,,The following appear to us to he the principalchanges in the situation since the decision was taken togo full speed ahead with the Greek enterprise.-1. Our envoys at their first interview with the king of Greece and General Papagos reported that they were&quot;greatly impressed hy the attitude and spirit&quot; of Papagos.At their recent interview, they found him &quot;unaccommodatingand defeatist&quot;, though he appears to have cheered uptowards the end. This change of attitude on the partof Papagos was perhaps only to be expected in view of theGerman arrival on the Greco-Bulgar frontier and of thefailure of any support from Yugoslavia or Turkey,,Nevertheless, it is bound to react unfavourably on thefighting spirit of his Armyc20 The Greeks undertook on February 21st to beginwithdrawing their advance troops to the line which we shouldhave to hold if the Yugoslavs were not willing to come in,and to start work immediately on improving communications in Greece to facilitate the occupation of this line.Today (twelve days later) we learn that no withdrawal hascommenced and we gather that no work has been done.      Inview of the paramount importance of the time factor, thisis seriouso3o We were to have had 35 Greek Battalions to help ushold the line.      V/e are now told that we are to have threeGreek divisions and seven Battalions from Western Thracehut that these only amount to 23 battalions at most.     Withthe exception of the 12th Division these are all newlyformed and have not yet fought.       One of the divisions can hardly have any guns, while the remainder can only have captured Italian material0     But,  in addition to the 35battalions for which we had hoped, we had contemplated that the Greeks would be able to withdraw some divisions from their Albanian fronts     General Papagos now says thatthis cannot be done as they are &quot;exhausted and outnumbered&quot;.4. We have always contemplated that MANDIBLES would becaptured before - or at least simultaneously with - the move to Greece.     It now appears that MANDIBLES cannot beundertaken until the movement to Greece has been completed.This means that instead of being able to concentrate all available air forces against the German advance, considerableair operations will have to be conducted against MANDIBLESin order to protect our lines of communication to Greece.5. The mining of the Suez Oanal has become a more acutehandicap.       It was to have been open on 3rd March, but theGermans put in ten more mines that day.       The Canal is nowcompletely closed, and on past form may not be clear until11th March.     Only half of- the M.T. ships required for themovement to Greece,, are North of the Canal, and allpersonnel ships are South of it.     Even if personnel forGreece are carried in men-of-war, the whole force cannotbe dealt with in this xnaEJie.?,

THE TIME FACTOR.6. Me have estimated that one armoured and threemotorised divisions could reach the Bulgar-Greek frontieron the 5th March, and in addition an infantry division by11th March.     We further estimate that, assuming weakdelaying action by the Greeks in the Rupel area, the Germanecould have two divisions on the Alyakmon Line by about the15th March, and concentrate the whole five divisions thereby 22nd March.7.        We are now told that General Papagos intends to fight in the Rupel area with three divisions. Until we receive an answer to our telegram 64 we have no means of&apos; knowing how much delay will be imposed on a German advance,since much will depend on the strength of the position,the equipment and morale of the Greek troops, and on whether an effective scheme of demolitions has been prepared and can be executed.     If the delay imposed is short, weshould at the best have one armoured brigade and one NewZealand brigade to oppose the first two German divisions onthe Alyakmon line.CONCLUSION.8. Our conclusion is that the hazards of the enterprisehave considerably increased.     Neverthless, despite ourmisgivings and our recognition of a worsening of thegeneral situation we are not as yet in a position to question the military advice of those on the spot, who intheir latest telegram, describe the enterprise as not by&apos;any means hopeless. Ends.
