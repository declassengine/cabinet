THE PRIME MINISTER thought that we could congratulate-late ourselves on the number of troops evacuated from greece.    It might well be that our total losses,killed, wounded and prisoners, would be between 5,000and 10,000.    The concluding stages of the Greekcampaign had been a glorious episode in the historyof British arms.    The losses we had inflicted on theGerman troops had almost certainly exceeded our own:this notwithstanding that the withdrawal had been effected almost without air support.He felt no regret over the decision to send troops to Greece.   Had we not done so, Yugo-Slavia wouldnot now be an open enemy of Germany.  Further, theGreek war had caused a marked change in the attitudeof the United States.The Prime Minister said that we must now expect aperiod of great enemy activity in the Mediterranean.Attacks would be ma.de on Crete and Malta, andprobably West Africa and Gibraltar.   The enemy&apos;s plan was, no doubt, to base strong air forces on Creteand Rhodes, which would be used to attack our surfaceforces off the Libyan coast.    If the enemy couldprevent our surface forces from operating in theEastern Mediterranean, they could hope to use the ports in Cyrenaica sufficiently to build up heavyforces for an attack on   Egypt.       The airmenace was the greatest menace which we had to face.THE chief OF THE AIR STAFF gave particulars of our air squadrons at present in Egypt.   We had 3 Hurricanesquadrons, 3 Blenheim squadrons, 4 Wellingtonsquadrons, 1 Wellesley squadron, 2 squadrons for army co-operation.    In addition, 2 Tomahawk and 4 Marylandsquadrons were forming.    &quot;23 Hurricanes had recentlyreached Malta by a special operation, . -THE PRIME MINISTER sai- that since the previousNovember we had used every possible means to sendair reinforcements out to the Middle East.   Untilthe beginning of November the position in thiscountry had not  enabled us to send forces away fromthe home front.0;fTHE BALKANS ANDTHE MIDDLE EAST.(previous reference:W.M.

Reference was made to the fact that since the 19t&amp;April, 13 ships were reported to have sailed forBenghazi from Tripoli,,THE PRIMS MINISTER said that while the Navy hadbeen engaged in the evacuation of our forces from greece, it had not been possible to stop the enemyconvoys. But now that evacuation was over, the navy would be in a position to devote more attention tothis essential activity.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the operation SALIENThad now been carried out. GLOUCESTER was now at malta, and the Cin-O. Mediterranean had receiveda reinforcement of 6 destroyers to operate againstthe Tripoli supply line.Some discussion ensued as to the use by the enemy of Benghazi harbour, notwithstanding the fact that wehad not been able to use it.The War Cabinet ?ere informed that Benghazi harbourwas too wide to block.   We had destroyed all thecranes there, but the enemy was, no doubt, dis chargirgfrom lighters -.    The reason why we had not been able to useBenghazi harbour hadbeen that we had not sufficientA.A. defence to protect that port as well as Tobruk.Reference was made to the position of Crete, andparticulars were given of our forces.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had sent atelegram to General Wavell to tell him that he thoughtan attack on Crete was imminent, and to ask what werehis plans.   He (the Prime Minister) was somewhatdoubtful o&quot;.f our ability to hold Crete against a prolonged attack.In reply to a question, the Prime Minister saidthat the battalion which had landed on Lemnos had beenwithdra.wn when the Germans had taken Salonika. - There hadno   lonsor  been       any purpose in holding Lemnosonce the Germans were free to launch air attack fromSalonika.   The Germans were now occupying otherislands in the Aegean.   We had not the strength tohold these islands against the air attack which couldbe directed a.gainst them.Street, S .W.1.-S-
