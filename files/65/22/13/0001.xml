possibledestinationof the GreekGovernment.The War Cabinet were informed that the GreekGovernment intended, if they had to leave-Greece, togo to Crete in the first instance.      They feared.,,--&quot;&quot;&quot;however, that they might be bombed out of Crete, andthey had asked whether we would be willing to allow them a small section of Cyprus in which to exercisejurisdiction (Telegram Noc 703 from Athens)0      Therequest for jurisdiction had not been conceded.    but after discussion at the Defence Committee theprevious day, a reply had been sent that we should beprepared to afford facilities in Cyprus,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that a further telegram had now been received which made it plain thatthe Greek Government attached great importance totheir having a small piece of territory which they couldcall their own and in which they could exercisejurisdiction,,      The next few days might well be verydifficult ones for the Greek Government and he was anxious not to send a refusal to a request about whichthe Greek Government felt strongly.,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat there was a strong party in Cyprus which wanted the Island to be annexed by Greece,,      If the King of greece was allowed to exercise jurisdiction over partof the Island, the Governor&apos;s position would become an impossible one.      Why could not the King go to alexandria or Jerusalem?After diission, the War cabinet agreed, that the Foreign Secretary should send a telegram to the effect that we agreed that the right plan was that theGreek Government, if they had to leaveGreece, should go to Crete in the firstinstance; and that we would be ready todiscuss the Cyprus project with them at alater date,,ibya.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War CabinetTelegrams 0/55613 and 0/55527 dated 10th and 13th Aprilfrom General Wavelie      The second of these telegramsgave the latest situation and the dispositions of ourforcescThe War Cabinet was Informed that it was thought that the Germans had two armoured divisions in libya and there was a report that a third was nowarriving in Tripoli,-,     There was also probably a weakItalian armoured division0The Prime Minister said that in his viewthings in Egypt were serious but not desperate,,     Therewas no cause for the alarm such as had already shown itself in certain elements in the United States.      Theenemy were using a line of communication severalhundreds of miles long to maintain a small but highlymechanised force-     Provd.ded \n could cut the.. Germancolumn from its bases, .vc was within our power to turndefeat into victory.In his view, it was essential that we should hold firmly on to Tobruk and, if necessary, shouldreinforce its garrison strongly.     He had seen one or

two phrases in a telegram from General Wavell dated 9th April (0/55526) which had rather disturbed him. But a telegram despatched on the ensuing day (0/55613) had rather reassured him. The garrison at Tobruk must be regarded as a weapon to strike at the enemy&apos;s communications.

Mr MENZIES said that, in order to enable our force at Tobruk to use it as a sally port to harry the enemy&apos;s communications, the garrison would have to be provided with striking weapons. He asked whether Tobruk was regarded as as strong a fortified position as Bardia.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had been present at the discussion between the Commanders-in-Chief at which this matter had been considered. It had been decided to hold Tobruk among other ? because the harbour there was much better than the harbour at Bardia, and there were adequate supplies of stores at the former, and ? at the ?

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that one of the difficulties of the defence of Tobruk would be to keep fighter aircraft in action from the limited aerodromes within the defences. There was a risk that these aerodromes would be bombed at night, and if we could not send up fighter aircraft we should, have inadequate protection against enemy dive-bombers, who would operate from El Adam  close by. We could operate our bombers round Tobruk from aerodromes in Egypt; but if we lost the aerodromes within the Tobruk defences we could not maintain a fighter defence in that area.

Continuing, THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was absolutely vital that steps should be taken to cut the enemy&apos;s communications from Italy and Sicily with Tripoli. Unless these communications were cut, the enemy could bring superior armed forces to bear against us, w ith most serious consequences. The stakes were high, and the Navy must be prepared, to suffer heavy losses in order to cut the energy line of communication.

The Prime Minister read, to the War Cabinet the draft of a Directive which he had prepare on this matter, the terms of which would be discussed further with the Service authorities before it was finally issued.

In discussion on the Middle East, reference was made to the internal situation in Egypt.   The question was raised, whether any steps could, be taken to improve the position.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY undertook to consider a suggestion that we should not neglect the influence which the ? Party might be able to exercise.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements.

The Government of India had undertaken to send a force comprising three brigades.The^convoy was now on the way.      Several of H.M.Lips were already at Basra, and others were on theway.The question arose whether we should notifyRashid Ali that we proposed to land troops or shouldland without warning.     We had the right under our treaty to pass troops through Iraq on notice being given.      If we gave notice, this would affordRashid Ali an opportunity of giving orders that our troops should be allowed to land unopposed.The matter had been considered that after-noon by a Meeting under the Chairmanship of theSecretary of State for IndiaT^ which had recommendedthat our Ambassador should approach Rashid Ali,  claimingtreaty right of entry-; and offering provisional recognitionin return? but making it clear that we meant to land inany case-. He rhould have (discretion what notice he should give, but should   allow little time for counter-preparations.      The Committee added that the navalcovering, and air demonstration from Shaiba   should enable a landing to be made against such emergencyopposition as might be offered.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF raised thequestion of what instructions should be given theAir Officer Commanding Air Forces in Iraq, whoseheadquarters were at Habbaniya.     Clearly he wouldbe entitled to use force to resist any attack on theRoyal Air Force station at Habbaniya.     But shouldhe threaten or, if necessary, employ force againstBaghdad, in order to overawe the Iraais .   He (the1Chief of the Air Staff) proposed that the Air OfficerCommanding should be instructed to act in this mattorin consul catLon with our Ambassador until the GeneralOffice Commanding in charge of the troops from india had landed, and thereafter should act in Consultationwith the General Officer Commanding.-1-/ Cj7 ,[ &amp;f*t ****** -.

The War Cabinet:-(1) Approved the recommendation at &quot;A&quot;above, that our Ambassador should give notice to Rashid Ali on thelines proposed of our intention toland troops, and should have discretion as to the amount of notification to be given.(2) Invited the Chief of the Air staff to concert with the Foreign secretary the terms of the instructions to besent to the Air Officer Commanding,Habbaniya, on the lines indicated.Great George Street, S.W.I.
