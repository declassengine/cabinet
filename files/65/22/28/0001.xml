(41) 61stConclusions,Minute 3.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that a number of telegrams had passed during the weekend about the United States Government&apos;s decisionto reinforce and ultimately to relieve the british garrison in Iceland,President Roosevelt was now satisfied withthe form of invitation which the Icelandic Governmentwere prepared to send to the United States, subject tocertain quite minor changes.     A telegram had beensent to our representative   in Iceland saying that weconcurred in what was proposed.The Foreign Secretary said it had besn necessaryto decide whether we should ask for an explicit provision that,after our land and air forces in Iceland had been relieved by the United States forces, we should still have facilities for basing naval and air forces onIceland.     He had thought that it was undesirable tocomplicate a difficult situation by raising thispoint at the present stage and had, therefore, decidedto make no mention of it.     He did not think that itwould give rise to difficulties when the time came.There was every reason to hope that within,say, a week&apos;s time an announcement might be made ofthe arrival of the first American troops in Iceland.The War Cabinet took note with approvalof the action taken in this matter.Great George Street, S.W.I,1st July, 1941.
