(41)  59TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential   Annex.(Friday, 11th April, 1941 - 11.30THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR/FOREIGN affairs said that when he and the Chief of/the Imperial GeneralStaff had set out they hadjfea^ 55-vi-ew the dual role(1)  in the political sphere of establishing a front inthe Balkans; (2) in the military of enquiring what could he&apos;done to send speedy help to the Greeks if they wanted it.Discussions in Cairo.On their arrival in Egypt they had had talks with the three Commanders-in-Chief who had takenrnuch thesame view of &apos;&apos;&quot;ke situation in the Middle East as we hadtaken at home;   namely, to see if we could build up acommon front.    General Y/avell, however, had had doubts about the desirability of Turkey&apos;s early entry intothe war in view of her weakness, and of the fact thatit would mean further calls by her on our limited resources.    The Commanders-in*-Chief had also felt that in *the circumstances we must continue to give help tothe Greeks so far as our resources permitted.As to military help, General Wavell had thoughtthat two divisions plus one armoured brigade could besent immediately,    At a later date he could send anotherdivision plus the Polish Brigade and, later on still,perhaps another armoured brigade.     As to air assistance,Air Chief Marshal Longmore had proposed to re*-equip at once with Hurricanes&apos; the Gladiator Squadrons then in Greece andto   send some Blenheim Squadrons.     .t the end of March hs   -had proposed to send two more fighter squadrons,    He had,however, been unable to fulfil this programme owing tothe heavy calls made upon our resources for other Middle Easttheatres,,      Admiral Cunningham had undertaken to giveprotection to convoys;    an undertaking which he hadamply fulfilled. ^  . ^ &amp;^/JfTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he/had thendiscussed with the Commanders-in-Chief, the question ofthe line to be held in Greece.    There had been threealternatives:-(l)    The Metaxas line.(2)    The Struma Valley line, and(3)    The Aliakmon line.

The first alternative had &quot;been ruled out at once &quot;but no final decision had been taken between the other two until,they had visited Greece,Tatoi Meeting.JAfter his talks with the Cornmanders-in-Ghief/he,\*had then seen the King of Greece.,and the Prime Minister atTatoi, secretly.    The King hadg^fsked to see him alone andhad said that the Greeks would f ightj, no matter who attackedthem or whether or not they received assistance,,     He had seemed slightly resentful that there should be any doubt upon this pol-nt.    The Grerk Prime Minister had then given him a written document containing this statement.    The questionof assistance to Greece had then been discussed and the greeks had said they would welcome &quot;heLp.     The Joint Staffs bar1,then discussed which line should be held and had agreed onthe third alternative i. e. the Aliakmon line.     As partiof the arrangement reached at Tatoi, it had been agreedthat the Greeks should withdraw their four divisions in macedonia and Western Thrace, bring them back to theAliakmon line, and start work on the defences,,Angora Discusssi ons.After this talk with the Greeks, he (Mr0 Eden)and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had gone to turkey.    It had been necessary to tell the Turks thatthe bulk of our assistance would be given to the greeks and that there would be very little left for them.    TheTurks had, however, agreed that this decision was soundfrom a military point of view.    The Turks had also saidthat they would not take any offensive action outside their ov/n borders and he had not pressed them on this pointsHe had endeavoured to persuade the Turks to make the invasion of Greece a   ca.sus belli but had got no definite answer to this suggestion.The attitude of the Turkish Government and theTurkish people had been extremely friendly and stout-hearted,but he had thought that they did not appreciate the dangerssurrounding them.    Their technical efficiency struck him as very low and the army as pre-1914.While at Angora he had had a visit fromSir Stafford Cripps, Largely as a result of Sir Stafford&apos;sinitiative the Turkish Government had approached theSoviet Government, and had asked them what would be theattitude of Russia   if Turkey was attacked,,    The answer tothis question had been satisfactory.    This had been a usefulpiece of work.Official vist to Greece.At the end of the Turkish conversations he andthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff had paid an officialvisit to Greece,,    On arrival there they had been shocked to

find that the four divisions in Macedonia and WesternThrace had not been withdrawn to the Aliakmon line.In the intervening period, Germany had occupiedBulgaria3 the Greeks said that to withdraw these divisions was politically impossible and would causepanic amongst the local population,,    Further, the troops were local troops and, whilst they would fight bravelyin Macedonia and Western Thrace, they would not fightso well in other parts of Greece.    The Greeks thenagreed, in place of these four divisions, to providethree othersc    Two of these divisions were now on theAliakmon Line, but the third was not being used as general Wilson did not think it sufficiently trained,,About this time. (6th March) they had feared that a German attack might be launched in a very fewdays, with the result that the Greeks and our owntroops (of whom few had then arrived) might be rolledup.General Wilson had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of our forces and had immediately won theconfidence of the Greeksn    He had been given command of all the tr 3j;s on th&amp; Aliakmon. Line.Cairo.   JffeetIng with General Smuts.After their official visit to Greecehe (the Foreign   Secretary)       and the Chief of theImperial General Staff had returned to Cairo where theyhad met General Smuts and,  with him and the Commanders-in-Chief, had reviewed the decisions which had been arrivedat in Greece.    General Smuts had fully approved of these decisions.Yugoslavia.The next anxiety had been the position in yugoslavia, for if the Germans came down throughYugoslavia there was a great danger of the Aliakmon Linebeing turned. He bad msde every possible endeavour to get in touch with the Yugoslav Government, but had failed.All the &quot;Jugoslavs would consent to do was to send down / ,one Staff Officer to Athens to interview General Vtf&amp;loonTeNChief of Staff0Cyprus Meeting.In an endeavour to get the Yugoslav Governmentto take some action he had arranged a meeting with theTurkish Foreign Minister in Cyprus.    There, M. Sara^ogluhad agreed to a very satisfactory formula which he had promised to send to Belgrade, and he had left Cypruswith thfe inte.ntion0    But immediately after he had left,the situation in Yugoslavia had deteriorated, and His lurkish.Foreign Minister had used this as an excuse not to deliver his assurance to the Yugoslavs.    No doubt hehad also experienced $eras difficulty with other membersof the Turkish Government.

Yugoslavia.   The coup dfetat.-  THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that ho Had madaa further attempt to get in touch with prince Pauland had sent him a personal letter &quot;by a Member of the embassy Staff at Cairo, but nothing had come of this effort&quot;    His own view  was that Prince Paul was (on themost favourable interpretation)too weak a character to face his responsibilities.   He and the Chief of theImperial General Staff had then started&apos;to return home,but whilst at Malta news had come of the Yugoslaveoup d&apos;etat and they had thereupon returned to Athens.Tkere the Greeks had requested that he should endeavourto establish   contacts with Yugoslavia but again he had-^Ls(* tLe.   \ fotad great difficulty,- for the Yugoslavs had been afraid-y   fl a Croat rioing.    It eventually had been agreed that thealZUu^U if-O.I.G.S. should see General Simovitch and that StaffUfarCZ fLavMoLX Talks should take place at florina immediately. But&amp; appeal&amp;*** &quot;/4a*a / when the Yugoslav Officers had arrived at florina it/*( itoe*$ hadbaenf ound that their instructions were too limited to/   be of any use.Summing Up.The Foreign Secretary said that he saw theposition as follows:-(l) Hitler&apos;s plan in the early spring had been to over-run all the Balkans by peacefulmethods.   He had hoped to deal with greece and Yugoslavia as he had dealt with roumania and Bulgaria.(S) Having secured bases in the Balkans, he meant to attack our positions in the eastern mediterranean, neutralising Turkey andintimidating Russia.(3) This plan had, to some extent, beer, jretardnc  .and thrown out of gear by the Greekresistance and the Yugoslav coup flTetat,which would not have taken place hut for the help which we had given to Greece.(4) The Germans would now try to carry out by force the plan whicsh they had intended to effect by intimidation.    They would accompanythis with as strong an attack on our pOsit&amp;nsin Cyrenaica   as they could nourish throughTripoli.(5) It was of the utmost importance that we shouldtake all possible steps to attack the enemysupply line through Iripoli. and should furnish General Wavell during the next fewmonths with his main needs, .which were modern-.aircraft.*--armour-ed--^ehj^xlasT and-r-in-particular, cruiser tanks.

Meeting with. General SimovitohoTHE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL ST AW supplementedthe Foreign Socrc:-tarj:.n &apos;jti^tement by reposing cex Ms meeting v thGeneral Simovitc:,.    This meeting had lasted three nours&quot;put it had been greatly interrupted by telephone calls,and messages from other people.    He had been told that only three Yugoslav Divisions were concentrated on the southernborders of Yugoslavia, and that mobilisation was going onsatisfactorily.    General Simovitch had at first agreedto sign a document which would constitute a basis for Staffconversationso    On. the ensuing day he had withdrawn and said that he was not ready to sign.    Finally, after great pressure, he had undertaken to send a staff officer with powers to draw.up a joint plan with the Greeks andourselvesc   But the Officer viho had been sent had not infact been armed with adequate powersc    The reason for thesehesitations had been the internal situation ia yugoslavia and the fear that the Croats and Slovenes would run out.General Simovitch sraia fh v.o cerse a dictator,and had to refer everything to his Government.Western Desert.Turning to Cyrenaica, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that the appreciation received that morning from General Wavell (0/55613)7 corresponcledgenerally with the discussions which had taken place in cairo.    General Wavell&apos;s chief anxiety was lest he shouldbe threatened with serious air attack on Cairo and hisother basest    Work was going on night and day to get the armoured fighting vehicles out of the workshops.Points in discussion:-(1) The development of .,,the German attack on Cyrenaica *THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he and some of hiscolleagues had been somewhat surprised at the rapidity andforce with which the attack had developed in Libya ; in face of the telegrams which had been received to the effectthat this attack was not thought to present any immediateor serious danger.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF agreedthat at first it had not been thought that the attack would be made in great force.)    It was now clear that theGermans had assembled a considerably stronger force in libya that, we had reckoned ona    The force was nowbelieved to comprise one armoured and two mechanisedGerman divisions, plus probably one Italian armoured division.    Our plan, had been that, while the AustrianDivision should hold the escarpment behind Benghazi (we hadbeen reconciled to losing the town of Benghazi itself),the 3rd Armoured Brigade, with an Indian MotorisedBrigade in support, should harass the enemy&apos;scommunications if he laxmched an attack; without howeverbecoming too deeply committed.

It had been lnevitatole-tha.-k--the 7i^armoured division should go back to Egypt to refit? as the work could not be done in the forward area.    It seemed clearthat we had lost practically the vifoole of the 3rd AanouredBrigade, which included about 50 oruiser tanks, 50 light &quot;--^tanks and a force equipped with 50 captured Italian tanks.We did not yet know exactly how the operations harideveloped, but there was a rumour that part of our forces,falling back near Mechili^ had hoped to  find a dump of petrol which had been destroyed.THE SECRETARY CP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtit was rather disconcerting that this comparativelylarge armoured force had apparently been outmanoeuvred by theenemy.(2) Position of our troops at Tobruk.MR, MENZIES thought that the operations which hadtaken place showed that the capacity of the German armoured divisions had been gravely underestimated.   This made himvery uncomfortable about the position of our forces inTobruk.   The perimeter was too large and scattered to be strongly held by the relatively small forces now in that area.They had only a handful of tanks with which to beat . off anattack by an armoured division.   If the harbour were mined,how could they be evacuated? Was it certain that Tobruk was theright place to make a stand?THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thatour force in Tobruk was well furnished with supplies andwith anti-tank guns, and was well off in artillery.   He was satisfied that they could put up a strong defence there.In reply to further questions he doubted whether therewas a serious danger of the enemy by-passing Tobruk, except with very light forces.    They would have difficulties withthe supply of water and of petrol, while our forces inTobruk could strike at their communications.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION thought that itwas important that our military advisers should develop some new plan i for the defence of Tobruk.   Otherwise there wasa    risk that we might suffer disaster there as atBenghazi.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the Germans, in developing such an attack, wouldbe faced with three difficulties which we had notexperienced in our attaok.   They haa not got air superiority.   They had not got command of the sea;    andthey would not be helped, as we had been, by large dumpsof captured enemy material.   He thought there was no step which could be taken to strengthen the position in Tobrukwhich was not already in hand.

(3)   Possibilities of interrupting the enemy supplyline to Tripoli,THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said thatdestroyers had &quot;been sent to Malta to raid the convoys.The normal practice seemed to he for enemy convoys to assemble at Palermo, passing round the western endof Sicily and down the Tunisian coast.    3 additionalsubmarines had also been sent to work in this area and 8more would be sent.    This would make a very strongforce.    The possibility of further operations againstTripoli was also being investigated.    The Navy wasacting on the basas that action to prevent the enemybuilding up a large force in Tripoli, was the primary object at the present time.    Beaufort aircraft were also being sent out to attack convoys on passage andWellingtons would be used to bomb Tripoli harbomvDiscussion ensued as to the possibility ofthe Mediterranean Fleet interfering with convoyscTHE FIRST SE^ LORD pointed out that it wasthree days1 sailing from Alexandria to the a rea inquestion.    It was not possible,  therefore, for our ships to arrive in time to intercept convoys, even if newswas received the moment they sailed.    If our shipsremained in the area for, say, four or five days, theenemy would then cease to send convoys during thatperiod, and would rush them across as soon as our Fleetreturned to its base.    There were   2 enemy cruisers and 8 destroyers in Tripoli harbour.    It was the enemy&apos;spractice to send an air escort of Messerschmitts 110to cover their convoys.The air position in the Eastern Mediterraneanwas then explained.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that Maltahad to be filled with fighter aircraft in order tomaintain itself against its unfavourable geographical position close to Sicily, where a large bomber force could be assembled.    If our fighter aircraft flew away   from Malta, they left Malta itself liable to enemy attack.   The radius round Malta over which fights;?aircraft could operate did not extend far enough toenable them to intercept enemy transport aircraftcarrying personnel or stores to Cyrenaica.In reply to a question, it was explained thatthe main differences between the position in the central mediterranean and the position round our own shores were:&apos;-First,  that near our coasts our ships could operate underthe umbEella of our land-based fighter force:    Secondly,that from this country we could bring a very large forceof bombers to operate against the ports, such asRotterdam, from which invasion might be launched, or against any seaborne expedition nearing these shores.Reference was made to the possibility of operating Aircraft Carriers in the central Mediterranean.

(PreviousReferencetW.M.(41) 33rdConclusions,Minute 8.)It was pointed out that there were large areas inwhich these craft would he within range of enemyfcvg-bombing attack, against which they would have Arrdefence except the carrier-borne fighters.   An aircraft carrier could keep, say, 6 fighter aircraft in theair continuously, but this number would not be sufficientto beat off a strong enemy force, which could attackat its own chosen moment0(4) Armoured Fighting   Vehicles in the Middle East,The main conclusion which emerged from this discussion was that we could not be certain ofinterrupting the enemy supply line to Tripoli,    Further,despite the sinking of 150,000 tons of shipping, theenemy had built Up a strong force in Libya,    It wastherefore of the utmost importance to do all we could to meet General Wavell&apos;s needs in armoured fighting vehicles.    We should proceed on the basis that furtherheavy reinforcements might be brought against our forces in the Western Desert, and that we must be ina position to meet them.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEasked whether steps should be taken to collectspecially skilled men in this country, and fly them out to Egypt so as to accelerate the flow of repairedtanks from the workshops,THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat a telegram had been sent from Egypt asking for skilled men to be sent out.THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that 2 Ordnance Companies were included in ConvoyW. S,6, due to arrive in the Middle East on the 23rdApril, and a further Ordnance Company in the nextConvoy, due to arrive on the 7th May,MR. MENZIES said that he doubted whether wefully realised what the Germans could achieve with theirarmoured divisions,    A mere enumeration of so manydivisions meant nothing.    It was the machines with whichthe forces were armed which counted.    He asked whetherit would not be wise for us to concentrate more of ourman-power on the production of tanks even though   thiswould involve reducing the number of. Infantry divisions.-THE SECRETARY .OF STATE FOR:.

It is essential to hold enemy as far west aspossible to reduce air threat to naval base at Alexandriaand other bases in Egypt, also because of moral effect on egypt of further enemy advance.2.     We can undoubtedly hold enemy for some time atTobruk but position is not good one to hold indefinitely.It is not naturally strong, existing Italian defences are too extended for forces available and water supply isvulnerable.3.     Enemy&apos;s superiority in mobile forces and his bolduse of them is driving our aircraft back behind Sollumescarpment which reduces support they can afford.,    Thereare landing grounds inside Tobruk defences but use of them is limited.4.     Harbour may be rendered unuseable by mining orheavy air attack, there are large supplies available inTobruk already, but reinforcement or withdrawal by sea may become difficult or costly.5.     On other hand enemy1s difficulties will be considerable though he seems to be partly overcoming themby use of transport aircraft.     Troops in Tobruk are in good heart and full of fight and prepared to hold onindefinitely.     Do not think enemy can continue pastTobruk towards Egypt except with light raiding forces.6.     To sum up, I propose to hold Tobruk, to place forcein Bardia-Sollum area with as much mobility as possible toprotect communications and act against flank or rear of enemy attacking Tobruk and to build up old plan of defence in Mersa Matruh area.     Distribution of force so as to gaintime without risking defeat in detail will be difficultcalculation.     My resources are very limited especially ofmobile and armoured troops and of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons.      It will be a race against time.7.     Longmore is building up reserve air striking forceeast of Mersa Matruh and hopes to bring heaviest scale air attack as enemy advances.C.4.  (Telegrams). Copies to:- V.C.I.G.S.  8 copies)M.0.5.
