These were that there should heno major offensive operations on the Continent in1942 unless we intended to stay there? and unless a crack in German morale was evident.   As to theoperation itself, if it had &quot;been possible to force (a) lodgement in the heavily defended Pas-de-Calaisarea and, at the same time, to effect simultaneouslandings at many other points on the French coast,the losses which would inevitably he incurred in the pas-de-Calais would be compensated by our ability to make firm lodgements elsewhere,   In presentcircumstances, however, operations on such a scalewere out of the question in 1942.The Chiefs of Staffs report dealt with the implications of mounting SLEDGEHAMMER *   Since the mount-ing process would take up to two months an immediate decision was necessary unless the operation    was to boregarded as abandoned for 1942,     The shipping impli-cations, although considerablef wore not intolerable, buttho effect on ROUND-UP training would be very serious andwould put hack that operation for two or three months.In the above circumstances, it seemed that theright policy would be not to abandon SLEDGEHAMMERaltogether, but only to make such preparations for itas would enable us. to deceive the enemy, but not at the^expense of interference with ROUND-UP. \THE WAR CABINET agreed with this view.

It had &quot;been agreed in Washington that shouldContinental operations in 1942 prove impracticable,we should immediately consider what could he doneelsewhere.   Operation GYMNAST offered considerableattract ions, at the present time, and the president had always expressed the keenest desire to carry it out.   If, as now seemed possible&apos;, the position inEgypt was held, a threat to Rommel1s rear might cause the.Axis considerable embarrassmento   If, moreover,we could obtain control of the French North African-coast, including particularly the air fields there,the whole situation in the Mediterranean would befe?ansformed,   GYMNAST might absorb   a force of theorder of 6 American Divisions, 2 of which might bornefrom this country, with possibly a spear head ofBritish assault troops*   French resistance would haveto be assumed, but if faced with superior force,it was unlikely to be sustained,THE WAR CABINET expressed general agreement as to the desirability of going ahead with OperationGYMNASToAs a counterpart to operations in North Africa,a lodgement in Northern Norwayj carried out if possiblein conjunction with the Russians, had much to commend it0   He (the Prime Minister) had discussed thepossibilities on several occasions With the Chiefs ofStaff but, so far, the latter had found the difficultiesinsurmountable.   Nevertheless, operations in northern norway, where there were powerful elements waiting toco-operate with us, offered such attractivepossibilities from so many points of view that it seemed desirable that no effort should be spared towork out a practicable plan,THE WAR CABINET fully agreed with this view,THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Chiefs ofStaff had carried out a most intensive study of thisproblems From whatever direction theprohlem was approached, certain fundamental   andso far insuperable difficulties presented themselves -(i) To be successful, an operation inNorthern Norway was dependent on ourestablishing an air striking force at murmansk.   In view of our recentexperiences with the P,Q, Convoys, it was by no means certain that this could bedone o(ii) We should have to gain control of allenemy air fields between Petsamo and Narvikby separate simultaneous operations.This would entail operations on a large scale..

(iii) Even if we established Fighter squadrons at Murmansk, they could only givefighter protection at Petsamo andKirkenes, and wo should he forced to rely upon fighter cover by aircraft, carriers for the operations to capture the remaining air fields0(iv) The naval forces required for these operations were beyond our presentcapacity and, irrespective of the factthat we had not available sufficientcapital ships and carriers.to giveadequate protection to the expeditions,the drain on our anti-submarine craftwhich would have to be withdrawn from theWestern Approaches was quite unacceptahle^(v) Finally, even if the troops got ashore,they would be unaccustomed to Arcticconditions and would be opposed by anenemy who had become acclimatized tothese conditions during the last twoyears,THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF andTHE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF gave details of theestimated enemy forces in Northern Norway  and adjacentterritory o      These were 5 Divisions, 2 of which werefacing the Russians in the Murmansk area, with thepossibility of rapid reinforcements by a further 3Divisions?  and 255 first-line aircraft, of which about150 were probably scrviceablooAfter further discussion, THE WAR CABINET -(l) Gave general approval to the Hoto by the&apos;   Chiefs of Staff dated 7th July (appendix: IE).(2) Agreed that, although the conditions whichwould make SLEDGEHAMMER a sound andsensible enterprise were very unlikely to occur, the operation should not be completely abandoned.   Planning shotildproceed and a proportion of thenecessary shipping, both ocean-going andcoastwise, should be taken up:   but,broadly speaking, preparations shouldbe confined to those which would not seriously prejudice operation ROUND-UP.In particular, training for ROUND-up should not be interfered with.(3) Agreed that, in view of the unlikelihoodof - SLEDGEHAMMER being undertaken, the americans should be encouraged to proceedwith operation GYMNAST, and that we ourselves shotild undertake JUPITER,if by any means a sound and sensibleplan could be devisedo

(4) Invited the Prime Minister to informPresident Roosevelt of the above conclusions* and to say that, in viewof the -unlikelihood of SLEDGEHAMMER being undertaken, it. was assumed that he would wish to proceed with operation GYMNAST,Meanwhile, we, for our part, were   &apos;studying the possibility of an operation in &quot;Northern Norway, or, if this should   .prove impracticable$ elsewhere,(5) Invited the&quot;Prime Minister to reply to premier Stalin1s telegram of 20th June,1942, and&quot; to say that we were greatlyinterested in the possibility of combined operations with the Russians inthe Petsamo-Benak area, and were preparedto use both naval and land forces if a food plan could be worked out.   If hePremier Stalin) was in favour of operations of this kind, perhaps he would permit discussions between the two Staffs,(6) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to submitmaterial for a reply to General Smuts&apos;Telegram No* 1211 of the 7th July*NOTES,    With reference to Conclusion (.3)above, it was decided subsequent to themeeting that General McNaughton should beasked to undertake the preparation of a plan for JUPITER, to be carried outlargely by Canadian troops,Great George Street, S,W,1*

APPENDIX   IPrime Minister1 personal MinuteSerial NoB D.125/2,GENERAL ISMAY FOR C.0.S. COMMITTEE.lo     &quot;SLEDGEHAMMER&quot;, or One-third &quot;BOLERO&quot; as the Americanscall it, is now at a point where a desision must he reachedwhether to take up shipping or riot. ---2,     No responsible British General, Admiral or air marshal is prepared to recommend &quot;SLEDGEHAMMER&quot; as a desirable or even as a practicable operation in 1*942.   No confirmation of the hopes of additional landing-craft from the United states has been obtained.   The three American divisions will not behere in time to be trained for the special amphibious work required.    The chances of favourable conditions in the first part of September are dependent on the uncertain factors of wind&quot;and visibility during the limited period when moon and tidesare suitable.3,     On the other hand, there is a price to be paid.The taking up of the shipping would cost us a loss in importsas the rate of 950,000 tons per annum and would derange the coastal trade affecting winter coal.   Par more serious is thefact that the interruption of the training of the troops, apartfrom the loss of landing-craft etcc, would delay &quot;ROUND-UP&quot; fora&apos;: least two to three months, even if the enterprise were unsuccessful and the troops had to be withdrawn after a shortstayi4,     In the event of a lodgment being effected and maintained, it would have to be nourished, and the bombereffort upon Germany would have to be greatly curtailed, if not entirely suspended.   All our energies would be absorbed in defending the bridgehead.    There would be no possibility of mounting a large-ssale operation in 1943, as all our resources would be absorbed pieoeraeal on the very narrow front which alone is open.    It may therefore be said that premature actionin 1942, while probably ending in disaster, would decisivelyinjure the prospects of well-organised, large-scale action in1943,5.     If these views are accepted, we should tell thePresident and, when we have heard from him, tell the Russians,giving them all the reasons set out in the Chiefs of StaffPaper and the C,C.0.&apos;s Appendix*    There v/ould of course be no public&quot;indication that the project was not going forward, as this would damage British and   Russian morale and put the enemyat his ease.6.     The question of &quot;GYMNAST&quot; will then come to the front,and must be taken up with the President.   The question of&quot;JUPITER&quot;, or some form of &quot;JUPITER&quot;, in concert with theRussians would also seem to be of great urgency from every pointof view, military and political.   Our whole power to helpRussia in any effectual manner this year depends upon our drivingthe enemy aircraft from the northern airfields of Norway,W.S.C.5.7,42,

, PRIME -MINISTER,Following our discussion last night, we have prepare the following note about future operations?1.    SLEDGEHAMMER^The conditions which would make-SLEDGEHAMMER a sound and&apos;sensible enterprise are very unlikely to occur.   Consequently .,we are not justified in accepting the &quot;full implications of mounting the operation as set out ih our paper O.O.S.(42)195(o).In particular, it would be wrong to do anything which would so seriously delay ROUND-UP in 1943,On the other hand, it is necessary to continue to presson With such preparations for operations on the Continent thisyear as will 3-(a) Lead the enemy to think that we propose to attackthis year:   and(b) Not lead the Russians to think that there is no chance of our attacking this year.We are considering how these conflicting considerationscan be reconciled and will report further,2,    GYMNAST 0It was decided at a meeting at the White House on Jglstt5une, 1942:-(i)    That it was &quot;essential that the United States andGreat Britain should be prepared to act offensivelyin 1942&quot;:    and( ii)   That if SLEDGEHAMMER should prove impracticable&quot;we must be ready with an alternative&quot;.Accordingly, it was agreed that GYMNAST should be &quot;exploredcarefully and conscientiously&quot; and plans &quot;completed in alldetails as soon as possible&quot;.If it is decided that SLEDGEHAMMER is not to be mountedwe should tell the Americans at once.   We assume that they will then consider whether they should mount GYMNAST this year or not.So . JUPITER.It was agreed at the same meeting that the possibility of operations in Norway should also be carefully considered.    Inaccordance with your instructions we have for some time past been trying to make plans for seizing and holding the Northerntip of Norway, but so far we have failed to find any satisfactory,solution to this problem,   We will submit a detailed report assoon as possible,4o    ALTERNATIVE OPERATIONS-If there is no satisfactory solution to JUPITER, we intend to see whether there is any operation, other than large-scaleraids, which could be undertaken this year,(Signed)   A.F. BROOKE.DUDLEY POUND.7th July, 1942V -C. PORTAL,APPENDIX II*
