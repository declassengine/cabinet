MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(8th July? 1942        12o30 p0m. )THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet the personal telegram^ which he had sent to president roosevelt informing him of the conclusions reached atthe Meeting held on the previous day.I-The Prime Minister then referred to thequestion of the appointment of a Supreme Commander forthe American and British foroes.for the ROUND-UPOperation,   On his last visit to America he had gathered that if the Supre.;n Command   was offered to General Marshall,he would be very pleased to accept it.   The Americans were proposing to employ 27 Divisions to our 21 in ROUND-UP.He thought that our interests would best be served bythe appointment of an American as Supreme Commander.    if general Marshall was appointed, he would, of course,receive loyal and effective aid and support from the staffs in this country, who might be expected toexercise some influence over his views.   An AmericanSupreme Commander would also be in the best positionto obtain the maximum resources and equipment from Americafor the expeditionary forces, and there could be noreproach, if any part of the operation was notsuccessful? that this was due to there being a BritishGeneralissimoo   Moreover, the forces engaged in theoperation would be so large that the local Commanders ofthe British forces would, of course, be&quot; British.The Prime Minister also referred to a telegram received that morning from Field Marshal Dill(IZ 792) pointing to the advantages of an AmericanSupreme Commander.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet adraft telegram to the President which he had prepared,to the effect that we had been considering the questionof Command, and that it would be agreeable to us if general Marshall would undertake this task.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with the view that it would be desirable to invite the americans to appoint General Marshall as supreme commander,;The following points were made in discussions-(l)   It would be necessary that the supreme commander should have an equal duty inrespect of the British and United states forces under his Command. / As a symbolit might be desirable that we should assume responsibility for part of his pay^-1*-1f ^

(2)   It wouldy of course, be necessary tft*lays down to what authority General Marshallshould be responsible0   The general view was that he should be responsible tothe Combined Chiefs of Staffs now in&apos; Washington;   but that if large-scalet operations were being undertaken from-.this country, the general weight of the strategic and political direction of theoperations would have to be transferred tothis country(3).   The three Chiefs of Staff all expressed agreement with the proposal that general marshall should be invited to be Supreme -Commander.   The Chief of the Air Staffadded that the fact that the American AirForce came under the Command of the american army presented perhaps a certain complication.He hoped? however, that it would be possibleto work out a system whereby the American andBritish Air Forces engaged on the operationwere regarded as a single Force under asingle Air Officer Commanding in Chief.(4)    THE CHIEF OF COMBINED OPERATIONS said that, .on his recent visit to the United States, hehad been authorised to discuss the questionof the appointment of a Supreme Commander forthe operation^    This had been favoured onall hands.    It was also favoured by those inthis country who were engaged on planning the operation,who had reached theconclusion that the present system wascumbrous and unworkable0.The War Cabinet agreed that the detailed arrangements implicit in the system of Supreme command had best be worked out at a later dateeThe War Cabinet also felt that it would bebetter not to deal with the proposal that a DeputySupreme Commander, in the person of General Eisenhowershould be appointed immediately, until the President&apos;sreactions to the Marshall proposal had been receivedoIf the President agreed, ii% might then be suggested to him that General MarShaljL should come over for a few weeks ^to get the ROUND-UP planning going smoothly.   Thereaftera   Deputiy Supreme Commander could take up the runninguntil it was necessary for General Marshall to devoteall his attentions to ROUND-UP.It was also agreed that a paragraph inthe draft $elogrer\ [Tsrpaxed by the Prime Minister, tothe effect that the appointment of a United StatesSupreme Commander for ROUND-UP should not prejudiceoperations of immediate consequence, such as GYMNAST,should be despatched as a separate telegram^The War Cabinet accordingly:-Authorised the Prime Minister to despatch a short telegram to the President to thet \ effect that we had been considering theP &apos; question of the appointment of a supreme commander for the 1945 operation, and thatit would be agreeable to us if general marshall would undertake this task.Great Georgo Streetf.

PRIME MINISTER1SPERSONAL&apos; TELEGRAM.Serial No. T.967/2.FORMER NAVAL PERSON TO PRESIDENT.PERSONAL AND SECRET.     .No. 107.1,     No responsible British General, Admiral or air marshal is prepared to recommend SLEDGEHAMMER as a practicable operation in 1942.    The Chiefs of the staff have reported (quote) The conditions which would makeSLEDGEHAMMER a sound sensible enterprise are very unlikely to occur (unquote).   They are now: sending their paper to your Chiefs of Staff.2.     The taking up of the shipping is being proceeded with by us for camouflage purposes, though it involves a loss in British imports of perhaps 250,000 tons.   Butfar more serious is the fact that according to Mountbattenif we interrupt the training of the troops we shouldapart from the loss of landing craft etc. delay ROUNDUPor 1943 BOLERO for at least two or three months even ifthe enterprise were unsuccessful and the troops had to be withdrawn after a short stay.5.     In the event of a lodgement being effected and maintained it would have to be nourished and the Bombereffort on Germany would have to be greatly curtailed.All our energies would be involved in defending the bridgehead. . The possibility of mounting a large scaleoperation in 1943 would be marred if not ruined.   all our resources would be absorbed piecemeal on the verynarrow front which alone is open.    It may therefore besaid that premature action in 1942 while probably endingin disaster would decisively injure the prospect of well-organised large-scale action in 1943.4.     I am sure myself that GYMNAST is by far thebest chance for effecting relief to the Russian front in 1942.   This has all along been in harmony with yourideas.    In fact it is your commanding idea.   Here is the true Second Front of 1942.    I have consulted Cabinet and defence Committee and we all agree.   Here is the safest

and most fruitful stroke that can be delivered this autumn. : . (5*    We of course can aid in every way, either by transfer of American or British landing forces fromthe United Kingdom to GYMNAST and with landing craft,shipping, etc.   You can if you choose put the punchin partly from here and the rest direct across the atlantic.6.     It must be clearly understood that we cannotcount upon an invitation or a-guarantee from Vichy.But any resistance would not be comparable to thatwhich would be offered by the German Army in the Pasde Calais,   Indeed it might be only token resistance.The stronger you are the less resistance there wouldbe and the more to overcome it.   It seems to me thatwe ought not to throw away the sole great strategicstoke open to us in the Western theatre during thiscardinal year.7.     Besides the above we are studying very hardthe possibility of ah operation in Northern Norwayor it this should prove impracticable elsewhere in norway.   The difficulties are great owing to thedanger of shore-based aircraft attack upon our ships.We are having frightful difficulties about theRussian convoys.&apos;   All the more is it necessary to try to clear the way and maintain the contact withRussia.W.S.C.J8.vii.
