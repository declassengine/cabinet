HOC OPPrime Minister to Deputy Prime Minister.As a result of such enquiry as I have made here,and after prolonged consultations with Field Marshal Smutsand C.I.G.S., and Minister of State, I have come to theConclusion that a drastic and immediate change is needed in  -the High Command.2.     I therefore propose that the Middle East Commandshall he reorganised into two separate Commands, namely -(a) &quot;Near East Command&quot;, comprising Egypt, palestine and Syria, with its centre in Cairo, and(b) &quot;Middle East Command&quot;, comprising Persia and Iraq,with centre in Basra or Baghdad.The Eighth and Ninth Armies fall within the first and the Tenth Army in the second of these Commands.3.     General Auohinleck to be offered the post ofC-in-C. the new Middle Bast Command.     The title remains thesMeTtout its scope is reduced.     It may, however, become more important later.     It also preserves General Auchinleck&apos;s association v/ith India.     It must be remembered that general wavell*s appointment as C -in-C. India was for the duration of the war and that the India Office have always desired that4pchinleck should return there if possible.     I know ofnothing that should prevent the eventual realisation of this plan though of course no promise can be made in respect ofevents which are unforeseeable.4.     General Alexander to be Commander-in-Ohief the Nenr-East.5.     General Montgomery to succeed Alexander in TORCH.I regret the need of moving Alexander from TORCH butMontgomery, though a first-rate soldier, would not be suited to the varied duties of ttie Near East Command.

EXTRACT FROM "THE TIMES" OF 22ND AUGUST, 1942.

MIDDLE EAST OBJECTIVES



ZONE OF GROWING IMPORTANCE



GENERAL AUCHINLECK&apos;S PIONEER WORK

From Our Special Correspondent

CAIRO, AUG. 21

General Auchinleck&apos;s farewell message to the Eighth Army will have raised a responsive echo in the hearts of the troops, where he retains their unstinted confidence. The great reputation which he brought from India has hot been seriously dimmed in the eyes of those who served under him in the Middle East by the misfortunes which attended the recent campaign.

 Little of the blame for them is considered to rest on his shoulders: on the contrary he is given full credit for changing defeat into partial victory at El Alamein. From the moment when he assumed direct command, of the Eighth Army his personality made itself felt, as he was everywhere on the battlefield, inspiring fresh confidence in badly rattled commanders by direct instructions and useful bits of information, and encouraging tired troops by stopping his car at the roadside, asking their news, and telling them to continue to do their best. He Was unsparing of his own powers, and, without taking undue risks, ventured as far forward as possible in order to make his presence felt. He was in El Daba, supervising the evacuation, only half an hour before the Germans arrived. Everybody who saw him in those  days realized that here was a real leader.

 THE NEW COMMANDERS

 General Alexander, General Auchinleck&apos;s successor, and General Montgomery, who takes over the command of the Eighth Army, come to Egypt with great names for leadership and comment on their appointments, though somewhat reserved on account of the numerous changes which preceded these is nevertheless definitely favourable. General Alexander&apos;s conduct of the campaign in Burma singled him out as a commander of unusual ability. All indivudual testimony which reaches Cairo from India about the fighting in Burma bears out the official tributes to his leadership, and emphasizes his versatility and adaptability to circumstances. High hopes are thus entertained of his command in the Middle East.

Mr. Churchi? to lines the growing importance of the Middle Eastern them ?. The losses suffered since June have been amply made up, so that once again it is possible to contemplate more ? of Egypt. The com ? the enemy ?



AMERICAN STRENGTH

 In considerring the striking or defensive power of these armies, the assistance which the American forces are beginning to give in the Middle East is coming more and more into the picture from day to day. Most important reinforcements of the United States Army Air Forces have recently arrived. American heavy bombers during the past weeks have given the Middle East Command greater striking power than it would otherwise have possessed, and American fighters have already been in action. The number of quadrons available continues to grow progressively. The presence of Major General Brereton in Cairo emphasizes that American assistance in the Middle East in contemplated on the largest scale.
