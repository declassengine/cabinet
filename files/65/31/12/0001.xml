TO BE KEPT--UNpER LOCK AND KEY. ;It is requested tiiat spfci iai ctce may be (at en to insure the secrecy of this oucument. PQffi.&apos; ^9 , ,W.Mw(43 V 107th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1,OonfiA,ential Annex.(7th August, 1943, 5*0 p.m.)The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P.(43) 344)taboutP.Q,. convoys to North Russia.THE FIRST LORD said that arrangements were proceed-ing to run a convoy in September.   It was not, however,possible to state definitely that the. convoy would-be&apos;run until the outcome of the next Malta convoy was known.   Should the escort to the Malta convoy suffersevere casualties it might not be possible to provide asufficient escort for the convoy to North Russia.The question whether a further P.Q,. convoy could be run      a month later, depended on the date fixed for operation TORCH.    If that operation took, place as early as we hoped, it would not be possible to run anotherP.Q,. convoy before Operation TORCH took place.   If,however,. Operation TORCH took place a month later thanthe present target date, it might be possible to runanother P.Q. convoy in October.. THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff explained that the original date Proposed by the americans for Operation TORCH had been the 30th October.After examining the position, we had reached theconclusion that it would be both practicable and desirable to fix an earlier date, say at the end ofthe first week in October.   Every effort was now being .me.de to bring forward the timing of the operation tothis    date, ant? a telegram in this sense had been .despatched to Washington.   No official reply had beenreceived, but Field Marshal Dill had reported that theAmerican preparations were proceeding slowlyvAccordingly, Field Marshal Dill&apos;s telegram had been repeated to the Prime Minister (TULIP No. 50), with asuggestion that he should send a telegram to president roosevelt asking him to impress on the United states authorities the^urgency of carrying out OperationTORCH at the earlier date.,THE FIRST S^A LORD explained that the interval between PfQ,. convoys    could not be less than some 36days.   He&apos;could not, of course, guarantee that afterOperation TORCH we should have sufficient escorts ^toenable us to run further P.Q,. convoys.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said .that he was anxious that we should not fall between,two stools: i.e., fail to arrange for Operation TORCHto be carried out .at--the earlier date proposed, andalso fail to arrange for a P.Q,. convoy in October.   -

, THE MINISTER OF. WAR TRANSPORT said that two-thirds; of.theihips it was necessax?^to Have eight weeks&apos; notice.   If an October convoy wasto be run, the loading of ships would start at thebeginning of the following week, and provisionalarrangements to- this end had already been made.   the americans were, very keen on the P.Q,. convoys, and hethought that some very strong reason would have to begiven (such as? for example, a decision to advance thedate for Operation TORCH; before they Would be willingto consent to abandon loading United States ships forthe, October convoy.   He-was anxious to avoid a position inVfaJch &amp;$ps haol been    loaded for an October P.Q,. convoy, .^and we also had to take up shipc. for Operation TORCH at thesame timaV&quot;   The effects on our import prowrivmae of taking upsmps smultAnepusly ibr jfcheBe twpoGperJvfetons %jgpm be very serious.Moreover, the cargoes&quot;loaded in U.,S.. ships for north russia did not consist, for the most part, of cargoes&apos;required here.   To bring these cargoes to this countryand unload, them would therefore be a very uneconomicalproposal.The War Cabinet1 s decision was as follows:-(l) The fixing of an early date for OperationTORCH must have priority over an OctoberP.Q,. convoy.   It was, how,ever, impracticable to persuade the Americans to stop loadingships for the October P.Q,. convoy, unless a firm decision   had first been reached that the october convoy must be abandoned.   Thia, in turn, depended on a decision that OperationTORCH should take place in the first week of October.   -:(2) It was clearly important, therefore, toreach a firm agreement with the UnitedStates authorities at the earliest possible moment as to the date for Operation TORCH.The Prime-Minister should be invited tosend a telegram to the President pressing for an early decision on this matter.(3) The Deputy Prime Minister was invited tosend a telegram to the Prime Minister inthe sense of-(l) and (2). (See telegramTULIP No. 59.)    *(4) In the meantime, no steps should be takento stop the loading, of United States ships for an October P.Q,.&quot; convoy.Great George Street, S.W.1.

MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(7th August, 1942, 5.0 ptn.)MOST SECRET. -MADAGASCAR..-(previous reference:W*M.(42)  72ndConclusions,Minute 70)The Yfcir Cabinet had. before them a Report by theChiefs of Staff (W.P.(42) 345) recommending thatapproval should be given to the completion of theoccupation of the key points in Madagascar as soonpossible.THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFreminded the War Cabinet of the course of events inMadagascar.   After Diego Suarez had been capturedwe had hoped that we might obtain the control of thewhole Island by negotiation.    It was now most unlikelythat those negotiations would be successful.   Heoutlined the operations proposed for obtaining controlof tho kcyf points in the whole Island.   Owing toweather conditions, operations must be completed by october, or postponed until the Spring.   Annexes and III gave the Comtrxander-in-chief s appreciation of the chances of success in operations to occupyMajunga and Tanatave.   Plans for these operations were going-ahead, pending approval of the War Cabinet.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the political considerations involved were evenly balanced.   Theeffect- of undertaking this operation on the french people and on Operation TORCH must be borne in mind.Further, the Americans were very anxious to placatethe Vichy Government at the present time.   Presumablywe should have to tell the United States authoritieswhat we had &apos; in mind, and their reactions might notbe too favourable.The Foreign Secretary asked that a final decision should be postponed until early in the following week,and undertook to submit a Memorandum to the War Cabineton   the political implications of the suggestedoperation.The War Cabinet&apos;-Agreed;to await the Foreign Secretary&apos;sMemora-ji.durh, which would be consideredearly in the following week. great George Street, S.T.I.
