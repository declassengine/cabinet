UNPaRAPHASED VERSION OF A SECRET CYPHERTELEGRAM NOT ONE: TIME TABLE.TULIP 93    ;TOO 18002/11. TOD 1935A/11MOST. SECRET CYPHER TELEGRAMIMMEDIATE.   &apos; j   &apos;From:- Air Ministry.To:- 30 Military Mission,-Moscow.Following for Prime Minister from Deputy Prime Minister.Your REFLEX No. 68 was considered by &quot;Cabinet and DefenceCommittee this morning,1,       It is quite impossible to do 11 TORCH1 1 and a P. Q.convoy at the same time, whatever risk is taken elsewhere.Hence if &quot;TORCH&quot; were to take place on 7th October we .could not run a P.Q.,convoy in October.2.       Even allowing for very generous assistance from the americans, the requirements for 1&apos;T0RCH&apos;&apos; for destroyers and other escort craft are so great that they can only beprovided by ceasing to run the Sierra Leone and Gibraltarconvoys and heavily cutting the escorts for Coastal convoys,with consequent loss of imports..3.       There seems considerable doubt, however, whether the americans will be ready for &quot;TORCH&apos;? by 7th October, andat the moment Eisenhower gives November 51th as the date,in which case it might just be possible to run an OctoberP.Q. convoy, v4. :-;   Everyone is seized with the importance of carryingout &quot;TORCH&quot; at the earliest possible moment, and we are doing everything possible to persuade the  Americans to workto an early date njn October, in which case an OctoberP.Q0 convoy would not be possible.5*       It would be most unwise, therefore, to get:committed to an October convey as we rhould have to go back on ourword if we found it interfered with &quot;TORCH&quot;.60       P.Q. convoys after &quot;TORCH&quot; must depend on:-/ (a) Length and

(a) Length and subsequent requirements of 1 -TORCH -1operations.;(b) Measure of success of &quot;PEDESTAL&quot; and whetherthe latter will need to be repeated this year.T.0.0. 1800Z/11.(CIRCULATION)Deputy Prime Minister.Foreign Secretary, i   ,First Lord of the Admiralty.Minister of War Transport,First Sea Lord.C.A.S.I.C.I.G.S.Mr. Martin.Sir Edward Bridges.General Ismay.Brig.
