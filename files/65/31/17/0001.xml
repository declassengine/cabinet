W.M. (42) 114TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 3.

Confidential Annex.

(20th August, 1942 - 12 noon)

?

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said that representations had been made to him by the High Commissioner for Eire on behalf of six young men who had been convicted in Belfast and sentenced to death for being concerned in a common design which had resulted in the shooting of a Belfast policeman on Easter Sunday last.

 An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal in Northern Ireland had not yet been determined; but Mr. de Valora had already expressed a hope that the prisoners would be reprieved, and the Eire Minister in the United States had made similar representations to the United States Government.

 The suggestion which was being made on behalf of the Eire Government was that the execution of these men would have an unfortunate effect on public opinion in Eire, and also on Irish opinion in the United States. It might disturb Anglo-Irish and Anglo-American relations; and, further, might arouse feeling against Ulster people among American troops in Northern Ireland.

 In discussion, it was explained that in Northern Ireland the prerogativo of mercy was vested in the Governor, who normally acted on the advice of Northern Ireland Ministers, in the same way as the King acted on the advice of the Home Secretary in the case of persons convicted in this country. It was, however, provided in the Royal Instructions to the Governor that "in any case in which a pardon or a reprieve might directly affect the interests of our Empire or of any country or place beyond the jurisdiction of the Government of Northern Ireland, the Governor shall, before deciding as to either pardon or reprieve, take those interests especially into his own personal consideration in conjunction with such advice as he may receive from Northern Ireland Ministers". The object of this Instruction was to secure that in cases involving wider interests than those of law and order in Northern Ireland,, the Governor should not act merely on the advice of the Northern Ireland Ministers but should be put in a position to receive advice from United Kingdom Ministers. In a case where such wider issues did not arise, the Governor was like a constitutional monarch, bound to act on the advice of his Ministerss. Where these wider issues did arise, he was enabled to exercise a personal discretion and to take into account any advice which might be tendered to him by United Kingdom Ministers. He was not, however, bound to act on the advice tendered by United Kingdom Ministers, in the same way as he was bound in an ordinary case to act on the advice of Northern Ireland Ministers. A case had occured in 1921 when Northern Ireland Ministers advised that the law should take its course,



 while United Kingdom Ministers felt it necessary to represent strongly to the Lord Lieutenant (Lord Fitzalan) that the larger interests of the Empire would be best servoi by a reprieve. The Lord Lieutenant, after considering the advice tendered, himself decided that a reprieve should be granted.

 Constitutionally, therefore, it was competent for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to tendor advice to the Governor of Northern Ireland if they considered that the case raised wider issues on which they were more competent than the Government or Northern Ireland to form a judgment. The effect of an execution on Anglo-Irish or Anglo-American relations was clearly such an issue; and the question for the War Cabinet was whether the probable reactions outside Northern Ireland were such a to justify them in tendering any advice to the Governor in this case.

 On this question, it was pointed out that on political grounds the Eire Government would feel bound to make some approach on behalf of the condemned men; but the representations made so far had not been strongly worded and there were no real indications that the execution of these men would in fact give rise to serious feeling in Eire. The United States authorities had done no more than acquaint us of the fact that representations had been made to them by the Eirean Minister in Washington; and they had indicated that they did not propose to approach us in the matter.

 The War Cabinet were reminded that far stronger pressure had been brought to bear, by both the Eire Government and the united States Government, in the case of the Coventry murders in 1940. On that occasion we had been confidently assured that, if the executions took place, there would be widespread resentment and agitation in Eire and that the effect on American opinion would also be unfortunate. The then Home Secretary had, however, decided that it was his duty not to recommend a reprieve. The prisoners had been executed,and in the event there had not in fact been any adverse reaction either in Eire or in the United States. Moreover, the executions marked the end of the campaign of violence which the I.R.A. wore then conducting in this country.

 THE HOME SECRETARY said that if, as it appeared, there were no good grounds for believing that in the present case failure to recommend a reprieve would have a bad effect on Anglo-Irish and Anglo-American relations, he would strongly deprecate any intervention by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. We were without full information about the details of the case, but it was clearly a case of gang murder and we should be slow to take any course which might be represented as condoning in any way the use of such methods of violence for political onds. The wider considerations with which the Government in the United Kingdom were alone concerned would have to be substantial if they were to outweigh the obvious disadvantage of appearing to hamper the Government of Northern Ireland, who were responsible for maintaining law and order in that country, in dealing firmly with armed violence and gang murder. As the Minister responsible for Northern Ireland he took the view that there were no such grounds as would justify him in intervening in this case.

THE WAR CABINET -

 (1) Decided that there were no sufficient grounds to warrant United Kingdom Ministers tendering any advice to the Governor of Northern Ireland regarding the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in this case.

 (2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to inform the High Commissioner for Eire accordingly.
