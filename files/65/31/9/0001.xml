(48) .101st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(1st August, 1942, 11.30 a.m.)THE PRIME MINISTER referred to a telegram fromGeneral Auchinleck (No. 30295 of 31st July)? copies oof whichhad been circulated to the War Cabinet, stating thathe had reached the conclusion that an opportunity to resume offensive operations was unlikely to arisebefore the middle of September, depending on theenemy&apos;s ability to build up his tank force.     this seemed to him (the Prime Minister) to be a verydepressing account of the position.      This telegram had made him all the more convinced that it wasnecessary that the position should be considered onthe spot.     He hoped that as the result of his visithe might be able to make arrangements which wouldresult in a more vigorous handling of matters.     Hethought the time had now been reached when general auchinleck could once more concern himself with theduties of Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, someother General being appointed to command the eighth army.     The powers of this General would, of course,have to be very carefully considered.The Prime Minister said that he was, leavingthat night, and hoped to be in Cairo in two days1time.   He had arranged to meet General Smuts andGeneral Wavell in Cairo, and if a meeting With M.Stalin was arranged he would then go on to meet him, perhaps at Astrakhan.    He read to the WarCabinet a copy of a telegram which he had sentto Mo Stalin, suggesting a meeting.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he thought itmight be desirable to inform the House, in secret session, that the Prime Minister had gone to Egypt,after word had been received of his arrival.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed withthis course.     Nothing,- of course, should be saidof a meeting with M0 Stalin, for the present.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to a telegramfrom the Joint Staff Mission at Washington (JSM 326)reporting that the United States Chiefs of Staffswore clearly coming round ,to the view that thedecision to undertake TORCH must be&apos; made now, atonce, without waiting until the 15th September.

The Prime Minister said that a reply had\ been sent to General Dill making it clear that weentirely agreed with this view.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the War Cabinetthat on the 8th July it had been agreed that heshould send a telegram to the President to theeffect that it would be agreeable to us if general marshall could bo appointed to be Supreme Commanderfor the 1943 operations,,     No decision on the matter had yet been reached a   He had now proposed to thePresident (in Personal Telegram No, Tol066/2)*that General Eisenhower should be designated toact as General Marshall&apos;s deputy here, havingcommand of the forces assigned for TORCH and also for BOLERO and ROUND-UP *   If this plan was adopted,he thought it might not be desirable to use so high-sounding a phrase as &quot;Supreme Commander&apos;VFurther, ho thought that it&apos; would be undesirable that there should be any announcement on thismatter, or discussion of it in the Press, atthe present time.     This point should be broughtto the notice of the Minister of Information, who should be authorised to arrange for the issue of a&quot;D&quot; Notice, if necessary.General agreement was expressed with thisview.The question was raised as to who would command the Naval forces for TORCH.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the original    ..conception had been that there should be twoNaval Commanders, one for the force covering theoperation on the Atlantic coast and the other forthe force covering the operation on the Mediterraneancoast.     For the former operation the United Statesproposed to appoint the Flag Officer commanding the United States Atlantic Fleet,    He proposedthat Rear-Admiral Syfret should command theNaval Forces covering the operations on theMediterrean coast in which our troops would been gaged.The suggestion was made that AdmiralCunningham should be appointed to take charge ofour forces in this operation.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that ho woulddeprecate bringing back Admiral Cunningham from washington, where he was performing very importantduties as a member of the Combined Chiefs ofStaff.It was also undesirable, if it could be avoided.,to displace for any special operation the Flag officer who had trained the forces to .be employed and hadcommanded them during the normal course of operations,Vice-Admiral Syfret, having commanded the naval forces in Operation IRONCLAD, was the only BritiehNaval Officer who had experience in combined operation,&apos;in this war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was no need to reaoh a decision on this matter at thepresent time.The War Cabinet then discussed operationPEDESTAL,

TUB PRIME MINISTER outlined the main features of this Operatipn.    A crucial stage would hereached on the night before the convoy reached the narrow passage between Cape Bon and Sicily.     Inmaking the plan, the Admiralty had had to decide -whether the heavy ship escort should&apos;carry the convoy right through to Malta at the risk ofour two 16-inch battleships being heavily attacked by air or   whether, during the final stage of the journey, escorting forces should be confined tocruisers and destroyers.     If ill befell ourheavy ships in the narrow waters approaching Malta,the whole balance of naval power would be affected.On the other hand, if it was decided not to risk the heavy ships during the final stage and the convoy suffered severe losses from attack by enemysurface ships, some searching questions wouldbe asked.     In view of the grave issues involved,he asked the War Cabinet to support any decision which might be taken.THE FIRST SEA LORD explained the operations to the War Cabinet in greater detail.     As soon asthe Italian Battlefleet, which might consist of four heavy ships, learned that our heavy ship escorthad turned back, there would be nothing to prevent them steaming south and lying in wait for the convoy off, or near Malta.     We should, of course,subject the Italian fleet to as heavy a scale ofair and submarine attack as we could, and we hoped to inflict severe damage upon them.     Nevertheless,there was a risk that, if the oiaemy ships were handledboldly it might be impossible to drive them off the convoy.The most critical moment would be at dawnon the last day.     At this time, the convoy wouldbe about 120 miles from Malta and would be underprotection from Beaufighter aircraft, based on Malta.     When the ships got within 75 miles of malta, they could be protected by Spitfires.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to considerwhether the number of Beaufighters which could bemade available for this task ought to be, and could be, increased.     He was, however, more anxioushimself about the provision of a sufficient forceof Spitfires to cover the convoy during the timewhen it was unloading in harbour.The First Sea Lord estimated the balance ofrisk to our heavy ships and aircraft-carriers from air attack, if they went on with the convoy or turned backin the vicinity of Cape Bon, was as 4 to 1.After some discussion, THE PRIME minister proposed that the plan advocated by the Admiralty -namely, that the heavy ships and aircraft-carriersshould no^^^1^ou^pwjjh.the convoy in the final*the WAR CABINET -Decided to support the Admiralty plan for the conduct of Operation &quot;PEDESTAL&quot;,after full consideration of the hazardsand dangers-to be provided against.

PcQ^-GOlTVOY THE FIRST SEA LORD described to the WarNO*3.7V Cabinet thecircumstances leading up and subsequentr*M&amp;(of P..Q, Convoy No,17eto the dispaThe Admiralty had hadinf&apos;6rmation on the nightbefore the order to disperse was given that the1- TIRPITZ, having eluded our waiting submarines, would,, if - she continued on her course, be in a position toattack the convoy early the.following morning.The convoy was liable to three forms of attack - namely, by air, U-boat   and surface ships.If the convoy remained concentrated, the most dangerous threat appeared, in the circumstances as\ then known to tho Admiralty, to bo that from surface ships.     Instructions were therefore issued for the convoy to disperse.     In view of the slow speed ofthe ships (8-10 knots) and the short time in whichtho convoy had to disperse, the Admiralty hadsignalled an order to the convoy to scatter.   Thisgave tho impression to the convoy that it was about to bo attacked at any moment.     The Senior Officer ofthe escorts considered the best way to deal with the surface forces was to add his destroyer strength to admiral Hamilton&apos;s force and asked permission to doso.     This was approved by Admiral Hamilton.     It isconsidered Admiral Hamilton acted correctly until he received tho order from the Admiralty to retire tothe v/estward.     It would have been preferable had hethen ordered the escort destroyers to return to thevicinity of the convoy.     His failure to do so could hardly be regarded as more than an error of judgment.&apos; The \7ar Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S.W.1,

I Should he grateful for a decision aboutthe command of &quot;BOLERO&quot;, &quot;SLEDGEHAMMER&quot;, &quot;ROUND-UP&quot;and &quot; TORCH&quot;.   It would be agreeable to us if general Marshall were designated for the supreme command of &quot;ROUND-UP&quot; and that in the meanwhileGeneral Eisenhower should act as his deputy here.17o uGuld appoint General Alexander as Task ForceCommander in the first instance to work with andunder General Eisenhower.   Both these men would work at &quot;TORCH&quot; and General Eisenhower would also forthe time being supervise the &quot;BOLERO&quot; - &quot;SLEDGEHAMMER&quot;business.   He will thus be able to draw for &quot;TORCH&quot;the necessary forces with the least injury to &quot;BOLERO&quot;and &quot;ROUND-UP&quot;.   As soon as &quot;TORCH&quot; has taken shapehe would command it, with Alexander and an AmericanCommander as Task Force Commanders of the two forcesstarting from United Kingdom and United States.   when this party starts out to do the job we should beglad if you would nominate either General Marshallor another locum tenens to carry forward the workof &quot;BOLERO&quot; &quot;SLEDGEHAMMER&quot; and &quot;ROUND-UP&quot;.   We Willsupply him also with a deputy.2.     It seems Important to act quickly, ascommittees are too numerous and too slow.   If youprefer other arrangements, pray let me know yourwishes.30.7.42.
