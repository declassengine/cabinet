OjgMidhhtiffil /Anneal( 21st S^teraber,&quot;1942 -10*0 p0m8 )THE. PR DIE MINISTER said that therewere: a ^number or important matters affecting future operations fordiscussion!by the War Cabinet.   He welcomed the presenceof Sir Andrew Cunningham, who could report at first handon the position in Washington.The Prame Minister said that the Americansstated that the date now fixed for this Operation was thePKi November^     if we decided to ccnrl a further P.Q*convoy (P^Qt 19jbefore Operation TORCH, this v/ould meanOperation TORCH would have to be delayed until either the 24th or 28th November, according to whether or not we intended to bring.back the ships of P.Q. 18 from north Russia.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, to delay Operation TORCH until the 24th or 28th Novemberwould be to court disastero   He referred iri&apos; particular to the rumours which were now in circulation regardingan impending opera tion.o   A good deal of this was, ofcourse, inevitable when the size of the operation wastaken into .account0   Furthermore^ the weather *would be worse as the winter went on.   Three weeks had alreadybeen lost through the Americans having changed the plan of the \operation  -   a change   which we had had toaccepto   It was also significant that since a week ago*there had been a great change in the atmosphere atWashington, where the authorities were now full out onOperation TORCH and determined to make it a success.SIR ANDREW CUNNINGHAM confirmed this change ofatmosphere, which was noticeable not only in the highest$utters,,but also on lower levels.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the first point :on which a decision was called for from the War cabinet was whether they were in agreement that operation TORCHmust be pushed forward at the earliest possible moment,irrespective of the effect on other operations^The next question for a decision was what should be done about convoys to Russia.   Up to the.presgnt, orders had been given that the loading of ships for p.fa 19 should proceed. - The fact that this convoy was being loaded might be regarded by the enemy aspreparation for an attack on Norway^ and therefore alsoserved the purpose of confusing the enemy as to our intentions^

The Prime Minister said that hithorto he had./been principally influenced on this matter by theconsideration that, if the Americans had said that&apos;Operation TORCH would have to be further postponed-there might have been time to fit in another convoy to north Russia before that operation.had taken place*He had been anxious, therefore, to retain the option to run this convoy, so as not to fall between two stools0Finally, he had been unwilling to have1 to make-it known to the Russians, that the running of convoys to north Russia would b e suspended, until this; had: become :absolutely necessary.The Prime Minister said that ten days ago theUnited States authorities had given orders that 180Airacobra aircraft, loaded in ships forming part ofthe PoQc H-9 convoy, should be unloaded, as they were required for Operation TQRGH0    In this matter fe had beennujSBly carrying out instructions issued by the Americans0Nevertheless, the Russians had talc en the matter verymuch amiss,   Ma Maisky had been to see him that afternoon and had complained about this action.,   He (the PrimeMinister) had told M, Maisky that something much v/orsowas in store for him than the action in regard to theAiracobrasa    It had been evident from M. Maisky&apos;s attitude that the Russians would be greatly upset at. the suspension of the convoys^   He therefore asked the First Sea lord to investigate whether any possible means could be foundto continue sailings to North Russia, although on a greatly reduced scalesTHE FIRST SEA LORD said that he would certainlycontinue to investigate this matter     It must berealised, however, that any ships going to North russia had to be prepared to meet three forms of attack:-surface ships? U-boats, and aircraftcTHE PRIME MINISTER said that, in view of thevery grim picture which the suspension of the convoya -would present to Russia, it was clearly necessary togive further consideration to Operation JUPITER *   At hismeeting with Premier Stalin in Moscow he had said that Wewould consider carrying&apos;outran operation with&quot;two British-DivisiORSo.  - Stalin had saicL that he would put. in three&apos; &apos;Russian Divisions; and had taken a hopeful vxewof the operationA Minute (D. No. 154/2$ on Operation JUPITER,addressed by the Prime Minister/on the 16th september to the Chiefs of Staff Committee, was then read to theWar-Cabinet. , This Minute dealt with the prospects of operation JUPITER, and commented on certain observationsin General   McNaughton&apos;s report on this operation.  I rj&apos;?/J MISXtfJflSR said that the Chiefs ofStaff had examined this&apos; question very fullyo   On thewhole, they took a rather unfavourable view of thepossibility of being able to provide the necessary forces and particularly the shipping for JUPITER in addition wT0RCH*

In particular, it was thoughtthat a somewhat different line of approach should be takenin the telegrams to Premier Stalin dealing with OperationJUPITER and the suspension of P,Q. convoys.(The Lord privy Seal, the Lord Presidentof the Council, the Foreign&apos; Soessatary and theMinister of Production then withdrew and prepared an alternative draft telegram to premier Stalin*   This draft was then handed to the Chiefs of Staff who withdrew and, onreturn to the meeting, proposed certain drafting-amendments which were accepted by the War CaK ...

BRIGADIER HOLLIS FOR C.O.S. COMMITEE

Operation "JUPITER".

1. To keep contact with Russia and to keep the Russian Armies equiped and in the field by a continued stream of supplies, must be considered  one of the three or four most important vital objects before us. For this the greatest sacrifices and exertions must be made by the Allies. The total defeat of Russia or the reduction of that country to a minor military factor would let the whole mass of the German Armies loose upon us. The President has stated that he regards the maintenance of the PQ convoys as an operation of equal magnitude with "TORCH", although he is ready to skip one or perhaps two for the sake of "TORCH".

2. The alternative before us is therefore:

(a) To go on with the PQ. convoys (perhaps missing one or two) in addition to "TORCH" and all it implies, all through 1943. Indeed, the scale of the convoys must be increased. The Russians have been solemly promised larger quotas and they will become more dependent on imported arms as their own territory is reduced by enemy invasion. Or

(b) To clear the Germans out of the north of Norway by some form of the Operation "JUPITER"

When we consider the losses attendant on the sending of these convoys, that they have to take place at least three times in every two months, and the grievous consequences of our announcing on the other hand that we can send no more, it may well be that "JUPITER", with all its cost and risk, will be found not only necessary but cheapest in the long run.



3. I have now read the McNaughton report, which certainly does not err on the side of underrating the difficulties before us. The fact of preparing for an Arctic expedition gives no clue to what part of Norway, which is 800 miles long, will be attacked (para. 21). The

statement in para. 9 is not true, and the General has no special qualifications for forming such an opinion. In fact since he wrote this the operations in the Mediterranean have been carried out successfully so far as the Air was concerned, under conditions far more dangerous than those attending the approach to Northern Norway. The enemy are credited with great facility of mouvement from  point to point, even overland in the depth of winter as well as along the coast, whereas we who have the command of the sea are said to be at a disadvantage in the matter. The requirements of naval support are set out on a liberal scale but, as the Home Fleet has to be this area anyhow for the purpose of safeguarding the Atlantic routes from a German naval break-out, there should be no difficulty in finding the naval forces. It is true, as stated in para. 15, that  Germany could (and indeed she may) advance against the Murmansk and Archangel railways. This is a matter which the Russians must consider. Making allowances for the exaggeration of difficulties which is customary, the McNaughton report can be taken as a basis of further discussions.

4. When the winter comes, the Russians must take the offensive against the German lines. Here in the North is as good a place as any and having regard to their vital need of Allied  monitions, I have no doubt after my conversations with Premier Stalin that they not only will resist attacks upon the Murmansk and Archangel railways but would be willing to set on foot a heavy offensive towards Petsamo. At any rate, before dogmatizing about it we must find out what they would be prepared to do. I am assuming however that they would not only bring enough forces to the North to attack the enemy, as proposed by McNaughton, but I also would if necessary undertake part of the landings themselves, say the Kirkenes - Petsamo sector. Here it should be noticed that we could easily leave, and may have to leave twenty, thirty, forty or more



 ships in the North, though whether they would survive Air attack at Murmansk is questionable.

5. The fitting of Operation "JUPITER" into our war plans can only be considered in relation to "TORCH". We cannot yet judge what "TORCH" will involve. If the French come over to us, the whole of the "TORCH" area may be formed up against Germany in a week or even a night. If this were so we should have harbours with proper defences, airfields, 8 or 9 French divisions, a certain amount of Air and, perhaps, the French Fleet in Toulon. In this case the British troops could be railed rapidly through to attack Tripoli from the West. There is no question of the Germans being able in the time mentioned, a fortnight or even a month, to mount and launch a heavy attack. They have not got above all the Air Force to spare. We must very heavy operations in Egypt and Libya will have been already in progress. Therefore I think if things go well for us on the North African shore it may be that a large number of assault ships and tank landing craft will be free to go North for "JUPITER". To these would be added all the additions to our tank landing force and assault ships, over and above those assigned to "TORCH", which were coming into Britain under "BOLERO" for the purposes of "ROUND-UP". It is no use saying the Americans have cancelled all this, because we have not yet given them the reasons against such improvident action. I am sure I can claim from the United States for the purposes of "JUPITER" all the craft or at any rate enough of them. I admit the escorts are the pinch.

6. On the other hand, if the French fight the Americans in "TORCH" and ask the Germans to come and help them, and the Germans come, or the Spaniards turn against us and we have to fight neck or nothing in the "TORCH" area, naturally in that case "JUPITER" does not have to be argued about. 

7. Para, 25 of the summary of General McNaughton&apos;s paper seems to me very wise, and that is all I ask now, to wit, (a)Immediate P.R.U. reconnaissances to make the mosaic, this also

l. Had long conference this morning with Eisenhower and your officers. Cunningham and Ramsay present and our Chiefs of Staff.



2. General Eisenhower announced that the final date for "TORCH" would be (see my following telegram). Everything is being worked to this.



3. We now know that P.Q.18 carried 27 ships safely to Archangel and 13 are sunk. For P.Q.l9. 40 ships are already loaded but it is impossible to send this Convoy without throwing back the date of "TORCH" by three weeks. We all regard any delay in "TORCH" as inadmissable.



4. The time has therefore come to tell Stalin, first that there will be no P.Q.19 and secondly that we cannot run any more P.Q.s till the end of the year, i.e. January. This is a formidable moment in Anglo-American-Soviet relations and you and I must be united in any statement made about convoys.



5. We are solemnly pledged to the supply of Russia and the most grave consequences might follow from failure to make good. For 1943 there may be two choices. First to run from January onwards Arctic convoys under the present conditions of danger, waste and effort, observing that we used 77 warships for P.Q. 18 and think ourselves fortunate to have lost no more than one third of the merchant ships.



6. Secondly, the Operation called "JUPITER". It is more than doubtful whether the developments of "TORCH" will leave shipping and escort resources sufficient for "JUPITER" unless you can help at any rate with the latter. We must however also know what importance Stalin would attach to the Operation and what contribution he would make to it. See the account of my last conversation with him where I mentioned two divisions and he offered three. Our estimate here is that larger numbers would be required, and I repeat the shipping problem is unsolved and is anyhow dependent on "TORCH" developments.



7. It seems to me that simply to tell him now no more P.Q.s till 1943 is a great danger, and I therefore wish to open Staff conversations on "JUPITER" under all necessary reserves. See the telegram I propose to send to him after consulting Mackenzie King, which, as you will see, leaves both British and Soviet Governments free to decide when the result of the Joint Staffs study is completed. Of course if you were able to take an interest in this it would be most helpful. As in a few days it will be necessary to unload and discharge P.Q.19 I felt this new project necessary to break the blow.



8. I gained the impression at the Conference that "ROUND-UP" was not only delayed or impinged upon by "TORCH"





:   but was to &quot;bo regarded as. definitely off for 191+30   Thiswill he another tremendous blow for Staling   Already.        Maisky is asking questions about the Spring offensive,i4P r       I understood that the words of our agreement stood, namely,that all preparations should go forward in a balanced way as fast as possible.     Under all circumstances it is - ,. indispensable to hold the Germans pinned on the&quot; Channelcoast of France o   However Mountbatton says lar&quot;.ing craftate hot going forward as arranged, and of course the &apos;movement of American troops across the Atlantic will &apos;evidently be greatly reduced,9*    V/e ought now to make a new programme 3. So far threeUnited States divisions have arrived here, all of whichWiS,l   shortly leave for&quot;?.&apos;CRCH&quot;,   We have sent six divisions from the United Kingdom -;his year and are holding fourmore ready for &quot;TORCH&quot;,    If we are to be able to takeadvantage of a broakdowr in enemy morale..., or an undne-weakening of their forces in Europe next Spring, or.alternatively, if thing&apos;j go badly for us and we haveto face the possibility of invasion, it will be necessaryfor yqu in the next six months to send at least eightUnited States division? to the United Kingdom in addition&apos;to your air force prog: !ummo,   U9S0 General Smith says that at least twenty si: Ip loads could be saved by useof the proportion of British equipment which we hope tobe able tb supplyc   Al bo these divisions can work uphere almost as well as at homo,10*   I can quite see how in thc*altered circumstances you would be inclined to s. lift the emphasis from building Tanklanding-craft to&apos; esco:i&apos; : vessels., but I hope this will not gotoo far and that you will give me a steady flow both oftroops and landing-c^i/1 up to the limit of shippingpossibilities^   Could * ou please send as soon as possiblerevlso^ programmes of   shat we may expect in the next twelve months between now and next September under themB0LSR0&quot;t&quot;R0UND-UP&quot; s-.\ieme.

It seems vital to all our plans not only that weshould be free from - ih5 invasion menace but that the enemyshould feel our pressu?e and we be able to take advantageof any serious deterioration in German morale.   In thisconnection every ax gum 3nt used for &quot;SLEDGEHAMMER&quot; and/or&quot;ROUND-UP&quot; counts even more in 19^3 and ISUk than it didin 19^2 and 19ij-3o11*   If &quot;TORCH&quot; prevci hard and costly and if we have tofight French and Germans and perhaps Spaniards, there couldof course be no question of &quot;JUPITER&quot; ,   ?/e British wouldrequire to r einf or js   ;T0RCH&quot; from Great Britain,   Thus itis all the more no re a sary that we receive the fullest flow of American divisions and air forces,to the United Kingdorru12*   But there  Is a nore favourable assumption to whichpersonally I in-line .. namely, taSat by the- end of november the United States wv&apos;;h French assistance will be masters ofFrench North Africa zjid that the British expedition will be

striking from &quot;TORCH&quot; at Tripoli.   General Alexanderwill attack in sufficient time to influence &quot;TORCH&quot;favourably should.he be successful.,   If all goes wellin &quot;TORCH&quot; and &quot;LIGHTFOOT&quot; we might control the wholeNorth African shore by the end of the year, thussaving some of the masses of shipping now roundingthe Cape,   This is our first great prize,13,, It would then be open to us.to decide on thenext move,     If the Russian need were sufficientlygrave and their demands imperative we might decide to do &quot;JUPITER&quot; instead of attacking the under-bellyof the Axis by Sardinia, Sicily and even possiblyItaly,   We ought to have the option open whichentails not only paper Staff studies but all suchpreparations as do not hamper our immediate-agreedactionolUo   To sum up, my persisting anxiety is Russia, andI do not see how wo can reconcile it with ourconsciences or&apos; with our interests to have no moreP,Q**s till 1943, no offer to make joint plans for &quot;JUPITER&quot;, and no signs of a Spring, summer oreven autumn offensive in Europe,   I should be most grateful for your counsel on all this.   MeanwhileI am sending you a draft of a suggested jointtelegram from us both about the suspension of theP,Q, convoys.

8. I gained the impression at the Conference that "ROUND-UP" was not only delayed or impinged upon by "TORCH" but was to be regarded as definitely off for 1943. This will be another tremendous blow for Stalin. Already Maisky is asking questions about the Spring offensive. I understood that the workds of our agreement stood, namely, that all preparations should go forward in a balanced way as fast as possible. Under all circumstances it is indispensable to hold the Germans pinned on the Channel coast of France. However Mountbatten says landing craft are not going forward as arranged, and of course the movement of American troops across the Atlantic will evidently be greatly reduced.



9. We ought, now to make a new programme. So far three United States divisions have arrived here, all of which will shortly leave for "TORCH". We have sent six divisions from the United Kingdom and are holding four more ready for "TORCH". If we are to be able to take advantage of a breakdown in enemy morale, or an undue weakening of their forces in Europe next Spring, or alternatively, if things go badly for us and we have to face the possibility of invasion, it will be necessary for you in the next six months to send at least eight United States divisions to the United Kingdom in addition to your air force programme. U.S. General Smith says that at least twenty ship loads could be saved by use of the proportion of British equipment which we hope to be able to supply. Also these divisions can work up here almost as well as at home.



10. I can quite see how in the altered circumstances you would be inclined to shift the emphasis from building landing-craft to escort vessels, but I hope this will not go too far and that you will give me a steady flow both of troops and landing-craft up to the limit of shipping possibilities. Could you please send as soon as possible revised programmes of what we may expect in the next twelve months between now and next September under the "BOLERO"-"ROUND-UP" scheme. Only then can we make plans for our own safety and the accommodation of you men apart altogether from enterprises such as "JUPITER". By a further rigorous handling of the British manpower problem we are hoping to bring the nine Beach divisions up to full field standard. It seems vital to all our plans not only that we should be free from the invasion menace but that the enemy should feel our pressure and we be able to take advantage of any serious deterioration in German morale. In this connection every argument used for "SLEDGEHAMMER" and/or "ROUND-UP" counts even more in 1943 and 1944 than it did in 1942 and 1943.



11. If "TORCH" proves hard and costly and if we have to fight French and Germans and perhaps Spaniards, there could of course be no question of "JUPITER". We British would require to reinforce "TORCH" from Great Britain. Thus it is all the more necessary that we receive the fullest flow of American divisions and air forces to the United Kingdom.



12. But there is a more favourable assumption to which personally I incline, namely, that by the end of November the United States with French assistance will be masters of French...



 French North Africa and that the British expedition will be striking from "TORCH" at Tripoli. General Alexander will attack in sufficient time to influence "TORCH" favourably should he be successful. His operation is called (see my telegram No. 153). If all goes well on both operations we might control the whole North African shore by the end of the year, thus saving some of the masses of shipping now rounding the Cape. This is our first great prize.



13. It would then be open to us to decide on the next move. If the Russian need were sufficiently grave and their demands imperative we might decide to do "JUPITER" instead of attacking the under-belly of the Axis by Sardinia, Sicily and even possibly Italy. We ought to have the option open which entails not only paper Staff studies but all such preparations as do not hamper our immediate agreed action.



14. To sum up, my persisting anxiety is Russia, and I do not see how we can reconcile it with our consciences or with our interests to have no more P.Q.s till 1843, no offer to make joint plans for "JUPITER", and no signs of a Spring, summer or even autumn offensive in Europe. I should be most grateful for your counsel on all this. We wish urgently to send the telegram (of which copy follows separately) to Stalin, and hope that you will back it up as strongly and as soon as you can.

PRIME MINISTER&apos;S PERSONAL TELEGRAM

SERIAL No T.1245/2



Following is text of telegram referred to in my No.151 which I wish to send to Stalin.



Begins.



1. As I told you in Moscow, we are convinced that the most effective contribution that we and the United States can make in 1942 to the defeat of Germany is to launch "TORCH" at the earliest possible date.



2. The date which has now been finally fixed with the President is early in November.



3. The effect of "TORCH" must be either (a) to oblige the Germans to divert air and land forces to counter our move, or (b) to compel them to accept the new position created by the success of "TORCH", which would then create a further diversion by the threat of attack against Sicily and the South of Europe.



4. The considerable success of the last convoy operation was achieved only because no less than 77 warships were employed on the operation. Protection on anything like this scale will be impossible until the end of the year, when the naval escorts which we must now assemble for "TORCH" can again be made available in Northern Waters.



5. In the meanwhile we are trying to find means of sending you supplies on a reduced scale by the Northern route during the rest of 1942.

Following for Prime Minister from Prime Minister. Begins.



We wish to send McNaughton to Moscow to discuss with Stalin and his experts the possibilities of the Operation Jupiter, for the examination of which you kindly placed him at our disposal in July. There will be no question of any Canadian commitment. I shall be greatly obliged if you will authorise me to propose his name to Stalin. Ends.
