Future Operations. (Previous Reference: W.M.(42) 88th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

At the request of the Prime Minister. THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF gave the War Cabinet an account of the conferences which had taken place with the United States Chiefs of Staffs. The latter had spent all Saturday and Sunday working with the United States Staffs in this country. The first meeting with the British Chiefs  of Staffs had taken place on Monday, 20th duly, at which the Americans had presented a Memorandum.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read to the War Cabinet the four main paragraphs from this Memorandum dealing with SLEDGEHAMMER (See Annex "A" to these Minutes). It would he seen that SLEDGEHAMMER was envisaged by the United States Chiefs of Staffs as either: -

(a) a desperate venture to assist Russia; or

(b) a valuable prelude to the ROUND-UP operation of 1943.

After the British Chiefs of Staffs had given the Americans their general views as to operations on the Continent and elsewhere, discussion had been resumed on Tuesday in regard to SLEDGEHAMMER, which had been discussed more particularly as a preliminary operation to ROUND-UP.

At the meeting that morning, the American Chiefs of staffs had put in a Memorandum recommending the adoption of SLEDGEHAMMER for execution at the earliest possible date in 1943. This Memorandum was read to the War Cabinet  (see Annex "B" to these Minutes).

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff then gave his views of the position.

The first point concerned the prospect of landing in the Cherbourg Peninsula. This was a difficult operation? but held out some prospect of success in certain conditions.

The second question was whether, assuming we made a successful landing, we could maintain ourselves in the peninsula. Cherbourg itself was on the fringe of the area over which fighters could operate from this country. No continuous fighter protection could be maintained. It had been calculated that the maximum force which could be maintained at the port of Cherbourg was six Divisions, plus ancillary, A.A., and other units. A force of this ? could not, however, get very far inland. The Peninsula was, some 20 kilometres wide at the tip, widening to about 100 kilometres at the base. To hold the latter point would require a force of at least ten Divisions.  Given the conditions likely to prevail in the port, it would not be ?any to expand our fores to this else. As not more than ? United States Divisions would be available, the rest of th? force would to be provided by this country.



As regards the Air position, it was estimated that the Germans had now about ? bombers available to operate four French aerodromes. The enemy could however, ? reinforcements quickly. The Chief of the Imperial General staff reminded the War Cabinet of how speedy the Germans had reinforced the air forces operating against Malta at the end of last year, notwithstanding the fact that the Russian campaign was still continuing.

The Germans had about 27 Divisions in France, of which about 15 were in the, coastal areas from Belgium to Brest. A force of some 6 to 10 Divisions could quickly be built up and brought to bear against our invading force. Furthermore, the Germans now had a total of about 284 Divisions against 250 Russian Divisions. Without taking any account of the Italian forces, therefore the Germans could mass a considerable force against our troops in the Cherbourg Peninsula. They would soon be bottled up in the Peninsula, and a systematic attack would be developed on the troops and on the port facilities. He thought the result might well be that our forces would be driven back into Hie sea. In this event, the operation would serve the purpose of giving us a preliminary foothold which could be used for the development of ROUND-UP in the following years; while the troops themselves, and their equipments would be lost.

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that, so far as concerned the assault phase, a fighter force of 100 could be made available on the first day, for threes hours and thereafter a force of 36 fighters at a time could be made available. This effort on this scale could only be maintained for about two or three days, and it could not be exceeded until we had seized aerodromes. The enemy air force immediately available against us would have a first line strength of about 324 bombers and 426 fighters, of which, may, 7?% would be serviceable at the outset of the operations. The scale of air protection which we could provide was not sufficient to ensure that we should not suffer severe losses during the assault.

The Chief of the Air Staff then described the problem of maintaining our hold once we had secured it. This meant the capture of aerodromes and the provision of anti-?craft protection. Assuming that we captured two aerodromes in the Peninsula, that we made three more landing-grounds in the Peninsula and also captured the two aerodromes in the Channel Islands, we should be able to maintain a force of, say, 200 to 280 fighters. We should, however, also require the protection of 300 heavy and 300 light A.A. guns, the ?nition etc. for which, would add to the maintenance problem. Assuming that the Russians were still holding on the Volga, that Rommel had been driven back, and that Germany was not engaged in major operations in Persia, ? or Spain, Germany might possibly be able to build up against as a force of 700 bombers and 930 fighters, of which, say, 78% would be serviceable at the outset of operations, and 60% later on.

It must be remembered that Cherbourg was a small, part covering only a few acres,, and would be a primary objective of enemy air attack. We should be exposed to day bombing with fighter protection. Although, no doubt, we should take



 a heavy tell of the air attackers, he thought that after six months the port would be a heap of ? and would not provide us with more than sheltered water.

 THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that the weather conditions in the Channel during the last ten years had been analysed. The weather broke between the second and third weeks of September and the second week in October. On the average, in September there would be 4.3 periods of four consecutive days suitable for landing operations, and 2.2 such periods in October. Westerly gales were three times as likely in October as in September. In heavy gales it would not be possible to ? of the transports across the Channel. The Cherbourg Peninsula had, however, the advantage that the beaches on one side of it would presumably offer sheltered water whether the wind was in the West or in the East.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would have to decide whether they should direct that the Chiefs of Staff should proceed with the SLEDGEHAMMER plan, notwith-standing the views which they held as to its feasibility. In his own (the Prime Minister&apos;s) view, the Cherbourg Peninsula was an attractive objective as part of a scheme which involved simultaneous landings on several parts of the French coast. If, however, no landings were made except in the Cherbourg Peninsula, we should find great difficulty in hanging on to territory which we had captured, and in maintaining our invading force, while the enemy brought all his Air Force to bear on a single small port. Moreover,even if we could maintain ourselves, the drain on our resources of men would be such that R0UND-UP would be indefinitely delayed in the following year. Again, there was nothing to prevent the enemy from building a strong defensive Line across the narrow neck of the Peninsula and bottling up our forces. On the other hand, we must not show ourselves too ready to raise difficulties.

 THE SECRETARY OF STATUS FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS asked whether the Americans had worked out a definite plan of operations, or whether they looked upon this operation as an idea Which should be considered. He was informed that the Americans had been hard at work, since they arrived on Saturday, in working out a plan, presumably for assault. It was not know whether they had prepared any plan for subsequent maintenance.

 THE CHIEF OF COMBINED OPERATIONS stated that he believed that the assault of the Cherbourg Peninsula would be feasible. Since March last he had taken the view that this was the one area of the coast on which we could stage a successful assault this year. Detailed planning for operation on this part of the coast, had, however, not been pursued, on the grounds that we should not help Russia by operations in the Cherbourg Peninsula, since we could not bring our strong Air Fores fully to bear against the enemy&apos;s Air Force in this area. This we could only do in the Pas de Calais area.



 THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had considered whether, if it was decided that we should say that we did not agree with the view put forward by the United States Chiefs of Staff in their Memorandum, we should say (a) that we were not in agreement with their view, or (b) that, while we did not share the American opinion, if they wished to conduct the operation we were prepared to carry it out with them. He saw danger in the second course and thought that, on the whole, the wisest course, if we did not see our way to agree with the American proposal in regard to carrying out SLEDGEHAMMER in 1942, was that we should ask the American Chiefs of Staff to report to the President that it had not been possible to reach an agreed plan for this operation.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that no discussions had yet taken place as to what alternative operation could be carried out if agreement was not reached to carry out SLEDGEHAMMER in 1942. It had been decided that we should first reach a decision on SLEDGEHAMMER before considering alternative operations. If SLEDGEHAMMER was abandoned, discussion of GYMNAST would at once be started. If it was decided not to carry out SLEDGEHAMMER in 1942, planning for ROUND-UP in 1945 would, of course, continue.

 THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF agreed that if SLEDGEHAMMER was abandoned for 1942, we should continue planning for ROUND-UP. It was relevant, in this connection, that it would not be until September that enough American troops would have arrived in this country to replace the forces that we had removed from Northern Ireland. The Chiefs of Staffs&apos; view was that GYMNAST should be carried out before the end of 1942, since otherwise there was a risk that the enemy would anticipate us. GYMNAST would, therefore, be carried out many months before ROUND-UP could take place. But the repercussions of GYMNAST (or of MOHICAN, which was a more powerful and extended version of GYMNAST) on ROUND-UP had not yet been fully examined. He thought that, while there had been no definite discussion with the Americans on GYMNAST, they were favourably impressed with the importance of the scheme, and that they had not hitherto taken into account the advantage which would accrue in the saving of shipping if he Mediterranean route could be re-opened.

 THE PRIME MINISTER then read to the War Cabinet telegram No. 990, Private and Personal, dated 23rd July, from Admiral Cunningham to the First Sea Lord, on the advantage of GYMNAST, and stressing the importance of the operation including, if possible, a surprise attack on Bizerta.

 THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that he greatly favoured operations MOHICAN. If the Germans were to occupy the North African Atlantic littoral, our W.S. convoys would have to go over to the American side of the Atlantic. As the result, the journey from Liverpool to Bombay would be lengthened from 12,000 miles to 15,500 miles, as compared with a figure of 7,300 miles by the route through the Mediterranean.                                                                 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that, on the political side, he thought that SLEDGEHAMMER suffered from the serious disadvantages that it would be 



be carried out too late this year to give any help, either morally our militarily, to Russia. He had not greatly favoured a project for landing at Casablanca alone, since he thought it would be a long time before troops landed at Casablanca could make their way along the North African coast. In the meanwhile the Spanish position might develop in an unpleasant way. These objections, however, did not apply to operation MOHICAN, which he understood included a landing at several points on the North African coast. The timing of the right plan, however, was of the utmost importance.

THE PRIME MINISTER then asked members of the War Cabinet for an expression of their views.

All expressed themselves in favour of making clear that we did not agree to operation SLEDGEHAMMER being carried out in 1942, and favoured operation MOHICAN.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was for consideration whether a Memorandum should be handed to the Americans in reply to the Memorandum dated 21st July which was handed to our Chiefs of Staff. On the whole, he thought that the right course was that a Memorandum should be prepared and kept for record, setting out our reasons against carrying out this operation, but should not be handed to the Americans unless they asked for such a document.

 As regards the reply to be given, he thought that the United Stated Chiefs of Staffs should be asked to inform the President that it had not been found possible to reach agreement on the proposed plan for SLEDGEHAMMER in 1942. This would, he thought, open the way for discussion on the alternative operations with the least difficulty.

 The War Cabinet agreed with this conclusion, which General Ismay was instructed to convey orally to the United States Chiefs of Staffs.

22ND JULY, 1942.



ANNEX A

 9. SLEDGEHAMMER was promised on the realisation that circumstances in 1942 might be such as to require, even compel,  definite action within the general from-work of ROUND-UP, before that attack can be fully mounted.

 20. With respect to the Russian situation, there are three possible conditions that could develop during the remainder of this years-

 (a) A deterioration of Russian strength becoming apparent, with a possibility of collapse.

 (b) A gradual turn for the better in the Russian situation with a progressive absorption of German strength on to the Eastern Front.

 (c) A continuance of the struggle on the Russian front with the battle progressively approaching the crisis, with a consequent effort on both sides to bring to bear every available ounce of strength in order to clinch the victory or to avoid defeat.

 11. If the situation develops as indicated first above (10(a)), the question for the Allies to decide now is whether or not SLEDGEHAMMER shall be undertaken in a desperate endeavour to relieve the Russian situation. We would be guilty of a gross military blunder if Germany should be permitted to eliminate an Allied army of 8,000,000 men, when some stroke of ours might have saved the situation.

 12. If the Russian campaign develops as indicated in paragraph 10 (b) above, the Allies must decide whether SLEDGEHAMMER should not be undertaken on the ground that it provides for the leisure and expansion of a foothold on the Continent as a preliminary useful step towards the full evolution of ROUND-UP in 1943.

 13. If a situation comparable to that set forth in paragraph 10 (c) above should develop, with German defensive forces in Europe reduced to a mininum, SLEDGEHAMMER would constitute the most effective nation that the Allies could take on behalf of Russia and, indeed, for the Allied cause in general.



ANNEX B.

 1. We propose that SLEDGEHAMMER be immediately adopted as a combined British-American operational plan for execution at the earliest possible date in 1942, not later than October 15th, under the following conditions and intentions:-

 (a) That SLEDGEHAMMER be regarded as the opening phase of ROUND-UP with a consequent purpose, not only of remaining upon the continent, but of building up ground and air forces and logistic facilities, and expanding our foothold, to the limit of our capabilities.

 (b) That the immediate tactical objectives be Cherbourg and the Channel Islands.

 (c) That a Task Force Commander for the operation be designated now, and charged with full responsibility for planning, organisation, special preparation and training the Combined U.K. - U.S. force and for the execution of SLEDGEHAMMER, American commanders, ground, naval, and air, will be directed to report to the Task Force Commander immediately. He must be given a firm commitment of the ground, naval and air force allocated for the operation.

 2. Supporting reasons for these proposals are:-

 (a) The indispensable prerequisite to successful attack against Western France is the intensive preoccupation of the German Army and Air Forces in operations against Russia. This condition prevails this fall probably more markedly than it will again.

 (b) Even though the forces that can be transported to France this fall are relatively small, they may will be stronger in proportion to the opposition expected than the numerically greater strength we will have available next spring.

 (c) With a foothold on the continent, the opportunity is afforded us to continue expansion through every type of aggressive action. It will afford some relief from the continued inaction we are now enduring.

 (d) Successful offensive action this fall will provide valuable training and experience to the attacking forces and commanders. It will tend to promote an offensive spirit throughout the entire British and American armies, and peoples.

 (e) Speed in such an undertaking will have a bolstering effect upon Russian morals and will either force some material diversions from the Russian front or will allow us to operate in France against the weakest forces we can ever hope to find there.

 (f) Because of the necessary concentrations for the defence of the United Kingdom and the short convey routes from the United States, Great



Britain is the only region in which the bulk of our forces can be combined for a unified offensive effort against Germany. To avoid further dispersion of forces, the major offensive effort should be initiated in this region. The concept of ROUND-UP must not be abandoned as long as there remains any possibility of its successful execution.

 (g) Possession of a port, even if reduced by bombing to a fraction of its normal capacity, may prove to be a determining factor in our ability to undertake a large scale continental operation. Any expansion of our foothold, realised during the winter, will further increase our chances for success in ROUND-UP.

 (h) Cherbourg is proposed as the first objective because the prospect of initial tactical success appears greatest in that area, and the prospect of sustaining ourselves, with a relatively good port and secure flanks, appears favourable.

 (i) Occupation of Cherbourg will seriously interfere with German communications throughout the length of the English Channel.

 (j) The seizure of this important area will be carried out before the enemy has opportunity further to fortify the locality and increase the effectiveness of beach defences. Its capture will facilitate raiding and reconnaissance operations during the winter throughout the length of the French coast.

 (k) It will provide, for next spring&apos;s operations, the best deepwater port within reach of supporting fighter aircraft. It will give positive evidence to the people of France and other occupied countries of our will to carry the war to the enemy.

 3. Major disadvantages as far advanced against the plan are commented upon as follows:-

 (a) Lack of air support. Other than the Calais area, the region is one of the most favourably situated localities on the French coast for supporting air operations based in England. While our aid strength is not so great as it will be next spring, its action will be completely concentrated on one area.

 (b) Interference with training for ROUND-UP. This is one of the inescapable costs of the operation, but it is believed that, by careful planning and intensified effort in the production and transfer of landing craft from U.S. to Great Britain, this interferene will be minimised. In this connection, the transfer of personnel from the Cherbourg assaulting units to divisions in the United Kingdom will give the latter a leavening of men with combat experience in this type of operation.
