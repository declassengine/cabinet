CONflT,USIONSf MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(7th August, 1942, 11.15 p.me)MIDDLE EAST.MilitaryAppoint-aents .(previous reference:W-.M.(42) 106thConclus ions,minute el.)The War Cabinet met to consider a telegram from   thePrime Minister (REFLEX No.35) (Appendix I) in reply to the telegram sent earlier in the day by the Deputy PrimeMinister (TULIP No. 45) about the changes in thesystem   of Command in the Middle East.Discussion centred mainly on   the followingpoints(a) The proposed re-organisation of the presentMiddle East Command into two, separate Commands .It was recalled that, when it had been decided in December, 1941, to set. up   a single unified command in the Middle East, it had been felt that the issueshad been fairly evenly balanced.   At that time it hadbeen argued against the proposal that it would bedifficult for one Commander to control so large an area&quot;,    that the Armies in Egypt and in the persian gulf areas had different and divergent lines ofsupply;   moreover, a choice for headquarters wouldhave to be made between Cairo and Baghdad, since therewas no- suitable location for G.H.Q,. between the two areas.   General Wavell had also opposed the unifiedMiddle East Command.The main   arguments in favour of the unified command had been that, since the Middle East might-be attacked from Libya, Turkey or the Caucasus, allthese fronts should be controlled by one Commander,who could transfer his reserves as the situationdemanded.   Moreover, the air forces in the whole&apos; area hadalready been put under one Command^ and must so remain. -The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that,while on balance   they did not favour the suggestedre-organisation of the two Commands., the case againstthe re-organisation was neither so strong nor soclear-cut that they could properly oppose the viewsof those on the! spot.&apos; (b) The appointment of, General Auchinleek ffothe proposed Middle East pomnand (Persia and Iraq&apos;).In paragraph 5 of REFLEX Nc 35 the PrimeMinister expressed the view that while the need^for making an abrupt and decisive change in the Commandagainst Rommel and giving the Army the sense of a newsmart, had induced him.to propose a re-distribution ofCommands, General Auchinleck had his (the PrimeMinisters) entire confidence as the head of an Armywith a single and direct purpose.

Certain Ministers felt some doubts- whether thenew appointment could easily be reconciled with,,the.reasons which had led to the proposal to remove general auchinleck from his present post.&apos;   Doubts were expressed as- to whether, if he had. lost the confidence of thetroops   under his Command, that confidence would be restored by appointment to tho new post.   Further, itwas argued that the appointment would give rise to criticism at home, where comment would be made that-wewere following tho practice of creating-new -posts, for^ppointmen^B^&apos; *&quot;ai-L-et      niake good in their existing(c) It was felt that force would be added to these comments if G-enera.1 AuohinlecX continued to be described as &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East&quot;, although in command Of only one Army.   Moreover, the. use of the term-&apos; &quot;Middle East&quot; for Iraq and Persia would createconfusion in   the public mind.   Importance was attached,to the use of some different term.(d) Command of the Eighth Army.Some doubts were expressed   as- to whether theappointment   of General &quot;Alexander to be C.-in-C. Cairomight not lead to   a repetition of the position in whichthe Commander-in-Chief had taken charge of the.directconduct of operations of the Eighth Army-. - It wassuggested that this might have undesirable, consequences,and. that   it&apos;was important to ensure that- one&quot; general was responsible for fighting the battle against Rommelin the West era, D es ert. &quot;-During discussion of this point, telegramsarrived (REFLEX 3 6 and 37) reporting that General Gott,whom the Prime Minister had proposed for the command of the Eighth Army, had been- shot down in   the air and killed, and asking that General Montgomery shouldcone out at once and take up the Command of the eighth army * , ,After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreedto the despatch Of the telesram to the Prime Minister &apos;attached, to this Annex as Appendix II (TULIP NO. 61 hThe Vice Ohief of the Imperial General Staff was asked to arrange for-General Montgommery to fly out toOalro,as soon as possible.Great George Street, S .W.1.I -   i -        &apos;: I. &quot;S-wmi-xsz-x. ^-;w-vi,:- &apos; ...........................

MOST SECRET CYPHER TELEGRAM.MOST IMMEDIATE.Proms- Mideast.To;-    Air Ministry:,REFLEX WOo 35o 7.8P 420Prime Minister to Deputy Prime Minister.Your TULIP No. 45.1.     Our proposal to divide the Command is made entirely on merits.   I doubt if the disasters would have occurred in theWestern Desert if General Auchinleck had not been distracted bythe divergent considerations of a too-widely extended front -see especially his reply of 22e5,42. to my CS.1O10 of 20.5.42.Paragraph 4 of thisi reply shows that he would have taken directcommand of the battle :which began at the end of May but forreluctance to become &quot;immersed in tactical problems in Libya&quot;0This phrase in itself reveals the false proportion engendered byextraneous reponsibilitieso    It is in fact &quot;the tactical problemsof Libya&quot; which dominate our immediate affairs.2.     The two Commands are separated by desert areas of 300or 400 miles, and the only lateral communications between them are *by the railv/ay through Turkey which we cannot use for the passageof troops, by motor tracks across the desert and by sea voyage:round Arabia, taking nearly 14 days.   Both Commands have entirely different bases of supply^   The Near East from the Canal zone andthe Middle East from the Persian Gulf ports leading up theEuphrates, and also by the Trans-Persian railway to the Northernfronts against invasion from the Caucasus or Caspian Basin.    Itwould be more natural to associate Iraq- and Persia with the IndianCommand, to which they are joined by short direct sea connectionsfrom Karachi and Bombay-,   General Wavell began this week bysuggesting that they should be returned to the Indian sphere.The main, reason why they were detached was because on the outbreakof war -with Japan, General Wavell had to look eastward to burma and Malaya, and we wished to relieve him of this distraction.3.     There lis (no natural unity between the two commands nowproposed for Near and Middle Easto    It is quite true that batteredwar divisions from the Western Desert will be sent to recuperatein the new Middle East Command, but such transferences can besettled quite easily by the Chiefs of Staff in London in the same manner as they now settle the far more important questions as to where divisions arc to be sent as they round the Cape, or whetherdivisions areto be ordered back:from India to the Persian theatre.4.     All the above views are endorsed by Field Marshal Smutsand 0.I.G-.S. &apos; We are all-convinced, that the division now proposed.is :sound on geographicals strategic and administrative grouhds. ;5.     It is quite/a separate question who should fill the Iraq*-Persia Command and command the Tenth Army now formed or formingthereo     This Tenth Army is now commanded by General Quinan who?

it is agreed by all here, is not adequate ih the task.I have no hesitation in proposing Auchinieck&apos;s appointment(?) to it0   At the head of an army with a single and directpurpose he commands my entire confidence.   If he had takencommand of the Eighth Army when I urged him to I believewe should have won the Gazala battle, and many people herethink the same   He has shown high-minded qualities ofcharacter and resolution.   He restored the battle ofSidi Eeaeghj) and has only recently stemmed the retreatat Alamoin.   There is no officer here or in India whohas better credentials.   Only the need of making anabrupt and decisive change in the command against Rommeland giving the Array the sense of a new start has inducedme to propose the re-distribution of Commands.    I shouldbe most reluctant to embarrass Alexander with remotecares at a moment when all our fortunes turn upon the speedy and decisive defeat of Rommel.   Nor can I advise that General Auchinleck should be ruined and cast asideas unfit to render any further service.   I am sure thatif he accepts the directions which I seek Cabinet authorityto give him? ho will in no way have lost confidence inhimself but,, on the contrary, will address himself tohis new taskp with single-minded vigour.   Here I must pointout that &quot;when General Wavell was removed from the middle east Command to India he in no way lost his reputation withthe public at home or abroad, and this was proved by thefact that the President specially asked for him to beappointed Supreme Commander of the A.B.D.A. area in spiteof the defeats he had sustained and some mistakes thathe had madee.   60     My rooommendations stand as a whole, beingconceived in their integrity solely from the point ofview of the harmonious division of responsibilities and ofthe selection of the best men to discharge them.   Indeed Ithink the nation will admire the array of our distinguishedcommanders Wavell Auchinleck and Alexander each facingtheir respective dangers on the vast front which extendsfrom Cairo to Calcutta.7*     There is no difficulty in preserving a singleAir Command over the existing Middle East area.   We are all impressed with Air Marshal Tedder&apos;s work here.    Thefact that the new Command will be separate no moreprevents him from exercising authority over the R.A.P. inIraq and Persia than it does in the entirely separateCommand of General Platt in East Africa.8.     I earnestly hope that my colleagues will find themselves able on further consideration of this most difficult problem to authorise me to proceed as Iproposeo    In all this I have the complete agreement ofSmuts and C- I0G0S.   A decision has now become most urgentsince Alexander has already started and Auchinleck has,of course, no inkling of what is in prospect,   I mustapprise him tomorrow.90     I am most grateful for the agreement of theCabinet to the other parts of my plan, grave though they be. -\
