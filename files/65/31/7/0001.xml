In the meantime we woulddespatch immediately to the Persian Gulf someof the ships which were to have sailed in theP.Q. convoyoTHE PRIME MINISTER said that on theprevious night M. Mai sky had handed to him theRussian reply.     This was read out to the WarCabinet.     (A copy is annexed to these Minutes as annex A).     The Prime Minister also reformedto   a number of points in this telegram whichwere contrary to the facts.,     (Sea note appended to these Miiuites as Aimox B,)It would be very easy for us to answercertain passages in this telegram;   e.g., thestatement that &quot;with good will and readiness to fulfil the contracted obligations, the convoyscould be regularly undertaken&quot;.   But it was important that we should avoid a wrangle, Whichwould be of no advantage to either of us.   He had accordingly contented himself with saying toMe Maiskyj that he would not have received a message in these terras but for the stern fightwhich the Russians were putting up against theGermans?   that he would consult the Cabinet;   butthat his present view was that it would be better that Premier Staling telegram should be leftunanswered: and that wo would, of course, continueto do our utmost to help the Russians0 jSUPPLIES TORUSSIA.(PreviousRetscenes %W,M.(42)86thConclusionsfMinute 1.)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had seen M.* Mai sky that afternoon,and had expressed the view to him that it was apity that an ariswea? had heen sent in these terms.He thought that, on the whole, it would he better that we should not answer Premier Stalin&apos;telegram, as we could not do so without replying to the charges made in it,     M* Maisky had-been disposed to agree with this view, more especially  -since Premier Stalin1 s telegram could perhapshe regarded as a reply to the Prime Ministerstelegram of the 17th July.     He had, however,suggested that it would he very helpful if a fullexplanation could he given to him, and to hisNaval Attache, of the reasons why we had decidedthat we must discontinue sailing the convoys.Such a meeting might result in the Russians heingpersuaded that nothing could he donej   or itmight result in agreement that some action waspossible.     In any case it would result in abetter understanding of each other position?which would he something gained.It was agreed that such an explanationshould be given.THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Mai sky had also raised the noint that apparently we had ceasedheavy bombing attacks on Germany.    He had repliedthat we haa being doing all that was possiblein bad weatherj   and that we had dropped more bombs in the preceding month on Germany than in any previous month.     Further, we hoped to carry out some heavy bombing attacks in the approachingfull moon period.     He thought, however, thatit would be desirable that a meeting should takeplace, at which an explanation could be given to M.Mais&amp;y as to our bombing effort.This course was agreed to.It was also suggested that, from the Russianpoint of view, it was undesirable to lay too muchemphasis in the immediate future on the bombing of submarine yards^THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that it wouldbe desirable that the statement   in PremierStaling telegram, which implied that we had failed to carry out a definite undertaking, shouldnot be allowed to go by default.     The best planmight be that this matter should be dealt withorally by the Foreign Secretary with M* Maisky, butnot until after the position vis^-yis navaland air operations had been explained to him*The question was also raised as toGommarido raids on the Continent, from the point ofview of their effect on Russian morale.     THEPRIME MINISTER Said that he told M. Maisky that heavy raids would be carried put in the nearfuture.

The view was expressed that there was some risk that -public opinion might get out of hand asregards the starting of a Second Front in Europe^more particularly if the situation on the russian front became more serious, and that it might bedesirable that the Prime Minister should see thePre s so the War Cabinet:-.(l) Agreed with-the viev; that PremierStaling telegram should be treated as not requiring any written answer:(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, the FirstLord and the First Sea Lord   to arrange a meeting with M. Maisky and his NavalAttach^, for the purpose of explainingin detail the reasons why we had decidedthat the sailing of convoys to north russia must be discontinued for thepresent:(8) Invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to arrange, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for ^ir, for M.Maisky to visit the headquarters of bomber Command and to be given some information as to the scale of ourbombing effort against Germany:(4) Agreed that, after (2) and (S) had beendone, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take an opportunity of explaining orally to M.   Maisky the points in Premier Stalin&apos;s telegram which wecould not accept:(5) Instructed the Secretary to inform theMinister of Information of the views expressed as to the risk that publicopinion might get out of hand in regardto the starting of a Second Front shouldthe position on the Russian Front continueto deteriorate^Great Qeorgo Street, S.w.1,

ANNEX A.TELEGRAM DATED 23RD JULY, 1948.- FROM premier stalin TO PREMIER CHI^OglLL:--1*        I received your message of 18th July.     Twoconclusions could he drawn from it.     First, theBritish Government refuses to continue the sending ofwar materials to the Soviet Union via the Northernroute.     Second, in spite of the agreed communiqueconcerning the urgent tasks of creating a second front in 1942 the British Government postpones thismatter until 1943.2*        Our naval experts consider the reasons putforward by the British naval experts to justify the cessation o f convoys to the Northern ports of theU.S.S.R. wholly unconvincing.     They are of theopinion that with goodwill and readiness to fulfil the contracted obligations these convoys could beregularly undertaken and heavy losses could be inflicted on the enemy.     Our experts find it also difficult tounderstand and to explain the order given by theAdmiralty that the escorting vessels of the P.Q.17should return whereas the cargo boats should disperseand try to reach the Soviet ports one by one withoutany protection at all.     Of course I do not thinkthat regular convoys to the Soviet Northern portscould be effected without risk   or losses.     But inwar time no important undertaking could be effectedwithout risk or losses.     In any case I never expectedthat the British Government will stop despatch of war materials to us just at the very moment when theSoviet Union in view of the serious situation on theSoviet-German front requires these materials more thanevere     It is obvious that the transport via persian gulf could in no way compensate for the cessation of convoys to the Northern ports.So        With regard to the second question, i.e*, the .question of creating a second front in Europe, I am afraid it is not being treated ,with the seriousness itdeserves.     Taking fully in the account the presentposition on the Soviet-German front I must state inthe most emphatic manner that the Soviet government cannot acquiesce in the postponement of a second front in Europe tin til 1943.I hope you will not feel offended that i expressed frankly and honestly my own opinion as wellas the opinion of my colleagues on the questions raised in your message.STALIN.KREMLIN.

ANNEX B. -NOTE ON TELEGRAM DATED 25RD JULY PROM premier stalin TO THE PRIME MINISTER&quot;!        &quot;.1*        The first Protocol signed on 1st October, 1941,(WiP.(4l) 238) includes the following passage:-&quot;oco-c. the provision of supplies, which willbe made available at British and U.S.A.centres of production, for the Soviet Union&apos;by Great Britain and the United States ofAmerica within the period beginning from october 1941 till the end of June 19420Great Britain and the U.S.A. will give aid to the transportation of these materials to the Soviet Union and will help with the delivery,,&quot;2t        The second Protocol (A. S,E.(42) 143) covering the period 1st July, 1942 to 50th June, 1943 includes the followings-&quot;In addition to possible limitations due to-the shortage of ships, the controllingfactor by the Northern Route is the quantityof shipping that can be escorted to ports of discharge.&quot;-&quot;Within the limits Imposed from time to time by the factors mentioned we will supply theshipping necessary to.lift that part of this programme for which U.S.SeR9 shipscannot be made available.&quot;The second Protocol has not been formally signedVbut was accepted by the U.S*S.R*3.

MINUTE 3.Confidential Annex.(24th July, 1942, 5,0 p,ra. )THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that, at their meeting two days earlier, it had been decided thatthe United States Chiefs of Staffs should be askedto inform the President that it had not been found possible to reach - agreement oh the proposed plan forSLEDGEHAMMER in 1942*     General Marshall, however,had taken the line that he did not wish to reportdisagreement, and a telegram had been sent to thePresident by the United States Chiefs of Staffs,to the effect that it had been agreed that thereshould be no SLEDGEHAMMER operation in 1942,On Thursday, the United States Chiefs ofStaff had spent the whole day in discussion among themselves with United States Officers in thiscountrye     They had met our Chiefs of Staff that morning, and he understood that a most satisfactory conclusion had been reached, and had been embodied in a Memorandum,.   THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAPP saidthat the British Chiefs of Staff had met theAmerican Chiefs of Staffs at 12 Noon that day.    Theyhad brought with them a Memorandum, which was in substance identical With the Memorandum which would shortly he read to the War Cabinet, subject to   ,certain alterations, which had been made at the instance of the British Chiefs of Staff,The Memorandum headed &quot;Proposals for operations in 1942*-43&quot;, on which agreement had been reached between the British and United States Chiefs of staff, was then read to the War Cabinet.   (A copy is attached to these Minutes as Appendix &quot;A&quot;).THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAPP thenwent through the Memorandum^ and drew attention tothe following pointss-(i) Preparations for SLEDGEHAMMER would becontinued, for purposes of deception.(ii) The Americans had expressed a desire toeead an Armoured Division to the middle east in British shipping, in substitutionfort an Armored Division which \*e proposedto send to that theatre.

(Hi) The reference to operations against &quot;theNorth and Northwest coast of-Africa&quot;was rather obscure^    It was contemplated that the operation against North-WestAfrica (Casablanca) would be whollyAmerican, whereas the operation againstthe North coast of Africa, (with landingsat, say, Algiers and Oran;, would becarried out by British jtroops, but undera United States veneer.     This meant that, for political grounds, and in orderto ensure the best reception by theFrench, our troops would be.preceded by united States forces.     The whole operation would probably be under the command of aU.S. Officer.&apos;( iv ) General Marshall* s conception of ROUND-UPhad been an attack in force on theContinent by all available forces^     it followed, therefore, that the Africanoperation necessarily involved a diversion of forces which would otherwise have been\ available for ROUND-UP*     Nevertheless,it would always be necessary for us tomaintain strong forces in this country,and it was clear that plans should bemade for these forces to re-enter europe as soon as opportunity offered*(v) The last paragraph (namely, that thesecurity of the British Isles was a first charge on the resources both of theUnited Kingdom and the United States)had been inserted by the Americans,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF referred to paragraph (d) of the Memorandum which stated that heavy and piedium bomber units in the United kingdom were available for transfer to the African theatreas desired.While it was agreed that offensive action againstGermany was our primary objective, if, when the african coast had been captured, opportunities were open to us to attack the enemy from this direction,it followed that we must be prepared to make forces available for this purpose.Under the present plan the Americans would have3,100 first line aircraft in this country at thebeginning of April, 1943*     The diversions proposed for the pacific theatre would mean.a reduction of 800from this number, although the Americans had saidthat they might not require this full numbero &apos; &apos;

The operation against the North-West coast of Africa would also mean a further diversion fromthis figure, perhaps of 700 or 800 aircraft.    Thesediversions notwithstanding, the Americans would still have a substantial Air Force in this country forbombing Germany or for operations against theContinent in 1943,THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that theoperation against Casablanca would probably be;carried out wholly by the Americans J as regardsNaval as well as land and air forces..      He thoughtfhowever, that for the operation against the North coast of Africa we should have to provide the wholeNaval force required.     This would probably amountto, say, three Airoraft-carriers, a&quot; number of cruisers, 30 Destroyers, and, say, 10 to 20 Corvettes,The size of the force available would no doubtdepend in part upon what casualties were sustained in escorting the Malta convoys.The War Cabinet then discussed the termsof the Memorandum,    Discussion centred on paragraph (c) -&quot;That if the situation on the Russian FrontSeptember 15th indicates such a collapseor weakening of Russian resistance as tomake ROUND-UP appear impracticable of successful execution, the decision shouldbe taken to launch a combined operation against the North and North-West coast of africa at the earliest possible date before... December, 1942&quot;.It was urged in discussion that, expressed inthis way, not only was it left open whether GYMNAST(or TORCH, as the operation was now called) would becarried out, but that TORCH was made dependent upon such a collapse or weakening of Russian resistanceas, to make ROUND-UP appear impracticable.   Therewas thus no definite decision to proceed with eitheroperation, and the fear was expressed that this mighthamper effective and timely preparations for TORGHo It wassuggested that it might db oe-o-cer to word paragrap(c; differently, and to say that we should how makedefinite plans to carry on with   TORCH,  unless thesituation in the autumn was so favourable that we coaGfclcarry out,ROUND-UP early in 1943.In discussion it was explained that if wecarried out operation TORCH, this would inevitableimpinge on operation ROUND-UP, which could not thanbe carried out so early in 1943*     It did not, fr$prever,follow that TORCH  would necessarily be regarded as analternative to ROUND-UP,    We had sufficient forces to make it possible for planning to proceed concurrently

for bath operations.     It was our purpose to proceedforthwith, as a matter, of urgency, with the planning of TORCH.     If, in the course of planning operationTORCH, it became clear that it was desirable to take steps, such as taking up shipping, before the 15thSeptember, this would&apos;be done.The War Cabinet were informed that there was complete unanimity between the British and the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staffs on the matters covered bythis Memorandum.     Both the British and the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staffs believed that it was unlikelythat ROUND-UP would be carried out in 1943, and that,unless this expectation was falsified by the courseof events later in this year, operation TORCHtherefore held the field.   The British Chiefs ofStaff, while confident that they were in complete agreement with the United States Chiefs of Staffs,who had greatly modified their views during thecourse of their visit, nevertheless felt that itwould be undesirable to press for further alterations in the terms of the Memorandum, and that&quot; it would be far better to leave the matter as at present expressed.The Y/ar Cabinet were also informed that theprocedure proposed was that the British and UnitedStates Chiefs of Staffs should now sign the proposedMemorandum, which would be submitted, as a combined chiefs of Staffs Memorandum, to President Rooseveltand to the British V/ar Cabinet.     The President,and the War Cabinet would have an opportunity ofcommenting on the document after it had been signedbut before it was accepted by both Governments.The British Chiefs of Staff, however, had felt thatit would be inappropriate that they should subscribe tothis document   before the War Cabinet had beenacquainted with its contents.The War cabinet-Instructed General Ismay to inform theUnited States Chiefs of Staffs that, theWar Cabinet had seen the Memorandum headed&quot;Proposals for operations in 1948-43&quot;;   andthat the British Chiefs of Staffs had been authorised to subscribe to it.    Thedoounont thus became a Memorandum agreed by the Combined Chiefs of Staffs and wouldbo submitted to president Roosevelt and tothe War Cabinot for approval by the twoGovornnentacGreat George Street, S.W.I.

for both operations.     It was our purpose to proceedforthwith, as a matter, of urgency, with the planning of TORCH.     If, in the course of planning operationTORCH, it became clear that it was desirable to take steps, such as taking up shipping, before the 15thSeptember, this would&apos;be done.The War Cabinet were informed that there was complete unanimity between the British and the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staffs on the matters covered bythis Memorandum.

The British Chiefs ofStaff, while confident that they were in complete agreement with the United States Chiefs of Staffs,who had greatly modified their views during thecourse of their visit, nevertheless felt that itwould be undesirable to press for further alterations in the terms of the Memorandum, and that&apos; it would be far better to leave the matter as at present expressed.The War Cabinet were also informed that theprocedure proposed was that the British and UnitedStates Chiefs of Staffs should now sign the proposedMemorandum, which would be submitted, as a combined chiefs of Staff s Memorandum, to President Rooseveltand to the British War Cabinet.

Thedooutaont thus became a Memorandum agreed by *he Combined Chiefs of Staffs and wouldbo submitted to president Roosevelt and tothe War Cabinet for approval by the twoGovernments^Street, S.W.1.&apos;

It having been decided that SLEDGEHAMMER is not to beundertaken as a scheduled operation, we propose the following general plans for 1942-3?That no avoidable reduction in preparations forROUND-UP should be favourably considered so long as there remains any reasonable possibility of its successfulexecution before July 1943.&apos;(1)     That Allied air strength continue to be built up in U.K. to provide for a constantlyincreasing intensity of air attack on germany.(2)     That, for purposes of deception and to beready for any emergency or a favourable opportunity, all preparations forSLEDGEHAMMER continue to be pressed except as to concentration of landing craft orother details that seriously interferewith training for ROUND-UP, and thata task force commander be appointed with authority to organise the force,; .direct the training and maintain a contingent plan for execution.     ThisCommander should be either the officerdesignated for supreme command of thefinal invasion of Northwest Europe or one ofhis subordinate commanders acting &amp;8 his deputy.      The troops and supporting     &quot;units, so far as possible, to be immediately   placed under his control.b. That, if the British 0.0.S. propose to ship anarmored division to the MIDDLE EAST, a U.S. reinforcedarmored division (about 19,000 men) be substituted thereformoving in BRITISH shipping.c. That, if the situation on the RUSSIAN frontSeptember 15th indicates such a collapse or weakening ofRUSSIAN resistance as to make ROUND-UP appearimpracticable of successful execution, the decision should   .be taken to launch a combined operation against the NORTHand NORTHWEST COAST of AFRICA at the earliest possible date before December 1942.

(1) That the combined plans for this African operation should immediately be developed and that thelatest date be determined after, which thenecessary shipping, naval forces and troopunits can be assembled in time to permit the initial landing operations before the limitingdate &quot; 1 December 1942*(2) That the U,S0 commitment for the African operation will require British assistance in aircraft carriers, covering forces and escort, vessels.Land and Air forces for North Africa would bepredominantly British and land and air forces for North West Africa would be predominantlyAmericano(3) That a task force Commander for the entireAfrican operation should be appointed forthwith,(4) That it be understood that a commitment to this operation renders ROUND-UP in all probability,impracticable of successful execution in 1943and therefore that we have definitely accepted-a defensive, encircling line of action for the    5Continental European theatre, except as to air operations and blookadej   but that theorganisation, planning and training, for eventualentry in the Continent should continue so thatthis operation can be staged should a marked,deterioration in German military strength become apparent, and the resources of the United Nations,available after meeting other commitments, sopermit od. That it be understood that heavy and medium bomberunits in the United Kingdom are available for transfer to the African theatre as required,e* That over and above the U,S, forces required fromBOLERO for operations in North and North West Africa, thefollowing readjustment of present U,S. commitments toBOLERO will be made for the purpose of furthering offensive operations in the Pacific:(1) Withdrawal of the following air forces:3 groups heavy bombers*2 groups medium bombers,,2 groups light bombers.2 groups fighter planes,2 groups observation planes.4 groups transport planes,(2) Probably shipping to move one infantry or Marinedivision from ,U,S* West coast to South west pacific,f* That the security of the British Isles is a first charge upon the military resources of both the U,k1 and theU.S.    &apos;
