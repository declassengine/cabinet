MOST SECRET CYPHER TELEGRAM.IMMEDIATEProms- MideastTo:-    Air Minis try oReflex 176     21.8.42i-Following Most Secret and Personal from Prime Ministerto Deputy Prime Minister for War Cabinet* General Ismay andothers concerned^Following is plan referred to in Reflex 175.1*        The Directive to General Alexander cannot be modified as he must at once be freed from all responsibility for persia and Iraq.,,2.        The establishment of the Persia-Iraq Command, theexpansion of the Tenth Army and the strategic study of the growing danger to these regions from the GOTcarr&amp;s is urgent,3.        Consequently a general must be appointed before I leavewho will be responsible to His Majesty1s Government for taking all the decisions affecting P.I. area which would otherwise havebeen taken by General Alexander.4.        This general will be designated as Commander in ChiefP.I. area, and will build up a separate command as quickly aspossible,,     He will have allocated to him forthwith theprincipal elements out of which the P.I. command and its headquarters will be formed.     See Appendix Ae5.        In the first instance the C-in-C P.I. will have his headquarters in Cairo and he will be assisted by all thedepartments of the staff in Cairo exactly as if he was general alexander himself.     He will do this work without prejudice tothe interests or authority of General Alexander who in all mattersof assignment has priority Unless he waives it, or unlessinstructions are given from London.6o        As the work in paragraphs 4 and 5 develops, the C-in-C P.I.will form his advanced headquarters in Persia or Iraq and willmove thither as soon as he considers it necessary.     He will leavebehind him in Cairo an organisation which will look after theinterests of his Command in harmonious agreement with G.H.Q. MiddleE&quot;.st until such time as he can stand entirely on his own feet.70        The C-in-C P.I, will take as his guide the report of theCommittee setting up a separate Command for P. and I.     This may require some modification as it works out.     He or his representative will have a seat upon the War Council presided overby the Minister of Stated ,   The functions of the latter over thewhole area will be in no wise affected except as proposed in theCommittee&apos;s report.8e        The Air Forces in the P. 1. area and their general standardof maintenance will be specified from time to time by H.M.G. onadvice of C*O.S.   These forces will remain under command ofAoOoC-in-Ga Middle East^ but once established at hjis headquartersC-in-K3 Palv may with the approval of H*M.G:.* announce that theconditions specif led in paragraph 4 of my Directive of October 1941

have arisen, and while this period of active operations continues he will have all the rights over.the Air Forces within his assignment enjoyed by General Alexander in the Western Desert.9.     This arrangement is for three months only and meets a situation which cannot be foreseen.During: this period a decisive battle may beexpected in the Western Desert.; A decision will bereached or the winter will have come in the Caucasusand on the Russian front.   Other considerable^operations will have been launched by-the Allies.The P,I.-Gonimand will have been formed and taken its.,station.   The Air Contingent for the Caspian Theatrewill either, if the Russians hold, have come into action on their Southern flank, or if fortune isadverse, will be serwing with the Tenth Army in persia.10.     C.I.G,So and I propose General Sir MaitlandWilson as C-in-C P.I. Command under the conditions set forth above.APPENDIX A.   Record of decisions taken at meetingheld at G.H.Q. M.
