PERSIA.

British ? in Northern Persia.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS referred to a telegram which had been received by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff from General Wilson (C.G.S. 9 of 26th September) asking for authority to establish advanced bases in North Persia at which military stores could be accumulated. This course was proposed as part of the troop dispositions which he recommended should be made in order to enable him to meet a German advance into North Persia at any time after the 15th November.

The movement of stores proposed would affect aid to Russia adversely to the extent of 14,000 tons in October, and 14,000 tons in November.

The Foreign Secretary said that, while he realised the importance of the measures proposed, he was most reluctant to make proposals on these lines to the Russian Government at the present time, more especially seeing that, even at the present rate of delivery, it looked at though there would be an accumulation of more than 100,000 tons of goods for Russia in the Persian Gulf ports by the end of November which could not be cleared. Most of these Supplies were American. If General Wilson&apos;s proposals were agreed to, this figure would be substantially increased.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had sent a Minute to the Chiefs of Staff on this question. He agreed that the present time was a bad moment at which to broach the diminution of supplies to Russia by the Persian Gulf route. He thought that the situation in a fortnight&apos;s time would make it very much easier to reach a decision as to the proper line of action to be taken. Furthermore, any approach made to the Russian Government in a fortnight&apos;s time could, he hoped, be linked up with the proposal, which was already under discussion with President Roosevelt, to send a force of 20 British and American squadrons to the North Persian-Caucasus front.



"X"

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he trusted that in the meantime no action would be taken by General Wilson locally which would have the effect of leading the local Russian authorities to believe that we proposed to take steps to establish bases outside the British zone of occupation, or to interfere with the arrangements made for the despatch of aid to Russia through Persia.



The War Cabinet:-

Agreed that, subject to the result of the examination now being carried out by the Chiefs of Staff, discussion of General Wilson&apos;s proposals for establishing British bases in North Persia should be postponed for, say a fortnight, and took note that a telegram would be sent to General Wilson by the Chiefs of Staff, incorporating the points made by the Foreign Secretary at "X" and informing General Wilson that importance was attached to the acceleration of supplies to Russia through Persia.
