-ahmire-the secrecy of this -uooument, ;.COpy//.(12feh August, 1943, 5*0&apos; p.m.)THE SHIPPING The War Cabinet had before then a Report by theSITUATION. Chiefs of Staff (W,P.(42) 302) and a Memorandum byi -        the Accredited Representative of   the Government of provision of the Commonwealth of Australia (W.P.(42) 326).Aircraft for ^ .    -the War at Sea, . THE FIRST SEA LORD said that at the beginning of 1-the war the Air Ministry had taken the view thatCoastal Command&quot;&apos;should, be able to cope with opera-transactions over the sea.   As   a result, aircraft of bomber Command had. not been fitted for work overthe sea.   As the war had. progress ed,- hoy ever, it hadbeen found that more and. more aircraft were requiredfor over sea work, and. now it had been agreed thatall aircraft should.be provided, where possible, withthe necessary equipment to enable them to be used forwork over the sea should the need-arise. (See Para.   119 of W.F.(4S) 302.)The First Sea Lord then outlined the various measures which had been taken to increase the numbersof aircraft available for over sea work.   This hadtaken&apos; the forr% partly of a great increase in coastal command., and. also of arrangements such as that madein the Mediterranean, whereby, by agreement betweenthe Chief: of the Air, Staff and. himself, certainsquadrons had been normally allocated for over sea-&quot;work., .After Japan&apos;s entry into: the war, the need forstill further aircraft for work over the sea had been felt.   As a result of ,dis cuss ions between theAdmiralty and the Air Ministry, agreement had beenreached, as to the target figures, so far as theycould at pres ent be ass ess ed, for aircraft for workover sea.   These were set out in Annex &quot;A&quot; to the       .Chiefs of Staff Report (WoPo(42) 302) .,     The, First Sea Lord, emphasised that there was nodisagreement between the Admiralty and the AirMinistry as to thes-e figures .   It was only   a questionof how quickly these requirements could be met.The&apos; Air Ministry were doing their utmost to see thatthese requirements were met as quickly ,as possible.In ,the meantime an agreement ,had - b eeh rea ched. whereby^: air craft of Bomber Command would be lent for work-over the Bay - of Bis coy .   This was rather&apos; an experi-ment ,,.but the -Admiralty were content to try it.     cfl-fg

Mr BRUCE said that neither the Chiefs of staff report nor the statement by the First Sea Lord led himto modify the vie&apos;&apos;S which he &quot;had expressed in his memorandum.   His &apos;main point was &apos; that ^insufficient factshad been given to enable the War Cabinet to reach a conclusion on the issue.   He was, however, disturbed tofind, that&apos; wewere working on the basis ofproviding  theminimum for the task of securing our yit&amp;l communication0and interruptinr those of   the enemy.   Surely more than&quot;&quot;a bare minimum should be provided for a task of such,paromouat. &quot;importance as preserving our sca communication--tions.   Moreover, after the entry of,Japan into the warand. the lors of the PRINCE   OP WALES and the REPULSE,it had become clear that sea communications were ofParamoupt,TTr)pri3g AnnP.     Mflvi^rhY&amp;l ftag     nft  rfil t, T.hfl.t   there ]had been a lack of drive and determination to make aireiFf-available for this vital purpose.   -By way of illustration, Mr Bruce said that since december last the defence of Ceylon had probably been amatter of importance second only to that of the british isles.   But at this day, although certain air squadronswere stationed there, we could not say that we had sufficient air forces to give us. offensive, power overthe Bay of Bengal and the coast of Malaya.   The Chiefsof Staff Report showed that no   additional aircraft would, be sent to the Indian Ocean area until coastal command had been able to   repay the.bombers which hadbeen lent by Bomber Command..   As a result, the building up of our forces in Ceylon would be delayed until october.Mr Bruce said, that his Memorandum was hot to beregarded, as in any sense an attack on   the policy of bombing Germany. &quot;He thought, however,,  that the needsof aircraft for the war. at sea probably ought to receive a higher degree&quot;&quot;of priority, at tne costTof some delayiiTthe date by whxun our bomber offensive againstGermany would reach its maximum.   It was, however,impossible, in his view, to   reach a final judgment, onthis matter until fuller particulars had. been supplied.Mr0 Bruce also suggested that a statement shouldbe supplied, showing what steps had been taken to carryout the policy set out in paragraph 19 of W.P.(42) 302.The following further points were made in discus-s ion:-x (1) THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER said, that the   vgeneral impression left on his mind by theChiefs of Staff Paper was that, in effect,our bomber effort against Germany took first.   place, subject to certain minima, and that theorder of priority set out in the terms ofreference to the Naval Staff-Air Staff-Committee was not in fact being observed.(2) THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that thefirst-line air croft in Coastal Command hadtotalled 174 at the beginning of the war, and how totalled. 643.   While he would, of course,   . .have welcomed, a larger diversion of aircraft for   work    over the .sea, it was fair to remember that provision had. already been madeto allocate 80 flying-boats and 40 long-rangebomber aircraft to Coastal ^Command.   ,

(-3). LORD HALIFAX said that it must he borne inmind that it was only   by the &quot;expansion ofour offensive that   we should   win the war,whereas the defensive should be kept to theminimum necessary to prevent our losing it.This led to a discushion of the optimumnumber of aircraft for bombing operations.It was explained, that&quot; after a certain pointhad been reached, any   additionto the /attacking force had far more than a propor-tzonal effect.   This v;ois because, after acertain point, the enemy-s defences becamesaturated.   The number of aircraft necessaryto saturate the defences varied, of course,with the size of the target attacked.(4) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ADR drew attentionto the fact that Bomber Command had beenreduced by 15 squadrons since the beginning ofthe year.   This, too, at a time when we were  .committed to the policy of maintaining thegreatest possible weight of attack on germany in order to support Russia,He also drew attention to paragraph 7 of thePrime Minister&apos;s Review of the War Position,dated 21st July, 1943 (W.P.(42) 311).   Inthis paragraph the Prime Minister had written:-&quot;It is at this point that we must observewith sorrow-- and alarm the woeful shrinkageof our plans for bomber expansion ......We must regard the bomber offensive againstGermany at least as&quot; a feature in breakingher will-power, second only to the largest,military operations which ca.n be conducted on the Continent until that war will isbroken&quot;.5)      THE.LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thathe thought the order of priority set out inthe terms of reference to the Committeeappointed by the Chiefs of Staff representedrather an over-simplification.   For example, theforces allocated for &quot;securing our vitalcommunications and interrupting those of theenemy&quot; were not &quot;&quot;holly defensive, and therewas thus some overlap between (bj and ( c) .It should also be bowae in mind that thestrength of the forces available for particular-needs resulted not only from   the long-term planning of our. resources, but also fromvariations which had to be made at short notice to meet changing developments in thew ar s it uat ion *The War Cabinet t-Asked that a statement should be preparedshowing -(a) The target-figures and present strengthof our ail&quot; forces (together with thoseof our Allies) in the theatres coveredby the Annex to W.P.(43) 303, both ona functional and geographical basis.

(b) ^hc present policy governing the allocation of resources as they became available.(c) f0 v/hat extent the aircraft ,at present--   devoted to rtThe offensive both direct and in support of land, operations  -were   ..capable of bding diverted to&apos; &quot;The fighter^.       ;&apos; defence of the United Kingdom&apos;!, or to,.&quot;Socurirg our vital communications and.  IntcrruFtlrig; those of the   enemy&quot; .(d) . S/hpt steps have been taken to ensure thataircraft now in   pro auction are bexngequipped with the   ne cess pry fittings to .enable them to operate as effectively as-.,,possible over the sea or in tropical climates -(Thus, to what types of aircraft, and towhat proportion of our production, is this practice now applicable, and what has been done to ensure that this policyis made effective over as wide a field aspossible, with the minimum delay.)Sreo.t George Street, S./.I.14th Augus t,    1942 .
