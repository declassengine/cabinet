The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Bomber Command had flown 760 sorties, their principal targetsby night being Hamburg, Stuttgart and Warnemunde. Results hadbeen less good than in recent weeks, mainly owing to poor visibility;and in the attack on Warnemunde our losses had been substantialbecause of an unexpectedly heavy concentration of defences. Wemust now be prepared for a heavier scale of defence at aircraft factories.Experience of Fighter Command suggested that the enemy was less inclined to put up a strong defence against daylight attacks bylight bombers.Of 117 enemy raiders which had crossed the coast during theweek, we had destroyed 12, night fighters accounting for 7.Of 64 Spitfires flown off carriers, 59 had landed safely in Malta.Enemy &quot;losses over Malta during the week had been 30 aircraft destroyed, 25 probably destroyed and 40 damaged, for the loss of10 destroyed and 14 damaged.Allied shipping losses for the week were 40 ships totalling210,000 tons, of which about a quarter were under British control.Twenty-three ships had been lost off the American coast.The Prime Minister undertook to make representations toMr. Hopkins regarding the heavy losses of American shipping inthis area.The War Cabinet were informed that there were indications that our difficulties in protecting convoys to Russia were &quot;likely toincrease. The Prime Minister&apos; said that he had telegraphed to premier Stalin emphasising the heavy risks involved in maintainingthese supplies.The War Cabinet were given the latest information regardingthe action in the Coral Sea. A Japanese expedition, comprisingnaval forces and transports believed to be carrying about one.division, had been intercepted by American and Australian forces the attack on both sides being carried out by aircraft. Of theJapanese force, one (light) aircraft-carrier and one heavy cruiserhad been sunk and one (heavy) aircraft-carrier and one cruiserdamaged. Apart from those sunk with the carriers, 37 Japanese aircraft haa been destroyed, 8 probably destroyed and 18 damaged,for the loss of 13 destroyed and 4 damaged. The expedition was believed to have turned northwards.Full particulars of Allied naval losses were not yet available,but it seemed clear that the results of the action had been greatly in our favour.There had been no major developments on the Russian front,but a German attack launched in the Crimea on the 8th May mightbe the prelude to an offensive in the south. It had been thoughtthat the main drive would be in that sector, and there were some indications of troop movements to the south.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Malta.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 58thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. Reference was made to telegram No. 184 from theGovernor, dated the 10th May, as to his powers vis-a-vis the ServiceCommanders in Malta.In discussion, the view was expressed that it might be necessarythat the Governor. should have somewhat wider powers in regardto the Service Commanders than those set out in the telegram sent
to him on the 7th May (No. 230) from the Colonial Office. The WarCabinet agreed, however, that further consideration of this matter should be deferred pending the reply to a telegram which had beensent to Lord Gort by the Chiefs of Staff.Madagascar.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 57thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet were given an account of the operations for the capture of Diego Suarez. The importance of propaganda,in order to win over the inhabitants of the island, was emphasised.The Foreign Secretary said that he had had a discussion with free French representatives that morning. He had not held out any hopes that it would be possible to give them any share in theadministration, but he adhered to the view (which had already beenaccepted by the War Cabinet) that this would be necessary at someappropriate stage, subject to the usual safeguards. It was important to do what we could to build up the Free Frenchmovement. The Free French representatives in London were muchdistressed at the attitude which the United States authorities were adopting in regard to Martinique, where they were negotiating withthe Vichy authorities.The War Cabinet took note of this statement. -Foreign Affairs.Peace Rumours.Vichy France.4. The Foreign Secretary referred to rumours, which werecurrent in two or three capitals, about the possibility of startingpeace negotiations. So far as Ankara was concerned, it was fairlyclear that these rumours indicated fear of Russia. He had repeated the instructions already given to our Missions abroad that all theserumours should be completely ignored. Otherwise there was a risk that suspicion might be sown in the minds of our Russian Allies.The War Cabinet approved this attitude.The Foreign Secretary said that the Germans were not beinghelpful to Laval, who was having a difficult time. The ItalianGovernment were again pressing1 their claims against France.Laval&apos;s difficulties might be responsible, in part, for the relativelyslight reaction in Vichy France against our action in MadagascarThe War Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S. W. 1,May 11, 1942.
