1. The Priine Minister gave the War Cabinet an account ofhis visit to the United States and of the Conferences which hadtaken place. The defeat of our forces in the Middle East, and,perhaps even more, rumours of its effect on the political situation inthis country, had figured largely in the American Press. Theattitude of the Administration had, however, been very staunch.The Prime Minister outlined the help which the United states had arranged to send to the Middle East.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff also gave an accountof his meetings with United States military authorities. [details are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.]The War Cabinet was informed that the United States Navyhad now been given control over the sailings of the MercantileMarine. This might be expected to reduce the scale of shipping losses. It also seemed that the United States authorities werereconsidering their policy in regard to publishing shipping losses,and might come into line with us on this matter.The Prime Minister mentioned a suggestion which had beenmade that an international commission should be set up by theUnited Nations, under high judicial authority, to collect evidenceof atrocities committed by the enemy. He had told the president that he agreed with the scheme in principle, though the detailsrequired further examination.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.primeministers visit to theUnited States.Parliament.forthcoming debate onMiddle EastSituation.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 80thConclusions,,Minute 1.)2. Discussion took place on the arrangements for presenting the Government case in the debate in Parliament on Wednesday andThursday, the 1st and 2nd July.The War Cabinet reached the following decisions : (1) On the first day, after the mover and seconder of the motionhad spoken, and perhaps one other speaker on each side,the Minister of Production would present the Govern-ment case.(2) The Prime Minister (who indicated the general line whichhe proposed to take in his speech) would wind up for theGovernment on the second day.(3) It would be for consideration whether a third Governmentspeaker would be required, possibly at the opening ofthe second day. This should be determined in the lightof the course which the debate took, and of the hour towhich it ran on the first day.(4) Any suggestion for an enquiry, such as had been proposedafter the fall of Singapore, should be resisted. But oneof the Government spokesmen should state that the WarCabinet would, of course, make full enquiries into any matters which required investigation and, if action were required, would see that it was taken.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 27, 1942.
