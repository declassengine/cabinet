Propaganda at 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome. Minister of Information (W.P. (42) 155) suggesting the following(Previous procedure with a view to formulating a propaganda policy : (a) The Minister of Information should circulate to the WarCabinet once a month an appreciation of the state ofpublic morale. This should take into account, in itspreparation, the views of any other Departmentsprimarily concerned with the Home front.(b) This appreciation would contain recommendations as toany general lines which publicity should take in the ensuing month.(c) The decisions of the War Cabinet would be taken as a directive binding on all Departments until further notice.Discussion showed general agreement with the Minister&apos;sproposals.   The following were among the points made : -(1) The public ought to be told more about the positive achieve-ments of the nation&apos;s War effort.(2) The view was expressed that more could be done withoutimpairing security to let the public know the achieve-ments of the Fighting Services; the defence of Malta orthe actions of H.M.S. Penelope and H.M.S. Aurora werecited as examples.(3) The Prime Minister thought that more could, perhaps, bedone to encourage well-informed answers (not in theform of Government statements) in reply to misguidedcriticism of the conduct of affairs by the Government.(4) It was suggested that comment should be separated fromnews items in the B.B.C. bulletins.(5) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, while in agreement with the Minister&apos;s proposals, thought itwas important, in view of the number of Departmentsconcerned, that the matter should be considered onthe widest possible basis. He attached particular importance to the measures to be adopted for ascer-taining the views of other Departments concerned withthe Home front.The Minister of Information undertook to discuss this matter with the Home Secretary.(6) It was important that the appeal to the public should notbe too materialistic. Thus, the improved state of feeling in the country in recent weeks probably owed something to the fact that the Government had adopted a numberof measures which involved greater austerity.(7) The Report prepared by &quot;Mass Observation,&quot; entitled&quot; Inquiry into British War Production,&quot; was unfavour-ably commented on.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the procedure proposed by the Minister ofInformation (as set out at &quot; X &quot; above), and took note that the Minister would discuss with the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security the measures to beadopted for ascertaining the views of other Departmentsconcerned with the Home front.(b) Approved the directions in paragraph 7 of the Memo-randum as to the general lines which government publicity should follow.W.M.
