A discussion took place, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;?Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.[24035]b 21. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.The principal air operations of the week had been raids onEmden on the 22nd June, and on Bremen on the 25th and 29th June(the first by over 1,000 bombers). The Emden raid had been very effective. The operations against Bremen had been hindered bythick cloud, but the Focke Wulf Works had been hit.Total enemy losses for the week had amounted to 26 machinesfor certain and 1 probable, with 15 damaged. We had lost14 fighters, 61 bombers, 9 Coastal Command aircraft and 2 army co-operation aircraft.Malta. The enemy had lost 20 machines for certain and 2 probable,with 12 damaged. Our total losses had been 3 destroyed and damaged in the air, with 5 destroyed and 4 damaged on theground. Aircraft from Malta had scored hits on three or four enemy merchant vessels.Libya. Attacks had been carried out on Benghazi and Tobruk.  Therehad been intense activity over the Western Desert. Total enemy losses for the week were reported as 16 machines for certain against25 British machines, but these figures were probably incomplete.Naval .    Assuming that two overdue vessels were lost, Allied shippingOperations. losses in the previous seven days would amount to 107,000 tons. Inaddition, there were belated reports of 37,000 tons sunk in the far east.Particulars were given of the arrangements for additionalconvoys made by the United States Navy. ...&quot;Military On the Russian front there were indications that the operationsOperations. southwards from Kursk were the opening stages of a major GermanRussia offensive, though we still had no information pointing to a concen-tration of German strength in that sector on a scale comparable with that of last year&apos;s offensive.Libya. Information was given regarding the fighting which had been taking place on the Mersa Matruh front since the 27th June. AGerman report claimed that they had captured Mersa Matruhjtaking 6,000 prisoners and knocking out 36 tanks.Particulars were given of the armoured forces engaged on bothsides and the reinforcements now arriving in Egypt and expectedto arrive in the near future.The War Cabinet were informed that reports were beginning to circulate overseas that General Auchinleck had himself assumedcontrol of the Eighth Army, and that, in the circumstances, thePrime Minister thought that this fact should now be made public,and that he therefore proposed to make an announcement to this:effect in the House of Commons on the following morning.The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion, and asked that a telegram should be sent to General Auchinleck informing him of theproposed announcement.
Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 79thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave a summary of the damage inflicted by enemy air attack during thepast week.There had been a sharp attack on Norwich on Friday night;and on Saturday and Sunday nights Weston-super-Mare liad beenthe main objective. There were various military targets in Weston,but the main damage had been to public and residential buildings.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Foreign Affairs. 4 The Foreign Secretary said that, when Ministers wereInterviews with asked to receive distinguished foreigners visiting this country, itdistinguished would be a convenience if, where practicable, the Foreign Officeforeigners.        could be consulted in advance.  They were often in a position to give advice or information which would assist the Minister concerned.He asked that, in any event, Ministers should let him have a brief account of what took place at such interviews.The War Cabinet approved this suggestion and invited the Foreign Secretary to bring the matter to the notice ofMinisters generally.Proposed visit to The Foreign Secretary said that our Ambassador to the this country by U.S.S.R. had expressed a desire to come to this country on a shortour Ambassador visit. He thought it desirable that the Ambassador should do so,to the U.S.S.R. as he had not been home since he had been appointed ambassador to China in 1938.The War Cabinet agreed that, subject to the PrimeMinisters approval, it would be convenient if arrange-ments could be made for Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to cometo London at an early date.Imperial PolicyGroup.The Foreign Secretary drew attention to recent publications ofthe Imperial Policy Group, which were not calculated to improve our relations with the U.S.S.R. The activities of the Group wouldhave to be watched.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The baltic states.Status ofRepresentativesin this country.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 56thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForeign Secretary (W.P. (42) 269), in which he proposed that, inorder to satisfy the Soviet Government, the names of the BalticMinisters and their Staffs should be removed from the DiplomaticList, but should be shown in an Annex as still possessing a diplo-matic character.The War Cabinet approved this suggestion.Middle East. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that our Ambassador in CairoEvacuation of had made enquiries as to whether arrangements should be made for civilian evacuating civilian personnel from Egypt if the military situationPersonnel. deteriorated. He thought that the Ambassador should discuss withthe Minister of State what policy should be followed in this matterand what detailed arrangements should be made, and that the latter should be authorised to determine these issues on behalf of the WarCabinet.The War Cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the Ambassador accordingly.
Malta.Evacuation of families ofServicepersonnel.7. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that theService Departments favoured the compulsory evacuation of the families of British Service personnel in Malta, and it was under-stood that the Governor was now proceeding to put such a scheme into operation as and when transport facilities became available.The view of the Colonial Office was that, if no correspondingfacilities were offered for the families of Maltese personnel, theeffect on morale in the Island would be unfortunate both now andafter the war. For this reason he would prefer that all theseevacuation arrangements should be on a voluntary basis, or, failing this, that some facilities should be offered for the voluntaryevacuation of families of Maltese personnel.In discussion, it appeared that there was no means of evacuating civilians except by air, and that only very small numberscould be evacuated by this means without making increased demands on the Island&apos;s stocks of aviation spirit.In these circumstances, and taking into account the difficultyof allotting passages, the right course was to discontinue the processof evacuation, save for any very special cases which could be justified on grounds of benefit to the war effort. The Governor should alsobe informed that, if at a later stage evacuation was resumed, in theopinion of the War Cabinet it could not be restricted to the dependants of British personnel.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies toarrange for the despatch of&apos;a telegram to the Governor of malta on the lines of &quot;X.&quot;8.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Joint Memorandum (W.P. (42) 267) by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, the President of the Board ofTrade and the Paymaster-General suggesting terms ofreference for the guidance of Sir Frederick Leith-Rossin his forthcoming discussions in Washington on Post-War Relief.(ii) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (42) 273) commenting on these proposed terms ofreference.(a) The first point dealt with in discussion was whether weshould agree to the proposal that the Executive Committee shouldbe confined to representatives of the four Governments-^GreatBritain, America, the U.S.S.R. and China.Mr. Bruce said that the Commonwealth Government, after full discussion, had been prepared to acquiesce in the proposal that theDominions should not be represented on the Executive Committee,on two grounds : First, that, if the Dominions were invited, allother Governments would insist on their right to be represented.In particular, the claim of the Argentine would be difficult to resist, as the Argentine was a producing country which would beexpected to contribute. Secondly, that the body representative ofthe four Governments would probably only act as a directingPost-War Relief.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 65thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Foreign Secretary said that our Ambassador at Bagdadhad raised questions about the evacuation of civilian personnel from Iraq.The War Cabinet agreed that no action should be taken&quot;to evacuate civilians from Iraq.
authority, and that the actual work would be undertaken by other bodies, upon which the Dominions would be represented.The War Cabinet were informed that the Canadian Govern-ment had asked to be represented at the discussions in Washington.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the balance ofadvantage lay in the Executive Committee which was to be set upraccording to the American proposals, after a Conference of all theUnited Nations, being confined to representatives of the four governments referred to; but that the point would have to be put to the Canadian Government before we could say that we agreed to-the representation on the Committee being so confined.(b) In reply to the Secretary of State for War, it was agreedthat the problem of handling post-war relief, to be dealt with atthe Washington Conference, did not include the problem ofvictualling, during the war, territories which might be reoccupiedby the Allies as a result of military operations.(c) Discussion followed on the terms of the draft instructionsto be sent to Sir Frederick Leith-Ross.The Foreign Secretary indicated various passages in the draft instructions which, in his view, adequately safeguarded the interestsof this country.The Foreign Secretary added that his intention was that sir Frederick Leith-Ross should not enter into any definite commit-ments in Washington, but should bring back a project forconsideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave his reasons for wishingvarious modifications to be made in the instructions, in order toavoid heavy financial commitments. He also thought that we ought not to pledge ourselves at this stage to the maintenance of rationing and other controls after the war.The general view of the War Cabinet was in favour of thedespatch of instructions to Sir Frederick Leith-Ross on the basisof the draft instructions contained in the Foreign Secretary&apos;sMemorandum, subject to the amendments set out below.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows : (1) Procedure. The Secretaries of State for Dominion affairs and Foreign Affairs undertook to see the High Commis-sioner for Canada on the following day, and to explain to him the reasons in favour of limiting the discussions at Washington to representatives of the four Govern-ments. Subject to the Canadian Government acquiescing in the proposal, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross should beinformed that he could say that we agreed that thediscussions should be sO limited.(2) Amendments to the draft instructions.(i) Paragraph 3 should be amended (on the lines ofpart of the revision proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in his Memorandum) in orderto make clear the distinction between the physicalor supply aspect of the problem and the financial aspect.(The Ministers concerned undertook to settle thenecessary amendments.)(ii) The passage about Shipping starting on page 2,line 9, should read as follows : - &quot;He should say that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-;ment are ready to help to the fullest extent oftheir ability as regards supplies and shipping.It will, however, be necessary to continue the pool
United States 9.   The Deputy Prime Minister informed the War CabinetForces. that it was proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should provideProposed Club accommodation in London to enable a Club to be run for Americanin London for Officers.  The Government would provide the building, but the ClubOfficers. would be run and administered by the American Red Cross.The War Cabinet indicated their general approval of thisscheme.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 29, 1942.of shipping of all the United Nations if the life of their peoples is to be maintained. He should therefore point out . ...&quot;(Hi) It was decided not to make any amendment to distinguish between contributions in food andraw materials.(3) The last paragraph of the draft formula should read asfollows : &apos;&apos; As part of the common plan, they will be preparedto continue in this country, after the end of hostilities,a system of rationing of food and clothing and other suitable measures of control over essential commoditiesso long as the available supplies are not sufficient to meetthe urgent needs of Allied countries which have regainedtheir freedom.&quot;(4) It was contemplated that the formula would be announced,in the first instance, by Ministers in the UnitedKingdom.(5) The Foreign Secretary was authorised to despatch toSir Frederick Leitn-Ross the instructions set out inparagraphs 1-4 of W.P. (42) 267, embodying the amend-ments set out in Conclusion (2) above.
