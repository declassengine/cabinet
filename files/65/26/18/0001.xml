Malta.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 56thConclusions,Minute&quot; 6.)1. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet telegramNo. 559 from the Minister of State. In this telegram the Ministerreported that he had discussed with the Commandersrin-Chief the relationship of Lord Gort to the Middle East Defence Committee,the Commanders-in-Chief in Egypt and the Service Commanders in malta, and set out the conclusions which it was recommendedshould be included in Lord Gorfs Directive.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider these recommenda-tions and to furnish the Prime Minister with their observations thereon.TradeDisputes andTrade UnionsAct, 1927.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet were informed of the results of thediscussions which had taken place between the Minister of Labourand National Service and the Chancellor of the Exchequer on thismatter.In discussion, the following views were expressed : On the onehand, if an agreed settlement could be reached on this matter, itwould have an important effect in easing the settlement with theTrade Unions of the many difficult questions which would arise onthe conclusion of hostilities. Considerable importance should therefore be attached to reaching an agreed settlement without waiting for the war to end.On the other hand, the War Cabinet were informed that important sections of opinion in the House of Commons took theview that a settlement of this question had no close connection withthe war effort. There would thus be considerable opposition to dealing with the matter at the present time. The best prospect ofdealing with this question would be as part of a general settlementof a number of questions at the end of the war.The War Cabinet-Agreed that Sir Walter Citrine should be asked to agreeto this matter standing over for the present, it beingexplained to him privately that at the moment it had notbeen possible to reach an agreed settlement in regard to theamendment of Sections 5 and 6 of the Act.Madagascar.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 54thConclusions.)3. The War Cabinet were given the latest information as tothe progress of operations in Madagascar.The War Cabinet agreed that, while it was premature to frameany detailed decisions at the present time, it seemed clear that atan appropriate stage the Free French authorities would have to beallowed some share of responsibility for the administration, subjectto suitable safeguards.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 5, 1942.
