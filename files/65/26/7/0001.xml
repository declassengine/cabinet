1. The War Cabinet had before1 thein a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (42) 148).Discussion turned mainly on the proposal to release minfersserving in Field Force units at Home for employment in the mines:It was explained that it was thought that as many as 7,000 men might be found in this way. The Ministers concerned with coal production were satisfied that the output required during the summer months could not be attained unless the labour force of theindustry was brought up to 720,000, and that there was no meansof bringing the force up to this figure by the beginning of the summer unless substantial numbers of miners were released fromthe Army at Home.The Secretary of State for War had indicated that he was opposed to the release of any men serving in Field Force units athome.The following were the main points in discussion: (1) The Prime Minister emphasised the seriousness of the stepproposed, and the bad effects that it would have on the morale and fighting efficiency of Field Force units.Every possible expedient should be adopted beforerecourse was had to this measure.(2) 7,000 miners might be expected to produce 2 million tons ofcoal in a year. This was a small figure in relation to thetotal anticipated output required in the period beginningthe 1st May, 1942, namely, 210 million tons.(3) In previous years, estimates had often proved excessive, and departments&apos; estimates nearly always contained somemargin of safety. Would it not be better to face some small reductions in the various programmes affected, orin stocks, rather than to recall to the mines men serving in Field Force units ? x(4) Against this, it was pointed out that the statisticalmachinery had been greatly-improved, and that theestimates had been most carefully checked, and were believed to be of a high standard of accuracy,b (5) Further, the 2 million tons which an additional 7,000 minerswould produce in a year represented part of the marginwhich had to be maintained in order to secure evendistribution. There was no surer way of slowing downproduction than by allowing local shortages of stocks todevelop. : &quot;&quot; ; &apos;(6) There were a number of. contingencies against which wec..... must provide; e.g., the effect of possible air raids.   Or,again, if shipments of coal from Bombay were interfered with, more coal would have to be sent out from thisi*.. - country to the Middle East. ,(7) Owing to the shortage of shipping capacity, we should in  &apos; any event have to run down stocks of imported materials, iand have to rely to an increasing extent on home- .-!produced raw materials.   This would certainly involve an increased consumption of coal.(8) Arrangements could be made that the men released from field Force units should be returned to the Army at the&quot;Alert &quot; stage if an attempt at invasion was anticipated.The War Cabinefs decisions were, as^ follows : (i) The Minister of Labourf ahd National Service should proceed on the basis that 3,000 miners must be returnedto coal production from other industries, including vitalindustries....................&quot;. : .Other Ministers concerned were invitedto co-operate with the Minister in the steps necessary to attain J;histarget. -  &apos; &quot;------- / \Production.(previous reference:W.M.
