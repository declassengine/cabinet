The Free 1.   The War Cabinet had a short discussion, which is recordedFrench. in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Ethiopia.Number ofItalianCivilians to beretained.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 111thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs about the evacuation of italian civilians from Ethiopia (W.P. (42) 222). The Emperor had asked that some 2,800 Italian technicians and their families,making a total of about 4,000, should be allowed to remain in ethiopia in order to keep working Italian-created utility services,industries and transport. The Minister of State agreed with theview of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, East Africa,that in the interests of security not more than 500 Italians, plus areasonable number of dependants, should be retained, together witha certain number of Italian drivers, to be taken over by the UnitedKingdom Commercial Corporation to operate -a transport service.The view generally expressed by the War Cabinet was that thenumber of Italians which it was proposed by the Minister of state should be allowed to remain seemed rather low. It was pointed outthat it might be unwise that the return of the Negus shouldsynchronise with a very marked deterioration in the serviceshitherto administered by the Italians.The Foreign Secretary undertook to review the matter, inthe light of the War Cabinet&apos;s view, that the proposal inthe Memorandum involved too drastic a reduction, and alsoto obtain further particulars as to the type of Italianworkers whom the Emperor desired to retain.Ethiopia. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theDejazmach Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 221) on a proposalGugsa. put forward by the Emperor of Ethiopia that Dejazmach Gugsashould be handed over by us to him and-should stand his trial for having deserted to the Italians during the Italo-Abyssinian war1935-36.The War Cabinet were informed that telegrams which had beenreceived since the Memorandum had been drafted made it clear thatGugsa could not now be surrendered to the Emperor without a breach of faith.The War Cabinet-Authorised a reply to be sent that, in view of the commit-ment entered into, Gugsa could not now be surrendered;but that no reason was seen why he should be regarded asa prisoner to whom any special privileges should be accorded.Blockade.Proposal toallow shipment of milk for children in enemy-occupied territories.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 53rdConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The War Cabinet again considered a Memorandum by theForeign Secretary on the. proposal that a supply of limited quantities of milk, for the relief of children only, should be allowedto enter territories of Allied countries occupied by the enemy(W.P. (42) 175).The Foreign Secretary said that he thought that this proposal would make good propaganda and would stimulate pro-Ally feeling in enemy-occupied Europe. This view was supported by theMinister of Economic Warfare.On the other hand, it was urged that the proposal before theWar Cabinet involved a departure from the strong ground ofprinciple that Germany, by invading these territories, had madeherself responsible for the conditions therein.  If milk for children
Great George Street, S.W.1,June 2. 1942.was allowed to pass through the blockade, it would then be argued that the amount provided was inadequate, and strong pressure would be brought to bear for a further concession. Moreover, itwould be particularly dangerous if we were to attempt to obtaincredit for our action in allowing such supplies through the blockade.The War Cabinet was also reminded that strong pressure hadbeen brought to bear for similar concessions in the past. Theserequests had been refused, but our relations with the governments in London of the enemy-occupied territories had not deteriorated onthat account.The Foreign Secretary said that, in the light of the views expressed, he would not press the proposal in his Memorandumfurther for the present.The War Cabinet accordingly postponed further con-sideration of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum for thetime being.
