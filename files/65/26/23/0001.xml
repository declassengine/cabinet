Fuel The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the President of rationing. the Board of Trade (W.P. (42) 197) to which was annexed a draft(Previous        White Paper on Fuel Rationing.Reference: The War Cabinet were informed that although the PresidentW.M. (42) 55th of the Board of Trade had made every effort to secure a modusConclusions, vivendi which would be generally acceptable, and had had very fullMinute 2.) consultations with all sections of Parliamentary opinion&apos;, there was still a considerable volume of opinion, especially among Conserva-tive and Liberal National Members, which would oppose the present scheme, either by voting against it or by abstaining. A general desire was expressed to avoid a cleavage of opinion on this issue.The War Cabinet were also informed that there had been aconsiderable demand in the House that measures for obtainingincreased production and reduction of consumption should be placed before the House at the present time.In these circumstances, the President of the Board of Trade,while still believing that a scheme broadly on the lines put forwardwas right on merits, thought that the wiser course would be thatthe Leader of the House should announce that the Government didnot propose to lay a White Paper on Fuel Rationing before Whitsun,but that immediately after Whitsun a White Paper would be laiddealing with measures both to increase production and to restrictconsumption.This course met with general approval.The following points were made in discussion : (1) The coal problem should be tackled as a whole. Miners,mine-owners and consumers all had something to con-tribute to the solution of the problem.(2) Measures must be taken to see that available resources were concentrated on the most productive seams.(3) Attention was drawn to the special steps now being takento improve working conditions, as part of the problemof recruiting young men in adequate numbers into the mines.(4) Consideration was again given to the suggestion that thePrime Minister should make a broadcast on the coalquestion as a whole, including an appeal for a voluntaryrestriction of consumption. As against the advantages of this course, it was pointed out that, since we wantedpeople to stock coal in the summer but not to burn it,it would be some time before we could measure thesuccess of such an appeal. Several Ministers thoughtthat a serious situation might arise if the introductionof fuel rationing was postponed for any considerable period.It was also argued that, although we mightmanage to get through the ensuing winter without fuelrationing, the situation in the following winter wouldbe even more serious.(5) It was suggested that the objections raised to the present scheme were not based on objections to the principleof rationing, which had proved very successful in otherspheres, but on doubts whether the present scheme was really workable in practice, and whether it was not toounwieldy.The War Cabinet, agreed as follows : (a) The Lord Privy Seal was authorised to state in the house that the Government had decided, having regard to theviews expressed, not to lay a further White Paper on fuel Rationing before Whitsun. After Whitsun a comprehensive scheme would be laid before the House,dealing with measures to increase the production andrestrict the consumption of coal.
27W.M. 62 (42).(b) The President of the Board of Trade was invited to bringhis rationing,scheme, in its latest form, before the lord presidents Committee. The Committee, in examining the scheme, should consider to what extent adjustmentscould be made which would substantially meet the main points put forward by its critics.(c) It was agreed to defer a decision whether an appeal shouldbe made for a voluntary reduction of consumption, untilthe results of the examination in (b) were available. Butit was agreed that the Prime Minister ought not to make an appeal unless a considerable time could be allowedto elapse thereafter, during which it could be judgedwhether the desired reduction was, in fact,. being achieved by voluntary means.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 12, 1942.
