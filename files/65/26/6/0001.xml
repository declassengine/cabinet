War Cabinet deeply sympathises with difficulties ofyour task, but is.greatly concerned to /find that latestformula was propounded to Nehru and to Working Committeewithout previous knowledge and approval of Viceroy andWavell.   There is also grave danger that Johnson&apos;s publicintervention may be misunderstood as representing actionon behalf of U,3. Government, which of course is not thecase.2.     It is essential to bring the whole matter back tothe Cabinet&apos;s plan which you went out to urge, with only such amplifications as are agreed to be put forward.3.     The most practical course would -be to have from you3in clear and continuous form, the developments in orunder (e) which the Viceroy, the Commander-in-Chief andyourself are propounding, so that the Cabinet can see theposition as a whole.4.     It is also necessary to know what is meant byallusions to a National Government as though the membersof it would: all      Indians.5,     We ucive not received any assurance that if agreement was reached on defence, the scheme in all other respectsis acceptable.  -6.     Following telegram raises some questions on 958-Son which we have as yet no clear information.   Ends.

Begins,Viceroy&apos;s telegram 958-S,   Following points need tobe definitely cleared up.(1) Last line of (a) &quot;for that purpose&quot;.We presume Commander-in-Chief remains member of council for all purposes, like all other Members,and that the phrase above only refers to hisspecial raison d&apos; etre,&quot; This must be quite clear,(2) First sentence of (cl) appears completely to side-track position of Viceroy and Government of Indiaand if so is clearly unacceptable.   The decision should be by Viceroy.(3) Does &quot;sanctioning&quot; under (d)(1) cover authority togive final sanction to proposals within general financial provision made for the services, or doesit give to the finance branch under the defence minister power to veto any and every proposal on financial grounds,(4) Generally speaking the whole document is obscureand couched in terms derogatory to the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s position.    If the scheme is acceptable to Commander-in-Chief in substance, would it notbe much better to say clearly that the present defence Department is to be divided between a war department and a Defence Department and explicitlydefine the functions assigned to each,   Ends,,
