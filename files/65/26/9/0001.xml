213W.M. 48 (42).Man-Power.Eelease ofCivil defence personnel forwar industryand the armed forces.1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Home Secretary and the Minister of Home Security(W.P. (42) 153).The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave ageneral explanation of the proposals in his paper. The schemenecessarily involved some element of risk; but; in view of thedifficulties of the man-power situation, this was a risk which ought,in present circumstances, to be accepted.The reduction in full-time strengths, particularly in the civil defence (General) Services, would necessitate some reorganisation and also use of the power to direct men and women to undertakepart-time service. It was also a part of the scheme that full-timepersonnel released would be liable to recall if heavy raiding were resumed though it was recognised that there might be some delay in getting people back, particularly in the London Region, wherethe large numbers to be released could not be absorbed in industrial employment within the Region.The Secretary of State for Scotland supported the proposals outlined in the Memorandum, on the understanding that they wouldnot prevent the recruitment of the 850 full-time personnel stillrequired to bring the establishment of the National Fire Service inScotland up to the minimum strength required for manning theheavy pumps.The War Cabinet approved the proposals put forward in w.P. (42) 153.chemical warfare.precautionary measures.(previous reference erences:W.M. (41) 47thConclusions,Minute 7;W.M. (42) 36thConclusions,Minute 3; andW.M. (42) 39thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. &apos; The War Cabinet had before them a Report by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs on the state of our civiliananti-gas precautions (W.P. (42) 152).In discussion, the following points were raised : (a) The Minister of Labour and National Service said, withreference to paragraph 15 of the Report, that he had arranged for laundries to be scheduled as essentialundertakings in order to ensure that sufficient staff would be available to deal with the decontamination of clothing.(6) As regards paragraph 14 of the Report, it was explainedthat negotiations with the laundries had been conductedprimarily by the War Office, and it was believed thatthey were now nearing a satisfactory settlement. Theview was expressed that some compulsory powers mighthave to be applied if a final settlement could not bereached at an early date.(c) The question was raised whether civilian anti-gas precau-tions were more, or less, complete in Germany than inthis country. The War Cabinet asked for a consideredappreciation on this point, based on the best information available from all sources.(d) It was also necessary to know whether the basis of our anti-gas precautions called for review in the light of the types of gas likely to be used by the enemy.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs undertook to submit a further report, in a week&apos;s time, dealing withthe points mentioned as outstanding in W.P. (42) 152 andwith the further points which had been raised in the courseof the discussion.
3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (42) 150) about politicalmeetings in factories.It was explained in the Memorandum that some difficulty hadbeen found in applying the previous ruling that no politicalmeetings of any kind should be held in Government Offices, orfactories, since Departments could not tell in advance whetherspeakers would exploit for political purposes the facilities extendedto them.The Ministry of Aircraft Production had therefore made a rule that, in factories under their control, a meeting should only beaddressed by members of the armed forces in uniform, or byspeakers provided by the Ministry of Information.It was now proposed that this rule should be applied generally to meetings in Government Offices, or factories, or other establish-ments directly under Government control.The Lord President of the Council explained that it was not intended that the adoption of this rule should operate to preventless formal meetings addressed by representatives of the manage-ments or by a trades union representative.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed and agreed that, as regardsfactories under private management, the Trades UnionCongress and the Employers&apos; Federation should beinformed that this practice would in future be followed by government Departments.Supplies to 4.   The War Cabinet had a discussion on this matter, which russia. is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet(Previous Conclusions. &apos;&quot;)Reference:W.M.
