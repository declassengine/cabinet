(42) 185).3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production on the supply of aluminium toRussia (W.P.&apos; (42) 199).The Minister of Aircraft Production explained&apos; that he wassomewdiat anxious about the maintenance of supplies of bauxitefrom South America to Canada owing to the difficulties of theshipping situation in the Western Atlantic.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to- inform the Russian authorities that we could undertaketo supply 2,000 tons a month for a period of three months,beginning in July 1942, but that we found difficulty inpledging ourselves beyond that point at the present time.4. The War Cabinet were informed that it had been arranged that on the first and second Sitting Days in the following week the adjournment of the House would be moved for the promised debate on the general war situation and the organisation of joint planning. A desire had been expressed that the debate should be opened by a Government spokesman.The War Cabinet, after discussion, agreed as follows :  The debate should be opened by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, who would make a statement about theorganisation of Joint Planning: The Lord Privy Sealwould wind up for the Government on the second day.The Prime Minister would not take part in the debateunless special circumstances arose Avhich rendered thiscourse desirable.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the United States Government were taking stepsto raise their Missions with Allied Governments to the rank ofEmbassies. An increase in the number of Embassies clearly lessenedthe significance of the distinction between an Embassy and aLegation. Nevertheless, he felt that We ought to follow &quot;suit andadopt the same course.The War Cabinet took note of this proposal.Great George Street, S.W.1,May 14, 1942.
ANNEX.MOST SECRET.W.M.(42)65rd Conclusions, Minute 1,NASCAR.previous conference:U.(4S) 61stnclusions,ute 3. )The War Cabinet were informed, that on the previous day a telegram (No. 1718B) had been sent to the ForceCommanders in Madagascar informing them that, foroverriding political considerations, a Communiquewas to be issued at once stating&quot; that it was theintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to associate theFree French National Committee in the administration ofMadagascar.A telegram (No. 0042C of 14th May) had now beenreceived from Admiral Syfret and General Sturges,representing that the association of the Free French inthe administration of Madagascar would alienate the bulkof the French population and make it necessary to employ a large proportion of the British forces on their control.For this reason they felt unable, for the present, tocarry out operations against Tamatave and Majunga unless their forces were considerably increased.A telegram   had been sent to Admiral Syfretexplaining that telegram 1718B had. not been intended as an instruction to issue a local Communique.      It was hoped,that the reactions to the Communique issued in london would not be as unfortunate as he feared, and that hewould be able to proceed forthwith with the instructions issued to him as to the occupation of Tamatave andMajunga.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was desirable to occupy these two places if the matter could be arrangedquickly.      But we could not allow Brigades which hadbeen earmarked to go to Ceylon to be unduly delayedin Madagascar.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Great George Street, S.W.1.,14th May, 1942.
