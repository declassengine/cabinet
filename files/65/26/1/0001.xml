TradeDisputes andTrade UnionsAct, 1927.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 95thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The War Cabinet were informed that a letter had beenreceived from Sir Walter Citrine asking whether the general council of the TUX. could be informed of the Government^intentions in respect of their request for an amendment of&apos;Sections 5 and 6 of the Act.General discussion ensued.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss the matterinformally, with a view to the question being againbrought before the War Cabinet at a later date.India.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 38thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet had before them two Personal telegrams from the Lord Privy Seal to the Prime Minister (W.P. (42) 138).In these telegrams the Lord Privy Seal said that the completeretention of- the existing control of defence by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had met with a very unfavourable reception, and thatthere was perhaps some misunderstanding of the position. It wasalso thought that unless the Indian leaders could claim some controlover the defence of India, their appeal to the Indian people wouldnot be effective. He had accordingly sent a letter suggesting thathe and the Commander-in-Chief should have an interview with congress leaders, in order to explain to them the technical difficulties of the situation, and to tell them that they might makeany suggestions which they might wish as to the division of responsibilities in this sphere of government.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the acceptanceor rejection of the proposals set out in the Declaration was not likely to turn on responsibility for defence. There could, of course,be no question of our accepting a nominee of Congress to some officeconnected with the defence responsibilities of the Government ofIndia. But there was no reason why some suitable Indian, selected by the Viceroy himself, should not be appointed in such a capacity.This could be done without altering the terms of the Declaration,and without impairing the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s responsibilityfor the control and direction of the Defence of India.It was also felt that the Congress leaders, by concentratingattention on responsibility for defence, were attempting to distractattention from the essential features of the scheme set out in theDeclaration. ,The War Cabinet-Agreed that a telegram should be sent to the Lord privy seal embodying the following points  (a) His action was approved in inviting Congress leaders to a discussion with himself and the Commander-in-Chief, at which the former would formulatetheir suggestions on the defence question. But theWar Cabinet must know what these proposals were before any commitment was entered into.(&amp;) The War Cabinet was unwilling to contemplate any departure from the published text of theDeclaration.(b) If, contrary to*what appeared to be the case, it became clear that Indian association with Defence was thepoint on which acceptance of the whole schemeturned, a new situation would have arisen, andit would be worth while to consider some arrange-ment to meet this outstanding point; subject of
187W.M. W (42)..course, to the (^mmander-in-Chief&apos;s responsi-bility for the -control and direction of the Defenceof India being unimpaired.The Prime Minister undertook to prepare a draft telegram on these lines, which he would circulate to the membersof the India Committee in the course of the afternoon.Great George Street, S. W. 1,April 2, 1942.
