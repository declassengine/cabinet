(42) 61stConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.Egypt.naval operations.Shipping losses.MilitaryOperations.Burma.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.In the home theatre air operations had been limited by bad weather. Coastal Command had borne the brunt of the week&apos;work, their main operation having been an attack on the PrinzEugen on the 17th May. Preliminary&apos; reports indicated thatprobably 2, and possibly 4, hits had been scored.At Malta the enemy had changed his tactics and was nowattacking mainly with fighters, with a view to wearing down ourresistance. In the week&apos;s fighting we, had destroyed 46 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 22 and damaged 46, for a total loss of10 destroyed and 17 damaged (including losses on the ground).In Egypt we had intercepted a convoy of between 14 and20 troop-carrying aircraft. More than half had been destroyed, andmost of the remainder had been damaged.Allied shipping losses for the week totalled 202.000 tons. Mostof these ships had been lost in the West Atlantic.The Americans had now begun to operate their conVoy systemoff the centre section of their eastern seaboard. The position in the carribbean continued to be unsatisfactory, but there was some prospect that the convoy system might now come into operationthere earlier than anticipated.now withdrawing over the borderthat General Alexander still hadto 8,000 British troops and fromIn Burma our forces wereinto Assam. It was estimatedunder his command from 6,00025,000 to 30,000 Indian troops.Preliminary reports indicated that there might be some lack of discipline among the remnants of two Chinese divisions which weremoving back into Assam with our troops.The Prime Minister asked that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be consulted before authority was givenfor these Chinese troops to be disarmed on arrival in India.The War Cabinet were given the latest information regardingthe progress of the German offensive in the Kerch Peninsula and theRussian drive on Kharkov.The German move in the Crimea was not the opening stage ofa major offensive. There were still no signs of any troop movementspointing to a large-scale German offensive, and it was thought thatsuch an offensive was unlikely to begin before mid-June.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Supplies toRussia.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 61stConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet had a discussion on this subject, whichis recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War&apos; cabinet conclusions.West Africa.DefenceArrangements3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 201) suggesting theappointment of a Commander-in-Chief to ensure co-ordinatedcontrol over the whole field of defence services, military and civil,in West Africa.   The appointment would be analogous to that of[23835]&apos; b 2
Admiral Lay ton in Ceylon. It was suggested that the Commander-in-Chief, though he might be a high officer of one of the FightingServices, should not exercise operational control over the Services.The need for greater co-ordination in this area was accepted.Discussion followed as to whether, the situation called for theappointment of a civilian or a serving officer. The conclusion reached was that general co-ordinating functions should beexercised by a single authority, whose position would be somewhatanalogous to that of the Minister of State in Cairo; and thatarrangements should also be made for unified command of all theFighting Services in this area.The War Cabinets conclusions were as follows : (1) An appointment should be made in West Africa somewhaton the lines of the Minister of State in the Middle East.Broadly, the functions of the holder of this post wouldbe to ensure the effective co-operation of all Services,Civil and Military, in West Africa.(2) A draft Directive for this appointment should be prepared and submitted to the Prime Minister.(3) In connection with the preparation of this draft, furtherconsideration should be given to the question whether any alteration was called for in the powers of the Naval,Military and Air Commanders in West Africa.Publicity.MilitaryOperations.(previous references:W.M. (41) 44thConclusions;Minute 5,and 64thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Information (W.P. (42) 206) emphasising theimportance, from the point of view of public opinion amongst theUnited Nations and in friendly neutral countries, of the Ministerof Information being fully informed in regard to Military opera-tions, as provided for in W.P. (41) 149. In particular, the Ministerurged, in the light of recent experience in regard to Madagascar,that the Service Departments should be directed to impart to senior officials in the Ministry of Information, at the appropriate stage,information in regard to impending operations.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) It should be laid down as the recognised procedure and brought to the notice of all concerned that, when bodies of troops left this country to engage in operations, theyshould include a small unit properly equipped for obtaining a record of those operations.(2) The personnel of this unit would normally be composed ofpersons under military discipline and trained for these duties. Specially nominated officials of the Ministry ofInformation should, however, be consulted on such occasions in order to ensure that the unit despatchedwas appropriate for the purpose.(3) It should.also be laid down that the accounts recorded andthe photographs taken on these occasions were to bemade available to all organs of the Press. (In thisconnection the procedure adopted in the expedition toMadagascar, when a representative of a single news-paper had been taken on board at Durban and accordedspecial facilities, was open to strong objection. Itshould be made clear to all concerned that this proceduremust on no account be repeated.)
35W.M. 64 (42).Publicity.British publicity in the UnitedStates.(previous reference erence:W.M. (41) 44thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister- of Information (W.P. (42)208) covering a paper byMr. H. B. Butler, the new Director-General of the British Infor-mation Service in the United States, stating that British prestige in the United States had declined, largely owing to our failure toput the facts of our war effort before the American public. Hesuggested that the interests of security had overridden those of propaganda and good Anglo-American relations, and mentionedvarious branches of the war effort about which more information could be made publicly available without giving aid to the enemy.In discussion, the Minister of Labour and National service said that in a forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on theEssential Work Order he would like to mention the fact that therewere nearly 22 million people between the ages of 14 and 64 nowoccupied in the Armed Polices, Civil Defence, Industry and Services.There was general agreement with the views put forward in thepaper, but there would have to be some scrutiny to determine exactlyhow much could safely be published.- The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of. State for Dominion Affairs toexamine the Memorandum in consultation with theMinister of Production, the Minister of information and other Ministers concerned, in order to determine what information could be made public, on the lines proposed inthis -Memorandum (W.P. (42) 208), and to report to theWar Cabinet.Palestine. 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the-Illegal Secretary of -State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 209) about illegal immigration.      immigration into Palestine.(Previous The Memorandum stated that since the matter had last beenEeference:        discussed by the War Cabinet there had been constant pressure byW.M. (42) 29th   Zionists in this country and the United States and by their conclusions,      sympathisers in Parliament for a declaration by His Majesty&apos;sMinute l.)        Government of their intentions not only in regard to the treatmentof future refugees, but also as regards the fate of the passengers ofthe Darien, who had been in a detainment camp for over a year.There were signs of a revival of the traffic, and within recent weeksthree small vessels with parties of refugees had reached Istanbul.The situation which had arisen called for new decisions.The following points were made in discussion : (i) The Foreign Secretary said that he was prepared to acquiesce in the iine of action proposed by the colonial secretary in his Memorandum provided that thesituation would be reviewed if and when the totalnumber of immigrants (legal and illegal) admitted to palestine reached the quotas set out in the White Paper.This was agreed to.(ii) What was to be done to the 20 or 30 illegal immigrantswho had now reached Turkey ? The view was expressed that, on the whole, the least objectionable course wouldbe to give them visas to Cyprus, on the understandingthat, if and when a decision was reached to remove allrefugees from Cyprus, these 20 or 30 people would haveto be removed at the same time.The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows : (1.) In pursuance of the existing policy of taking all practicable steps to discourage illegal immigration into Palestine,no steps whatever should be taken to facilitate the arrival of Jewish &apos;&apos; refugees &apos;&apos; in Palestine.
(2) Future shiploads of illegal immigrants who, nevertheless,succeeded in reaching Palestine should be ianded, placedin detainment camps, and those who passed the security and economic absorptive checks should gradually be released against the current half-yearly quotas granted under the White Paper.(3) The Darien detainees should be subjected to the same procedure.(4) All practicable steps should be taken to avoid publicity forthe new arrangements. It was suggested that privateexplanations should be given to those who were likely toraise the issue publicly.Major-general sir A.Cunningham.Question offurtherEmployment.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 31stConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War - Cabinet were informed that Major-GeneralCunningham had asked whether he might be definitely informedwhether there was any prospect of his being further employed.It was urged that this Officer was entitled to be informedwhether he was likely to secure further employment.A final decision on this matter was deferred.Great George Street, S.W.1,&apos;    May 18, 1942.
