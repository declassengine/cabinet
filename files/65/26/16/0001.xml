ExternalMonetary andEconomicPolicy.(Previous : :Reference:W.M. (42) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the paymaster-General (W.P. (42) 159) on preliminary discussions withthe United States. This Memorandum set out the recommendationsof the Committee on Reednstruction Problems, and had annexed toit a Note, prepared by the Treasury in consultation with otherDepartments, envisaging the probable conditions of the post-war world, and reviewing a number of projects in the external economic sphere. .     -The Paymaster-General explained that Article VII of the mutual Aid Agreement contemplated that conversations should be begun between the two Governments in order to determine the best means of attaining the objectives set out in that Article. The objectof his Memorandum was to obtain approval for the general linesof approach which our representatives should adopt in these conver-sations. In particular, should our representatives put forward theconstructive ideas which had been elaborated in the Treasury fora new organisation, styled a Clearing Union, which aimed atsubstituting an expansionist for a contractionist pressure on world trade generally ? It was thought that there was every advantage in putting forward this scheme in discussion, since it would fit in with a number of proposals likely to be made by the United states representatives. . .      &apos;The following points were agreed to in discussion : (1) It was of the utmost importance that the discussions should be regarded as exploratory and informal, andeven perhaps somewhat academic, and that they shouldnot take the&quot; form of a negotiation between representa-tives of the two countries.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs emphasised how important this was from the point ofview of the Dominions.(2) The Paymaster-General said that the Minister of Labourand National Service hoped that it would be made clearthat we should in no way be committed to deflationarymeasures. In order to meet this point, the following additional paragraph should be inserted in paragraph85 (4) (d) of the Treasury Memorandum (E.P. (42) 2), ofwhich the Note appended to the Paymaster-General&apos;s paper was a summary : &quot;It should be made clear that the measuresunder paragraph 85 (4) (c) which the GoverningBoard can ask a country to take &apos; to improve its position,&apos; if it has a substantial debit belance, donot include a deflationary policy, enforced by dearmoney and similar measures, having the effect ofcausing unemployment, for this would amount torestoring, subject to insufficient safeguards, the evils of the old automatic gold standard.&quot;(3) On the suggestion of the Lord Privy Seal, the fourthsentence of paragraph 13 of the Treasury Memorandum,annexed to W.P. (42) 159, should be amended to read asfollows: &apos;&apos; It has been provisionally assumed that anysuch organisation would be founded by the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom and, if she would agree, Russia, and that, while other States wouldbe admitted as members when they were ready, themanagement and control might for the firste fiveyears, and perhaps permanently, remain with thefounder States.&quot;
3W.M. 55 (42).- While the discussions for the moment should be confined to representatives of the United States and thiscountry, he thought it was- undesirable to have it on record that the organisation would be permanentlymanaged by ourselves and the United States, to the exclusion of the U.S.S.R.(4) On the suggestion of the Lord Privy Seal, the followingaddition should be made at the end of paragraph 13 ofthe Treasury Memorandum : -&quot; The plan would provide for the possibility ofcancelling surplus credit balances in excess of a country&apos;s quota and for the employment of the funds thus released for the relief, in appropriatecircumstances, of a State which had fallen uponeconomic misfortune.&quot;The War Cabinet-(a) Agreed  to  the  recommendations  put  forward  in  the paymaster-General&apos;s Memorandum, subject to the points made in discussion and set out above.(b) Agreed to the despatch of the draft telegram to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington (Annex &quot; B &quot; tothe Paymaster-General&apos;s Memorandum) subject to stepsfirst being taken to ascertain the views of Mr. Winant,who had just returned to this country from the UnitedStates.Fuel Rationing. 2.   The President of the Board of Trade informed the War(Previous -       Cabinet of the result of his discussions with bodies representativeReference:        of political Parties on the fuel rationing scheme.W.M. (42) 53rd The War Cabinet were informed that the 1922 Committee hadbeen unanimous as to the urgent need both for economy in consump-tion and for measures for ensuring an equitable distribution of coal,gas and electricity, and also as to the need to increase coal produc-tion. They had, however, felt that a simpler scheme could be worked out.Should the Government put down a Motion on the occasion ofthe debate which it had been arranged should take place onThursday, the 7th May ? The view was expressed that, if a Motionwas put down, it was likely that amendments would be tableddealing with the wider issues of reorganisation of the coal-mining,industry. Further, if a Motion was put down, a Supply Day wouldbe lost.The War Cabinet-Decided that, if possible, arrangements should be made forthe debate on Thursday, the 7th May, to take place in committee of Supply, on the Board of Trade and other appropriate Votes. Should, it appear that there were difficulties in arranging for the debate-to take place on this basis, the question whether a Motion should be put downwould be further considered early in the following week.3. Reference was made to the Questions put to the Chancellorof the Exchequer on the preceding day, asking whether he woulddisclose the names of certain firms/mentioned adversely in the comptroller and Auditor-General&apos;s Report,The point at issue was whether the Government ought to take responsibility for deciding whether the names of the firms should be disclosed,, and, if they decided in favour of disclosure, should giveeffect to that decision forthwith.The War Cabinet were informed that it was the normal pro-cedure for the names of firms commented upon in the ComptrollerConclusions,Minute 7.)government contracts.Report by the comptroller and auditor- general on CivilAppropriationAccounts(UnclassifiedVotes), 1940,
and Auditor-General&apos;s Report not to be disclosed. Further, theprocedure was for this Report to be examined by the public accounts Committee; which heard witnesses and could- obtain-further evidence. There were objections to interfering with this procedure, and the Public Accounts Committee might take excep-tion if the Government were now to announce the names of the firms in question.On the other hand, it was pointed out that in a number of thesecases the Comptroller and Auditor-General&apos;s Report seemed to showthat action by the Departments concerned was overdue.The War Cabinet-Decided that the best course would be that the public accounts Committee should be invited to meet immediately,in order to consider the specific cases referred to, and toreport to the House; and asked the Chancellor of theExchequer to take steps accordingly.Pension Appeal 4.   Reference was made to the question of Pension appeal tribunals. Tribunals, which had been raised in the debate on the Adjournmenton Wednesday, the 29th April. It was urged that cases of hardshipwere apt to cause a disproportionate amount of local feeling, andthat the promise that Tribunals would be set up after the war didnot meet the fact that it would then be more difficult to getappropriate evidence. Could not an arrangement be made wherebycases could be referred to County Court Judges for their decision upon the available evidence ?The War Cabinet was informed that the question of setting upthese Tribunals had been considered by the Lord President&apos;sCommittee on the 13th March last, when it had been decided thatthese Tribunals should not be established during the war, but thatan undertaking should be given that they would be established assoon as practicable after the war.the War Cabinet-Asked that the suggestion that these cases should be heard by the County Court Judges should be considered by theLord Presidents Committee..
