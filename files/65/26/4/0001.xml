(42) 38thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.India and ceylon.Australia.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations/Burma. &apos;Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the main events of the past week.Bomber, Command had carried out effective attacks on theMatford Works at Poissy and the Gnome-Rhone Works atGennevilliers.  There had also been a heavy attack on Cologne.The enemy had raided the Gloucester Aircraft Company&apos;spremises.The total enemy casualties in the home theatre had been14 destroyed, 4 probably and 26 damaged against British lossesamounting to 34 bombers, 14 fighters and 6 Coastal command aircraft.At Malta we had inflicted air losses on the enemy amountingto 35 destroyed, 13 probably and 43 damaged. Our own losses hadbeen 18 destroyed and 15 damaged, mainly on the ground.Two places on the east coast of India had been bombed.Particulars of the raid on Colombo had been given in the Press.In the New Guinea and Northern Australia areas australian and United States air units had been very successful.The Chief of the Air Staff was asked to report to the PrimeMinister on the following matters : (1) He should obtain a report from General Wavell regardingthe latter&apos;s policy for despatching air reinforcements from India to Burma.(2) He should obtain a report as to the training and previous experience of the Blenheim squadron at Colombo, whichhad failed to establish contact with the Japanese shipstaking part in the attack on Colombo.&quot;(3) He should ascertain the position as to the total numbersof American aircraft now in Australia or en route for Australia. This information was essential in order todetermine whether Kittyhawk aircraft being manufac-tured to our orders in the United States should be sentto the Middle East or to Australia.Allied shipping losses had totalled 74,000 tons. A further32,000 tons might have to be added to this figure in respect of ships which had left Java but had not yet reached Australia.The Japanese were advancing slowly in the Irrawaddy andSittang valleys. Their slow progress could be attributed in part to a successful counter-attack by General Alexander&apos;s forces atPaungde at the end of March. Our forces were suffering from enemy air supremacy in this area.There had been heavy fighting on the Moscow front, with little progress by either side. In the south the thaw had set in everywhere.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Policy.Daylight bomberattacks with   ,Fighter Escort: ;(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 14thConclusions,Minute 5.)&apos;&apos;&apos; 2. Reference was made to an air attack by 12 bombers and14 squadrons of Spitfires on St.;;Oirier railway junction on the4th April, in which we had lost 12 aircraft to 5 of the enemy.The question was raised whether the policy of attackingselected targets by day on the Western Front with heavy fighterprotection was justified. This policy had been adopted in order to force the German fighters into the air, and it had helped Russia byretaining German fighters on;, the,, Western Front. But the loss ofa British fighter in these attacks meant that the pilot was killedor made prisoner, while if a German fighter was lost the Germanpilot might fight again.The general view was taken that the policy of carrying out these air attacks on the Western Front was fully justified so long
as, on the average, we brought down not less than one enemy aircraft for every aircraft of our own lost.  But it was impossible&apos; to  prevent our  suffering  disproportionate  losses  on  isolatedoccasions.The War Cabinet expressed general agreement with thisview.Attacks on It was suggested that the effect on German morale would beTargets in considerable if we published a list of, say, twenty-five German townsGermany. which would be the targets of heavy bombing attacks in the ensuing months. In order to avoid concentration of the enemydefences at the named places, we should not, in practice, confineourselves to targets on the published list.s The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to submit to the WarCabinet a list of targets in order that this suggestionmight be further considered.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 5thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat on the night of the 2nd/3rd April, 28 aircraft had operatedoverland, mainly in Kent and Dorset. At Weymouth, where con-siderable damage had been done, there had been 84 casualties, 20 ofthem fatal.  There had also been 8 fatal casualties at Dover.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Spain.Action in -Spanish Terri-torial Waters.(previous reference:W.M, (41) 122ndConclusions, ,.Minute 2.). 4. A discussion took place, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Publication of 5.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that Admiralof theMemoirs by Fleet Lord Cork and Orrery had asked permission to include in service Officers, his Memoirs, which he proposed to publish shortly, some accountof his experiences as Commander-in-Chief at Narvik. Subject tocertain points, there was not much to which objection need be taken on Security grounds. But this application raised the questionwhether it was appropriate that Officers who had served in thepresent war should publish war reminiscences during the war.The War Cabinet-; Agreed that a general rule should be laid down f.that officers of the three Services should hot publish reininis-cences of the present war while the war continued.   TheService Ministers were asked to consult together as to the-application of this decision. -        .;   sGreat George Street, S.W. .1,April 7, 1942.
