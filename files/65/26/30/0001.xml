SECRET.NO CIRCULATION.W.M. (43) 69.29th May. 1942 - 11 a.m.) MEETINGSORGANISED BYSOCIETIESCONNECTED WITHTHE COMMUNISTMOVEMENT.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL informed the WarCabinet that he had accepted an invitation to address a meeting on the 20th June to celebrate the entry of Russia into the war.     The Home Secretary had certain views on the matter which he wished to put to the War Cabinet.THE HOME SECRETARY explained that,although the nominal sponsors of this meeting were a large number of persons of high standing and responsibility (the list of which was read to theWar Cabinet), the meeting was in fact organised by three bodies (Russia To-day, the Joint Committeefor Soviet Aid, and the National Council of British-Soviet Unity) all of which had associated with their administration persons closely connected with theCommunist Movement.     This modus o-perandi was increasingly practised by the Communist Movement.He feared that if a Cabinet Minister addressed thismeeting, the result would be that these Societies wouldclaim publicly that they were above reproach.There was some discussion on the subjectthat the Government should itself organise a demonstration to celebrate the aniversary of Russia&apos;sentry into the war and their coming alliance withthis country, and that this should be made a pretext for the Lord Privy Seal to say that as he had to address the Government meeting, he could not address the meeting organised by these three Societies.After some discussion, however, the view was taken that it was rather late in the day to makea change of this nature.The War Cabinet were informed that aMemorandum, dealing with the attitude which should betaken in regard to such Societies, was in preparation and would shortly be submitted to the War Cabinet.This would afford an opportunity for a policy to belaid down, after due consideration.Great George Street, S.W.1.
