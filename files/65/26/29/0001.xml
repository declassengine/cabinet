U-boat activity had now moved to the gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.The outward-bound Russian convoy had been attacked on theprevious day by some thirty-two torpedo and dive-bombers, of which one was certainly and four were probably destroyed. The convoyhad escaped damage except for one ship which bad had to turn back.Our forces from Burma were now back in Assam.There were indications that the enemy might launch an attackbefore the end of the month. Details were given of the strength ofour own and the enemy forces.The German counter-attack to the south of Kharkhov had placed the Russian forces in this area in some danger. TheRussians had evacuated the Kerch Peninsula.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.2. The Foreign Secretary gave the War Cabinet a resume ofthe position. , The record of the discussion is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.3. The Foreign Secretary informed the War Cabinet that thenegotiations for the evacuation of Italians from East Africa hasbeen completed, and the first 10,000 had already left Berbera for italy.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 213) stating that president Roosevelt had proclaimed the 14th June a &quot;united nations Day,&quot; to be marked by the flying of the flags of the united nations and other appropriate celebrations.

India.The Governor-General &apos;sExecutiveCouncil.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)The War Cabinet    -(1) Approved the following recommendations in the foreign secretary&apos;s Paper, namely : (a) That the Prime Minister should ascertain TheKing&apos;s pleasure.(b) That a co-ordinating committee consisting of reprs-sentatives of the three Services, the ForeignOffice, the India Office, the Dominions Office, theColonial Office and the Ministries of home security, War Transport and Labour, under theChairmanship of the Ministry of Information,should be formed to decide and carry out thepractical arrangements involved.(2) Decided that, for reasons of security, there should be norelaxation of the present practice whereby celebrationsof this character could not be made generally knownbeforehand. In this connection the Co-co-ordinating committee was invited to consider a suggestion that the ceremony should be held at Windsor, where a limiteddegree of local publicity might be possible on the day ofthe celebration. The possibility of holding the celebra-tion in London, subject to appropriate safeguards, wasnot, however, excluded.5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the.Secretary of State for India (W.P. (42) 217).   Attached to&quot; this paper were telegrams from the Viceroy suggesting the creation ofthree new Portfolios in his Council, and setting out his proposalsfor filling these Portfolios and two existing vacancies.A scheme somewhat on these lines had been approved by theWar Cabinet on the 2nd February, but had been held in abeyanceduring the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Mission. Since the Mission&apos;s return the Viceroy had reviewed his proposals as a whole and had sub-mitted them with certain modifications.Certain comments on these proposals had been put to theViceroy after consideration by the India Committee. these comments related (a) to the proposed division of the DefencePortfolio, and (b) to certain of the proposed appointments.As regards (a), the Viceroy had been asked whether theproposal to create the Portfolio of Defence Co-ordination was putforward at this juncture on merits and not merely as a politicalmove. The Viceroy&apos;s answer was that the Commander-in-Chief,who agreed that the decision was essentially political, would be quite prepared to work to a Defence Co-ordination Portfolio, butadded that, if it was created, it was essential that it should be filled by Sir Firozkhan Noon, as he (the Viceroy) proposed.As- regards the choice of members of the Council, the Viceroyin general adhered to his previous nominations.The view taken by the War Cabinet was that it was appro-priate that the views held by Ministers in this country on theViceroy&apos;s proposals should be brought to his notice. Since, however,responsibility for running the Council must fall on the Viceroy,and the latter adhered to his original proposals, which had thegeneral support of the Secretary of State for India, it would be right that these matters should be left to be adjusted between theViceroy and the Secretary of State.The War Cabinet accordingly gave general approval tothe proposals for the reconstitution of the Governor-General&apos; s Executive Council, and authorised theSecretary of State for India to settle the details with theViceroy.Great George Street, S. W. 1,May 26, 1942.
