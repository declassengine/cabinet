Pretoria The Secretary of State for the  Colonies said that theConference. Conference at Pretoria, attended by Field-Marshal Smuts and(Previous General Platt, was starting on the following day.  He understoodReference-        that this Conference would deal mainly with Madagascar.  But itW.M. (42) 72nd was also proposed to discuss certain matters affecting the spheresConclusions,      of military command in East Africa, e.g., whether Southern,   Minute 7.)       Rhodesia would fall within General Platt&apos;s Command or would form a separate command.   For this reason Field-Marshal smuts had asked that Sir John Waddington, the Governor of northern rhodesia, should attend the Conference.For some time past there had been- labour unrest in the rhodesian copper belt, partly as a result of the activities ofMaybank, the leader of the Miners&apos; Union. There had been con-siderable risk of labour troubles which would seriously impair thewar effort. The position had, however, so far been successfully held,and Sir John Waddington had just gone to the copper belt to investigate the position. It would be very undesirable that heshould have to leave in the middle of the investigation which he wascarrying out. Moreover, if he were to leave, it would have to be explained that he had done so to attend the Conference at Pretoria,which would thus be given undesirable publicity.A communication had therefore been transmitted to Field-Marshal Smuts explaining the reasons why it was undesirable for sir John Waddington to attend the Conference, and proposing thathe should be represented by Mr. Tucker, who had acted as chief secretary of Northern Rhodesia and knew the Governor&apos;s views.Field-Marshal Smuts, however, had returned to the charge, and pressed strongly that Sir John Waddington should go to Pretoria.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, as he saw thematter, there was no compelling reason why Sir John Waddingtonshould go to Pretoria; and, although he was anxious to meet Field-Marshal Smuts &apos;s views as far as possible, he felt that the right course was that the Governor should complete his visit of investi-gation to the copper belt, and that Mr. Tucker should represent him at Pretoria. &apos;In discussion, this view met with the general approval of theWar Cabinet.A draft telegram to Field-Marshal Smuts was read out and approved, subject to minor amendments, and the Colonial secretary was authorised to arrange for its despatch.Great George^ Street, S. W. 1,June 17, 1942.
