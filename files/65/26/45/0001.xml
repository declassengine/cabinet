Parliament.forthcoming debate on theMiddle EastSituation.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 82ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Procedure.Dive-bombers.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he hadreceived a letter from Sir John Wardlaw-Milne, M.P., saying that,subject to the consent of the other signatories, he was willing thatthe Debate on his Motion should be postponed, on a statement being issued that, in view of the seriousness of the position, the Debatewas postponed temporarily by agreement.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Debate on the Motion must proceed, and invited the Prime Minister to send a reply in this sense.Further discussion took place as to the arrangements for the debate.It was agreed that the. Minister of Production should speakimmediately after the mover and seconder of the Motion, and thatarrangements should be made for another Government spokesmanto be ready to speak later in the afternoon if this should prove necessary.The question of dive-bombers was likely to be raised in the debate, both as regards the general utility of this weapon and ofthe steps being taken to equip our forces with it, and as to the part which it had played in the Libyan battle.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Production to discuss the matter with the Secretaries of State for War and Air that afternoon, in order to prepare a statement for use in thecourse of the Debate.The debate in the Lords.The War Cabinet were informed that arrangements had beenmade for the Debate in the Lords to start on Wednesday, the1st July, instead of on Thursday, the 2nd July, in order that itmight synchronise with the Debate in the Commons. It was under-stood that Lord Beaverbrook proposed to make a speech in supportof the Government early in the Debate, from the point of view ofa former Minister whose administration of the Supply department responsible for tanks might be called in question. The Secretary ofState for the Colonies, as Leader of the House of Lords, would state the Government case fairly early in the Debate, and the LordChancellor would wind up on behalf of the Government.The War Cabinet took note of these arrangements.Great George Street, S.W.1,June 30, 1942.
