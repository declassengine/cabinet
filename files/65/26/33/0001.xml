Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 70thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.Libya.naval operations.Shipping Losses.Australia.Mediterranean.Midway Island.MilitaryOperations.Libya.Russia.Murmansk.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week. In the Home theatre Bomber Command had carriedout 2,000 sorties of which 1,300 had been on Essen. Visibilityhad been bad during the large-scale raid on that city.Coastal Command had made six attacks on U-boats, four ofwhich had been promising.Fighter Command had carried out 6,500 sorties.Total enemy losses for the week had amounted to 40 machinescertain, 17 probable and 52 damaged. Our total losses had been81 bombers, 40 fighters and 6 aircraft of Coastal Command.Attacks on Malta had been relatively light, the enemy losing11 machines to 6 of our own.There had been signs that the enemy air effort in Libya wasslackening. We had lost 49 machines to 29 of the enemy, but our aircraft had devoted much of their effort to attacks againstground troops.Allied shipping losses in the previous seven days amountedto 133,000 tons.The Japanese were beginning to operate in the Indian Oceanwith raiders and U-boats.In the Australian theatre 2 U-boats had been sunk and 2damaged, besides 4 Japanese midget submarines which had succeeded in entering Sydney Harbour.H.M. Submarine Turbulent, operating in the Mediterranean,had sunk one Italian destroyer, one U-boat and one 4,000-ton andtwo medium-sized merchant vessels.The Japanese losses so far reported in the attack on MidwayIsland had been three battleships damaged, two aircraft carrierssunk, and two aircraft carriers, two cruisers and two transportsdamaged.Details were given of the battle proceeding in Libya. after a week&apos;s fighting the German forces were about where they hadbeen at the beginning of the week and must have suffered heavy casualties.   Our tank recovery service was working well.The week on the Russian Front had been quiet, but there were some indications of a coming offensive in the region south of moscow.Hitler&apos;s visit to Finland and recent troop movements might indicate an enemy attack in that region also.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raids.Damage and casualties.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 70thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat on the night of the 6th June a large undetected bomb, whichhad probably been dropped during the air raid on London onthe 10th May, 1941, had exploded under a block of flats near theElephant and Castle. Nineteen people had been killed, 97 seriously injured and 42 slightly injured.During the previous week the enemy had made a number ofsmall raids, but damage had been small and the casualties light.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Ministers&apos;Speeches.3. The Foreign Secretary said that, as public interest in post-war problems increased, it became even more important that ministers, especially those who were not members of the WarCabinet, should consult the Foreign Office before including in theirspeeches references to foreign affairs.The Prime Minister undertook to invite the attention ofMinisters to the guidance already issued on this matter.[23931]b 2
U.S.S.H. 4.   The Prime Minister referred to a recent appreciation bythe Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee about the probable courseof the Russian campaign.The War Cabinet asked that this appreciation shouldbe circulated to members of the War Cabinet and theDefence Committee, with a covering note containing the comments of the Chiefs of Staff. This paper shouldnot, however, be sent to Dominion Governments, at anyrate at this stage.Turkey.Turkish-soviet relations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 47thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he felt some anxiety about the negotiations now proceeding betweenthe Turkish and German Governments. The Germans would do their best to exploit Turkish suspicions of the long-term intentions of the Government of the U.S.S.R. He was watching the situationvery closely, and would do all he could to improve relations between turkey and the U.S.S.R.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Yugoslavia. g    The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum byForces in the the Foreign Secretary (W.P. (42) 243) regarding the dissensionsMiddle East.     which had arisen within the Yugoslav forces in the Middle East.These had originated from the action taken by the new yugoslav government some six months ago in dismissing their Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East and attempting to impose anunpopular officer in his place. In course of time our forces hadinterned all the dissident elements in the Yugoslav Army in Egypt some 300 officers and men out of a total of 1,200 and theMinister of State had been asked to help in finding a more permanent solution of the difficulties. The Foreign Secretary had recently proposed a scheme by which Mr. Rendel and the YugoslavMinister of Justice would proceed to Egypt to carry out an enquiry on the spot; but it was necessary that the ringleaders should first be separated from the rest of the interned officers and men. TheMinister of State had rejected this scheme, partly on the groundthat an attempt to remove the ringleaders would provoke a pitchedbattle, and had suggested as an alternative that the whole of the yugoslav forces in the Middle East should be transferred to someother theatre.In discussion it was pointed out that those interned included a number of the best officers in the Yugoslav forces and, so faras was known, their only offence consisted in showing theirresentment at the appointment of an incompetent officer as commander-in-Chief. Our own officers on the spot evidently feltconsiderable sympathy for these men, and it seemed that their view was shared by the Minister of State. The continuance ofthis dispute was a grave embarrassment to our military authoritiesin the Middle East; and there was much to be said for relievingour authorities there of a difficult problem by transferring thewmole of the Yugoslav forces to some other and less active theatre of war.On the other hand, it was suggested that some of the ring-leaders were unreliable and had been associated with the party which had advocated capitulation when Germany had firstattacked Yugoslavia. Any undue support of them would be likelyto undermine the position of the new Yugoslav Government. Inany event the only principle which we could follow was tosupport the recognised Allied Government in their right to appoint a person of their choice to command their forces and to exactobdedience to his orders. .-,
Madagascar.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 63rdConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(W.P. (42) 242) covering copies of telegrams regarding thepossibility of reaching a modus vivendi with the Vichy authoritiesin Madagascar.The Prime Minister said that he was most anxious toavoid locking up in Madagascar troops which were urgently required in other theatres, and on this account he would welcomesome satisfactory arrangement with the French authorities in the island. The overtures made through Mr. Barnett had seemed atfirst sight to hold promise of a satisfactory solution; but it now appeared that they had not been authorised by the Governmentof the Island. He thought that these negotiations could not becontinued until we knew more of the attitude of the french authorities in the Island. Field Marshal Smuts&apos;s views should alsobe obtained before any further approach was made to the French.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that General Platt should be instructed to proceed at once to Madagascar and, after reviewing thesituation there, to go on with General Sturges to discussthe position with Field Marshal Smuts.(2) Invited the Prime Minister, meanwhile, to send a further telegram to Field Marshal Smuts explaining more fullyour reasons for wishing to reduce to the minimum our continuing military commitments in Madagascar, andinforming him that Generals Platt and Sturges were on their way to discuss the position with him. It mightbe made clear in this telegram that, if we had been satisfied that the overtures made by Mr. Barnett hadbeen prompted by the French authorities in the Island,we should have been disposed to regard them as offeringthe basis of a satisfactory settlement.The Foreign Secretary handed round copies of the draft ofa telegram which he proposed to send to the Minister of Stateinviting him to reconsider the position, in view of the political difficulties which would otherwise arise between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Yugoslav Government.The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) It was essential that the Yugoslav Government should be supported in maintaining discipline &quot;among their own forces, and we must be ready to use force, if necessary,for this purpose.(2) In accordance with (1), the Foreign Secretary was invitedto adopt a somewhat stronger line than that set outin his draft telegram to the Minister of State.(3) While no definite decision was reached as to the mannerin which the dispute should be settled, it might be suggested to the Minister of State that, if he still feltdifficulties about accepting the scheme proposed in telegram 1147 of the 30th May, he should arrange forall the 300 Yugoslavs now interned in Egypt to be sentto this country.
The Allies. 8.   The War  Cabinet had before them a  statement byMorale of Allied the Security Control Officer, Glasgow (W,P. (42) 234) reportingSeamen.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 25thConclusions,Minute 3.)a decline in the morale of Allied seamen, due in part to the absenceof news of their families, but also to the impressions of Britain&apos;swar effort to be formed in the docks, where laziness and disorderlyconduct were alleged to be rife.The Minister of War Transport said that this Paper did not give a true picture of the position. He was satisfied that, on thewhole, the dockers were working well. This was borne out bythe improvements in turn-round which had been effected. TheSecretary of State for Scotland, who had made some inquiries inthis matter, was also satisfied that the statements in the Papercould not be substantiated.The War Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to make someinquiries of the organisation responsible for this report,and as to the sources of information relied on in itscompilation.youth organisations.Conditions ofGovernmentAssistance.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 121stConclusions,Minute 1.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council (W.P. (42) 240) in which itwas stated that one of the principles governing the attitude of departments was that no grant of public money, or other formsof assistance should be afforded to organisations connected witha political party. What attitude should be adopted, therefore, tosuch organisations as the &quot; Anglo-Soviet Youth FriendshipAlliance&quot; and the &quot;International Youth Council,&quot; which werenot connected with any political party, and whose avowed objectswere unobjectionable, but some of whose members were believed tohave connexions with the Communist Party? &apos;       ,The Lord President recommended that the test should be whether or not the organisation was in practice controlled,or materially influenced or directed by a political party, or wasbeing run to serve the interests of a political party. To withholdassistance from organisations of the kind mentioned would onlyencourage them to seek from the Communist Party that guidance and assistance which they were denied by the Government.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals set out in this Memorandum, and invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange forthe necessary instructions to be given to the Departmentsconcerned.Reconstruction.ProposedAdvisoryCouncil onWelshReconstructionProblems.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Paymaster-General (W.P. (42) 238).The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the establishment of an Advisory Council onWelsh Reconstruction Problems, to work in co-operationwith the Paymaster-General&apos;s Office, with the following terms of reference&quot;To survey, in conformity with the generalexamination of reconstruction problems now being conducted by the Government, those problems of reconstruction which are of special application tcWales and Monmouthshire, and to advise on them.&quot;(2) Agreed to the arrangements proposed by the paymaster general for setting iip the Council.
West Africa. 12.   The. Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet thatAppointment of Lord Swinton had been offered, and had accepted, the post of minister Minister Resident in West Africa.    The appointment would beResident. announced on the following day.(Previous The   terms  of   the   Directive  to  the  Minister  ResidentReference: (W.P. (42) 245) drawn up in consultation with the DepartmentsW.M. (42) 64th concerned, were read to the War Cabinet.Conclusions, The War Cabinet took note of these arrangements.Minute 3.) toGreat George Street, S.W. 1.June 8, 1942.Ethiopia. 11.   The Foreign Secretary referred to telegram No. 775Number of from the Minister of State, Cairo, recommending that thereItalian Civilians should be no alteration in the decision, which had alreadyto be retained, been conveyed to the Emperor, that he should not be allowed to(Previous . retain more than 500 Italians, plus a reasonable number ofEeference: &apos; dependants. The Minister recommended, however, that a numberW.M. (42) 7lst of Italians should be retained, e.g., for transport services, and for conclusions, the British Mission, over and above this number. The total numberMinute 2.) of Italians retained would thus amount to not far short of 1,000,plus dependants.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of thissuggestion.
