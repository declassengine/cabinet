Future The War Cabinet had a discussion on operational matters,Operations. which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet(Previous       Conclusions.reference:. W.M. (42) 60thConclusion.)Parliament.SelectCommitteeon national expenditure.The AirborneDivision.(previous reference :W.M. (42) 9thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that the Fighting ServicesSub-Committee of the Select Committee on National Expenditurehad visited the Airborne Division, where they had asked questionsof the General Officer Commanding and also of the Deputy Directorof Staff Duties (Air), War Office. On their return they had asked that the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Army Co-operationCommand, should give evidence on Thursday, the 11th June, inregard to the supply of gliders and the training of pilots. Thequestion had been raised whether this matter was within theCommittee&apos;s terms of reference. Apart from this point, obection had been seen to the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief givingevidence before the Committee, and provisional arrangements had therefore been made for the attendance of other witnesses from theAir Ministry and Ministry of Aircraft Production. Later, on thePrime Minister&apos;s instructions, the Committee had been informedthat, since the evidence seemed likely to touch on operationalmatters, the Ministers concerned wished to have an opportunity ofgiving further consideration to the question in all its bearingsbefore further evidence was tendered. The arrangements forhearing witnesses from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of aircraft Production had accordingly been postponed.In discussion, the view was expressed that the Select Committeehad for some time past been dealing with matters which wentbeyond their terms of reference. While, of course, almost all matters had some financial implications, it had never been intended that theCommittee should pursue enquiries into questions which had onlya remote bearing on economical administration but involved opera-tional questions and policy.The Minister of Aircraft Production informed the WarCabinet that in a recent Report the Committee had drawn a comparison between two of the factories engaged on aircraft pro-duction in terms very unfavourable to one of the two factories. TheCommittee had shown the greatest reluctance to inform him whichthese two factories were, in order that he might be able to remedymatters, on the ground that the evidence heard was privileged.The War Cabinet agreed as follows :-(1) A communication should be sent to the Committee to theeffect that the supply of gliders and training of pilotsfor the Airborne Division were regarded as mainlyoperational matters in which issues of policy were involved, and, accordingly, as falling outside theCommittee&apos;s terms of reference.(2) The Chancellor of the Exchequer was asked to arrange fora reply to be drafted on these lines, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Air and the Secretary of Statefor War; this reply should be agreed with the lord privy Seal before despatch.(3) While the reply should be sent from the Departmentsinvited to give evidence, it should be made clear that the reply represented a decision reached after considerationby His Majesty&apos;s Government.Great George Street, S.W.June 11, 1942.
