The Chiefs of Staff reported the main events of the past week.On the previous night we had raided Italy, for the first timefor several months. Bombers which had been prevented by adverse weather conditions from reaching their primary objective at Genoahad been diverted to Turin, where the earlier&apos;arrivals found thatthe black-out had been relaxed.A daylight attack on Hazebrouck on the previous day had met with heavy opposition. Twenty-one squadrons of Spitfires,escorting 9 Bostons, had encountered about 190 enemy fighters.Four had been destroyed, 4 probably destroyed and 10 damaged; butwe had lost 15 Spitfires (4 pilots safe) and 1 Boston.In Malta enenvy bombing had been less accurate or moreindiscriminate, and widespread damage had been done to buildings.Our defences continued, however, to inflict heavy losses on theenemy.In Burma the American Volunteer Group had again been inaction and had inflicted heavy losses on Japanese air forces whichbad previously raided Mandalay.Allied shipping losses during the week had amounted to fiftyships, totalling 265,000 tons. Losses in the North Atlantic had been particularly heavy and might account for as much as 190.000 tons.Of the convoy returning from Russia, one ship had been sunk by air action and two by U-boat.The Prime Minister thought it was important that we shouldmake the Russian Government realise the extent of the risks whichwere being run, and the efforts which were being made, in main-taining the northern supply route to Russia.It was agreed that the Foreign Secretary should make represen-tations, through the diplomatic channel, explaining the seriousness of the risks which we were running, and the importance of thefullest co-operation from the Russian air and naval forces in theprotection of the convoys.The Prime Minister undertook to send a telegram in the same sense to M. Stalin.The First Lord of the Admiralty was asked to supply material for these communications to the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary.On the Burma front our forces and those of the Chinese were now occupying positions somewhat further back from those held aweek earlier.In Libya the enemy, after advancing in three columns, had nowshown a tendency to withdraw his forces again.There was little change on the Russian front.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
Relations 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thebetwean.Russia bomb explosion that had taken place at Angora threatened to,make and Turkey.relations difficult between Russia..and Turkey. The Russians were convinced that the explosion had been due to German instigationand should be handled on tfiis, basis. They had accordingly askedfor the release of the two Russians who, had been arrested. this request had probably been ill-judged, for it was. impossible for theTurks to take such action. The Russians had then issued astrongly-worded communique. The Foreign Secretary said that hewas taking such action as was in his power to ease matters between turkey arid Russia; but the situation was somewhat disquieting.&apos;        The War Cabinet took note-of1 this statement&apos;.-&quot;Great Georae Street, S. W. 1,April 13, 1942.
