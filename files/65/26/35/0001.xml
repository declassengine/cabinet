Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (42) 72ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.Libya.Pacific.India.naval operations.Malta Convoy.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Libya.Russia.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.In the home theatre bad weather had restricted the operations of Bomber Command. Since the 1st May an increased number of mines had been laid and some 80,000 tons of enemy shipping sunk or damaged.Coastal Command had made eight attacks on U-boats. one had been sunk; another had put in to El Ferrol for repairs; whileattacks on two others had been promising.Total enemy losses for the week had amounted to 12 machinesfor certain and 7 probably, with 18 damaged. Our total losses hadbeen 23 bombers, 8 fighters and 3 aircraft of Coastal Command.Beauforts operating from Malta had claimed 3 hits on 2 enemybattleships.  The enemy had lost 10 machines to 3 of our own.There had been heavy air fighting in the Libyan battle, where we possessed some degree of air superiority. The enemy had lost33 machines to 29 of our own.There had been indications of the movement of considerableJapanese air forces northwards.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to communicate withGeneral Wavell regarding the types of aircraft now being received in India.Details were given of the two convoys, one from gibraltar and the other from the Eastern Mediterranean, which were endeavouring to reach Malta.Allied shipping losses in the previous seven days amounted to225,000 tons.Details were given of the battle proceeding in Libya. After theevacuation of the Knightsbridge area our forces were taking up theline Acroma-El Adem.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to furnish the Prime Minister with particulars regarding the training of the10th Armoured Division.The Germans had started a definite offensive in the Kharkovarea and claimed to have crossed the Donetz River. The Russiansclaimed to have knocked out 250 German tanks.There were indications of a German offensive in the Kursksector.The Germans appeared to be suffering heavy casualties in their attck on Sebastopol.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Policy.Retaliation forGermandestruction ofLidice.-(previous reference:W.M. (42) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2.)2. Reference was made to the action of the Germans indestroying the whole of the village of Lidice in Czechoslovakia, themen being killed and the women and children taken away. Thequestion was raised whether, as an act of counter-retaliation, weshould destroy a number of German villages by air attack.The main point made in discussion was that such action couldonly be carried out effectively by a considerable number of aero-planes, on a clear moonlight night. Action on the lines suggested would therefore mean the use of forces which would otherwise beemployed against objectives of greater importance.The War Cabinet decided that this suggestion should notbe followed up.[23968] b 2
India.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 68thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Secretary of State for India informed the War Cabinetthat the Viceroy was becoming increasingly convinced that Gandhiwas meditating a line of action which would cause serious inter-ference with the war effort in India. The Secretary of state proposed to circulate an appreciation of the position so that theWar Cabinet might consider, at an early date, what guidance couldbe given to the Viceroy regarding the action which he should takewhen it became clear that Gandhi was about to stir up serious trouble.In discussion, it was emphasised that quick and decisive action should be taken as soon as it was clear that Gandhi&apos;s activities mustbe repressed.The War Cabinet took note that the Secretary of State forIndia would circulate a memorandum on this point forconsideration at an early date.Middle East.Levant-CaspianFront.Co-operationwith theRussians.(previous reference:W.M. (42).25thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChiefs of Staff (W.P. (42) 253) proposing that, in view of the improved atmosphere created by the signature of the Anglo-RussianTreaty and by M. Molotov&apos;s visit, further efforts should now bemade to secure Russian co-operation in defensive preparations onthe Levant-Caspian front. If the Russians were still unwilling tohold staff talks on a high level covering all problems in the Caucasusand Middle East areas, we might at least ask for certain specificfacilities to carry out reconnaissances and defensive preparationsin Northern Persia as enumerated in paragraph 5 of theMemorandum.In discussion, reference was made to the difficulty of pressing on the Russians a request which they might take to imply a lack ofconfidence in their military power. Our military authorities in persia had also made the situation more difficult by sending officersinto territory within Russian jurisdiction without seeking the permission of the Russian authorities.The Foreign Secretary said that, while for these reasons hecould hold out no expectation of a satisfactory outcome, he was prepared to arrange for negotiations on this question to be openedthrough General Isayev, who was now in this country.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChiefs of Staff, to explore the possibility of arranging for Anglo-Russian Staff talks on common problems ofdefence in the Caucasus and Middle East areas, or,failing that, for specific facilities for reconnaissance, &amp;c,as set out in paragraph 5 of W.P. (42) 253.(2) Asked the Chiefs of Staff to make it clear, in replying toGeneral Auchinleck&apos;s telegram, that while these negotia-tions,were proceeding no independent action should betaken by the military authorities to obtain the informa-tion they required by means not authorised by theRussian military authorities.
Home Front.Publicity Policy.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 49thConclusions,Minute 1.)(previous reference:W.M. (42) 70thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Ministerof Information (W.P. (42) 250) the first of a aeries of periodical reports which the Minister proposed to submit, to keep the WarCabinet informed of any major movements of public feeling andtheir relations to questions of publicity on the Home Front.The following were the main points in the Memorandum : . (a) Attention was drawn to the rising tide of optimism aboutthe war; this should be allowed to run its course and ministers should confine themselves to avoiding any public statements likely to reinforce it.(b) It should be a major publicity aim of the Government toemphasise the magnitude of our contribution to the war effort in fighting, resources, personnel, civil adjustmentand, above all, production.(c) The proposed publicity campaign for voluntary economy in fuel consumption needed careful handling. The minister proposed to concert a joint campaign with the Ministerof Fuel and Power.In discussion, reference was made to the great significanceattached in certain quarters to the statement about the creation ofa Second Front in 1942, which had been included in the official announcement regarding the Anglo-Russian Treaty. It was agreedthat Ministers should avoid references to this subject in their public speeches, in view of the importance of avoiding any disclosure of future military operations.The War Cabinet took note of this appreciation of thestate of public feeling, and approved the specific recom-mendations made in the Ministers Memorandum.The Colonies. 6.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumReorganisation by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (42) 249) giving theof the Colonial   outline of a scheme for the reorganisation of the Colonial Service.Service. The Colonial Secretary said that a considerable advance hadalready been made towards unification of the Colonial Services, butthere were three features.of the existing system which militatedagainst further progress in this direction : So long as the salaries of Colonial Civil Servants were paid by the Colonial Governments,the poorer Colonies could not afford the best men, though perhapsthey needed them most. Secondly, while Colonial Governmentscarried the cost, their demands for staff were liable to rapid fluctua-tions according to the level of prosperity in the Colony; and this made it difficult to secure a steady supply of suitably qualifiedrecruits. Thirdly, the efficiency of the Service was suffering from lack of power to insist on the retirement of officers who were nolonger competent to discharge the duties appropriate to their rank.To overcome these difficulties, it was proposed to establish aGeneral List of officers who would be under an obligation to accept any employment in any Colony to which they might be assigned bythe Secretary of State. The conditions of employment for these officers would be determined by the Secretary of State in accordancewith uniform principles and would not be alterable by the vote ofthe Colonial Legislatures. The central feature of the scheme wasthat, by means of a subvention from the Exchequer, it would bepossible to equalise remuneration and prospects throughout thehigher ranks of the Colonial Service, and thus remove the obstaclesnow preventing the Secretary of State from making the best use ofthe available man-power.As a complement to the reorganisation of the higher ranks ofthe Service, measures were also under consideration for providingfuller opportunities for the Colonial peoples themselves to take the
(1)(2)Empress Hall 7.   Reference was made to the Demonstration and PageantDemonstration,  organised by a Joint Committee for Soviet Aid, the National20th Jnne, 1942. Council for British-Soviet Unity, and the Russia To-day Societyto celebrate the anniversary of Russia&apos;s entry into the war.Various questions were raised as to Government participation in this Demonstration.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows :-(1) Having regard to the extent of the support already givento this Demonstration, no objection should be raised toa detachment of Civil Defence workers attending it in uniform.(2) The Prime Minister had been asked to send a message tobe read at the Demonstration. As the Lord Privy Sealwas already attending the Demonstration on behalf ofthe Government, no special message need, therefore, besent by the Prime Minister or by any other Minister.(The Prime Minister would, no doubt, send somemessage to Russia on this occasion, which would be made public. But this message would not be in any wayspecially connected with this Demonstration.)(3) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security was asked to bring before the War Cabinet on some futureoccasion a suggestion put forward by him in discussion,namely, that in future representatives of the services should only attend functions held under the auspices ofthe State or of approved Local Authorities, or inconnection with some well-recognised charitable object.Parliament.Application to members ofParliament ofEegulations eon-trolling traffic to Ireland.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 120thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The War Cabinet were informed that Mr. R. R. Stokes,M.P., had applied to go to Northern Ireland and to Eire on businessprojects. It was proposed that he should be accompanied on his visit to Eire by Mr. A. Bevan, M.P., and Mr. F. J. Bellenger, M.P.,who wished to have discussions with Mr. de Valera on political matters. Broadly speaking, the general rule hitherto had been topermit visits to Eire only where some national advantage would follow.The War Cabinet-Decided that, on balance, these visits should be allowed.If this decision was questioned, it could be differentiatedfrom the decision given in the case of Mr. McGovern,M.P., whose attitude was openly anti-war. Further, itcould be explained that, while no public advantage mightensue from these visits, they were unlikely to result in anyserious impairment of the war effort.Great George Street, S. W. 1,June 15, 1942.greatest possible share in the framing and execution of policy intheir own countries.The War Cabinet Approved in principle the scheme outlined in the appendix to W.P. (42) 249.Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to workout the details of the scheme in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and Colonial Governors.
