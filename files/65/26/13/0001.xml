The War Cabinet had a further discussion on this matter,and reviewed the position reached at the meeting held on the20th April in regard to Vichy representation in Canada.The War Cabinet-Agreed that a telegram should be sent to the PrimeMinister of Canada, informing him that the position hadbeen further reviewed by the War Cabinet in the light ofthe speech made by M. Laval on the 20th April, which hadnot been taken into account when our last communication on this subject to Mr. Mackenzie King had been con-sidered. In all the circumstances, we had reached theconclusion that the right course would be that theCanadian Government should now ask that the Vichyrepresentative in Canada should be recalled, and diplo-matic relations broken off.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook tosupply the Dominions Secretary with material for a communication on these lines.Malta.(previous reference erence:W.M.

The War Cabinet were given the latest information aboutthe position at Malta, and invited the Minister of State to spendtwo or three days there on his journey to the Middle East, and toreport whether in his view a change of Governor should now bemade.4. The War Cabinet had a short discussion, which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported to theWar Cabinet the results of the discussions which he had had withthe Minister of Production, the Minister of War Transport andthe First Lord of the Admiralty as to the representations whichshould be made to the United States authorities with a view toregulating the sailing from America of ships bound for Eussia, andto ensuring that, so long as present conditions lasted, these shipscarried only high-priority supplies.The Foreign Secretary said that the Admiralty had reachedthe conclusion that the present cycle of convoys would have to bereduced, and that the utmost which could be managed was threeconvoys in two months. The number of ships in each convoy mustbe restricted to twenty-five.It had also been agreed that a request should be made, at avery high level, for increased Russian assistance in the defence ofthe convoys.As a result, in part, of a number of ships in the last convoyhaving had to turn back, there was a serious congestion of ships in iceland. Two measures were proposed in order to deal with this situation : First, it was proposed that a considerable number ofUnited. States ships now in Iceland should be brought to thiscountry, discharged, and the high-priority goods restowed, so as toensure the greatest volume of such goods on the smallest number of
ships. This would ensure a considerable economy in shipping.Secondly, it was necessary that the flow of ships from north america should be slowed down until the accumulation in Icelandwaters had been worked off. It would be necessary to ask theconsent of the United States Government to both these measures.It would be necessary to explain to the U.S.S.R. authorities the reasons for the above measures. It would also be necessary toexplain to the workers in the ports the reasons why vessels whichhad sailed from North America, loaded with goods for Russia,would have to be discharged in this country as a preliminary torestowage of the high-priority goods.In conclusion, the Foreign Secretary pointed out that our ownshipments of tanks, aircraft and other high-priority material would,if properly stowed, occupy not more than twenty-four ships every two months. This would leave fifty-one ships, which should suffice to take all the Protocol commitments from the United States withan ample margin.The War Cabinet- *(1) Approved the proposal that convoys should continue at therate proposed by the Admiralty.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for communica-tions to be made to the U.S.S.R. and United states authorities on the lines proposed.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange with the Ministerof Information for suitable measures to be taken(probably by the issue of a &quot;D&quot; Notice) to avoid anymention in the Press of the discharge in this country of cargoes from North America destined for Russia.(4) Invited the Minister of War Transport to let the Ministerof Labour know at which ports this discharge andrestowage would take place, in order that the minister might arrange for suitable communications to be madeto the dock workers at these ports.Great George Street, S.W. 1,April 24, 1942.
