7W.M. 56 (12).Dr. H. Y. Evatt. l. The Prime Minister welcomed Dr. H. V. Evatt, who had just arrived in this country as the accredited representative of theGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia.Dr. Evatt said that he brought with him the good wishes of hisGovernment and Prime Minister, whose one object was to work together, in co-operation with His Majesty&apos;s Government in thiscountry and with the. Governments of all the United Nations, to prosecute the war to a successful conclusion. In the course of * ageneral appreciation of the views of the Commonwealth Govern-ment, he said that, while the position had improved, his Governmentwas not yet satisfied with the state of Australia&apos;s preparedness. Inthe light of a reassessment of the general strategic situation, there might be good grounds for strengthening the forces available for thedefence of Australia. If early reinforcements could be sent(particularly aircraft), the Japanese might be deterred from making an attack which, if it came, would compel us to divert much largerforces from other theatres.Dr. Evatt added that his Government wished it to be clear thatthe&apos;arrangements by which the United States authorities had under-taken operational responsibility for the defence of Australia didnot affect in any way the position of Australians as members of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations with a common allegiance toHis Majesty The King.The Prime Minister expressed the War Cabinefs appreciation of the message of goodwill which Dr. Evatt had brought from theCommonwealth Government. We did not, of course, regardourselves as in any way relieved of our responsibility to do all inour power to defend our kith and kin in Australia,.As regards the arrangements for the supply of men and equip-ment for the defence of Australia, he was most anxious that dr. Evatt should enquire into these matters in detail in consultationwith the competent authorities here. He would be accorded thefullest facilities for this purpose; and if, after these discussions,there were matters which he thought required further review, he(the Prime Minister) would give them his personal attention.Defence ofAustralia,Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 53rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations,Home theatre.Malta.2.

In connection with Minute 2, attention was drawn to a speech in which Mr. McGovern, M.P., was reported to have saidthat it had been announced that our shipping losses had recentlyexceeded 800,000 tons a month. This statement might be a reference to the Prime Ministers speech in a recent Secret Session,in which event a breach of privilege might be involved.The War Cabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider this matter in consultation with the appropriate authorities.Shipping Losses. 4. In connection with the discussion recorded in Minute 2,Tankers. the Prime Minister drew attention to the loss of two tankers offTrinidad, and asked to what extent the sailing of tankers from america had been resumed since the recent decision to suspend this traffic.The Minister of War Transport explained that the suspension of this traffic had not been complete. Some tankers must continueto be put in to certain points where stocks were insufficient to meetessential needs, and, while these vessels were routed in such a way as to take advantage of any available convoy protection, they hadto make some part of their journey without protection. These wererisks which must be accepted if our immediate essential needs wereto be met.The position would be eased considerably if a small shuttleconvoy could be provided between Trinidad and Aruba. This was now under consideration by the Admiralty.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids.Damage and casualties.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2.)5.

It was suggested that it might take the formof a statement to be made in Parliament on Thursday,the 7th May.    *Parliament. 7.
