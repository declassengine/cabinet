Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 47thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Operations.Augsburg.Malta.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.221 W.M. SO (42).1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the main events of the past week.In the air, the outstanding event had been the. daylight attackmade by 12 Lancasters on the Diesel Engine Factory at Augsburg.Our losses over the target (3 aircraft) had not been greater thananticipated; but we had been unlucky to lose the four which hadbeen shot down by fighters near Paris. It had been hoped that thediversions which had been arranged would have enabled our bombers to slip through without serious fighter opposition over France.The War Cabinet expressed their admiration for the courageand determination with which this daring attack had been pressedhome. The success of this raid might stimulate the enemy toattempt similar attacks on vital targets in this country, for whichwe must be prepared.The air offensive against Malta, though still severe, had been rather less intense during the last week. We had continued to inflict heavy losses on the attackers, and we had been able to put inreinforcements of fighter aircraft.Allied shipping losses for the week totalled 236,000 tons. Ofthis, however, about 100,000 tons represented belated reports of losses sustained during the first two weeks of the month. A largeproportion of the sinkings were still occurring off the north-east coast of America.On the Burma front there had been no great change.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was asked toascertain the present effective strength of the british forces under General Alexanders command.There had been little change in Libya and on the Russian front.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Supplies to 2.

These convoys now involved a substantialnaval operation; and it was necessary that the American authoritiesshould realise that it was the number of ships for which escortscould be provided, rather than the capacity of the ports, whichdetermined the volume of supplies which could be sent to Russia.Further, the Americans were reported to be sending ships loaded with cargoes not of the first priority.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to consult with the Ministerof Production and the First Lord of the Admiralty as tothe representations which should be made to the UnitedStates authorities, with a view to regulating the sailing from America of ships bound for Russia, and of ensuring that, so long as present conditions lasted, these shipscarried only high-priority supplies.

(41) 122ndConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The War Cabinet had a general discussion of the probablepolicy of the reconstituted Vichy Government.The Foreign Secretary said that it was too early to determine the precise significance of the restoration of M. Laval, but it was probably in part due to German anxiety about the internal situationin France. It was also possible that the G ermans intended to make some use of Laval, and through him of French resources, inconnection with their spring campaigns.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs raised thequestion of Vichy Ministers accredited to Dominion Governments,dealt with in his Memorandum (W.P. (42) 169). Field-marshal smuts would like to ask the Vichy Minister in South Africa toleave. The United States Government had indicated their wish that the Vichy representative in Canada should not be invited toleave for the time being, and that any such request should be timedto coincide with similar action at Washington.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Prime Minister of Canada should be informed that wenoted that the Canadian Government were in touch withWashington, and that we should quite understand ifthe Canadian Government did not wish to take any action which might run counter to the suggestion ofMr. Sumner Welles. In the circumstances, we should agree if they thought that the best course would be forthe Vichy Minister to be allowed to remain for thepresent, until the position became clearer.(2) Field-Marshal Smuts should be informed of the policy being pursued by the United States and by Canada. At thesame time, we saw no objection to the Union Govern-ment asking for the recall of the Vichy representative in South Africa, whose activities had been open tosuspicion.(3) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was asked tcarrange for the despatch of communications on theselines, in consultation with the Foreign Office.Burma.evacuation of Befugees4. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by theSecretary of State for Burma (W.P. (42) 160 and 162).The Secretary of State for Burma said that, in view of the difficult situation, he thought that consideration should be given tothe question whether a further appeal should be made to theUnited States authorities, on humanitarian grounds, to maketransport aircraft available for the transfer of Indian refugees from Burma.After a short discussion, in which it was pointed out that theUnited States authorities might take exception if asked to deal withrequests for aircraft from more than one British GovernmentDepartment, and that many weeks must elapse before such aircraft could reach Burma, the War Cabinet Decided against taking action on the lines proposed.
223 W.M. 50 (42).United States of       5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumAmerica. by the Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of/Jurisdiction      State for Scotland (W.P. (42) 151) recommending- ,   .&apos;ioTunfted states W That the United States Service Tribunals in this country,&apos;A   ^Forces should be allowed to deal with all offences committed by. rm^ Un^tedS tne American Forces in the United Kingdom, whetherm.   , or not these offences were committed on duty.mg om&quot; (&amp;) That effect should be given to (a) by means of legislationrequiring all American Service offenders to be handedover to the American authorities, and providing that,after they had been so handed over, our courts shouldnot have any jurisdiction over them,(c) That, if (&amp;) were approved, an attempt should be made tosecure reciprocity from the United States in respect ofBritish Service personnel in American territory, butthat this should not be made a sine qua non.The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed that United States Service Tribunals in thiscountry should be allowed to deal with all offences com-mitted by American forces in the United Kingdom, onthe understanding that this was limited to offences against the Criminal Law, and did not confer anyimmunity from the ordinary processes of Civil Law.(ii) Agreed that effect should be given to this decision bymeans of legislation, and not by a gentleman&apos;s agreement.(iii) Decided that it would be inappropriate to attempt tosecure reciprocity in this matter from the United states in respect of British Service personnel in Americanterritory.(iv) Asked the Lord Chancellor to supervise the arrangementsfor drafting the Bill,(v) Agreed that the Bill should be a Lord Chancellors Bill,and recorded the view that it might be appropriate thatit should be first introduced in the House of Lords,(vi) Agreed in principle to the making of the proposed Orderin Council applying the Allied Forces Act to the UnitedStates Service authorities in this country, in order to regularise the exercise of jurisdiction by United StatesCourts-Martial, and to authorise British Civil andMilitary authorities to co-operate to this end.(vii) Agreed that the Order in Council appended to W.P.(42) 151 could be made forthwith, subject to examination by the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers, who would report their views to the Lord President of the Council.Joint Planning 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a draft White PaperOrganisation.     describing the existing organisation for Joint Planning.General agreement was expressed with the view that the pre-sentation to Parliament of a White Paper on the lines of the draftwould serve a useful purpose.Some general discussion took place on the points raised inrecent articles and speeches in regard to the organisation for thedirection of the war; in particular, the proposal for a &quot; GreatGeneral Staff.&quot;The following points were made in discussion of the draft: (a) A sentence should be inserted at the beginning of the white paper to make it clear that the ultimate responsibilityfor action in war must always rest with the responsible
Ministers, and that the White Paper dealt only withthe staffs responsible for joint planning under the WarCabinet and the Defence Committee.(b) Paragraph 5. Rather more importance might be given tothe Political Warfare Executive, and the last two words(&quot; whenever necessary &quot;) should be omitted.(c) A reference should be included to the arrangements forliaison with the Dominions.The Prime Minister undertook to give further considera-tion to the terms of the draft White Paper in the light ofthe points raised in discussion.Great George Street, S. W. 1,April 20, 1942.
