Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 68th&apos;Conclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Libya.naval operations.Shipping Losses.Australia.MilitaryOperations.Libya.Russia.Supplies toRussia.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 69thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet were given particulars of the latestconvoy to Russia. Of 35 ships in the convoy, 27 had reached port.During attacks on the convoy, at least two enemy aircraft had been destroyed by two Hurricane aircraft, catapulted from ships in the convoy. Of the two pilots of these Hurricane aircraft, one had been killed and the other injured. Four U-boats had also probably been damaged.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.China.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 13thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that he had had a discussionwith the Chinese Ambassador, the record of which would be circulated.Three main points had arisen from the interview: The first was that there was some risk that the Chinese would think that wewere not as interested in fighting the Japanese as we were in fighting the Germans. He thought it would be of the greatestassistance if the Prime Minister would see Dr. Wellington Koo anddisabuse him of this view. In this connection it was pointed outthat the position of Australia afforded one very potent reason why we could not afford to ignore the Japanese menace.The Prime Minister said that he would see Dr. Wellington Koo.The second point was that the Foreign Secretary thought thatit might help to a better understanding of our position by China ifDr. Wellington Koo were now to return to China on a visit.[23900]b 21. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.In the Home Theatre during the past six days the weather hadbeen bad, except for two nights, on which the Gnome and Rhoneworks and Cologne had been bombed. The photographs of the raidon the Gnome and Rhone works showed good results. There was little to add to the statements in the Press about the raid onCologne by over 1,000 bombers.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been informed by theRussian Ambassador that the raid had had a very good moral effect in Russia. It was clear that, if these very large raids could be repeated periodically, this would have more effect on our Allies thana sustained effort on a lower scale.Coastal Command had made two night attacks on convoys offthe Dutch coast, hitting 17 ships, 6 of which were set on fire. AU-boat had been attacked in the Bay of Biscay.During the previous six days Bomber Command had lost51 aircraft, Fighter Command 12 and Coastal Command 13. enemy losses amounted to 26 machines certain, 7 probable and 29 damaged.In the Libya battle now in progress we had lost 31 machines and the enemy 32.Allied shipping losses for the previous seven days amounted to165,000 tons. This figure included the ships lost in the outward-bound Russian convoy.Three Japanese midget submarines had succeeded in enteringSydney Harbour.  One small depot ship had been sunk.Details were given of the battle proceeding in Libya. Theenemy was now endeavouring to withdraw through two gaps in ourminefields. Although it was early to form a judgment, thesituation appeared to be satisfactory.The situation on the Russian Front was somewhat obscure, butGerman attacks around Kharkov appeared to have ceased.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
Loans from theUnited Statesand GreatBritain.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)The third point concerned the loans which we and the UnitedStates had made to China. He thought that the Chinese nowrecognised that our position in regard to these loans was different from that of the United States. But the public statements whichhad been made on the matter in China had given rise to a somewhatawkward situation. The Foreign Secretary thought the best coursewould be that he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should firstdiscuss the matter, and that they should then see Dr. WellingtonKoo together.Mention was also made of the fact that certain R.A.F. groundpersonnel had retreated into China with the Chinese troops. this had raised hopes that we intended to send R.A.F. units into China.The transport difficulties in the way of this course were explained.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 56thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat the main event of the past week had been the attack onCanterbury the previous, night. There had been considerable damage to the business part of the city. A number of fires had been started, but were now under control. The casualties so far reportedwere 22 killed and 50 seriously injured, but these figures might wellbe increased later.  Some damage had been done to the Cathedral.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.reconstruction problems.Functions of thechairman of theCommittee.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 205).This Memorandum dealt with the question whether the Pay-master- General&apos;s functions, as Chairman of the Committee on reconstruction Problems, should extend to the study of such matters as armistice terms, measures of control to prevent clandestinerearmament, and other military issues which would affect our policyafter the war.The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office hadalready given some consideration to the problems of military administration in devastated areas in the wake of an advancingarmy. He assumed that the proposal before the Cabinet would besubject to discussion between Ministers as regards the-scope.of thefunctions to be undertaken by the staff under the Paymaster-General.  This was agreed to.The point was also made that the duties of the Paymaster-General and his staff were to carry out enquiries in broad outline,and to co-ordinate the preparatory work now in progress in Depart-ments, and that there was no intention that he should assume responsibility for any functions performed by Departments.The War Cabinet agreed that the Paymaster-general should be authorised, in concert with the Service ministers and Chiefs of Staff, to make such arrangements as&apos; they saw fit to ensure that the information which already existed should be properly sifted and presented in such a form as would assist those responsible for deciding policy,Ministers and Service Chiefs alike, when the time for doing so arrived.
The Press.The daily worker.(previous reference erence:W:M. (41) 72ndConclusions,Minute 6.)Food.Milk MarketingandDistribution.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 12thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (W.P. (42) 230).The discussion and Conclusions are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Food (W.P. (42) 228) covering the draft of a white paper on the marketing and distribution of milk. The scheme outlined in the White Paper was designed to enable the Ministryof Food to guarantee supplies of milk to the priority classes and alsoto secure economies in the man-power and transport used in milkdistribution.The essence of the scheme was that existing contracts betweenthe milk producers and distributors would be cancelled; theMinistry would become momentarily the owner of all milk (exceptthat used by producer retailers for their own businesses) and woulddirect its distribution.The scheme had the support both of the agricultural interests concerned and also of various sections of the distributive trade. Ithad been approved by the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (42)32nd Meeting, Minute 2).The War Cabinet approved the terms of the draft white paper and took note that it would be presented to Parlia-ment forthwith.Coal Production. 8. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the PresidentFuel Rationing, of the Board of Trade (W.P. (42) 231 (Revise)) covering the draft(Previous of a White Paper containing a statement of the Government&apos;reference: policy for increasing the production, and restricting the consump-W.M. (42 ) 69th tion, of coal, as approved by the War Cabinet at their meeting on conclusions,      the 29th May.Minute 1.) The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft White Paper in principle.(2) Invited the Lord President and the President of the Boardof Trade to consider certain drafting points which hadbeen raised in the discussion and to settle the final termsof the draft.(3) Took note that the Lord Privy Seal would announce in theHouse of Commons the following day that the white paper would be placed in the Vote Office during the afternoon of Wednesday, the 3rd June, and thatarrangements would be made for a debate to take place during the following week. Two days would be allowed for the debate, which would take place on a government motion inviting the House to approve the proposals outlined in the White Paper.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 1, 1942.

MOST SECRET. -bPLIES TOJSSIA.*evioussrence:^.(42) 69thnelusions,nute 2.)ee also.0.S.(42)66th Meeting,st June, 1942,inut e 3 .)NO CIRCULATION.W.M. (42) 70th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Monday, 1st june 19421 6.0 p.m.THE PRIME MINISTER said that owing to anotheroperation, not specified to the War Cabinet (the relief of Malta), it would be necessary to postpone the nextconvoy to Russia for ten days or a fortnight.   He thoughtthat the question of getting extra air support to accompany the convoy should be considered.THE CHIEF OP THE NAVAL STAFF said that the postpone-ment for ten days or a fortnight would still make it possible for us to adhere to the schedule of three convoysin two months.   We simply could not provide escortssimultaneously for the Russian convoy and the Malta convoy.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that if the convoy wasto be postponed, it would help matters very much if wecould send some additional tanks over and above the normalquota.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that if the convoy was postponed he might be able to make availablesome additional A.22&apos;s.THE PRIME MINISTER said   that a definite decision should be taken to postpone the next convoy by ten days or a fortnight, and the Admiralty should hove the necessarylatitude in this matter.   The Secretary of State for war should, report what he could do in the way of making available an additional consignment of A.22&apos;s, and theForeign affairs secretary of State for/$HKK should inform   the SovietGovernment of the decisions which we had reached when we knew, what we could do in the Way of making availablean additional cons ignment of tanks.Great George Street, S.W.I.
