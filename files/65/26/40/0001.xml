Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M; (42) 74thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.Libya.Pacific.naval operations.Malta Convoys.MilitaryOperations.Russia.Libya.1, The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Home Theatre. Weather had restricted bombing operations,but raids on Emden, Osnabruck, Essen and Bonn had been effective.There was evidence that our intensified mine-laying operations had had an appreciable effect on enemy shipping.Of eight attacks on U-boats made by Coastal Command, one had been promising and another possibly successful. Threemerchant vessels had been hit.Fighter Command had carried out two large sweeps overNorthern France. Our attacks on railway engines in this area weretroubling the enemy.Total enemy losses for the week had amounted to 17 machinesfor certain and 2 probable with 17 damaged. Our total losses hadbeen 14 fighters, 25 bombers and 4 aircraft of Coastal Command.Excluding the fighting in support of the recent west-bound convoy, the enemy had lost 21 machines to 15 of our own. Hitsclaimed by Beauforts on 2 Italian battleships and on Italiancruisers had not been confirmed.All available aircraft were now being concentrated in theWestern Desert, where we retained a measure of air superiority.Apart from casualties in the fighting connected with the protectionof the western-bound convoy, the enemy had lost 25 machines to 46of our own.During the Libyan retreat only 5 damaged aircraft had had tobe left on our aerodromes.In the Pacific the enemy had lost 21 machines to*18 of our own.Allied shipping losses in the previous seven days amounted to261,000 tons. In addition, there were belated reports of 14,000 tonssunk in the Far East.In the recent convoy actions the enemy had lost 43 aircraftwhilst attacking the western-bound convoy and 22 whilst attacking the eastern-bound convoy.South-east of Leningrad the Russians had made a number of successful local attacks. In the Kharkov area the Germans hadextended their bridge-head over the Donets River. The Germansappeared to be consolidating their gains in this area. The situation at Sevastopol had deteriorated, and the Germans were now very close to the Bay itself.Information was given of the events culminating in the capture of Tobruk. Full information was not yet available, but the Germanclaim to have captured 25,000 prisoners at Tobruk might well becorrect.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Middle East. 2.   The War Cabinet had a short discussion regarding certainAircraft aircraft reinforcements for the Middle East.   A record of there reinforcements,   discussion and of the conclusion reached is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Air, Raids..Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 72ndConclusions,Minute 2.)[239983. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat some fifty enemy aircraft had attacked Southampton onthe previous night. The damage caused in the dock area had notbeen serious, but a certain amount of residential property had been destroyed.  Casualties had been 14 killed and 29 seriously injured.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.&apos;-2]b 2
Parliament.Statement onMiddle EastSituation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (42) 77thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs indicated thelines of the statement which he proposed to make in the House onthe following day regarding the position in Libya. He proposedto quote textually the statement by the Commanders-in-Chief inthe Middle East, as set out in their telegram to the Chiefs of Staff(CC/66 of the 21st June). He would bring this up to date by stating that, since it was despatched, Tobruk had fallen,, but thatno detailed information was yet available regarding the circum-stances of its capture. He would end by making it clear that thiswas only a phase in the Libyan campaign, that the battle was proceeding, and that we were determined to see that the situation was restored.It was likely that there would be a demand for a full debate onthe situation in the Middle East. He would make it clear that,while the Government would welcome a full and frank discussion,it would be premature to hold such a discussion while the battle was still proceeding.The First Lord of the Admiralty read a draft statement aboutthe two Malta Convoys. This was discussed. It was agreed thatthe statement in the House should be confined to a factual accountof the operations. The draft should also be amended so as &apos;to makeit clear that the losses of merchant vessels in the western convoyhad been considerable, and that the eastern., convoy had turned back for lack of sufficient fuel to complete its journey. This statement,amended in accordance with the suggestions put forward in&apos; discussion, should be made by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs as part of his statement on the position in the Middle East.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the general lines of the proposed statement,subject to the points raised in discussion.(2) Took note that the statement would be made at the end of questions on the following day, with reference to aQuestion which Lord Winterton had already placed onthe Order Paper.(3) Agreed that the Press might be told in advance that sucha statement was to be made.StabilisationPolicy.Effect ofProposedIncrease inMiners&apos; Wages.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 69thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (42) 263) regarding the effecton the Governments stabilisation policy (outlined in the white paper of July 1941, Cmd. 6294) of the proposals made in the Reportof Lord Greene&apos;s&apos; Board of Investigation on the immediate wagesissue in the coal-mining industry.The Lord Presidents Committee had decided that the cost ofthese wage increases should be met by an increase in the pitheadprice of coal; and that steps should be taken to ensure that theincreased cost falling on the domestic consumer would not involve any departure from the undertakings given in July 1941 regardingthe stabilisation of prices.It was explained in the Memorandum that the effect on thecost-of-living index figure was not likely to be more than one point.The undertaking given in July 1941 was that the Government would endeavour, by their stabilisation policy, to prevent the cost-of-living index figure from rising beyond the level which it had then reached.The ceiling thus indicated was about 201, and the latest publishedfigure was 199. The forthcoming increase in coal prices was not likely to raise the index number above 201, but, if signs of a greatermovement developed, the Chancellor proposed to take steps to compensate for this by the grant of a further subsidy, probably on some suitable foodstuff.
In discussion, it was pointed out that the Chancellors Memo-randum might be regarded as contemplating a decrease in the costof some other commodity (corresponding to the increase in the priceof coal) only if this were necessary to prevent the index figure risingabove 201, and that this fell short of the decision reached by theLord Presidents Committee, which had been as follows: &quot; The Chancellor of the Exchequer would take steps toensure that this increase in cost did not involve any departure from the undertaking which he had given in his Budget speech in 1941 as to stabilisation of wages and prices. This wouldmean that the increases, direct and indirect, to the domesticconsumer would have to be counterbalanced by a decrease in thecost of some other commodity or commodities entering into thecost-of-living index. It would be important to select somecommodity or commodities in equally universal consumption.&quot;(L.P. (42) 30th Meeting, Conclusion 4.)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he expected to beasked to make some statement in Parliament regarding the effect ofthese wage increases on the stabilisation policy; and, in preparingthis statement, he would be guided by the decision of the lord presidents Committee.The Minister of Labour and National Service drew attentionto the importance of treating this wages award as an issue for settlement, in the ordinary course, between the two sides of theindustry. It was undesirable that the Government, either by volun-teering information to Parliament about the award or otherwise,should do anything which might create the impression that this wasin any way a Government decision.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of these statements.Great George Street, S. W. 1,June 22, 1942.
