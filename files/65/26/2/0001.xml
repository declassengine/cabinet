OUTWARD   TELEGRAM.From Secretary of State for India, to ViceroyDespatched 00.30 hrs, 3rd April, 1943.OST IMMEDIATE.9:26.     Superintendent Series.SECRET.     Following from Prime Minister for Sir Stafford Cripps.1.     War Cabinet and India Committee this morning consideredy our telegrams 859, 860 and 866S.   We entirely approve yourinviting Azad and Nehru to talk Defence question over with you and Coramander-in-Chief and asking them to state their proposals.We feel however, that we must know what these proposals arebefore you are in any way committed to their acceptance.    I must,as I told you, consult not only the Cabinet but the Ministersabove the line.2.     Cabinet showed itself disinclined to depart from the published text of the Declaration or to go beyond it in any way.It has made our position plain to the world and has won general approval.   We all reached an agreement on it before you started and it represents our final position.The restatement of paragraph (e) together with yourexplanation in paragraph 9 of 859S has made it plain that, aslong as the Coramander-in-Chief retains his position on theViceroy1s Council and as long as his existing control and direction of the defence of India are not in any way weakened,there is no objection in principle to the appointment by theCrown of a new Indian member of the Council to co-operate inthe sphere of military organisation.3.     If Congress leaders have some better way of providingfor Indian association with defence, as safeguarded by you inyour 859S, and if they assure you that subject to this theyare prepared to accept the whole scheme, then some more preciseinterpretation to meet this outstanding point would be worthy of consideration.   But are you satisfied that this is the actualposition?   Up to the present Congress spokesmen appear to havevoided anything which could be constructed as even a conditionalScceptance of the post-war proposal.
