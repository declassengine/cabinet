233W.M. S3 (42).Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference erence:   &apos;W.M. (42) 50thConclusions,Minute 1.)&quot;&apos;Air Operations.Home Theatre.Malta.naval operations.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Burma.1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week. ,The main objectives of Bomber Command had been Cologne andRostock, which had been attacked on four successive nights. Atotal of 1,100 tons of bombs had been dropped during the week, andour losses had been below normal, largely because the targets chieflyattacked did not involve a long flight over Germany. .Fighter Command had flown a total of 4,100 sorties by day and460 by night. Enemy opposition over France continued to be strong,and the Germans seemed to be keeping a number of their bestmachines and pilots for defence in this theatre.The scale of the air attack on Malta, though still severe, hadbeen slightly reduced. In the last few days there had been deliberateattacks on hospitals, both at Malta and in Egypt. In the numberof aircraft destroyed, operations over Malta continued to be morefavourable to us than operations over France. In a period of six weeks we had destroyed 76 aircraft in the home theatre at a costof 75 of our own. In the same period over Malta we had destroyed151 at a cost of 90, including those destroyed on the ground.Allied shipping losses for the week totalled 101,000 tons.On the Burma front there had been little change except on theeast, where preliminary reports indicated that the Japanese had advanced rapidly in the last five days.In Libya, and on the Russian front, there had been no change.There were still no indications of the early resumption of a large-scale offensive&apos; against Russia.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Air Raids. 2.   The War Cabinet were given a detailed report on the raidsDamage and on Bath (on the nights of the 25th/26th and the 26th/27th April)Casualties. and on Exeter (on the nights of the 23rd/24th, 24th/25th and the(Previous 25th/26th April).Reference: At Bath the numbers known to have been killed in the two raidsW.M. (42) 43rd were 148 (which might increase by another 20-30), and the numberConclusions, of injured was estimated at ^200. Damage to houses had been minute 3.)       extensive.   One thousand people bad been evacuated from restcentres in the town to rest centres on the outskirts.  There had beentwenty fires, including one at the City Fire Headquarters.  Therailway station was out of use and the main line trains had been diverted via Badminton.There had been widespread damage to buildings occupied bythe Admiralty, and, in addition, a number of the staff were homeless.The Admiralty were considering whether some part of the staff should be transferred back to London.At Exeter the total casualties for the three raids were 60 killed,21 seriously injured and 36 slightly injured.The Prime Minister asked that Departments should do all theycould to ensure that disproportionate publicity was not given tothese raids. Our attacks on Germany were inflicting much greaterdamage; and it was important to avoid giving the impression thatthe Germans were making full reprisal.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Foreign Affairs.Hitler&apos;s Speech.Supplies toRussia.(previous reference:W.M. (42) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)French west indies.3. The Foreign Secretary promised to circulate to the WarCabinet a considered appreciation of Hitler&apos;s speech to theReichstag. Preliminary examination of the speech suggested thatit reflected some anxiety about morale, not in the Army,, but amongthe civilian population.The Foreign Secretary had seen M. Maisky, who was concerned at the delay resulting from the fact that fifteen ships in the lastconvoy had been forced to turn back by damage from ice. He had explained the position, and, though he had made no promise, had said that it might be possible to arrange for thirty-five ships to sailin the next convoy.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been trying to persuade the United States Government to take a stronger line regardingthe administration in the French islands of Guadeloupe andMartinique.   So far his representations had not been successful.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.naval construction programme.(previous reference:W.M. (41) 118thConclusions.)4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty giving details of the Admiraltyprogramme of new construction for 1942 (W.P. (42) 173).The First Lord of the Admiralty gave a review of the presentposition of the fleet, giving details of the number of ships availablein each main class and the losses sustained.Points raised in discussion were : *(a) In addition to armoured aircraft-carriers, it was proposedto order four &apos;&apos; intermediate &apos;&apos; carriers in 1942. It wassuggested that it might be possible to obtain some assistance from the United States, where there were under construction twenty carriers and eighty auxiliarycarriers. As our carriers were more often at risk, theUnited States might be asked to undertake to replacefrom their new construction the next two or threecarriers which we lost.(b) The latest specifications for Tank-Landing Craft wouldmean that it would take materially longer to build thelarge numbers required. Efforts should be made toevolve a simpler standard design, which eliminated allnon-essentials and would lend itself to mass-productionmethods. If this were done, the work could be spreadmore widely, use could be made of yards (e.g., in the thames and the Severn) not now in use for shipbuilding,and labour could be more easily provided, e.g., from menwho were to be released from the Civil Defence Services.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the programme submitted in W.P. (42) 173.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to provide thePrime Minister with material on which he might basean approach to the President of the United States forassistance in connection with aircraft-carriers.(3) Asked that the Vice-Chiefs of Staff should consider andreport to the Defence Committee whether a simplerdesign of tank-landing craft could be evolved; and invited the Minister of Production to submit to theDefence Committee the memorandum which he was pre-paring on the prospects of increasing the production ofthese-craft.
235W.M. 53 (42).Supplies toRussia.^previous reference:W.M. (42) 48thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production on Post-Protocol Supplies to Russia(W.P. (42) 178).After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that this Paper should be remitted for considera-tion by the Defence Committee at their next Meeting.Blockade. q    The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProposal to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 175) in regard toallow shipment a proposal that a supply of limited quantities of milk in concen-of milk for trated form, for the relief of children only, should be allowed to children to enter territories of the Allied Governments occupied by the enemy,enemy-occupied It was explained that it would be a condition of the schemeterritories. that no curtailment of our own supplies of milk from the United(Previous States was thereby involved. It was proposed that shipments should reference: be made in Swedish ships now in the Baltic and trading for theW.M. (41) 75th enemy.   Further, our dollar resources would not be used for this conclusions,       purpose.Minute 9.) It was explained that the scheme was put forward as being inour interests. Thus, useful propaganda could be based upon it, andit would have an effect in maintaining the morale of the peoples ofthe overrun territories.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that his Departmentnow favoured a scheme on the lines proposed.On the other hand, it was urged that, if once this concessionwas made, strong pressure would be brought to bear upon us by theAllied Governments to extend it, more especially since the amountof concentrated milk which it was proposed should be allowedthrough the blockade would go a very little way to meet the needs ofthe children in the territories concerned. Once the principle was conceded, there would be no firm ground on which we could resistfurther concessions. The arguments put foiward in favour of thescheme were the same as those which had been urged a year ago. Atthat time we had had great difficulty in resisting the strong pressureput on us by the United States Government; but there was reasonto suppose that opinion in that country on this matter had greatlychanged since they came into the war.It was suggested that many of the arguments against theproposal would be met if, while we retained effective control overthe scope and extent of the scheme, it took the form of action onbehalf of the Allied Governments for the benefit of the people intheir own territories, occupied by the enemy.The War Cabinet-Recorded no decision, and agreed to resume considerationof this question in, say, a week&apos;s time.Fuel Rationing. 7. Reference was made to the interest aroused in the Houseof Commons and in the Press by the announcement made by thePresident of the Board of Trade on the 21st April that the Govern-ment had decided to introduce a comprehensive scheme of fuelrationing as soon as possible, and that it was hoped by this means to reduce the domestic consumption of coal by 10 million tons a year.The Prime Minister suggested that consideration should begiven to the alternative method of an appeal to the public to reduceconsumption voluntarily. Having regard to the grave complications
inherent in any scheme of fuel rationing, there would be great advantage if the requisite saving could be obtained withoutelaborate machinery, and by a method which would secure general assent.The War Cabinet were informed that a Motion had been putdown for discussion in the House of Commons at an early date tothe effect that, before any scheme for the rationing of fuel was instituted, steps should be taken, in accordance with the recommen-dation of the Select Committee on National Expenditure, in theThird Report of the Session, 1941-42, to release men temporarilyfrom the Army, and in other ways therein set out materially toincrease the production of coal in this country. It was also statedthat there was likely to be some opposition to a rationing scheme in both the main political Parties.The view was also expressed that some of the criticism was directed not against fuel rationing as such, but against what the critics imagined to be the essential features of the scheme drawn upby Sir William Beveridge. A White Paper would be presented onthe following day setting out the Beveridge scheme, to which, ofcourse, His Majesty&apos;s Government were not committed, and whichwas regarded as a basis of discussion. Further, the President ofthe Board of Trade was proposing to have discussions with repre-sentative political bodies in the current week.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note that various measures were in hand which wouldresult in a further elucidation of opinion in the house and among the public generally in regard to the fuelrationing scheme.(2) Favoured the suggestion that there should be a discussion in the House on fuel rationing at an early date, probably in the following week.(3) Agreed that for the present no firm decision should be takenin favour of the adoption of any particular method ofsecuring the necessary saving in the consumption of domestic fuel.Great George Street, S. W. 1,April 27, 1942.
