39W.M. 65 (42).1. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram from thePrime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia to Dr. Evatt,about strategic considerations affecting the defence of Australia(W.P. (43) 210).The discussion and the Conclusions reached are recorded in theSecretary^ Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (42) 212), summarising the proposals of the United States Government as to the procedure to be adopted for dealing with post-war relief.In discussion, the-First Lord of the Admiralty said that he assumed that there would be a full discussion at a later stage withthe Admiralty and the Ministry of War Transport about the availability of shipping for this scheme.   This was agreed to.The War Cabinet-Agreed that this matter should be dealt with on the linessummarised in the Foreign Secrefcary&apos;s Memorandum,viz. : (a) The Dominions and India should be told at once thatwe strongly favour acceptance of the United states proposals and that, subject to the concurrence ofthe Governments of the Dominions and India, HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdompropose to inform the United States Governmentthat we welcome their proposals, which we accept in principle, and that we shall be prepared to give them such support as they desire in securing their acceptance by the Soviet and other Allied Govern-ments.(b) On receipt of replies from the Dominions and India,the Foreign Secretary should so inform Mr. Winant.ic) If agreeable to the United States Government, weshould work for a joint Anglo-American-soviet proposal to lay before the Inter-Allied Committee.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (42) 214). It was explained inthe memorandum that numerous attacks had been made by the enemy on our hospital ships. While it was doubtful whether the enemydid not intend any longer to respect the Red Cross Convention, it seemed clear that there was little hope of preventing attacks on ourhospital ships in the Mediterranean unless details of each voyagewere notified to the enemy beforehand. It was therefore suggestedthat we should address protests on this matter to the German andItalian Governments, and should inform them that we proposed to notify them of the full details of all the voyages of our hospital ships in the Mediterranean, by signals&apos;giving prior notice of thetime of sailing, &amp;c.In discussion, doubts were expressed as to the wisdom ofembarking on a course which would necessitate sending communi-cations direct to the enemy.The War Cabinet were reminded that in 1940 the germans had asked us to recognise as within the scope of the Geneva Conven-tibn certain aircraft which were employed to rescue airmen whohad fallen into the Channel. We had declined to agree to thiscourse. Subsequently evidence had become available showing thatthe Germans had abused the use of aircraft marked with the red cross. -
The Conclusion of the War Cabinet was That, while our hospital ships, when on the high seasmight take steps to proclaim their position and identityby signals at intervals, it was undesirable to address anycommunications on this matter to the German or italian governments.Dr. Evatt. 4.   The Prime Minister said that he was sure his colleagues would wish him to say what a pleasure it had been to them to haveDr. Evatt among them, and to express their regret that he felt itnecessary to return after so short a visit. They had greatly appre-ciated the advantage of having Dr. Evatt among them, and he would carry back with him the warmest feelings of the many friends hehad made over here.Dr. Evatt said that he was deeply appreciative of what thePrime Minister had said. He wished to express his gratitude toall the War Cabinet for the help which they had given him.War cabinet arrangements.5. The Prim,e Minister said that, unless any urgent businessarose which called for a Meeting of the War Cabinet at short notice, the next Meeting would be held on Tuesday, the 26th May.at 5-30 p.m.Great George Street, S.W. 1,May 21, 1942.
- MOST SECRETSUPPLIESTO RUSSIA.(previous preference:W.M.(42)  64thConclus ions,Minute 2.)U. S . S .R *M. Molotov&apos;visit.(previous reference:W.M.(42) 58th.Conclusions,Minute 1.)WAR CABINET 65 (42) .Thursday, 21st May, 1942, 5.5 0 p.m.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that he had had a telegramfrom Admiral Miles saying that the Russian Deputy Chiefof the Naval Staff had expressed great satisfaction a tour decision to send the May convoy.   The Russians were going to treat the arrival of this convoy as a specialoperation.   200 aircraft of the Red Army would he employedon protection measures, and 50 bombers would attack theenemy aerodromes in Northern Norway.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet thatM. Molotov had arrived, in this country on the previous day,  en, route to the United States.   M. Molotov was most anxious that no information should he given of his arrival in this country.   Shoul6 the news 1eak out, no eonfirma-tion should be issued.   He had said that there were two matters which he wished to discuss:    first, the PoliticalTreaty;    secondly, the Second Front question.   A firstMeeting had been held at 11.30 that morning.   As regardsthe Political Treaty, M. Molotov had said that he musthave as a minimum the Russian frontier as at the time of hitler&apos;s aggression on Russia in June, 1941.   He had usedlanguage which seemed to imply that he would not be ableto make any concession on the point of difference betweenthe two drafts .   He had added, however, that if it wasnot- possible to reach agreement, he thought it would bebetter to defer signature altogether for some time.   he also said that he attached more importance to the second front than to the signature of the Treaty.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had had a two hours&apos;  discussion that afternoon on the Treaty.    It hadnot been possible t o reach agreement over the Polishfrontier.   M. Molotov had said that his Government

wished to deal with, this matter by means of a separateNote (a copy of which had been given to the foreign secretary by M. Maisky on the 1st May), which contained the following statement:-&quot;The Soviet Government considers it as self-evident that the question of the post-warfrontiers between the U.S.S.R. and the PolishRepublic will form the subject of a special agreement between the Polish and soviet governments in accordance with the understand-ing reached some time ago between M. Stalinand General Sikorski.In this connection theSoviet Government expresses its confidence that the said question will be settled by mutual agreement between the two countries&apos;friendly allied relations.&quot;He (the Foreign Secretary) had told M. Molotov that ifthe matter was dealt with on this basis, he would haveto send an answer to this Note saying that, pending theconclusion of such an Agreement, our attitude was governed by the letter which he (the Foreign Secretary) had sent atthe time of the conclusion of the Russc-Polish Treaty.M. Molotov had not liked this idea at all, and had hopedthat we should not find it necessary to refer to this.letter.   The Foreign Secretary said that in his view wecould not recede from our attitude in this matter.The only other matter which had been dealt with atthe meeting that morning had been   the encouragement ofConfederation among the smaller States of Eastern Europe.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a Meeting would beheld on the following morning, attended by representativesof the Chiefs of Staff, at which the Second Front question would be dealt with.   He invited the Vice-Chief of theImperial General Staff to prepare a short Note on theprospects of &quot;SLEDGEHAMMER&quot;.The Prime Minister added that questions might wellarise in the course of a few days which would call for decision by the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.w.1.
