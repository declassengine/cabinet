Civil Defence. 1.   The Secretary of State for the Home Department and recruitment for Minister of Home Securitysaid that the experience of recent largeCivil Defence air attacks with incendiaries showed that a large part of the damageServices. caused was due to ineffective fire-watching.   It had already been(Previous made compulsory on owners of factories and offices to provide fire-Reference : watching parties, but this obligation was not effectively carried out.W.M. (40) 309th When the owners were prosecuted, they often avoided a heavyConclusions, penalty on the ground that they had been unable to obtain suitableMinute 10.) fire-watchers. Powers already existed under which a Regulationcould be made, making compulsory fire-watching and other part-time Civil Defence duties.The Home Secretary said that he was broadcasting that evening. In view of the present position and of the outcry whichhad arisen in the Press on this matter an outcry which he believedwas justified-it was essential that he should be in a positionto announce in principle the adoption of compulsion for fire-watching services. ,   .In discussion it was agreed that the situation must be dealtwith urgently, and that compulsion must be accepted. At the sametime there were certain difficulties to be solved. For example, whatwas to be the machinery for determining who should be compelledto render these services, and how was compulsion to be exercisedfairly as between man and man.The Lord President of the Council reminded the War Cabinetthat the question of making compulsory part-time service in theCivil Defence Services had been before the War Cabinet on the17th September, when it had been decided that this course shouldnot be adopted until other alternatives had been exhausted. Wherea man was compulsorily enlisted for whole-time service, the Statepaid him, and there was an impartial Tribunal before which theman could appear to represent that the imposition of compulsionupon him involved exceptional hardship. It would be much moredifficult to enforce an obligation for part-time service, and, inparticular, for a service such as fire-watching. He thought that,while it was possible to apply compulsion to jjart-time Civil defence services as a whole, and within that scheme to provide for a com-pulsory fire-watching service, the Government would be unwise to commit themselves to a compulsory scheme for a part-time fire-watching service only.- The following further points were made in discussion : (1) The Minister o.f Labour and National Service said that hehad now made arrangements that the conditions ofservice of the Liverpool dockers should include the workof clearing debris, fire-watching and other duties. Hewould shortly be meeting representatives of theengineering and shipbuilding trades with a view toreorganising their conditions of service on a weekly as opposed to an hourly basis. There would thus be anopportunity for making fire-watching part of the general conditions of service over a wide section of industry.(2) The Minister of Labour and National Service suggestedthat some small form of payment, e.g., 9d. or Is., to coverlight refreshments might be paid to part-time fire-watchers and that this payment would form a retaineron their services.(3) Emphasis was laid on the need for the arrangements forfire-watching being on a flexible basis adaptable to the varying conditions of factories, blocks of offices and groups of small private houses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 251stConclusions,Minute 5.)
(4) In some cases the solution might be an extension of theemployment of members of the Home Guard on these duties. In others the fire-watching might be made partof the air raid wardens&apos; duties.The War Cabinet agreed as follows:- (1) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security was invited to speak on the following general Tines in hisbroadcast that evening: (a) Where adequate fire-watching arrangements were adopted, the fire risk could be kept under control.The remedy was in our own hands.(b) The question of ensuring an adequate fire-watchingservice raised in an acute form the question of compulsory part-time service for Civil defence services. The War Cabinet had decided that this principle should now be affirmed. The detailedmethod of its application would shortly be pro-mulgated. This measure would be introduced asan emergency measure, and Parliament would beasked to ratify it at a later date.(c) While it would be undesirable, at any rate at thisstage, to suggest that compensation for war damage would be reduced in cases where therewas neglect of fire-watching precautions, theHome Secretary might refer to adequate financialpenalties on those who failed to discharge their responsibilities.(2) The Minister of Labour and National Service was invitedto communicate informally with the Employers&apos; Federa-tion and the Trade Union Congress, that afternoon,indicating the lines of the statement which the HomeSecretary was proposing to make that evening.(3) A Committee was appointed, comprising The Lord President of the Council (Chairman),The Minister of Labour and National Service.The Home Secretary and Minister of home security,The Secretary of State for War, andThe Minister of Supply to prepare a scheme for applying the principle of compulsory part-time service to the Civil defence services.2. The War Cabinet had a discussion on the general situation,and in particular as to the probable sequence of events if our troops and the Greeks continued to have successes against the Italians;and as to the form, which Hitler&apos;s counter-stroke would be most likely to take.Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 31, 1940.
