Naval, Militaryand air operations.Air Operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 288thConclusions,Minute 1.)Raid onCoventry.1.   The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on Wednesdaynight 72 of our bombers had attacked targets including Berlin,Leuna, Hanover and Taranto.   Two bombers failed to return.   OnWednesday night 90 enemy bombers had been over this country.The casualties for the previous Wednesday had been : Our Own Nil.Enemy 4 certain.8 damaged.On the previous day 180 enemy machines had taken part inattacks on this country, the main objective being shipping.   the casulties had been : Our Own 2 machines lost (2 pilots safe).Enemy 19 certain.8 probable.9 damaged.On the previous night we had sent out 122 bombers, including49 to Berlin. Full reports were not yet available, although good results had been obtained.  Unfortunately we had lost 10 bombers.On the previous night there had been a very heavy raid bysome 300 enemy bombers on Coventry. In an endeavour to lessen the magnitude of this attack we had sent 80 machines to attack the enemy aerodromes from which the bombers had been expectedto take off. Fairly good results had been obtained. In addition, a continuous fighter patrol had been maintained over Coventry itself,but only one inconclusive engagement had taken place.The Lord President of the Council said that the raid onCoventry had been the heaviest yet experienced on a munitioncentre. The damage had been very heavy and the casualties (killed and wounded) were believed to be around 600. Communicationshad been badly interrupted, the water, gas and electricity supplieshad failed. Reinforcements of police, firemen and fire applianceshad been sent to the city. Owing to the breakdown in communica-tions full details were not yet available. It was known, however,that a number of parachute mines had been dropped, and steps hadbeen taken to deal with 15 of these which had not exploded.The Chief of Naval Staff said that further reconnaissancesover Taranto showed clearly that three Italian battleships had been damaged in the raid on Tuesday last. Their position had been changed and they were now protected by nets. The undamagedbattleships and the 8-inch cruisers had now left the harbour. Itwould probably take at least six months to repair the damagedships.Dover had been heavily attacked by dive bombers on the previous day, one drifter being sunk and three damaged.During the course of the recent operations of the mediterranean-nean Fleet four enemy aircraft had been shot down during the first period of the operations (i.e., the 8th-10th November) and threemore had been shot down on the 12th November. Two unsuccessfulattempts had been made to bomb the Fleet during the operations.Alexandria had been twice attacked by enemy aircraft on the13th, and slight damage caused to dock sheds and the shore base.[21928] b 2NavalOperations.The raid onTaranto.(previous reference:W.M.

Attache at Washington had reported that UnitedStates destroyers were patrolling off Tampico in the Gulf of Mexicowith orders to shadow German ships should they attempt to escape.United States destroyers were also patrolling the Florida Straits.The latest report showed that not more than five ships had been lost in the attack on the Halifax Convoy on the 5th November.Four had definitely been sunk and one was still unaccounted for.One ship in the convoy had landed 23 of her crew in New-foundland, leaving on board a crew of 15. The next that was heardof this ship was that she was at Clare Bay on the west coast ofIreland. In the opinion of the War Cabinet, this remarkable featof courage and seamanship deserved some recognition, as did theaction of the Jervis Bay.There had been no casualties from U-boat action on the previous day. St. Catherine (British, 1,216 tons) had been sunk by a torpedofrom an enemy aircraft off Aberdeen on the previous day. A convoy off Yarmouth had also been attacked by aircraft, and one ship hadbeen bombed.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there was still apersistent tendency for ships in convoy to straggle, with the resultthat the stragglers were picked off by enemy aircraft. TheAdmiralty were taking the matter up with the Ministry ofShipping.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the following information : One company of Indian troops occupied an extendedout-post position north of Gallabat. In the Kassala sector one squadron of Skinner&apos;s Horse had been in contact with enemy armoured cars 15 miles east of Makali Wells.Although one Italian Colonial Battalion had been practicallydestroyed at Gallabat on the 6th instant, and two others had suffered heavily in subsequent counter-attacks, it would appear that theItalians would, in the course of the next few days, have a forceof some 8,000 to 10,000 men, with six to 10 guns and possibly15 light tanks, and 15 armoured cars at or near Metemma. Inaddition, approximately 9,000 men with 26 guns were in reserveat Gondar. Probably half the latter force was required for internal security.In the northern sector Greek concentrations had been completed on the 13th, and early on the morning of the 14th Greek forces had begun a large-scale attack along a front extending from Lake Prespato Slimnitsa, with their first objective the line of mountainsimmediately east of Koritza.At noon on the 14th the Greeks had advanced to the following general line : S.W. corner of Lake Megali Presba-(all inclusive)Proger Bilisht Bozhigrad-River Devole.In the Pindus sector the Greeks were holding the frontier in face of weak enemy forces. They were closing in on Konitsa, andmany Italian prisoners had been taken.In the Epirus sector opposite Doliana Italian outposts had broken off contact. In the central Kalamas river line there hadbeen no change, although the Greek forces were increasing their pressure. Along the west coast Greek advanced troops were nowwithin six miles of Egoumenitsa, and had met with very slightopposition.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, had just returned to egypt after a short visit to Crete, and had reported that all waswell and the troops in good spirits. He had left a Brigadier to study defence questions. A second battalion had been sent to Crete.Further reinforcements were available if necessary, but the presentview was that they were not needed at present.In answer to a question, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that reinforcements were still being sent from Italy to
Albania, but both the bases used, Valona and Durazzo, were beingbombed.   This bombing would continue.The War Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider whether some special recognition should be made to the crew ofSan Demetrio and the officers and men of the /ervis Bay.(3) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty was taking up with the Minister of Shipping the question ofmerchant ships straggling when in convoy.2. The War Cabinet were informed that a Danish ship and atug were in Greek waters. The Greeks were unwilling to seizethem for fear this might lead to an early declaration of war upon them by Germany. But they seemed to have no objection to ourseizing them.On the suggestion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the War Cabinet Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to sendinstructions to the Commander-in-Chief, mediterranean fleet, to the effect that there was no objection to these ships being seized by the British Navy, provided it was clearly established that the Greek Government saw noobjection to our taking this course.Greece.Danish Ships inGreek &quot;Waters.foreign information.Egypt.U.S.S.E.Visit ofM. Molotov to berlin.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 288thConclusions,Minute 3.)Prance: rela-tions with theVichyGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 287thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the following information : The death of the Prime Minister threw the Egyptian politicalsituation into the melting-pot. Sir Miles Lampson had taken theopportunity of making it clear that we should not welcome KhalilBey as Prime Minister. Nahas Pasha and the Wafd were acting in a reserved way, and it seemed uncertain whether Sir miles lampson would be able to find a new Prime Minister who could bring them into the Government.There had been no further developments in regard to theU.S.S.R. The Turkish Government professed not to be disturbed by the negotiations between Germany and the U.S.S.R.The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to a recent reportsuggesting that Sir Stafford Cripps was interesting himself too much with the Straits question, and that the knowledge of thiswould come to the German Government.The Foreign Secretary said that we had spoken very franklyto the Turkish Government, and he thought there was no fear of a misunderstanding between us and that Government on this matter.No move had been made by the Vichy Government, but we had further reports confirming the split between General Weygand andM. Laval. Our present policy was to pursue contacts with indi-vidual members of the Vichy Government, since our approach tothat Government as a whole had been barren of results.[21928]b 3

(40) 286thConclusions,Minute 2.)Meeting ofAllied Repre-sentatives.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 288thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Lord Privy Seal read to the War Cabinet a personal message ^from the President of the United States to the PrimeMinister. The President had instructed the United States Charged&apos;Affaires at Vichy to obtain confirmation or denial of a reportthat the Jean Bart and Richelieu might be transferred to theMediterranean for completion, and, if the report was confirmed,to say that such a step would seriously prejudice Franco-american relations.The War Cabinet were informed that the Free French forces had occupied Port Gentil. All French Equatorial Africa was nowin General de Gaulle&apos;s hands. There was an unconfirmed reportthat an attack by Vichy forces was being prepared upon Chad.A telegram had been sent to the Greek Government explaining the disadvantages of their sending an Observer to the Meeting ofAllied Representatives, but not pressing them on the matter unduly.The War Cabinet took note of this information.India- 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theDraft statement Secretary of State for India (WP. (G.) (40) 297) covering the draftby the Viceroy, of a Statement to be made by the Viceroy on Wednesday, the(Previous 20th November, in the course of an address to both Chambers ofReference: the Central Legislature.   The substance of the Statement was that.M. (40)272nd the reception of the Viceroy&apos;s offer of the 8th August by theConclusions, principal parties made it inexpedient to proceed for the presentMinute 11.) with the idea of expanding his Executive Council and setting up aWar Advisory Council.The Secretary of State for India made the following points inthe course of an explanatory statement:- (1) The first part of the statement annexed to W.P. (G.) (40) 297reproduced, in a somewhat different order, the language of the Viceroy&apos;s Statement of the 8th August, whichhad received the approval of the War Cabinet. TheStatement now proposed neither went beyond nor modi-fied the Statement of the 8th August.(2) He had thought the Viceroy&apos;s original draft of theStatement defective in that it did not distinguishclearly between the immediate proposals and the longer-term policy embodied in the offer of the 8th August.From the point of view of publicity the Statement should give a complete picture of the offer in correct perspective.(3) The Viceroy had concurred in the revised draft, although he had expressed some preference for including in it what he (the Secretary of State) had deliberately omitted some explanation of the reasons, to a large extent self-contradictory, which had led the various parties to reject the offer. He remained of the opinion that it wasinexpedient to include any such explanations owing tothe great difficulty of framing them briefly, in languagewhich would not be liable to be criticised by the parties concerned as being a misrepresentation of these views.
The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the draft Statement to be made by the Viceroyon the 20th November in the form attached toW.P. (G.) (40) 297 on the understanding that its terms in no way modified the Statement made by the Viceroyon the 8th August.(b) Authorised the Secretary of State for India to present theStatement as a Command Paper on the 20th November.blockade policy: appli-cation to Japan.S.S. NagaraMaru.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 81stConclusions,Minute 9.)&quot;A&quot;G5. The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister ofEconomic Warfare informed the War Cabinet that the NagaraMaru was a Japanese ship which had been in an Italian port atthe outbreak of war with Italy. She had been due to load certaingoods of Italian origin. On being approached by the Japanese, wehad agreed to permit the ship to sail with a cargo including some27,000 kilograms of mercury. The Japanese had then employedvarious pretexts to delay her sailing and had asked permission tomake a large increase in the shipment of mercury, bringing its valueup to 2 million dollars.   We had refused to sanction this increase.Nevertheless, the ship had ultimately sailed, and it had been discovered that she had, in fact, embarked an additional 350,000kilograms of mercury, together with other commodities fromGermany, Italy and Switzerland believed to include machine tools.The ship was now held at Colombo. The Japanese were urging usto release her as dues were mounting up, and had offered an under-taking that, if the whole of the mercury was allowed to go through,they would make no effort to import any further goods of enemy origin. Unfortunately, they had given, but not observed, similarundertakings in the past.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that our contraband control had so far been applied with considerable elasticity to goods destined for Japan, including goods coming from enemy countries. In his view, the time had come to take a firm line. he proposed that we should allow the original consignment of 27,000kilograms of mercury to go to Japan, but should take off the shipthe additional consignment of 350,000 kilograms, together with the machine tools, &amp;c. As a concession to Japan, we might agree notto put in prize the goods taken off the vessel, but merely to detainthem until the end of the war. It would then be possible for theJapanese to get them back by making application to the Courts.The Foreign Secretary made the following points : (1) He agreed to the course suggested by the Minister ofEconomic Warfare. The Japanese were unlikely, to regard our action as a casus belli unless, indeed, theywere in any case determined on&apos; war, which seemedimprobable. He believed that they expected us to takestrong action in the present case.(2) Sir Robert Craigie, who had discussed the matter with theJapanese Foreign Office, saw nothing to justify ourreleasing the whole of the Nagara Maru&apos;s cargo, though he expected political repercussions, and possibly alsoreprisals, if we took the line suggested. Sir Robertopposed a concession except in return for a quid pro quo.He (the Foreign Secretary) did not favour this. Therewas no undertaking which we could obtain from Japanwhich would be of any value if she went over to our enemies.(3) There was one possible flaw in our otherwise very strong case. In a letter of the 9th August we had stated thatwe should be prepared to allow the 27,000 tons ofmercury to go through on the clear understanding that
this would be the last occasion on which German or italian goods were allowed to proceed to Japan. TheJapanese claimed to interpret our letter as meaning thatthe Nagara Maru was to be the last ship containing sucha cargo which would be allowed to go through. Buttaking the correspondence as a whole, this was obviouslya forced interpretation.(4) While he agreed to the course proposed, he thought thatwe might later have to compromise with the Japaneseon some such solution as letting through part of thedetained cargo or buying the mercury from its Japaneseowners.The War Cabinet-Invited  the  Minister of Economic  Warfare to  give instructions to the Port Authorities at Colombo, on thelines suggested in &quot;A.&quot;France:blockade policy.The S.S. Cuba.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 286thjConclusions,Minute 4.)&quot; B &quot;6. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that S.S. Cuba had now been rummaged by Customs Staff in co-operation with naval officers; no trace of gold or other valuable cargo had been found.The cargo was reported to be in order.The First Lord asked for authority to despatch the draft signalattached to W.P. (40) 443, giving orders to detain the Cuba pending further instructions, and stating that the present intention wasthat she should be brought to the United Kingdom, provided that (a) satisfactory arrangements could be made to repatriate pro-Vichy elements amongst the crew and passengers to someVichy territory where they would not constitute a danger, and(6) that a crew could be provided for the Cuba from Freetownto the United Kingdom.In reply to a question, the First Lord said that the objectionto allowing the passengers to go to Dakar was that the greater partof them were French Naval personnel or reservists.The Minister of Shilling said that he was prepared to agreeto the draft signal being despatched. He was attempting to find aPortuguese ship which could take the pro-Vichy elements amongstthe crew and passengers to Casablanca.The War Cabinet-Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to despatch, the draft signal annexed to W.P. (40) 443, and summarised at &quot; B. &quot; above, subject to paragraph 1 (a) being amended to read &quot; . . . . to unoccupied France or to some VichyTerritory where, &amp;c.&quot;Parliament: the        7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the LordKing&apos;s Speeches Privy Seal covering drafts of the King&apos;s Speeches on the Proroga-on Prorogation   tion and Opening of Parliament (the 20th and 21st November)and Opening of (W.P.

Speech on prorogation.Speech on theOpening ofParliament.No comments were made.The following amendments were made : Paragraph 1, line 3. The first sentence should end&quot; . . . . until freedom is made secure,&quot; the reference to the peoples of Europe being omitted.Paragraph 2. Should read &quot; I am confident that victoryis assured, not only by the prowess of the Naval, Military, air and Civil Defence Forces of My Empire and those of MyAllies, but also by the tenacity and industry of My peoples,who now endure, where they live and labour, the perils as wellas the hardships of war.&quot;Considerable discussion followed on the fourth paragraph,mainly on the question whether it was wise to single out for mentionin this Speech the United States of America, no other foreign country being mentioned.The Foreign Secretary undertook to give further considerationto this point, and, in particular, to a suggestion from the Ministerof Labour and National Service that this paragraph should start with a sentence to the effect that our resistance to aggression had won us the respect and sympathy of all the countries which sharedour ideals.Last paragraph but one. The view was expressed that it wouldbe better to return to the original wording of this paragraph, whichread as follows : &quot; Measures will be submitted to you for alleviating the hardships of victims of enemy attack and for improving theconditions of those who may now or hereafter have to seekassistance from public funds.&quot;The War Cabinet-Approved the drafts of the two Speeches, subject to theabove points and to settlement of any outstanding pointsby the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, who would consult the Prime Minister as necessary.Richmond Terrace, S.

THE FORMER NAVAL PERSON.I have received your message with, regard to triepossible transfer by the French Government of the JEANBART and RICHELIEU to the Mediterranean for completion.Instructions have been sent immediately to the AmericanCharge&quot; d&apos;Affaires in Vichy to obtain a confirmation ora denial of this report and to point out that it is of vital interest to the Government of the United Statesthat these vessels remain in stations where they willnot be exposed to control or seizure by power whichmight employ them to ends in conflict with the interestsof the United States in the future of the French Fleet,If the report is confirmed the Charge^ d&apos;Affaires hasbeen instructed to convey to Marshal Petain an expression of the grave concern of this Government and to point outthat the Government of the United States, mindful of thecommunity of interests which has existed for more thana century between France and the United States, believes that if it is necessary, for purposes^)f reconditioningor repairs, to move the units in question the french authorities will not transfer the JEAN BART and RICHELIEU

to places where they would be subject to the controlinconsistent not only with the &quot;best interests ofFrance hut with the ultimate interests of theUnited States as well.It will also he made clear, should thereport he confirmed, that such a step on the partof the French Government would inevitably seriously prejudice Franco-American relations.For your personal information only, I amletting the French Government know that this government would he prepared to &quot;buy these two shipsif they will dispose of them to us.    I will letyou know the results.November 13,  1940.Lord Privy Seal,Perhaps you will read this to the Cabinet.I am replying suitably to President.I consider in view of it that Admiraltyis justified in sending 3 of the 4   submarinesdetailed to stop these vessels, to operate uponItalian lines of coraruunication.w. s. c.15. 10,
