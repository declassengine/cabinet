Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 298thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.fighter command.1. The Chief of the Air Staff reported on the air operations from Thursday, the 28th November, to Sunday, the 1st December.The enemy had carried out fighter sweeps and reconnaissancesover this country, sending over an average of 280 aircraft a day. to counter these operations we had sent up an average of 500 fightersa day.  The casualties for the four days had been : Enemy 23 destroyed.6 probable.7 damaged.Our own 17 destroyed (8 pilots lost).bomber command.On the nights the 28th/29th and the 29th/30th November theenemy had sent some 250 bombers and 15 to 20 minelayers over thiscountry. On the two following nights they had sent over 120 and 80aircraft respectively, the reduction being on account of fog.Our night bombing attacks on Germany and German-occupied countries had been as follows : November 28November 29November 30December 1Numberof Britishbombers,sent out.774510Numberof Britishbombersmissing.21CoastalCommand.naval operations.Mediterranean.On the 29th November a Coastal Command aircraft had sighteda convoy off Terschelling, and had successfully attacked an 8,000-ton merchant vessel.On the Greek Front our Gladiators had brought down 8 italian aircraft on the 28th November. Our own losses in the operation hadbeen one Gladiator.The First Sea Lord reported that on the 29th November4 British destroyers had engaged a force of 3 enemy destroyers20 miles south-east of the Lizard. The German destroyers had proved faster than ours. Measures were being considered for givingour destroyers an extra turn of speed. H.M.S. Javelin had been torpedoed, but was safely back in port. One German destroyer hadbeen damaged. Aircraft reconnaissance had shown that she was now in Brest, down by the stern.H.M.S. Fame, which had been beached off the Tyne, had nowbeen refloated.Two British Motor Torpedo Boats had attacked 6 escortedenemy motor vessels off the Scheldt on the night of the 30th Novem-ber-lst December.H.M.S. Icarus had successfuly completed &apos; mineiaymgoperations in the Baie de la Seine during the night the28th/29th November.H.M.S. Furious had delivered her Hurricanes at Takoradi.H.M.S. Dragon had released the Vichy French M/V Ville duHavre, bound from Casablanca to Madagascar, after obtaining acertificate that she carried no goods of enemy origin.H.M.S. Berwick had been hit by two 8-inch shells in the actionoff Sardinia, one turret being put out of action. She was now inport.Successful attacks by aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm had beencarried out at Port Laki (Leros) and at Tripoli.[21979]b 2
Minelaying.(previous references:W.M. (40) 294thConclusions,Minute 7, andW.M. (40) 295thConclusions,Minute 1.)Slapping losses.We had now begun laying the new minefield for which cabinet approval had been obtained on the 22nd November. We had alsolaid a minefield in the Denmark Strait.Tradeprotection.MilitaryOperations.Italy-Greece.Sudan.East Africa.The armed merchant cruiser For far had been torpedoed about300 miles West of Blacksod Bay early that morning. She had goneout as escort to a convoy, which had dispersed before the attacktook place.  It was not thought that she was in danger of sinking.Enemy U-boats, probably 3 in number, had carried out effectiveattacks on our shipping West of Bloody Foreland. Seven merchantvessels of a total tonnage of about 30,000 tons had been hit, but itwas probable that 2 of these would remain afloat.Discussion followed on the number of British destroyers now fit for service. Only 4 of the 50 American destroyers which we hadreceived in September were as yet in operational use. The rest were either working-up or being repaired.The First Sea Lord said that there were only two effectiveanswers to the U-boat campaign (i) To send long-range flying-boats to the danger area.(ii) To provide more escorts, so that convoys could be takenfurther out to sea.The Prime Minister suggested that the position should bediscussed at a Meeting to be arranged later.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that the greeks were now in Pogradets. It was thought that the Greekswould attempt to advance further into the Albanian Hills, and thereto hold a strong defensive line. At present they were 25 miles inadvance of their own frontier in the Northern Sector, 15 miles inadvance of their frontier in the Pindus Sector, and 10 miles inadvance of their frontier in the Epirus Sector. There were reportsof Italian reinforcements, including tanks, being on the way to this theatre of operations.There had been patrol action in the Kassala and Gallabatsectors. The fort at Gallabat had been occupied by Italian whitetroops on the morning of the 29th November.There had been a patrol action in the Loruth area, North-west of the northern end of Lake Rudolf, in which we had lost one british officer (missing) and 29 native soldiers (killed).The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.foreign information.Turkey:Probable atti-tude in certain eventualities.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (40) 295thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Angora telegram No. 1612 containing Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen&apos;s appreciation of the action which Turkey would take inthe various contingencies which might develop.On the whole the Ambassador was satisfied with the position.The Foreign Secretary thought that we might be able to obtain more specific assurances after the arrival of our Military Mission inTurkey.
Spain: economic assistance.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 298thConclusions,Minute 3.)France:American red cross proposalfor distributionof relief supplies in unoccupied france.The Foreign Secretary drew attention to telegram No. 1212 to madrid, in which Sir Samuel Hoare had been instructed to informthe Spanish Government of the measures of increased economic assistance which we were prepared to extend to them. We had ascertained that the United States Government saw no objection toour taking action on these lines.In reply to a question, the Foreign Secretary said that theshortage of food in Spain was really serious. He thought there wasno danger of our assistance increasing the risk of that countryjoining our enemies, while to have abstained from assistance mightwell have led to this result. A careful eye would be kept on thedistribution of the supplies.In Washington telegram No. 2837, Lord Lothian asked for afavourable answer to a proposal put forward by Mr. Norman Davis,the Chairman of the American Red Cross, for the distribution of relief supplies in unoccupied France. The scheme had the supportof President Roosevelt. Consideration of the proposal had best be deferred until the War Cabinet had before them a memorandum which the Minister of Economic Warfare was about to circulate.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 298thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Minister of Home Security said that Southampton had suffered from a severe raid on the 30th November/1st December.PirelfFs works had probably been burnt out, and Harland andWolffe&apos;s and J. and I. Thorneycroffs gutted. The Ordnance Survey,the Emergency Food Store, and also the South Hants Hospital hadbeen set on fire.On the night the lst/2nd December Southampton had sufferedagain. Among the places known to have been hit were Edwin Jones,Rank&apos;s flour mills, Messrs. Thornycroffs and Super Marine,Pirelli&apos;s and the Civic centre.A number of mobile canteens had been brought into the town.Utility services from outside had been called in to help and every-thing possible was being done. The fire situation was serious, butthe Fire Brigade services had stood up very well to their ordeal, andso far reports regarding casualties showed that they were not asserious as the material damage suffered would lead one to expect.The air-raid casualties over the week-end had been :-Killed.6 a.m. November 29-6 a.m. November 30.London     ......... 122Provinces ...      ...      ... 116 a.m. November 30-6 a.m. December 1.London    ...       ...       ... 1.....      ... 531-6 a.m. December 2.Injured.33718Provinces6 a.m. DecembeiLondonProvinces40121277100The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.United States 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a draft letter from theof America. Prime Minister to President Roosevelt (W.P. (G\) (40) 466).Proposed The Prime Minister said that Lord Lothian now thought thatmessage from it would be better that the letter should not be delivered to thePrime Minister President, who was going on holiday, for about a week.  There wasto President thus more time to make any amendments.Roosevelt.
The Secretary of State for War suggested that paragraphs 14and 15 gave too optimistic a picture of our munitions production.The Prime Minister said that if the picture was painted toodarkly, elements in the United States would say that it was useless to help us, for such help would be wasted and thrown away. If toobright a picture was painted, then there might be a tendency to withhold assistance. He had been rather chilled by the attitude ofthe United States since the Election; but it might well be that thePresident was waiting for the election atmosphere to disperse before taking any striking action.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that itmight be desirable to ask for more than 50 destroyers. PerhapsLord Lothian&apos;s advice on this point might be sought.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that, in the light of theUnited States destroyer strength, he thought it unwise to ask for more than 50.The Chief of Naval Staff concurred with this view. It would,however, be a great help if alterations to destroyers could be madein the United States, so that they could go straight into servicewhen we received them.An amendment to the wording of paragraph 12 (4) wasagreed to.The War Cabinet :-(a) Approved the general line of the draft letter, and(b) Invited Ministers to submit any proposed amendments tothe Secretary of the War Cabinet within the next twenty-four hours.Italy. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theThe Dodecanese  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 464) as to the ownership of the Dodecanese Islands, if captured from Italy.The War Cabinet took note of this paper.Air Raids:repair of damage.Mobile labourreserves.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 297thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (G.) (40) 317) reporting thearrangements made, or proposed, for securing an adequate supply of skilled labour to make good air raid damage in areas which sufferedespecially heavy attack.The Lord President of the Council said that he and theMinisters concerned had reached the conclusion that, in respect ofthe restoration of public utility services, the arrangements already made, and the supplementary measures now being taken, would afford the most practical means of ensuring a sufficient mobility oflabour resources to deal with air-raid damage wherever it occurred.For this work military assistance was available. The arrangementsfor the repair of damaged houses, however, were more precarious,owing to the great shortage of skilled building labour; and in caseswhere the repair of houses was vital to the maintenance of essentialindustrial production, the Ministers felt that such repairs ought tobe included among the emergency measures for which military assistance could be invoked.The Secretary of State for War said that the Army was readyto help in every way possible. Since June last 13,000 technicians,who were doing skilled work in the army, had been released and thearmy had had to train others to take their place. The militaryauthorities were quite ready to allow Pioneers to help with the work,
-    121153 W.M. 299 (40).but it would be some two months before the new units would beready. In the meantime all the Army could do was to make available the Engineer Construction Units. The Secretary of State for Waradded that the Army had done all that it had been asked to do bythe civilian authorities in regard to air-raid damage, but so far no public recognition had been made of the fact.The Minister of Home Security said that he proposed to acknowledge the debt due to the military authorities in a speech that he was making that week.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theprevious week he had addressed four large meetings in Coventry,and had appealed to the men in the factories, who had experience astilers, builders, carpenters, &amp;c, to report at once to their manage-ments, so that they could be loaned for repair work. His experiencewas that there was too great a tendency on the part of employers to wait for services to be provided for them when, with a littleinitiative, they could provide their own. He suggested that theProduction Departments should send a letter to all Managements inorder to ascertain the number of men who had experience in repair work, so that they could be starred and used in an emergency. Anundertaking should be given to the men that they would be taken onagain at the factories as soon as this special repair work had beencompleted.The War Cabinet approved the arrangements for mobile labourreserves to assist in repairing air-raid damage outlined in w.P. (G.) (40) 317.Palestine:illegal immigration.Sinking ofS.S. Patria.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 297thConclusions,Minute 5.)Proclamationissued   on20th November.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 468), covering a telegramfrom the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East. General Wavellregretted the decision to allow the illegal immigrants who had been saved from the S.S. Patria to remain in Palestine, on the groundthat it would spread over the Arab world that the Jews had againsuccesfully challenged the decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government;and that the policy of the White Paper was being reversed. he asked that the matter should be reconsidered.The War Cabinet decided that the decision should stand.The War Cabinet were reminded that, at the Meeting held onthe 27th November, it had been decided that the Proclamationisued in Palestine stating that the illegal Jewish immigrants whowere being sent to Mauritius would not be allowed to enter Palestineor remain in the Colony after the War, should stand, but that asuitable explanatory statement should be issued.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that it had beenfound very difficult to draft a suitable explanatory statement.In the course of discussion, the view was expressed that thestatement that illegal immigrants sent to Mauritius would not beallowed to enter Palestine or to remain in the Colony after the war was somewhat harsh. On the other hand, it was felt to be undesirable that the Proclamation having been issued, action should now be taken to countermand it. Further, now that it had beendecided that the illegal immigrants saved from the S.S. Patriashould be allowed to land in Palestine, the Proclamation applied only to any illegal immigrants who might attempt to land inPalestine in future and be sent to Mauritius. The Proclamationmight have some useful deterrent effect and should stand.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies read to the War Cabinetthe terms of a telegram from the. High Commissioner for Palestine,giving the draft of an announcement which he proposed to make inregard to the immigrants on the S.S. Patria. The draft read asfollows : &apos;&apos; With reference to notice published the 20th November.In view of loss of Patria from causes which are at presentunknown but are to be investigated by special Commission ofEnquiry, it has been decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government,as an exceptional act of mercy, after taking all circumstancesinto consideration and in particular terrible experience under-gone by survivors, not to proceed with proposal to send these particular persons overseas to a British Colony. They will accordingly be allowed to stay in Palestine subject to existing regulations, and their number will be deducted from the nextimmigration quota that will be granted.2. Position remains unchanged as regards all other illegal immigrants, and the intention remains to send them overseasas soon as the necessary shipping is available.&quot;This draft was approved by the War Cabinet, subject to the insertion of the words in italics.The War Cabinet: (1) Reaffirmed their decision that the illegal immigrants saved from S.S. Patria should be allowed to remain inPalestine on the usual conditions, subject to a carefulscrutiny to make sure whether any enemy agents or otherundesirable persons were among them.(2) Approved the terms of the public announcement proposedin regard to the immigrants on the S.S. Patria.(3) Agreed that the Proclamation issued by the High Commis-sioner on the 20th November should stand, and that noexplanatory statement should be issued other than theannouncement referred to in (2).Parliament. 8.   The War Cabinet were informed that an amendment,Debate on the standing in the names of Messrs. McGovern. Stephen and Maxton,Kings Speech, would be called on Thursday, the 5th December. This amendment(Motion for an regretted that the King&apos;s Speech .... &quot;failed to set forth the address.) terms on which peace would be made .... and failed to proposethat a conference should be called to bring an early conclusion ofthis conflict . . . .&quot;The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion as to how this amendment should be handled. While no formal conclusion wasrecorded, the view generally expressed was that it would be a mistake to debate the amendment in Secret Session. The aim should be toavoid giving the impression that any special importance attachedto it. Arrangements might be made for a number of back-benchersto speak against the amendment, but only one member of the Govern-ment to speak against it. It would be undesirable that the PrimeMinister should wind up the debate.Richmond Terrace. S.W. 1December 2, 1940.
