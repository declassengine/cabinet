Wellingtons had attacked Naples andhad obtained hits on a concentration of cruisers and destroyers, with good results. An Italian communique had admitted a hit on oneunit, which had caused 50 casualties.Details of the fighting in Libya were at the moment difficult toobtain owing to the use of advance landing grounds. The totalcasualties for the 13th and 14th December were : Our own 4 fighters (3 pilots safe).2 Blenheims.1 Ly sander.Enemy 34 certain.5 probable.7 damaged.Figures were given of the number of fighters now available for operations in Libya and of reinforcements on their way.Naval The Navy had continued to give support to the military opera-Operations        tions in Egypt and Libya, and were supplying forward troops andevacuating prisoners.H.M.S.

Military Halfaya had been cleared. Sollum and Fort Capuzzo were stillOperations. being held by the enemy. The weather in the desert had turned from egypt and a sandstorm to rain, which made the supply situation especiallyLibya. difficult, and added to the difficulties of moving troops forward.Although our losses had been slight, many light tanks had been temporarily put out of action. Enemy air attacks were at presentthe chief menace, and difficulty had been experienced in the disposalof prisoners which might now number over 30,000. The equipmentcaptured had not yet been counted, but probably included over 100guns and 50 tanks. Our casualties, excluding those suffered by the armoured Division, amounted to 500.The Prime Minister said that these operations constituted an event of first-class importance, and the results had been more than we had dared to hope.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the above statements.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to send a message,on behalf of the War Cabinet, congratulating all ranks of the Royal Air Force, Middle East, on the part theywere playing in conjunction with the other Services inthe victorious operations in the Western Desert.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 302ndConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Home Secretary said that on the previous night 11London boroughs had been bombed, but no extensive damage hadbeen done. The enemy&apos;s main attack had been on SheffieldOne hundred and fifty fires had been started, but by 2-30 that morning they had been got under control. Some damage had beendone to steel works and to working-class property, and some 10,000people had been made homeless, in addition to the 10,000 renderedhomeless by the raid on the night of the 12th December. the casulties for the previous night had been : London : 0 killed, 0 injured.Sheffield : 24 killed, 26 injured.(So far as was at present known.)Elsewhere : 0 killed, 1 injured.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Germany.Futureizitentions.3. A short discussion ensued on this matter and is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.foreign information.blockade policy:   GermanArms consigned to Brazil.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 301stConclusions,Minute 4.)France:dismissal ofM. Laval.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hoped that the case of the Sequeira Campos was now in a fair way tobe settled on terms satisfactory to us, and that we should secure mostof the conditions which we had laid down.The Foreign Secretary referred to M. Laval&apos;s replacement as foreign Minister by M. Flandin. While he did not think that muchconfidence was to be placed in the latter, he thought that the dis-placement of the former could only be in our interests.On the other hand, in discussion it was suggested thatM. Flandin, being more &apos;&apos; respectable &apos;&apos; than M. Laval, might bemore effective in persuading French opinion to co-operate withGermany.
It was pointed out that any hopes that we might have thatM. Flandin would be better disposed to this country than M. Lavalwould be defeated if he were to be praised by the Press ofthis country.The Foreign Secretary referred to telegrams Nos. 1726 and1739 from Sir Miles Lampson, expressing the view that, on balance,there was no advantage to be gained in pressing the egyptian government to declare war against Italy at the present time.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.5. The Foreign Secretary reviewed our relations with Spainas affected by the action of the Spanish authorities at Tangier intaking over the administration of the International Zone without warning to us (see telegrams Nos. 1215, 1216 and 1239 from Madrid,and 1287 and 1297 to Madrid).The Foreign Secretary said that the actions of the Spanishauthorities at Tangier were indefensible. The real point was whether they afforded such evidence of pro-Axis sympathy that itwas useless to continue relations with the Spanish Government, andthat we should not implement our recent offer of economic help to spain.In discussion, it was pointed out that the attitude of theSpanish Government presented an unpleasing analogy with theconduct of Italy in the months before Italy&apos;s entry into the war.On the other hand, there was no doubt that the Spanish Generalsand nearly all the Spanish people wanted to keep out of the war. IfSpain wanted to assist Germany, there were many better ways of doing it than by upsetting the international regime at Tangier,possession of which had long been coveted by Spain.The Foreign Secretary said that there was no chance of theSpanish Government withdrawing their decree taking over theadministration of the International Zone. Sir Samuel Hoare had,however, asked the Spanish Government to suspend the applicationof the decrees affecting British interests.The Foreign Secretary added that, if the War cabinet approved the line of action which he proposed, they might have to choose between a break with Spain and a climb down over Tangier.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the provisional instructions sent to our Ambas-ambassador at Madrid on the previous evening (TelegramNo. 1297), the main points of which were as follows : (a) The Spanish Governments detailed proposals for meeting our requirements in Tangier should besubmitted in writing.(6) Our offer of economic assistance, including our creditproposals, should be regarded as suspended.(c) Pending consideration of (a), navicerts would begranted for wheat imports up to 1 million tons for the next 12 months, and for other food supplies.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform Sir Samuel Hoarethat he should make it plain to Senor Suner that we werenot afraid of taking on Spain, and that if they threw intheir lot with our enemies we had it in our power, andshould not hesitate, to deal with them as we were nowdealing with the Italians.
Parliament.christmas recess.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 3O0thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Prime Minister said that a review of the volume ofbusiness to be transacted before the adjournment for the easter recess made it necessary for the House to re-assemble on Tuesday,the 21st January.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Means Test.determination of Needs Bill.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 300thConclusions.Minute 1.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the WarCabinet that he had been invited to consult with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury and others concerned as to the best meansof communicating to the House the general form of Regulations tobe made under the Determination of Needs Bill, consistently withestablished Parliamentary procedure. After discussion with theLord Privy Seal and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury,it had been agreed that, simultaneously with the presentation of theBill, a White Paper should be presented to Parliament. This wouldcontain the detailed information which would not normally appearuntil the Assistance Board had recommended Regulations in accord-ance with the terms of the Act. This was a new procedure, but those concerned were satisfied that it was desirable to take this step to meet the difficulty which would otherwise arise if Parlia-ment were called upon to pass the Bill without any knowledge of theform which the Regulations to be made under the Act would take.The War Cabinet approved the course proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 16, 1940.
