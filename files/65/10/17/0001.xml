The information so far received was very scrappy,in the The course of events was at the moment obscure, and it was difficultMediterranean, at the moment to visualise what had happened.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that during the night ofthe 24th/25th Belgian fishing vessels had been attacked by enemywarships. A number of our destroyers had been at sea, but had seennothing, and in a subsequent sweep had not intercepted any enemy forces. Our destroyers had made a further sweep on the night of the25th/26th, again without result.The Free French training ship Medoc bad been sunk by a torpedo from an enemy aircraft off Rame Head on the previous evening. Assistance had been sent and 48 survivors had been picked up, but 39 were missing.An aircraft reconnaissance off Taranto on the previous day had shown 3 battleships in the harbour, one of the Littorio Class beingsurrounded by small craft and two others beached.The Rhododendron had reported that she had obtained a firmcontact with a U-boat on the morning of the 21st about 240 miles north-west of Bloody Foreland. Three depth charges had been firedand wreckage had been sighted immediately afterwards. It was probable that the U-boat had been destroyed.The Rangitane (British, 16,712 tons) had reported on the evening of the 16th. that she was being attacked by an enemy raider300 miles east of East Cape, North Island, New Zealand.

Air Raids: 3.   The Lord President of the Council gave an account of the repair of , Meetings which he had held with Ministers concerned and withdamage. representatives of the gas industry in order to make special arrange-Establishment ments to expedite the repair of public utility services.   At all theof a Mobile three cities which had been subjected to recent heavy air attacksColumn. (Birmingham, Coventry and Bristol) the repairs to public utilities(Previous were nOW wel] in hand-Reference- Lord President of the Council said he would not be in aWM f40) 295th position to submit a full Report to the War Cabinet as to theConclusions       establishment of a mobile column until he had obtained certainMinute 10&quot;)&apos;      further data, e.g., as to the amount of skilled labour available capableof repairing public utilities.In discussion, the Prime Minister explained that, in speakingof a mobile column, he did not mean that experts and workers wouldbe withdrawn from their normal occupation and kept idle; but thatthey would be earmarked as ready to proceed to any centre at short notice and understudies instructed to take their places.The Lord President explained that preparations were already being made on these lines. Thus, the central water, gas and electricity authorities had lists of experts who were ready to move at short notice, although the arrangements had not been fullycompleted.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, it was agreed that theMinister of Aircraft Production should attend a further conference which the Lord President was holding on the following day.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to circulate a written Report for consideration by the War Cabinet on:; Monday, the 2nd December, on the steps taken to establish a mobile column to repair damage to public utility services.(previous reference:The Press. 4.   The Prime Minister said that, in his considered view, noLibellous Minister was under an obligation to expose himself to the trouble ofc-u-toon taking action in regard to a cartoon of this nature, more especiallyin war time.   In essence, the cartoon really amounted to no morethan a vulgar insult.   It would, of course, be a different matter ifcurrency was given to a circumstantial account to which someW.M. (40) 295th cre(jence might be attached.   On the whole, his strong advice was conclusions,      that the Minister was under no obligation to take action in this case,Minute 13.)       an(j        ^e ^es^ course would be not to institute proceedings for criminal libel.The Attorney-General said that prosecutions by Ministers for criminal libel were very largely a question of policy, subject,perhaps, to the exception that there was a bias in favour of prose-cution where corruption was alleged. In the present case,.however,the allegation was a very vague one.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he wascontent to accept the advice of the Prime Minister on this matter,which was endorsed by the War Cabinet.
Palestine.Illegal    ...immigration:sinking ofS.S. Patria.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 295thConclusions,Minute 8.15. The War Cabinet further considered the position of illegalJewish immigrants into Palestine.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the volume ofthis immigration had increased since the German occupation of roumania. There was now a formidable traffic, organised as a regular trade, in ships which were often unseaworthy or on whichconditions were indescribable, The total number of jewish immigrants into Palestine over the period of five years contemplated in the White Paper was 75,000, but nearly half that number had entered in under 18 months. Most of these illegal immigrants came from Central Europe, and it was reasonable to assume that theenemy had taken steps to ensure the presence among them of anumber of enemy agents.The Secretary of State added that Dr. Weizmann, when he had seen him a. few days ago, although he had not assented to the pro-posal to send these illegal immigrants to Mauritius, had said that in substance he could not dissent from it. He had, however, takenexception to the wording of a Proclamation issued by the HighCommissioner for Palestine as to the action to be taken in regard toillegal immigrants.In discussion, some objection was seen to the terms of thisProclamation, which had stated that the illegal Jewish immigrantswho were being sent to Mauritius would not be allowed to enterPalestine or to remain in the Colony after the war. It was urgedthat the Proclamation should not have taken away from these people the right to take their chance with other applicants of obtainingentry to Palestine in a legal way.It was also suggested that the proposal to keep these illegal immigrants in an internment camp in Mauritius was perhapsunduly severe.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that it was impos-sible to put large numbers of aliens, many of them enemy aliens, ina British Colony in wartime without making arrangements for theirdue surveillance. All possible steps were being taken to treat themin a humane way.Discussion followed as to whether the illegal immigrants whohad been saved after the S.S. Patria had sunk in Haifa harbourshould be deported to Mauritius or be allowed to remain inPalestine.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was afraid that theGovernments policy in regard to the suppression of illegal immigra-tion would be gravely weakened if these people were allowed to stay in Palestine. If this were allowed, he feared that it was only toolikely to encourage further acts of sabotage by other illegal immigrants, in order to obtain a similar concession. He would atleast like to discuss the matter with the High Commissioner, witha view to seeing whether some could be allowed to remain and the others sent to Mauritius.After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) The Proclamation which had been issued by the HighCommissioner for Palestine should stand, but a suitableexplanatory statement should be issued.(2) The illegal immigrants who had been saved from theS.S. Patria should be allowed to remain in Palestine, onthe usual conditions, subject to a careful scrutiny (inwhich the Jewish authorities might be asked to assist) tomake sure whether any enemy agents or other undesirablepersons were among them.(3) The action in (2) could be justified as a special act ofclemency, having regard to the sufferings which theseimmigrants had undergone in the S.S. Patria.
(4) That the above should be the only exception made to thepolicy of the Proclamation, and that in future all otherillegal immigrants attempting to enter Palestine shouldbe diverted to Mauritius or elsewhere.(5) In the meantime, measures should be taken with a view to making the conditions of internment in Mauritius as little burdensome as possible.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 27, 1940.
