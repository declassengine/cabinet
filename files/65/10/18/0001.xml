Preliminary reports indicated that this attack had been successful. The remainder of our bombershad attacked the Channel Ports.  One of our machines was missing.Two machines from the Coastal Command had succeeded insinking a 5,000-ton enemy merchant vessel off Terschelling and a7,600-ton oil tanker off Wilhelmshaven.The Chief of Naval Staff reported that detailed news of thecontact between our naval forces and those of the enemy in theMediterranean was still awaited.On the 27th a fire had broken out in the engine room of theminelayer Port Napier. The ship had been abandoned. There hadbeen no casualties.Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Sinking of theS.S. Patria.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 297thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Charles F. Meyer (British tanker of 10,516 tons) had reported on the previous afternoon that she was being attacked by aU-boat 210 miles north-west of Bloody Foreland. A destroyer hadbeen ordered to proceed to her assistance, but had so far failed to locate her.The Glenmoor (British, 4,393 tons) had been reported to havebeen torpedoed 160 miles west of Blacksod Bay on the previous evening.The Diplomat (British, 8.240 tons) had been torpedoed 140 miles north-west of Bloody Foreland on the previous evening. She was still afloat, however, and two tugs had been sent to her assistance.Twenty-seven survivors of the Port Brisbane, which had been sunk by an enemy raider on the 21st, had been picked up&apos; byCanberra. It had been reported that this raider had sunk a secondship in the same neighbourhood.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that of the1,903 passengers on the S.S. Patria 1,555 were now in a concentra-tion camp, 34 had been arrested, 22 were dead, 25 were in hospital,and 267 were unaccounted for, of whom 13 had escaped fromhospital. The majority of the missing had probably decamped andwere not drowned. There had been a few British casualties. Sofar as public opinion had developed, the reaction to this episode hadbeen mixed.[21967]b 2
Italy-Greece. Tn the Northern and Pindus sectors, the Greeks had made further advances. In the Epirus they were meeting with moreresistance.There had been an unconfirmed report concerning the impend-ing arrival in Albania of a motorised division from Italy.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raids.Casualties.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 297thConclusions,Minute 2.)2.   The Minister of Home Security reported the following air-raid casualties during the past twenty-four hours : By day : 2 injured only.By night  Killed. Injured.London area    ...       ... 15 62Elsewhere       ...       ... 10 17Further casualties might be reported from Plymouth.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.foreign information.Spain:Dr. Negrin.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 295thConclusions,Minute 7.)Spain:  food situation:United states attitude.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 291stConclusions,Minute 3.)Italy:   questionof bombingRome.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 278thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs said that neitherthe Canadian nor the United States Government were prepared toreceive Dr. Negrin. He proposed to explain the position toSir Samuel Hoare. Unless Sir Samuel raised very strong objectionto Dr. Negrin&apos;s continued residence in this country, he did not, inview of the discussion at the War Cabinet on the 1st November,propose to pursue the question further.The Foreign Secretary drew attention to a telegram from washington, reporting that the United States Government had toldtheir Minister at Madrid not to press for a public declaration ofpolicy in regard to non-belligerency.The Foreign Secretary said that in the course of an interviewon the previous day with the Apostolic Delegate he had said that public opinion in this country was surprised at the distinction whichthe Pope appeared to draw between the suggestion that our AirForce should drop bombs on Rome and the bombing by the enemy of historic monuments and religious buildings in this country. TheApostolic Delegate, who had said that he would report this view,had volunteered that he assumed that, now that Italian aeroplaneshad bombed London, the position was different. He (the foreign secretary) had said that this was so.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Air Raids. 4.   The War Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum by thePress reports. Minister of Information about the censorship of Press Reports(Previous of air raid damage (W.P.  (G.) (40) 314).   The MemorandumReference: set out the principles and practice which had been agreed betweenW M (40) 290th the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Home Security,Conclusions,      an(i draft instructions to the Press.Minute 3.) T]ie Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security said that the matter had been carried a stage
further at the Meeting of the Civil Defence Committee on theprevious day. Two points were at issue. The first had been whetherthe names of places which had been bombed should be mentioned inthe Press. In the case of Coventry, it had. been agreed that the nameshould be published, because the raid had been one of outstandingimportance, and it was clear that the enemy must be aware that theyhad in fact bombed Coventry. It had, however, been decided not to publish the fact that Bristol and Birmingham had been bombed.The position had then been made more acute by a statement in a broadcast from this country to the United States which had mentioned the fact that Birmingham and Bristol had been bombed.Again, when it was decided not to publish the names of townsbombed, the newspapers were beginning to evade the prohibition byquoting the German wireless, which mentioned the places by name.The policy proposed for the future was to publish the names of places bombed rather more freely, provided that it was clear that publication would convey no information to the enemy. TheMinister thought that no difficulty would be encountered in applyingthis principle. But he agreed that if any difference arose, the AirMinistry should have the preponderant voice.The second point at issue concerned the publication by the news-papers of details which conveyed information to the enemy. Oneexample was a statement in the Daily Mail that the water supply atBristol had been exhausted. A second example was the statement that the factories at Coventry had suffered only slight damage.It was clear that a great deal of the news which was being published conveyed information to the enemy. He thought that theright course would be that the Secretary of State for Air, theMinister of Information and himself should arrange to discuss thematter with newspaper editors and should explain the matter tothem in a frank and friendly way, making it clear to them that itwas essential that they should exercise far more restraint in thedetails in regard to air-raid damage which they published, in orderto prevent useful information being conveyed to.the enemy.This suggestion met with approval.The Prime Minister suggested that a list might be compiled,for communication to the Press, indicating the kinds of points which would be likely to give information to the enemy.In the course, of discussion, reference was made to the Debate inthe House of Commons on the previous day on man-power. Theview was expressed that almost any statement made in debate onthis subject was apt to be dangerous from the point of view of givinginformation or encouragement to the enemy, and that there waseverything in favour of holding debates on such subjects in secret,and for giving statements to the Press for their guidance as to what should be said on such matters.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Memorandum by theMinister of Information (W.P. (G.) (40) 314).(2) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security,the Secretary of State for Air, and the Minister ofInformation to arrange to meet the newspaper editorsand discuss matters with them on the basis indicated in discussion.
Aliens: intern- 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a report by Lord Snellment of enemy  on the conditions prevailing at Huyton Camp (W.P. (40) 403).aliens. The War Cabinet were reminded that, when the House ofHuyton Camp Commons had been informed that Lord Snell had been invited toInquiry. conduct an inquiry into the Andora Star, no reference had been made(Previous to the fact that he had also been asked to enquire into the conditionsReference:        a^ Huyton Camp.   In the circumstances, it was felt that the bestW.M. (40) 224th plan was probably to take no action in regard to the publication of conclusions,      ^is Report, at any rate for the time being.Minute 5.) The War Cabinet-Took note of the Report and decided that no action shouldbe taken in regard to it, at any rate for the time being.Man Power. 6.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatMr. David Gray, the American Minister in Dublin, bad approachedMr. de Valera on the question of the use by British forces of the eire ports. Although he had pressed the point strongly, he had found Mr. de Valera totally unreceptive to these ideas.Mr. de Valera had not thought that America&apos;s entry into the war would make any difference. The Dominions Secretary said that he proposed to instruct Sir John Maffey to allow matters to stand asthey were, without giving any reassurance to Mr. de Valera.The Prime Minister said that, if Eire had been willing to comeinto the war, he thought that public opinion might well have broughtabout a united Ireland; but that if Eire insisted on retaining her neutrality, public opinion would be most strongly opposed to puttingany constraint upon Northern Ireland to join in a united Ireland.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Eire.&quot; TreatyPorts.&quot;(previous reference:W.M.
