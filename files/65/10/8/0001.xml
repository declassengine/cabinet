(40) 286thConclusions,Minute 2.)shipping losses.GermanMeteorologicalExpedition.Air Operations.Greece.1. The Chief of the Naval Staff reported that at dawn on the12th November the Fleet Air Arm had carried out a very successful attack with torpedoes and bombs on the Italian Fleet in Tarantoharbour.From a photographic reconnaissance on the previous day itappeared that : (a) 1 Littorio class Battleship was down by the bows with herforecastle awash and a heavy list.(b) 1 Cavour class Battleship was beached with her after turretunder water.(c) The stern of another Cavour class Battleship just showedin the photograph, and it seemed certain that she also had been beached.(d) 2 Cruisers were listed to starboard in the Inner Harbour,surrounded by oil fuel.(e) 2 Auxiliaries had their sterns under water.The devastating effect of the attack was rather surprising inview of the fact that only 18-inch aerial torpedoes had been used.Two Swordfish aircraft had been lost during the operation.A further attack was to have been carried out the previous night, but so far no news of this had been received.The convoy from Flalifax attacked by the Admiral Scheer onthe 5th November had consisted of 38 ships, one of which had becomedetached before the attack had been carried out. Of the remaining-37 ships, 24 were now in port and four others had been located at sea. Five ships were definitely known to have been sunk by theraider, and one bombed and sunk later in the North-western approaches. The fate of the other three ships still remainsuncertain.A number of heavy mines had been laid in the North-western approaches.Tetrarch had reported that on the 4th November she had attacked an east-bound convoy of two laden and escorted merchantvessels in the Gulf of Sidra, and had sunk one 3,000-ton ship, andpossibly a second.The Free French at Libreville had reported that the VichyFrench sloop Bougainville, which had been damaged during the capture of the town, was resting on a sandy bottom, but should be easily salvable.A destroyer had reported that during the attack on the previous friday on the east coast convoy, she had shot down two Junkers 87&apos;s.The Creemuir (British 3,997 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk off Aberdeen on the night of the 11th. The Harlaw (British,1,141 tons) had been damaged by a bomb, but had arrived atAberdeen. The Lily (Greek 5,719 tons) had been bombed and set on fire the previous night.Information had been received that the Germans were sending a second meteorological expedition to Greenland. Steps were beingtaken to deal with it.The Chief of the Air Staff reported that only 46 enemy machines had been over this country on the previous day. We had destroyed one and damaged another.The previous night 120 machines had been over this country.Our fighters had made no interceptions.The previous night 78 bombers had been detailed to attacktargets in Germany and occupied France. The weather had beenbad and no reports on the results had yet been received. Two of our machines had not yet returned.On the 11th November our bombers, based in Greece, had madea successful raid on Valona and Sordinori. Two large ships had[21926] b 2
MilitaryOperations.Middle East.Sudan.Italy-Greece.Bulgaria.Turkey.been seen burning fiercely, and the intensity of the fire suggestedthat they had been tankers. On the previous day Blenheims andWellingtons had attacked Durazzo, and had gutted a fuel dump.They had also attacked Valona, setting on fire a fuel and petroldump.The Chief of the General Staff reported that there had been aconsiderable increase in wireless traffic between Rome and Libyasince the 9th November.Our forces now occupied Gallabat, and the enemy were in the adjoining town of Metemma on the Italian side of the border. Onthe 11th November advance elements of an Indian infantry battalionhad ambushed and inflicted heavy casualties on an enemy force,estimated at four companies; our casualties had been threewounded. On the morning of the 12th one company of the samebattalion had cleared the ridge overlooking the frontier from thewest. Later our artillery had engaged two enemy companiesadvancing towards the stream between Metemma and Gallabat, andhad also caused fires at Metemma.In the northern sector there had been no change.In the Pindus sector enemy detachments were still retreatingin disorder from Konitza, and the Greeks were taking manyprisoners.In the Epirus sector the Greeks were again advancing towardsthe River Kalamas along the whole front. Yannina had been twicebombed and considerable damage had been reported.Two further Italian divisions, the 47th and 56th, were on their way to Albania.A report had been received to the effect that railway and otherpreparations were being made for the movement of German troops into Bulgaria.A telegram had been received from our Military Attache atAnkara stating that the Roumanian Military Attache had seen theItalian Military Attache, who had admitted that there was intensenervousness in Italy that the British Fleet and Air Force would cut off Italian reinforcements for Albania. The ports of Valonaand Durazzo together could only handle four ships at a time. BothBari and Brindisi were being used as ports of embarkation. TheItalian Military Attache had also admitted that the Italians hadnot expected the Greeks to resist.General Smith had had a successful visit to Turkey, but unfortunately had been unable to see Marshal Chakmak.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Invited the Minister of Information to give special attention to publicity in the Middle East for thesuccessful attack on the Italian ships at Taranto.Invited the Secretary of State for War to considerwhether a message should be sent to India, announcing the successful action of the Indian brigade at Gallabat.(i)(ii)(iii)Mediterranean. 2.   The Prime Minister said that the &apos;&apos; Naval occasion &apos;&apos; atPossible effects Taranto (see Minute 1) might redound to our advantage in manyof Taranto ways. First, it might influence Japan, who would realise that theaction. paper strength of the Italian fleet was not to be reckoned upon, andthat we might well be in a position to send heavy ships from theEastern Mediterranean to the Far East. Secondly, it might have some effect on Russia. Thirdly, it brought home the importance ofhitting the Italians as hard as we could. If the Greeks could maintain themselves against Italy throughout the winter, thesituation in this quarter might develop greatly in our favour.   We
should press this advantage all we could. The co-ordination ofsupplies to Greece was being dealt with by a Committee under theChairmanship of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. ThePrime Minister proposed that the Defence (Operations) Committeeshould consider what more we could do (a) to help the Greeks, and(b) to harass Italy.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Foreign 3.

He had concluded,however, that this action might embarrass the Turks, and he had telegraphed to Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen asking what diplomatic action we could take to help Turkey in this contingency.   It wouldalso be useful if the Chiefs of Staff would consider what military(Previous steps eould be taken.

As regards a demon-stration of Anglo-American solidarity with China, the last sentence of the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 4 would perhapshave been better expressed if he had said that we should make some statement as soon as we were affording practical help.He thought that the financial proposals, when ready to be putinto effect, should be notified to Japan in as unprovocative a way as possible. Thus it should be explained that the loan had a directbearing on our own interests, and that the export credits would assist the British export market.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was important to explain to the United States that we were able to give this financial help to China only because of the form which that helpwas to take; otherwise the fact that we had made these loans mightland us in difficulties in our forthcoming financial discussions withthe United States Government.

Supply of In discussion, three suggestions were made as to the supply of aircraft. aircraft to China.   First, when we had re-equipped our forces inthe Middle East, the obsolete aircraft displaced might be sent to china. (Spares might be a difficulty.) Secondly, could Russiasupply more aircraft ? Thirdly, were there any aircraft in Americawhich would be of no value to us but which might be useful to china 1   It was agreed that these suggestions should be explored.The Prime Minister thought the War Cabinet should approve the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals. The advantage of China&apos;sfriendship to us after the war might be very great indeed. Japan&apos;attitude would, in the last analysis, depend on whether she believedin the mobility of our sea power.The Secretary of State for India and Burma made the followingpoints :-(1) It would be helpful if China&apos;s commercial needs could bemade known as early as possible, while the Delhi Con-ference was still sitting.(2) If China was allowed to buy much oil from Burma, India(which depended on oil from Burma) might have to makedollar purchases of oil.(3) The Loiwing aircraft factory had been bombed, and theChinese Government might want to move it to India.(4) In his Paper, the Foreign Secretary had deprecated thedespatch of economic and communications missions atthe present time. With the concurrence of the governor of Burma a proposal had just been made to theForeign Office for the despatch to Chungking from burma of a local mission which would indicate goodwill and would have for its main purpose the discussion oflocal communications questions. Was there any objection to this?The Foreign Secretary saw none.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked for time to consult the Dominions before our proposals were communicated tothe Chinese.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved in principle the proposals in the foreign secretary&apos;s Paper, and in particular the grant to Chinaof a loan for currency purposes and of credits forsterling purchases,(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andthe Secretary of State for India to consult the Govern-ments of the Dominions and of India in regard to theseproposals.The Allies.Meeting ofAllied Eepre-sentatives.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 284thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for foreign ffairs said that it had been hoped to arrange the Meeting of allied representatives for Friday, the 15th November, but this was not now possible. It was hoped that the Meeting might be held one-day early in the following week.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,November 13, 1940.
