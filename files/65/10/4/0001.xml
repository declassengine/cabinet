1. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on the previous day the only large scale attack had been a fighter sweep in EastKent, which had synchronised with an attack on the Southamptonarea by a small bombing force escorted by fighters. The casualtiesfor the previous day had been : Our Own 4 machines (1 pilot safe).Enemy 4 certain.2 probable.3 damaged.Home On the previous night 150 enemy machines had been over thisCommands.       country including only 30 over London.   A further 10 enemy machines had been over London early that morning.   One inter-ception had been made by a Hurricane which had been indecisive.On the previous night 65 of our bombers had been despatched to attack enemy targets.   Owing to bad weather most of them had attacked secondary targets but one had bombed Berlin and anotherLeuna.   Three of our machines had been lost.Middle East. Six Wellingtons had been despatched to Greece to operate fromGreek aerodromes.   No bombing of Italy from Malta had takenplace on the previous night.The accidents to the Wellington bombers a few days ago at(Previous Malta had been due to the machines carrying too heavy a load for reference: the size of the aerodromes. Orders had been issued to prevent suchW.M. (40) 282nd happenings in future.Conclusions, A new Italian vessel had been sighted in the harbour atMinute l.) Kismayu. No particulars had been reported, but if enemy tankersor cargo vessels with consignments of cased fuel were to get into thisharbour, the scale of Italian air operations might be greatlyextended.The War Cabinet requested the Admiralty to examine the pos-sibility of denying this harbour to enemy ships.Naval The Chief of Naval Staff reported that there had been noOperations. further news from the convoy which had been attacked by theRaider in the Admiral Scheer on the previous evening. There were indicationsAtlantic. that the raider had moved to a position approximately 120 miles north-west of where the attack had taken place. The War cabinet were informed of the dispositions which had been made in order&apos;to intercept the raider. ..,      1 The Wivem had reported serious damage, believed to be dueto sabotage. -Shipping losses.        There had been no attacks by U-boats on the previous day, but;heavy attacks on convoys had been made by enemy aircraft. Thefollowing ships had been set on fire : Clan Mackinlay (British 6,365 tons).Harborough (British 5,415 tons).Nalon (British 7,222 tons).Olga S. (British 2,252 tons).Some of them might be salvaged.A convoy passing Dover the previous night had been shelledby enemy coastal batteries, but no damage, had been reported.The Prime Minister said that these air attacks on convoysemphasised the necessity for further convoy protection by aircraft and. guns, and made it all the more important that our fighter air-craft should work from the Irish coast.Submarine Sttirgeon had reported that she had sunk a 2,000 ton supplyoperations. ship on the 2nd November, and a 1,200 ton supply ship on the6th November whilst on patrol off the south coast of Norway.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.
MilitaryOperations.Egypt.Sudan.Italy-Greece.Crete.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that an enemycolumn of 54 vehicles had been successfully engaged by our artillery and tanks 22 miles south-east of Sidi Barrani. The enemy had withdrawn.There had been patrol encounters in the Sudan.Air reconnaissance had shown 16 ships in Valona harbour,indicating the arrival of extensive Italian reinforcements.In the northern sector the Greeks had advanced to a general line west of Lake Mikra Prespa, excluding Bilisht. The latter place,although in enemy hands, was under fire. A considerable numberof Italian prisoners had been taken and two mountain guns. TheGreek losses had been few.In the Pindus sector an isolated Alpini detachment had been located at Dystraton.  Over 100 Italians had been taken prisoner.In the Epirus sector the Italians had made a bridgehead overthe River Kalamos as the result of dive-bombing attacks and machine-gun fire from aircraft. The Greeks were getting worriedby these attacks, and the atmosphere at Greek headquarters wasone of rather diminished satisfaction. It looked as though themain Italian attack would be made on the Epirus front.The Greeks wished to withdraw 9 battalions from Crete for transfer to the Epirus front. A i^reserve Division was to be formedat once in Crete, but no equipment was available.If Greek troops were withdrawn from Crete, they must bereplaced. A telegram had been sent to the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East, asking him to report wha,t forces he could make avail-able for this purpose from his Command.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff emphasised the risks involved in any further depletion of our forces in Egypt and palestine.The War Cabinet were also informed that, as Greece was notat war with Germany, Germans were still at large in Greece as awhole, and in Crete. It was suggested that discreet action shouldbe taken to restrain the Germans in Crete.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Middle East.Possibility of enemy advancethrough the balkans and syria.Proposedcounter-measures.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 268th&quot;Conclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff on the possibility of a German advance through the balkans and Syria to the Middle East (W.P. (40) 431).The Prims Minister said that the Defence Committee(Operations) had recommended that the War Cabinet should give general approval to the Report, and in particular should authorisethe following action : (i) The preparation of plans for giving assistance to Turkey.(ii) Examination   of   methods   of   increasing   supplies   ofarmaments to Turkey.(iii) The formation of a mission to Turkey which should beestablished in the Middle East as soon as possible and made ready to move into Turkey at once in the eventof the Turks becoming involved in the war. The TurkishGovernment to be sounded as to whether they would receive this mission now.(iv) The preparation of plans for the demolition of Turkishcommunications.(v) The taking of measures on the lines suggested in para-graph 9 of the Report to prevent the French Authoritiesin Syria from menacing our interests. v(vi) The perfecting of plans for the destruction of Iraqi oilwells, and pipe lines in Iraq, Syria and Palestine.  .(vii) The taking of firm measures towards Iraq, on the lines proposed in paragraph 10 of the Report.
The War Cabinet-(a) Accepted the recommendations of the Defence Committee(Operations) as set out above.(&amp;) Authorised the Dominions Secretary to telegraph to theDominion Governments informing them of the substance of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff, and of the actionwhich was being taken on it.The Allies.proposed meeting ofAllied Repre-sentatives.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 280thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Permanent Undersecretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the Greek Minister had informed him that hisGovernment did not wish to be represented at the proposed Meetingof Allied Representatives in London. This attitude might be dueto the fact that most of the representatives at the Meeting wouldbe exiled from their own country. Or it might be because Greecewas not at war with Germany. He had told the Greek minister that he thought that we should regret it if no Greek Representativeattended. This absence would be conspicuous, and we should probably press them to reconsider their decision. A telegram inthis sense had been sent to Sir M. Palairet.The Prime Minister thought that the fact that the GreekGovernment were not at war with Germany would be a sufficient reason for the absence of their representative from the Meeting,and that it was undesirable to put pressure on them to reconsider their decision.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that a longtelegram had been received from Mr. Mackenzie King (No. 197)criticising the proposal to hold the Meeting at all, and the termsof the proposed Resolution, but without making any alternative suggestions.The Prime Minister thought that, if the Canadian High Com-missioner did not attend the Meeting, Mr. Mackenzie King might find difficulty in explaining his absence to the Canadian people.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Greek Government should not be pressed to send a representative to the Meeting of allied representatives.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to send a reasoned reply to Mr. Mackenzie King, but making itclear that the Meeting would be held, irrespective of whether the Canadian High Commissioner attended.United States 4.   The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a personalof America. message which he had sent to President Roosevelt, congratulatingPresidential him on his re-election as President of the United States for a thirdElection. term.(previous reference: - -W.M. (40) 283rd _____Conclusions,Minute 3.)Oil.100 Octane fuel:completion ofthe ThorntonPlant.5.   The War Cabinet had before them Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production(W.P. (G.) (40) 281).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (G.)(40) 292).Memorandum by the Chairman of the Oil Control Board(WP. (G.) (40) 287).
The Minister of Aircraft Production considered that it wouldnot be good business to proceed with the erection of the Thorntonplant, which could not be ready before the last months of 1942.The arguments which weighed with him were : (1) The estimated cost of erection was  9,000,000, and mightwell be exceeded. The present commitment was 3,500,000. Large sums might be saved by stoppingconstruction.(2) The scheme had been started to meet a possible embargoby the United States on the export of aviation fuel.This could now be ruled out.(3) Even allowing for an increased domestic consumption, anample surplus ought to be available in the United states to meet our demands from 1942 onwards.(4) Tankers were available for bringing 100 octane fuel fromthe United States. The fuel in this form took lessshipping than crude oil.(5) There would be a saving of plant and labour, of which our supplies were limited, if we decided to rely to a greater extent on production in the United States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forAir, the President of the Board of Trade and the Secretary for petroleum, (as Chairman of the Oil Control Board) recommended the completion of the Thornton plant, for the following reasons :  (1) The plant would remain as a national asset after the war.(2) The purchase in the United States of the quantity of 100octane fuel contemplated by the Minister of aircraft production would involve a substantial dollar commit-ment.(3) We did not know what the United States supply wouldbe in future years, or what would be the demands upon it. Attention was drawn to Sir Andrew Agnew&apos;estimate of the American position in 1943. (Para-graph 2 of W.P. (G.) (40) 287.)(4) We ought to insure against interruption of production atHeysham, by bombing or otherwise.The Minister without Portfolio said that it was impossible togive equally high priority for labour and construction materials to both Heysham and Thornton. In his view, we ought to pushahead first with the completion of Heysham.   This was agreed.The War Cabinet-(a) Decided against stopping the completion of the ThorntonPlant.(&amp;) Decided that the completion of the Heysham Plant must on no account be delayed by work on the Thornton Plant,which was of lower priority.Aliens.Arandora Starinquiry.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 224thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by Lord Snell&apos;(W.P. (40) 432) into the method of selection of aliens to be sent overseas in the Arandora Star, in accordance with the request madeto him by the War Cabinet in August.The Report dealt with the action taken by M.I.5 in respectof the selection of &quot;dangerous &quot; Italians. The War Cabinet were reminded that, subject to the Ministerial responsibility of the lord president of the Council, Lord Swinton had been entrusted withthe executive control of M.I.5.   (See W.P. (40) 271.)
The War Cabinet were informed that Parliament had been told that this Inquiry was being held, but that no undertaking had beengiven to publish the Report. Public interest in this matter seemedto have died down, and it would be a pity to revive it.The War Cabinet-Took note of the Report, and decided that no further action should be taken in regard to it, at any rate for thepresent.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 7, 1940.
