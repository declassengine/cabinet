The Prime Minister said that he thought that the fullestpublicity should be given to the damage caused in the City by thisraid and photographs published of the damage suffered by Guildhalland other well-known places in the City.As no military objectives had been aimed at, and the enemymust have known what he was attacking, there was no object insecrecy.The War Cabinet Agreed that the fullest publicity, including the publicationof photographs, should be given to the damage caused bythe raid on London on the previous night. -Civil Defence.Fire WatchingOrganisation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 309thConclusions,Minute 10.)3. The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Home Security said that the recent raid on manchester and last night&apos;s raid on the City had made it clear that our fire-watching organisation was inadequate. He had asked the lord president to convene a meeting to deal with the matter.The Lord President of the Council said that he had held ameeting and submitted to the Prime Minister a proposal that a fire prevention Executive should be set up at once on which all departments affected would be represented. Action was urgently necessary.[22075-1]      &apos; B 2
The War Cabinet Approved in principle the immediate establishment of aFire Prevention Executive, and the creation of a properlyorganised and disciplined force for fire-watching purposes.Foreign 4    f^g Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported theInformation.      following information : (1) The negotiations between the Greeks and the Turks regard-ing the future of the Dodecanese had begun in afavourable atmosphere.(2) Telegram No. 605 from Budapest reported a depressingaccount from the United States Naval Attache at Berlinof the lack of success of our bombing raids on Berlin.Telegram No. 1648 from Berne recommended thatwe should adopt a different technique when bombingItaly where, owing to the emotional temperament, pin-prick raids on several towns simultaneously would havea greater moral effect, whereas raids of the Coventry typewere needed in Germany.(3) A telegram from Sofia reported the Apostolic delegate (an italian) as stating that peace was not impossible, even ifit could not be achieved without the removal of mussolini.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Dodecanese.(previous reference:W.M.

United States ofAmerica.PresidentRoosevelfsSpeech of29th December.Financing of contracts.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 310thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Prime Minister said that he thought that, althoughPresident Roosevelt&apos;s speech of the previous day had been in general terms, it had been satisfactory from our point of view, and he hadbeen encouraged by it. It committed the United States to implacablehostility and resistance to the Three-Power Pact, while the phraseabout keeping the United States out of a &quot; last ditch&quot; war was,perhaps, significant.The War Cabinet were informed of the latest developments ofthe negotiations on this matter. It now seemed that the Presidentmight regard it as necessary to pass a Bill through Congress. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that he thought that means couldbe found of staving off the immediate difficulty, without havingrecourse to the expedient proposed by President Roosevelt.The Prime Minister asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer todiscuss this matter with him later in the day, in connection with the telegram which he proposed to send to President Roosevelt thankinghim for his speech.United States of 7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theAmerica. Secretary of State for the Colonies on recent United States activitiesGrant of base    1VL tne West Indies and other British Dependencies (W.P. (40) 485).facilities in xiie Colonial Secretary said that up till now he had felt it hisBritish duty to go as far as possible to meet American requests.    But heTerritories. feared that if we gave way to certain .recent demands, we should(Previous fail to maintain full British sovereignty in some of the West IndianReference: Islands, and that friction would arise which would imperil our goodW.M. (40) 260th relations with the United States.Conclusions, In discussion, it was explained that agreement had now been minute 9.) reached in regard to most of the Islands. The two main outstanding points concerned Trinidad and Bermuda. At the former it had beenagreed that a camp for the 9,000 troops should be provided on atemporary basis on the site proposed by the United States in thecentre of the island. We wished that the occupation of this siteshould cease as soon as another area, which we thought was far more suitable both from the American and our point of view, had beendrained. Our action in this matter had, however, been represented as offering the Americans a &quot; swamp.&quot;At Bermuda, which formed no part of the exchange and inwhich the offer made by us had been a free one, the point at issue was whether we should allow the Americans the use of Morgan&apos;sand Tucker&apos;s Islands as a seaplane base as part of the permanent scheme. Morgan&apos;s Island was only a mile from the mainland, andif this request was granted, seaplanes would fly continuously overthe adjacent mainland to the further detriment of tourist and residential amenities.The Colonial Secretary said that he had gone into the matter very fully with Colonel Donovan, who had taken the view that wehad been most reasonable in the whole matter, and that if thePresident knew the full facts he would not support the acts of hisagents. Later, he had seen Mr. Herschel Johnson, who had also thought that we had been extremely reasonable. He felt that unless we made a stand now we should continuously be pressed for further concessions, and with results which would not be only most unfor-unfortunate throughout the Empire, but which must in his opinion leadto grave friction in due course with the United States of America.In the discussion which followed, the Foreign Secretary thoughtthat the right plan would be to make a concession on these two points, but to urge very strongly that discussion on all outstanding-matters should take place in this country.
The general view of the War Cabinet was that, while it wentagainst the grain to make further concessions in this matter, wemust be ready to do so in order to avoid the risk of providingammunition to the isolationist opponents of President Roosevelt in congress in the discussions as to the extent of United, Statesfinancial help to this country in providing munitions for the war.This issue was of overriding importance, and other matters must give way before it. If it should emerge that we were not going toget the help from America which we hoped, then our policy in regardto the grant of base facilities might have to be revised.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in con-sultation with the Secretary of State for the Colonies,to send a telegram to our Charge d&apos;Affaires at Washing-ton on the following lines : (a) We should agree to the United States proposals about the site for American troops in Trinidad,and to their request that they should be allowedto have the use of Morgan&apos;s and Tucker&apos;s Islands,Bermuda, as a seaplane base as part of thepermanent scheme.(b) We should urge that discussions on all outstanding points, including those affecting Newfoundland,should take place in this country. The reasonsfor this should be strongly stated, but should notbe put as high as a sine qua non.(2) Action on these lines would meet the position for the next ten days or so, when the position could be furtherreviewed in the light of developments in the UnitedStates.(The Secretary of State for the Colonies wished itto be put on record that he feared that action on the linesof the above decision would lead to major friction.)Broadcasting.Constitution and management ofthe B.B.C.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 290tbConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (40) 491).After a short discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in the Memorandum, thechief of which were as follows :- (a) Two new Officers should be appointed to the B.B.C.,as General Adviser and as Foreign Adviser.These Officers would have supreme direction intheir own spheres. In the event of any dispute with the Director-General, the question would bedecided by the Minister of Information :(b) Weekly meetings should  be held, under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Information :(c) The number of broadcasting stations and trans-,mitters should be increased as quickly as possible,especially for the purpose of overseas news andtalks :subject to the addition of a representative of theMinistry of Economic Warfare to the weekly meetingsreferred to under (6).
(2) Agreed that the system in force in the Air Ministry,whereby bulletins on air operations were read over by theB.B.C. to a representative of the Air Ministry before being broadcast, should be extended to the other two services.(3) Agreed that a meeting should be held, with the Minister ofInformation in the Chair, attended by the three service ministers and their advisers, and the two new Officers tobe appointed to the B.B.C., to determine the procedure to be followed by these two Officers in carrying out their duties.Ports. 9.   As requested at the last meeting of the War Cabinet, the dispersal of Lord President of the Council gave a report of the action beinggoods from taken in this matter. A Committee under the Chairmanship of theport areas. Minister of Transport had now submitted a Report, which contained(Previous ttle following two proposals : Reference: (1) Strong local controlling authorities should be established W.M.

The Home Secretary said that the Glasgow tramworkersWork after       had decided not to work after the &quot; Alert &quot; had sounded.  He was&quot;the alert.&quot;     afraid that a difficult situation would arise if this decision wasacquiesced in.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that this wasa troublesome problem. It was made more difficult by Section 6 ofthe Trade Unions Act of 1927, which operated to weaken the disciplinary power of the Unions. He would, however, take what action he could in the matter.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.lighting restrictions.Improved street lighting.(previous reference:W.M.

(G) (40) 330).The War Cabinet-Concurred in the Home Secretary&apos;s recommendation thatthis matter should be deferred until the following summer.Great Georqe Street, S.W. 1,December 30, 1940.
