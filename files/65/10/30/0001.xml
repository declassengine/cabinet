This convoy consisted of 22 ships, a number of whichhad troops on board. So far as could be ascertained at presentthe ship Empire Trooper with 2,500 men on board had been damaged.The Berwick had engaged the raider and claimed at least one hit,but had received some damage and casualties. The dispositionstaken to deal with the position would entail the postponement ofthe plans which had been made to interfere with French trade between West Africa and the Mediterranean.The Bonaventure while proceeding to the assistance of theEmpire Trooper had intercepted the German ship Baden (8,200tons) at noon of the 26th December. The crew had set their shipon fire and abandoned her. The weather had prevented boardingand the Bonaventure had, eventually torpedoed the Baden after having picked up 39 survivors.The Sarastone claimed to have hit an enemy submarine twiceon the 22nd December.

ReportedGerman troop movements.Trouble withSikh troops in hong Kong.A number of reports had., been received that German troops were moving down through ^Hungary on their way either to roumania, Yugoslavia or Bulgaria. Reports that German troops were on their way to Italy had not been confirmed.Trouble had been experienced with a number of Sikhs in HongKong. The reason given was that they objected to wearing steelhelmets. A number had been placed in custody. It was doubted whether the wearing of steel helmets was the real cause of dis-content, and steps were being taken to ascertain the real reason.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Balkans.Air bases.(previous reference:W.M.

The discussion on this matter is recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thefollowing information :  (1) Telegram No. 1405 from Athens. The President of theCouncil had said in conversation with our Minister : &quot; We must first defeat Italy and then deal with Germany.&quot;(2) Telegram No. 1822 from Bucharest stated that therecent B.B.C. reports of disturbances in Austria had been con-firmed by recent arrivals from Vienna.(3) A Telegram from Angora reported the satisfactoryinformation that the Greeks were about to open conversations with the Turks about the future of the Dodecanese.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Fpanoe* 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heRelations with thought it was important to improve our contacts with the Vichythe Vichy Government.   At the present time we had very little knowledge ofGovernment. what was going on. He hoped the Chancellor, with whom he was(Previous discussing the matter, might find it possible to send a TreasuryReference:        official to Vichy.   He also proposed to re-establish Consular repre-W.M. (40) 308th sentation in unoccupied France.  A number of French Consuls were conclusions,      already in this country and he proposed, if the War Cabinet agreed,Minute l.)        to send a British Consular Officer to Lyons.   It would be a help ifthis Officer could have the use of ciphers.   This, however, wouldinvolve a corresponding concession to the French Consuls now in thiscountry, and the advice of the Chiefs of Staff was being sought onthis matter.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal that a British Consular officers should be appointed to Lyons.

The War Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in regard to the negotiations now proceeding on this matter in washington.The present position was somewhat difficult, but it was hopedthat President Roosevelt was endeavouring so to arrange matters that he would be able to obtain in the course of a few days theauthority from Congress which he required to enable him to giveeffect to the policy which he had outlined in his public statement onthe 18th December.The War Cabinet were reminded that up till now we had given full value for everything which we had obtained from the UnitedStates.Of the fifty Destroyers which we had obtained from the UnitedStates, only nine were at present in action. A telegram was being sent to the President setting out the tale of the defects which had prevented more of these vessels from coming into immediate use.The War Cabinet took note of the position.Eire.Future policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 309thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as directed bythe War Cabinet at their previous Meeting, his Committee had discussed the position further and were submitting a Report to thePrime Minister.The Prime Minister said that it was a matter for consideration whether, in the first instance, the action taken should be limited tothe withdrawal from Eire of shipping facilities which we urgently required for our own use. It was clear, however, that action in thismatter must not be allowed to clash with the appeal which president roosevelt would probably make to Congress in the near future aboutthe financing of our munitions contracts in the United States.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 309thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat the approximate total casualties in the two raids on Manchesterwere : Dead ............       ...      529Seriouslv injured ...       ...      ...       ...      748Slightly injured    ............    1,5938.200 people had been rendered homeless.

The War Cabinet had before them the Third Report bvProduction.       the Minister of Aircraft Production (W.P. (40) 489).Dispersal of Some discussion took place on the policy of dispersal.   It wasaircraft pointed out that the Minister of Suppiy&apos;s problem differed from thatfactories. of the Minister of Aircraft Production.  The Minister of Supply&apos;s(Previous factories were already reasonably dispersed, and grave difficultiesReference: would follow if important units of production were to be set upW.M. (40) 309th at a distance from the main industrial centres. At the same time,Conclusions, where too much was concentrated in one place, there should be someMinute 9.)        degree of dispersal.   On the other hand, owing to the marked con-centration of the aircraft industry, a far greater degree of dispersalhad to be carried out in that industry.
Trafford Park was cited as an instance of a single centre inwhich too much had been concentrated. It was pointed out, however,that the industrial organisation of this country had resulted ina concentration of storage at the docks, and that the transport system had been built up on this basis. A good deal was already being done to improve, the position; e.g., an intensive investigationwas being carried out into the inland transport system, by a Com-mittee under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Transport, and steps were being taken to set up inland sorting depots.The War Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Third Report by theMinister of Aircraft Production.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to examine theposition in regard to the measures being taken to bringabout dispersal, more particularly from port areas, andto report the position to the War Cabinet on Monday next.Motor 9.   The War Cabinet approved a proposal made by the MinisterTransport: of Aircraft Production (W.P (G) (40) 333), that the production ofproduction for motor cars and transport for the Air Ministry should be transferredthe Air Ministry, from the Ministry of Aircraft Production to the Ministry of transfer of Supply,responsibilityfrom theMinister of aircraft __Production tothe Minister ofSupply.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (G) (40) 328).The Lord President of the Council said that his Memorandum,which was a Progress Report, indicated the steps taken to deal withthe position generally. Special arrangements were being made to-deal with the areas in which shortages of supply were developing.These measures included additional coal trains, which would meansome interference with passenger traffic, but not at the peak hour.Whether these measures would suffice depended on the maintenanceof seaborne supplies at the present level. Normally, the greater partof the coal consumed in the South of England comes by sea. If these supplies, which must be regarded as precarious, fell away, or ifrail transport suffered further interference, he might have to ask the Cabinet to consider recourse to more drastic measures to main-tain the supply of coal.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Memorandum by the lord president of the Council.Coal.Supplies toLondon and theSouth.(previous reference:W.M.
