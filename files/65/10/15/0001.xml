naval operations.Enemy raiders.Shipping losses.Acoustic mines.MilitaryOperations.Sudan.Italy-Greece.The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief had visited Greece andwas satisfied with the way in which our men were settling down.He had seen the King, General Metaxas and General Papagos, whowere very pleased with the situation. They had asked what weshould do if the Germans came down through Roumania and bulgaria to Salonika. They hoped to drive the Italians out of albania, and expressed the opinion that Greece would provide theonly possible land base from which a decision against germany could be obtained.The Chief of Naval Staff reported that 2 French ships hadbeen intercepted and sent into Gibraltar under an armed guard.Our patrol in this area had been suspended for the time being.On the 23rd November an aircraft on patrol had observed a violent upheaval of water 50 miles N.N.W. of North Rona and3 small black cylindrical objects had been seen on the water afterthe explosion had taken place.A surface mine-field was being laid in the Denmark Strait.This area had been declared dangerous some time ago, but steps would be taken to draw further attention to the fact.On the previous night a number of German destroyers had attacked Belgian fishing vessels 10 miles S.E. of the Wolf Rock.There had also been a report of enemy E-boats off Berry Head. Nocontact had been made with the enemy.The South African Government had agreed to release 4 Anti-submarine vessels for service in the Mediterranean.On the 24th November Port Hobart (British, 7,448 tons) had reported that she was being shelled by an enemy raider about 600miles south-east of Bermuda. Since then no further news had beenreceived of this vessel.During the last three days 2 British and 4 neutral ships hadbeen lost through mines and torpedoes, though it was possible that of the neutral ships were still afloat.Particulars were given to the War Cabinet of the good progressthat had been made in devising means for dealing with acousticmines.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that therehad been active patrolling in the Gallabat area. Metemma was now only lightly held by the enemy.The situation on the Greek front up till 10 o&apos;clock on theprevious night had been as follows : In the Northern sector Greek reconnaissance troops had pene-trated 15 kilom. west of Voskopoja without finding the enemy.Reconnaissance troops had reached Pogradets, where no enemy hadbeen found. On the roads from there to the north three advancingcolumns of the enemy had been machine-gunned by our fighter air-craft and dispersed.In the Pindus sector gradual progress continued.In the Epirus sector Greek troops were advancing on theArgyrocastro road and had met opposition from fresh Italian troops.On the coastal sector the main Greek forces had made progressbeyond Philiates. The Corfu garrison had landed some 100 men with machine guns near Buthroto, and had succeeded in cutting the communications of the enemy&apos;s right flank.Several fresh Italian formations had been identified. reports from our aircraft also showed that the Italians were landing troops at Durazzo and Valona, and that they were endeavouring to retrievethe situation by extensive reinforcements. It was vital to impedethis movement.A number of Italian atrocities had been reported. the prisoners now arriving in Athens were of inferior quality.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
blockade policy: appli-cation to Japan.S.S. NagaraMaru.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 289thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theJapanese Ambassador had that day seen the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with regard to the cargo onboard the Nagara Maru, now at Colombo. The Ambassador had now suggested that the case should be settled on the basis of removing from the ship the additional consignment of 350,000 kilog.of mercury (over and above the original consignment which we had agreed should go to Japan), but to allow the machine tools to go forward. He had urged that it would be extremely difficult toremove these tools, and that great delay would be caused thereby,which would exacerbate feeling.The Foreign Secretary said that if the Minister of economic warfare agreed, he would accept this proposal. He thought theJapanese realised that there was a limit beyond which we would not go, and that when we had a good case we were not afraid to enforceour blockade policy.The Minister of Economic Warfare agreed.The War Cabinet agreed That the. Nagara Maru should be allowed to proceed whenthe additional 350,000 kilog. of mercury had been removed.U.S.S.R.M. Molotov&apos;visit to Berlin.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 294thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the upshot of a good deal of information from different quarters wasthat probably not very much had been settled at the discussions between Hitler and Molotov in Berlin.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Balkans.Bulgaria,Turkey and yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 294thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. Further discussion took place on this matter, and is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the question whether it was to our advantage to bring Turkey into the war at this stage, and the instruc-tions thereon to be sent to our Ambassador at Angora,should be further considered by the Defence Committee(Operations) that evening.Yugoslavia. 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the ChiefsAssistance        of Staff (W.P. (40) 461) on paragraph 4 of Belgrade telegramagainst possible No. 980.   The substance of the Report was that the best way inaggression.        which this country could assist the Yugoslavs was to carry on thewar relentlessly against the Germans and Italians.    The Reportsummarised the very limited scale of direct armed assistance whichwe were in a position to afford to Yugoslavia.The War Cabinet Took note of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff, and also ofthe fact that Belgrade telegram No. 980 had been answeredby Foreign Office telegram No. 754 to Belgrade.[21956]
spain- 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the ChiefsStrategic of Staff (W.P. (40) 460) on the strategical dangers which wouldimplications of follow if Spain joined the Axis Powers. Two telegrams from SirSpain joining Samuel Floare were annexed to this Report (Madrid telegramsthe Axis Powers. Nos. 1068 and 1094).The War Cabinet took note of the Report by the Chiefs ofStaff.Spain.Dr. Negrin.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The War Cabinet were informed that the question of dr. Negrin&apos;s residence in this country was about to be raised againby a Parliamentary Question in the House of Commons and in debate in the House of Lords.The Prime Minister said that it was undesirable that thismatter should be discussed openly in Parliament. If a Question was put in the House of Commons, he would propose to reply to it in very general terms, e.g., by remarking that this country had always main-tained its right to offer asylum to political refugees from abroad.The Negrin case should not be debated in public in the House ofLords. If debate were insisted upon, it should take place in secret session.The War Cabinet-Approved the course of action proposed, and invited thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to proceed accordingly.Palestine. 8.   The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that it hadIllegal been decided that the S.S. Patria, which had been taking illegal immigration:     immigrants to Palestine, should be diverted to Mauritius,sinking of That morning an explosion had occurred in the ship, which hadS S Patria heeled over within 15 minutes, and had settled on the bottom, onlyher port-side showing above the water. Of 1,835 illegal immigrantsand a crew of 37, some 1,450 survivors had so far been accounted for.An inquiry was being held into the cause of the explosion.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Allies:meeting ofAllied Repre-sentatives.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 289thConclusions,Minute 3.)Greekrepresentation.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the Meeting which had been fixed for that morning had been postponed as the Greek Government had not beenable to decide whether or not to be represented at the Meeting. Theabsence of a Greek representative from the Meeting would be embarrassing.The War Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit to the PrimeMinister a draft of a personal message for him to send toGeneral Metaxas on this matter.
1 0 niAi* Raids. 10.   The Minister of Home Security gave the following figuresCasualties and of the previous day&apos;s civilian casualties in air raids : damage. Killed. Injured.( revxous Daylight hours of Sunday Reference: s   v J 3W.M. (40) 294th        London     ...........Conclusions, Other parts of the country 1 5Minute 5.) ct     j        - i j.&apos;        Sunday night London............ 21 21Bristol      ............ 40 277(of   whom   some150 were seriously injured)Other parts of the country 7 37The latest estimate of casualties in the raid on Birmingham onthe 22nd November was : Killed. Seriously injured.   Slightly injured.407 429 about 300The Minister without Portfolio said that he had spent theweek-end in the Midlands. Birmingham had been bombed on the night of the 19th November, in addition to the more serious attackon the 22nd November. Birmingham had not been given as muchpublicity as Coventry, but the damage in Birmingham was probably more serious. Munitions production was certain to be slowed up asa result. He instanced the damage to the B.S.A. factory. Apartfrom actual hits on factories, production was frequently held up after heavy raids by the failure of the electricity, gas or watersupply.In both Coventry and Birmingham the process of immediaterecovery was going ahead well. The measures taken by the regional commissioner (Lord Dudley) and the other authorities concerned had been very effective.The Minister paid a tribute to the action of the Minister of aircraft Production in placing at the general disposal of all theSupply Departments the reconstruction panels which his fore-thought had established for the benefit of the Ministry of aircraft production.A discussion took place on a proposal to establish a &apos;&apos; mobilecolumn &apos;&apos; of experts and workers, who would be held in readiness toproceed to the scene of any heavy bombing in a munitions area, orother vulnerable area, with the object of getting public utilitiesrestarted quickly and thus enabling production to be resumed. Thefollowing points were made : (1) The &apos;&quot;&apos; mobile column &quot; would have to be established under government authority. It would have to work under thegeneral direction of the Regional Commissioner.(2) In the Electrical Industry a central authority existed in the shape of the Electricity Commissioners, but there wasno comparable authority for water or gas. Water came under the authority of the Minister of Health; and the institute of Water Engineers should be brought into consultation. Gas came under the authority of thePresident of the Board of Trade.(3) After an air raid there was usually a serious shortage of skilled labour capable of repairing public utilities. The&apos;&apos; mobile column &apos;&apos; must therefore include a labour force.(4) Departments should not hesitate to make full use of their powers of requisitioning after a serious air raid.
The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to consult withthe other Ministers concerned and to make plans imme-diately in the light of the above discussion for establishing a &apos;&apos; mobile column &apos;&apos; to deal with damage to public utilityservices. The Lord President was invited to reportprogress at the following morning&apos;s Meeting of the WarCabinet.Chemical 11.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the LordWarfare. Privy Seal (W.P. (40) 450) as to why the direction given by the preparations for Cabinet in 1938 to increase the storage reserve of gas from 500 toretaliation.        2,000 tons had not been fully carried out.(Previous yAe Lord Privy Seal said that the main point in his report was reference: one Qf general application to Departments, namely, an all-too-\\ .M. (40) 268th freqUent tendency to substitute enquiry for action. CommitteesConclusions, were set up, formed of persons with expert knowledge on particularMinute 7.)        aspects of a subject, or representing a particular point of view.Long discussions followed, and there was no one person who insistedupon a workable solution being quickly found and action drivenforward to a conclusion.The Minister of Supply referred to the special difficulties whichhad been encountered in designing a suitable gas shell for the new, 25-pdr.  Teething troubles had now been surmounted and production would proceed on the capacity which had been laid down.The Minister of Aircraft Production stressed the need for action in regard to the supply of containers for gas bombs, theproduction of which had been damaged.The Prime Minister said that it was of the utmost importance that Departments should press forward with the measures required to accumulate a thoroughly adequate reserve of gasweapons as quickly as possible. If the enemy could not beatdown our resistance in any other way, he might well have recourse to gas, and we must be in a position to retaliate at once and effectively.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Report by the Lord privy seal (W.P. (40) 450); and invited the Departments con-cerned to press forward urgently with the measures necessary to accumulate adequate reserves of gas in theform of bulk storage and of filled weapons.The WarCabinet.Carrying out of decisions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 268tbConclusions,Minute 8.)12. In connection with the preceding Minute, the War cabinet were informed that schedules were circulated weekly to all Depart-ments setting out (a) The decisions reached by the War Cabinet in the precedingweek, and(6) Decisions reached in earlier weeks in regard to which nonotification had been received by the War Cabinet Officesthat action had been taken or, in the case of long-termprojects, that the initial action was in hand.The Prime Minister invited Ministers to consider whether somefollow-up procedure should be set up in their own Departments, tomake sure that effect was given promptly to Ministerial decisions on important matters.
Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,November 25, 1940.The Press. 13.   The War Cabinet were informed that the Daily WorkerLibellous of the 18th November had contained a libellous cartoon of thecartoon. Minister of Labour implying that he had taken bribes from(Previous capitalist organisations.Reference: Attorney-General, who had been consulted, was of theW.M. (40) 274thopinion that proceedings could be instituted for criminal libel. TheConclusions,      question at issue was whether, on balance, it was desirable toMmute 4.)        institute proceedings.  Even if the case was expedited, it could notbe heard for several weeks, and when it came on it would be likelyto take up a good deal of the time of the Minister of Labour.  An(Previous alternative course would be to suppress the paper.  This course had reference: been considered by the War Cabinet some months earlier; andW.M. (40) 194th subsequent events afforded strong justification for this course.Conclusions, jn        course of a preliminary discussion, the Minister ofMmute 10.) Labour said that he would prefer that proceedings should be instituted, rather than that the paper should be suppressed, sincethe latter course might be misrepresented and might put him in afar worse position.The Attorney-General pointed out that the institution of criminal proceedings did not preclude simultaneous action to suppress the paper.The view was also expressed that the Fascists had been morehardly treated than the Communists.The War Cabinet-Decided that this matter should be further discussed atWednesday^ Meeting of the War Cabinet, and invited the attorney-General to consider whether action in regard tothe institution of proceedings should be deferred pendingthis further discussion.
