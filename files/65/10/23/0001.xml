The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(Previous Secretary of State for India (W.P. (40) 476), about action againstEeference: tne Congress Party. The point at issue was whether, if a situationW.M (40) 293rd arose in which action had to be taken against the Congress Party,Conclusions tne Congress Party as such should be declared an unlawfulMinute 7.) association; or whether it would suffice to proclaim as illegal theAll-India Congress Committee, the Working Committee, and theProvincial Committees as necessary.In discussion, the view was expressed that to make membership of the Congress Party a criminal offence might lead to graveembarrassment and provoke serious reactions. While it might beless convenient administratively to proceed by way of proclaimingparticular Committees and bodies which formed part of the Congressorganisation, the object in view could be achieved by these means.The attention of the War Cabinet was also drawn to the reference in paragraph 3 of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of the1st December (No. 2859 S.) to the views expressed by the ministers of the three Ministerial Provinces, in August last, urging that a party which was responsible for a revolutionary movement, shouldnot later be allowed to return to power. The Ministries of these three Provinces represented, in the main, the Moslem point of view and the Congress Party were their political opponents. If theGovernment of India were to authorise the Governments in these three provinces to suppress the Congress Party altogether, theywould, in fact, be authorising the suppression by these three governments of the Parliamentary Opposition. This aspect of thematter, which deserved attention, was not referred to in theViceroy&apos;s telegram.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for India to communicate with the Viceroy as follows; (1) The War Cabinet were opposed to the proposal thatthe Congress Party as such should be declared anillegal organisation; i.e., that membership of theparty should be made a criminal offence.
(2) If a situation arose in which action had to be taken against Congress, they thought that this should takethe form of declaring unlawful the All-india congress Committee, the Working Committee andthe Provincial Committees as and when required.(3) If a situation arose in which the Viceroy consideredaction under (2) was necessary, he should refer thematter home; but if, having done so, after 24 hoursthe Government of India judged that the situationdid not permit of further delay, the Viceroy wouldbe free to act on the lines suggested in (2) withoutawaiting a reply to his reference.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,December 10, 1940.
