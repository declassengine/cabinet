Parliament:FutureBusiness.The war damage bill and the means test Bill.(previous references:W.M. (40) 265thConclusions,Minute 9, andW.M. (40) 270thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury asked whetherthe War Damage Bill or the Means Test Bill should be taken byParliament before the Christmas Recess. There was not sufficient time to take both Bills. He proposed that the War Damage Billshould be taken first. The Means Test Bill might be presented onthe eve of the Christmas adjournment, and circulated during the recess.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the War DamageBill would be ready quite shortly, but the Means Test Bill had yet tobe finally drafted. In his opinion, it would be better to take theWar Damage Bill first, and to leave the Means Test Bill to be takenwhen Parliament re-assembled. If the latter Bill was presentedbefore the Recess, and left uncompleted, it would give ample opportunity for criticism, and misrepresentation by mischievouspeople.General agreement was expressed with this view.In discussion it was pointed out that the Means Test Bill wouldbe very difficult to follow, unless it was accompanied by theRegulations to be made by the Assistance Board. There was, ofcourse, no authority to issue the Regulations until the Bill had been passed into law. Nevertheless, it was felt that some means shouldbe found of communicating to the House, not, of course, the Regula-tions themselves, but some indication as to the form which thoseRegulations would take, during the passage of the Bill itself throughthe House. Means should be found to achieve this consistently with parliamentary procedure.The War Cabinet :-(a) Agreed that the War Damage Bill should be introduced into Parliament before the Christmas Recess.(&amp;) Agreed that the Means Test Bill should not be introduceduntil the eve of the Parliamentary Recess.(c) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult with theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and others con-cerned as to the best method of communicating to theHouse the general form of Regulations to be made underthe Bill, consistently with established parliamentary procedure.Parliament. 2.   In the course of discussion on the preceding item the WarChristmas Cabinet: Recess. Agreed that it would be desirable that the christmas recess should be of not less than a month&apos;s duration.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury said that it was proposed that Parliament should meet again on the 21st January.Naval, Militaryand Air i .,,.Operations.(previous reference:W.M.

Four of these machines had crashed on return, but the crews were safe.On the previous night 21 of our bombers had attacked Essenand the Ruhr. One of our machines had crashed, the crew beingkilled.On Monday a Coastal Command machine had attacked an enemy submarine near Malin Head, and claimed a direct hit on the conningtower.Another Coastal Command aircraft claimed to have sunk a2,000-ton enemy merchant vessel off the Norwegian coast.On Monday Valona had been successfully attacked. two italian machines had been shot down by Gladiators, without loss to ourselves.The oil refinery and station at Naples had been attacked by four of our machines on Monday night. Two other machines, which were unable to locate the target, had attacked aerodromes in Sicily.The First Sea Lord reported that on the 28th November 6 dive-bombers had attacked H.M.S. Glasgow to the west of Malta and obtained a near miss, but had caused no damage or casualties. Onedive-bomber had been shot down by H.M.S. Glasgow.Six Fulmars from Illustrious had intercepted 6 ItalianC.R. 42&apos;s : 1 of the enemy had been shot down and 2 had been damaged.  Three Fulmars had been slightly damaged.H.M.S. Glasgow had been hit by two torpedoes from aircraft on the afternoon of the 3rd December at Suda Bay. No report of the damage had been received, but she had left later escorted byH.M.S. Gloucester and destroyers.The homeward Canadian convoy which had been attacked onthe 2nd December by German submarines had been bombed by an aircraft on the morning of the 3rd December; the British shipW. Hendrik (4,360 tons) had been set.on fire, but it was thought thatshe could be salved. Of 35 ships in this convoy, 12 had been hit, ofwhich 8 had sunk. The total tonnage of the ships sunk was about42,000 tons.A discussion took place on the methods of countering the enemy attack on shipping. It was suggested that, in the light of our experience, we might propose to the United States Governmentcertain methods of improving the efficiency and sea-worthiness oftheir destroyers, irrespective of whether they were prepared to giveor lend us any further destroyers.A discussion took place on the methods of protecting ships atanchor from aircraft torpedo attack.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there was little new to report in the Northern and Pindus sectors of the GreekFront. In the Epirus sector the Greeks were advancing, but hadnot yet reached the line on which they were expected to stand.The War Office were watching carefully a reported concentra-tion of German troops in the Szeged area.Our patrols had been active in the Kassala Sector.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
foreign information.Italy.Spain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 299thConclusions,Minute 2.)Tangier.(previous reference:W:M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Representativesabroad : Washington Telegram No. 2907 and Geneva Telegram No. 281,containing reports of growing restiveness and discontent in Italy.Madrid Telegram No. 1166 reported a fairly satisfactory inter-view between Sir Samuel Hoare and Senor Sutler.Tangier Telegrams Nos. 828, 829 and 831 reported an anti-British riot in Tangier. The Foreign Secretary said that he pro-posed to instruct Sir Samuel Hoare to inform the SpanishGovernment that they were making it very difficult for us to help them. We were prepared to discuss any of their desiderata in theinternational zone, but we took strong objection to the method of unilateral encroachment.Our weakness at Tangier lay in the fact that we had to maintain our position single-handed, the other Powers having given up thestruggle. We obtained certain advantages from the presence ofMr. Gascoigne in Tangier, and it would be unfortunate if we had towithdraw him.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.United Statesof America.ProposedBritish-north america supply council.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Aircraft Production containing proposals agreed by thethree Supply Ministers in regard to the organisation in the UnitedStates and in this country for dealing with supply from north america (W.P. (G) (40) 318).A preliminary discussion took place, in the course of which theestablishment of the proposed British-North America supply council met with general approval. As regards the organisation tobe established in this country, satisfaction was expressed at the factthat the three Supply Ministers had reached agreement. It was felt, however, that further consideration should be given to the representation of other interests, at present represented on theNorth American Supply Committee, before final decisions were reached.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Prime Minister to discuss this matter with theMinisters concerned, and to bring it before the WarCabinet on Monday, the 9th December.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,December 4, 1940.
