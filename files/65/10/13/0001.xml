The Chief of the Air Staff reported that 60 enemy aircraft had been over this country on the previous day. We had destroyedone and damaged another without loss.On the previous night 230 enemy bombers had been over, and180 had dropped bombs over a widespread area in the Midlands,including Birmingham and Coventry. One interception had beenmade, without any decisive result.On the previous night, 64 of our bombers had been despatchedand one had failed to return. Duisburg had been the main target.In Security Patrols one enemy twin-engine fighter had been shot ,down, and we had lost one machine.Seven Wellington bombers had left for Malta on the previous day and one, with Air Marshal Boyd on board, had made a forcedlanding in Sicily. So far as could be ascertained, Air Marshal Boydhad been carrying no secret papers beyond one confidential letter.A reconnaissance flight, by a Glenn Martin machine based on Malta, had been carried out over Spezia.Our aircraft had bombed Valona and Durazzo on the night ofthe 17th/18th, causing fires and explosions at the former port. one machine had been lost in this operation.One enemy aircraft had been shot down in flames over Aden.A squadron of Gladiators of the Australian Air Force had hada successful encounter with 60 Italian fighters, destroying 6 forcertain, together with 3 probables. Our losses had amounted to onepilot and 2 aircraft.The Chief of Naval Staff reported that enemy aircraft had made low-bombing attacks on Alexandria during the night of the18th/19th. Forty-three Egyptians had been killed and 75 injured.An attempted low-bombing attack on the harbour had been abandoned when the A.A. barrage had begun, the enemy jettisoningtheir bombs, which had demolished 15 houses.A convoy had been attacked by 2 dive bombers in the thames estuary on the previous morning, but no damage had been caused.Two Norwegian ships with a total tonnage of some 12,000 tons,were now overdue at Cape Town.Maimoa (British, 10,123 tons) had reported earlier the previousmorning that she was being chased by an enemy raider 750 miles west of Freeman tie.Some 5 enemy raiders were now at sea. The Admiralty were examining the question of how best to deal with this pi&apos;oblem.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that a smallsuccessful raid had taken place south of Sidi Barrani and a numberof guns and prisoners had been captured.North-east of Kassala our patrols had been active.In the northern sector the Greek mopping-up had continued throughout Tuesday night, and on the previous day the heightsimmediately east of Koritza, at a distance of 4 kilom., had beentaken, and troops had been reported advancing down the forwardslopes towards the town, parts of which were in flames.In the Pindus sector the Greek front was now entirely inAlbanian territory. Ersek had been successfully raided on theprevious night.  The main road remained cut.In the Epirus sector, between the Permet and Argyrocastroroads, a complete break-down of Italian resistance had beenreported. Enemy troops just inside Greek territory, finding them-selves in danger of encirclement, had retired in disorder. It hadbeen reported that 200 lorries had been abandoned, with muchartillery and other material. Whilst Italian resistance had beenstrong on the previous day, contact with the enemy had now been lost. The Greek Commander-in-Chief had said that he would do his utmost to maintain the momentum of advance.[21946]b 2
Greece.military assistance.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 291stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 1172 from Athens to the Prime Minister, which stated that the King and the President of the Council were most grateful for the prompt response which had been made in answer totheir requests for ailreinforcements.   The telegram contained a reference to sending Hurricanes at short notice, which showed thatthe difficulties of moving aircraft rapidly from one country toanother were not realised. The Prime Minister had sent a telegram in reply (No. 948), drawing attention to these difficulties and adding that, whilst we sympathised with the Greek anxieties, we were doing everything humanly possible.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.blockade policy.German armsconsigned toBrazil.(previous reference:W.M. (40)292ndConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Chief of Naval Staff reported that the Brazilian shipSequeira Campos, with a cargo of German war material for Brazil,haa been intercepted 250 miles west of Gibraltar and ordered intoGibraltar under an armed guard.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, althoughthe news of this ship&apos;s interception had not become known, telegramshad been received from Lord Willingdon and from Washingtonexpressing anxiety regarding the fate of this vessel, and stating thatits arrest would create a difficult situation. The Brazilian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs had also expressed apprehension. The foreign secretary then read to the War Cabinet a draft telegram which hadbeen prepared by the Minister of Economic Warfare giving our reasons for the detention of this vessel which it was proposed tosend to Washington (No. 3148).The War Cabinet approved the despatch of this telegram.Air Raids.casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40)292ndConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Rome Security reported that little damage had beendone the previous day and the casualties had been as follows  London : Nil.Elsewhere : 0 killed, 2 injured.previous night, the Midlands  hadbeing the principal objective.    TheOn theBirminghambeen : been attacked,casualties hadLondon : 11 killed, 45 injured.Elsewhere : 25 killed, 220 injured.The figures for the casualties in the Birmingham area for the raid on the night of the 19th/20th had been : 211 killed, 596 seriously injured.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Since the operation of our Gladiators on the 19th, only two italian fighters had been seen in the air.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
Eire.&quot; TreatyPorts.&quot;(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Prime Minister referred to telegram No. 319 fromSir John Maffey, in Dublin. Sir John reported that Mr. de Valerawas in a very agitated and bitter mood. His attitude was that Irishsentiment towards this country had been steadily improving until we had suddenly raised the issue of the ports. This had let loose anabusive Press campaign.The Secretary of State for Dominion A if airs said that a numberof Members of Parliament had wished to put down a Question onthis matter, but had been dissuaded. But it was doubtful how longthe position could be held without answering a Question.The Prime Minister suggested that one line of reply would beto say that this country had a very real appreciation of the fact that,if Eire was now at war with Germany, she would be exposed to thesame perils as&apos; ourselves, but that at the moment she had no adequatedefence. The last thing we wished to do was to lay Eire open tosuch attacks before adequate defence was available, and we wereprepared to go to the limit of suffering. If, however, a time arrivedwhen the use of Eire ports became a matter of life and death to thiscountry, we might have to take another view. Clearly, however, no reply or statement should be made without further discussion in theWar Cabinet.The general opinion of the War Cabinet was that for the timebeing it would be better, if possible, to avoid making any statement.It was not clear, however, how long it would be possible to postponemaking a statement, since public opinion in this country was becoming inflamed.The Prime Minister added that every expedient must, of course,continue to be tried, both in the political field, in order to bringinfluences to work on Mr. de Valera, and in the field of navalmeasures which might enable us to overcome the threat to shipping without the use of the Eire ports.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.ourfUnited Statesof America.disclosure of secretoperationalandtechnicalinformation.(previous reference:WM. (40) 104thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the minister without Portfolio, covering a Memorandum by the Chairman of theNorth American Supply Committee as to the disclosure of secret information to the United States of America (W.P. (40) 441).The Chairman of the North A merican Supply Committee saidthat, if we were to avoid delays in our supply negotiations, it was important that we should, under appropriate safeguards, give theinformation required to demonstrate the importance and urgency ofour different demands; and that we should furnish this in a regular and consistent form so that we should avoid the suspicion ofselecting what might seem most useful for our immediate purpose and forming a misleading impression. It was of great importanceto avoid inconsistencies. e.g., the refusal in the United States ofAmerica of information given to United States Representativeshere, or of information by one Department exactly similar to whatwas being given by another. The safeguards required would, ofcourse, differ greatly in the case of different classes of information.Some could be restricted to the President or a few high Officers ofState; others would have to bs given to selected firms, and in this case special security arrangements would be essential. He suggestedthat Lord Lothian should, as he had himself proposed, discuss theposition privately with the President, and advise as to what safe-guards would be practicable in the different cases.The Prime Minister thought that we should proceed cautiouslyin this matter, and vary our procedure according to the three mainclasses of secret information.  The first comprised the details of our
Supply programmes. Here the essential was that a full statement should be furnished to the United States Authorities in regard to each of the Supply programmes. A convincing case should be pre-pared for each programme, as had been done for the aircraft programme. Once this statement had been made, all the other information supplied must be consistent with it.The second class comprised details of technical devices. Herea distinction might be drawn between those which we wished to havemanufactured in the United States for our own forces and thosewhich the United States authorities wished to produce themselves for their own benefit. In the latter case we could demand a quid proquo for disclosure.The third class related to operational information. Here themain essential was to avoid giving away technical information whichwas intimately connected with operations likely to be undertaken in the near future.The following were the main points dealt with in discussion :  (1) Operational information.Reference was made to the fact that during recent months theUnited States Air Attache had been supplied with a copy of theAir Ministry War Room Daily Summary. This document gave particulars of our own operations, and contained an Appendixgiving details of the places in this country where enemy bombs had dropped and of the damage done.It was suggested that if we furnished the United states authorities with particulars of, for example, damage to machine tools, we were less likely to get the United States authorities to agreeto the import of machine tools into this country.It was explained that arrangements were being made to dis-continue the supply of this Appendix to the United States AirAttache.The Prime Minister thought it undesirable to furnish theAttache with a very detailed daily report of operations. It was obviously undesirable to cut off the supply of this informationsuddenly and entirely, and the best plan would be that the Summaryshould be reduced gradually in volume over the next two or threeweeks.Agreement was expressed with this view.(2) Figures of production and casualties.The Secretary of State for Air said that the United states authorities were pressing for our aircraft production and casualtyfigures for October.The Minister of Aircraft Production thought that there wouldbe no objection to giving our production total for October, togetherwith the figures of casualties as published in the daily Press. he saw no reason, however, why particulars of casualties, other thanthose reported in the Press, should be communicated to the UnitedStates authorities.This was agreed to.(3) Security arrangements.It was suggested that if we agreed to the manufacture of ourdevices in the United States, we should get the United states authorities to give us the benefit of their security service. But weshould not be under the delusion that this security service gave us as much protection as the security service in this country. the recipients of secret information in the United States had not thesame compelling reason for discretion as ourselves, and there was asmall pro-German faction.
(4) Sir Henry TizarcV s visit to the United States.The War Cabinet were informed that Sir Henry Tizard hadbeen given authority to disclose a number of our secret devices to theUnited States authorities, and that he had done so. This, of course,did not carry with it the right to manufacture. Sir Henry had reported that on the whole the United States had much less to tellus than we had to tell them.(5) Political considerations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it would be disastrous if the United States authorities got it into their headsthat we were treating them in these matters with a lack of confidence,and he suggested that Lord Lothian should discuss the position quitefrankly with the President.Hie Prime Minister said that he thought we should say thatwe did trust them, but that they would appreciate that we were fighting for our lives, and that it followed that there was certainsecret information which we could not possibly divulge.The War Cabinet decided as follows : I. The principles which should govern the supply of informa-tion (both operational and technical) to the United states authorities should be as follows : (a) Arrangements should be made for a full statement to be furnished as to each of the Supply Pro-grammes. Care should be taken that, once these statements had been furnished, no further informa-tion should be given which might appearinconsistent with them.(&amp;) Details of technical devices may, subject to properprecautions, be disclosed to selected firms in theUnited States where we require the manufactureof these devices for our own forces. In the case ofspecially secret apparatus, the various parts shouldbe manufactured by different firms.(c) Details of technical devices may also be disclosed tothe United States Government and to selected firms,although manufacture in the United States is notrequired for our own forces, provided that in eachcase we can obtain a suitable quid pro quo.(d) Particular care should be taken not to disclosetechnical matters which are intimately connectedwith operations to be undertaken in the near future.(e) Operational information should be supplied at regular intervals, in a summarised form, rather thanin frequent detailed reports of local happenings.II. Procedure for communication of information.(a) A Committee of the three Supply Ministers, acting in consultation with the Service Ministers, underthe Chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, should meet to advise what information should, in the lightof the above principles, be disclosed to the UnitedStates authorities or to selected firms.(6) This advice should be submitted to the PrimeMinister as Minister of Defence.(c) It should be a standing instruction that repre-sentatives in North America should be promptlyacquainted by their respective Departments with all information communicated to United States ofAmerica representatives in this country.
(d) In addition to information supplied to the UnitedStates authorities through normal official channelsin the above manner, the Prime Minister will him-self from time to time give information, on a personal basis, to President Roosevelt on the under-standing that this information should be disclosedonly to the Presidents immediate associates.III. A ction to make known these decisions.(a) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was asked toinform our Ambassador in Washington of the sense of the discussion in the War Cabinet, and thedecisions reached, in order that he might explain theposition to President Roosevelt.(b) The Chairman of the North American Supply Committeeand the Secretary of the War Cabinet were invitedto send the Foreign Secretary material for this communication.IV. Communication  of operational intelligence  to  UnitedStates Air A attache.The Secretary of State for Air was invited to take steps to reduce gradually the volume of informationhitherto supplied on operational matters.India. 7.   The Secretary of State for India drew the attention of the(Previous War Cabinet to the Viceroy&apos;s personal telegram No. 2382/S, datedReference:        the 17th November, 1940, which read as follows : W.M. (40) 289thConclusions,Minute 4.)&apos;&apos; My official Home Department telegram of to-day. I and my Advisers are now clear that we are moving rapidly towardsthe moment when we shall have to proclaim Congress, arrestWorking Committee, including Gandhi, and leaders of congress in all Provinces. I trust that you and the Cabinet will feelthat we shall take no action stronger than the situation requires,and that we must be free to take decisions here and to act from day to day without reference home. I am confident that you and the Prime Minister will recognise that behind the by-playof Gandhi&apos;s tactics and coin of current controversy we carryresponsibility for peace in India and India&apos;s capacity tocontinue to make effective part in the war.&quot;The Secretary of State said that he found it difficult to under-stand how the situation could have deteriorated as rapidly as theViceroy&apos;s telegram indicated. There was nothing in Reuter&apos;smessages nor in the other telegrams recently received from theGovernment of India which gave the impression of an impendingcrisis. Recent telegrams had shown that Gandhi was gradually, byspeech and action, developing his policy of discouraging Indiansfrom participating in the war effort On the other hand, the con-viction of Pandit Nehru had, on the whole, been received quietly,although a hartal had been observed in a number of places, notably in the Bombay Presidency.The Secretary of State read to the Cabinet a telegram which hehad sent to the Viceroy asking him to explain why he would be seriously hampered by delay if he had to refer home before takingthe kind of action he anticipated would be necessary. (TelegramNo. 7315.) The Secretary of State added that he would like to bein a position to give the War Cabinet the Viceroy&apos;s programme ofaction and the reasons therefor. Was it essential that the viceroy should proclaim Congress, which presumably meant making every
member of the Congress party in India guilty of an offence?  would it not be enough to arrest the leaders who were guiding Congress inthe direction of non-co-operation ?(Previous The Secretary of State reminded the War Cabinet that on the reference:        16th September they had, with some reluctance, given the ViceroyW.M. (40) 250th authority to take firm action the moment it was established that conclusions,      Congress was determined to embark on a campaign of deliberateMinute 6.)        interference with the conduct of the war.  When that decision hadbeen taken, it had been thought that an openly obstructive resolution was about to be adopted by Congress.   In the event, however, theresolution adopted had been a colourless one.In discussion the following points were made : (1) The Lord, Chancellor understood that to proclaim Congressmeant to arm the Viceroy with authority to exercise verydrastic powers, all of which he might not find it necessaryto exercise. It was by no means clear what powers theViceroy intended to exercise on the present occasion.(2) The Lord President of the Council said that he would be reluctant to agree to any more extreme course than pro-claiming the Working Committee. To proclaimCongress was tantamount to giving the Viceroy a blankcheque.(3) The Foreign Secretary agreed that it would probably be enough to proclaim the Working Committee. This wouldenable the Viceroy to arrest not only the present congress leaders, but any others who might take their places.(4) It was generally agreed that, if the break with Gandhi wasfinal, it would be a mistake to leave him at liberty tocontrive mischief. If he was arrested he might well goon hunger strike, and the question would arise whether he was to be allowed to starve himself to death. Therewas general agreement that Gandhi ought to be told inadvance that we should not interfere if he chose to starvehimself. If this was made clear, it was unlikely that hewould attempt to do so. The Secretary of State forIndia said that he had already told the Viceroy that hewould have full support from here in allowing Gandhito fast to death. ;.(5) The Prime Minister thought that a telegram should be sentto the Viceroy on the following lines : &apos;&apos; We should make it clear that we were prepared tosupport him in whatever steps were necessary to main-tain peace in India and India&apos;s effective part in the war.Before, however, we could agree to Congress being pro-claimed we must know exactly what his programmeinvolved. Prima facie, we thought it would give rise toI   s an infinity of trouble if it was intended to make member-ship of the Congress party a criminal offence, and we found it difficult to see why it should be necessary to go further than proclaim the Working Committee. TheWar Cabinet would be glad to receive any new factsexplaining how the situation was developing and whichhad a bearing on the need for taking immediate action.&quot;(6) The Prime Minister added that he did not himself expectserious political trouble. He thought that agrariantrouble would be more likely to give rise to serious embarrassment. Congress were probably trying to keepthemselves alive by a demonstration.The Secretary of State for India concurred in this view.The War Cabinet: Invited the Secretary of State for India to send a telegram to the Viceroy to elucidate the position, on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister at &quot;X.&quot;[21946]c
RoyalAir Force.Trainingarrangements.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 271stConclusions,Minute 5.).8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (W.P. (40) 447) containing a further report on Royal Air Force training.In paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Memorandum the Secretary ofState asked for authority to complete the immediate programme forthe transfer of certain existing schools overseas, subject to onemodification, namely, the formation of an additional Service flying training School overseas, instead of transferring a Service flying training School from this country. It might also prove possible toform a second school overseas, thus obviating the necessity of trans-ferring a second school from this country.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he was ingeneral agreement with the proposals in the Secretary of State&apos;sMemorandum. He hoped, however, that it might be possible to make some adjustments in the demand for Cheetah engines for training establishments overseas.The War Cabinet:  (1) Gave approval to the proposals in W.P. (40) 447, includingthe completion of the immediate programme for thetransfer of training schools overseas.(2) Took note that the Minister of Aircraft Production and theSecretary of State for Air would consult together as toany adjustments which might be made to avoid, so far as might be possible, sending Cheetah engines abroad foruse in training establishments.(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for Air to press on withhis schemes for training facilities in the United Statesand, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, to conclude the best arrangements possible.I)Aliens.Internmentof enemy aliens.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 215thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Home Secretary (W.P. (G.) (40) 309).The number of enemy aliens at present interned was 19,500. Inview of the widespread desire to release from internment those whose loyalty to the Allied cause was beyond doubt, the AsquithCommittee had recommended a new category of eligibility for release covering &apos;&apos; any male person who had reached his fiftieth birthday or who,having applied for enlistment in the Auxiliary Military pioneer corps, has been rejected on medical grounds, and in regard towhom a tribunal appointed by the Secretary of State for thepurpose reports that he is opposed to the Nazi system and isactively friendly towards the Allied cause, and the tribunal is satisfied that he will remain steadfast towards that cause in all circumstances.&quot;The Home Secretary proposed to make a statement in the House ofCommons indicating the Government&apos;s acceptance of the recom-mendation, but making ^clear that the Government did not contemplate any further enlargement of the categories of eligibility for release.In the course of a statement explanatory of his proposal, theHome Secretary said that in the Metropolitan Police district therewere a number of enemy aliens in regard to whom the process of internment had been suspended because of lack of accommodation in internment camps. These cases would be sifted and some of those concerned might have to be interned.The general policy of the War Cabinet was in favour of themeasures proposed in the Home Secretary&apos;s Paper.   The rough and
ready measures adopted in the early summer had been justified bythe danger during that period, but we could now afford to take a rather less stringent line.The War Cabinet Approved the measures and line of policy proposed in theHome Secretary&apos;s Paper W.P. (G.) (40) 309.Fascists.Members of theBritish Uniondetained underDefenceRegulation18B.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (40) 133rdConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (W.P. (G.) (40) 308).In all, some 750 persons had been detained, most of whom hadexercised their right to make objections to the Advisory Committee.It was expected that ultimately the Committee would recommend therelease of about 60 per cent, of them on the ground that they couldnot be regarded as dangerous people. The Home Secretary proposed as a general policy to authorise the unconditional release of persons whose release was recommended by the Advisory Committee, subjectto a warning that should they engage in any British Union activitiesthey would be liable not only to prosecution under the defence regulation, but also to a fresh order of detention. In special casesthe release would be made subject to conditions as to residence and reporting to the Police.After a short discussion the War Cabinet approved theproposals in the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (40) 308).Eire.trade relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 230thConclusions,Minute 11.)11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 304)circulating the reply of the Eire Government to the proposed com-prehensive agreement with Eire on trade matters, authorised by theWar Cabinet at the Meeting noted in the margin.The War Cabinet-that considerationsay, a month.Decided that consideration of this matter should be deferred for, say, a month. In the meantime, no hopeshould be held out to the Government of Eire that a settle-ment would be made with them on the basis of the demandsput forward in their reply. There was nothing in these demands which afforded justification for payment by thiscountry to Eire of  500,000.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 21, i940.
