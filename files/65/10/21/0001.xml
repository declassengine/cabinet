The Chiefs of Staff reported on operations. The main points were as follows : Night December 4/5. The enemy had sent over some 155bombers, the main attack being against Birmingham. We haddespatched 87 bombers to attack targets in the Ruhr and Turin.One of our machines had been lost.December 5. By day the casualties had been as follows : Our Own 2 machines (1 pilot safe).Enemy 14 certain (1 by A.A. fire).3 probable.2 damaged.Night December 5/6. The enemy had attacked Portsmouth and southampton.On the 4th December our Gladiators in Greece had shot down8 Italian machines for certain and 7 probables without loss.Very bad weather had been experienced in the North-WestApproaches. Seven merchant ships were adrift, but there was noreason to think that they would not make port.The Silverpine (British tanker, 5,066 tons) had been sunk on theprevious day. Information had just been received that the st. Elwyn (British, 4,940 tons) had been torpedoed on the27th November.The A.M.C. Carnarvon Castle had been in action with an enemyraider about 700 miles north-east of The Plate, but owing to hersuperior speed the raider escaped. No report had been received asto the damage done to the raider, but the Carnarvon Castle had had some casualties and was putting into Montevideo for repairs.The German ship Klaus Schoke had been sunk when endeavour-ing to get into one of the Biscay ports.Our artillery had been in action south of Sidi Barrani. Enemyanti-tank obstacles had been completed at a new perimeter camp5 miles south of Sidi Barrani.In the Kassala Sector patrol activity continued.Beyond a slight advance in the north there had been nothing toreport on the Greek Front.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Broadcasting: . 2. In discussion on this matter, the following views werebroadcasts by    generally approved by the War Cabinet :  K_ei.ni-, office is.        ^ Considerable advantage had been derived from broadcastsgiven by serving Officers. But it was generally undesir-able-(a) that such broadcasts should be given by serving officers in high executive or controlling positions :(b) that the same Officer should broadcast at frequent intervals for a long period.(2) There would be advantage in arranging for a panel ofOfficers who could be called upon to broadcast, and a substitute should be found as soon as possible for anyOfficer who had been broadcasting for a prolonged period.(3) Arrangements should be made for a prior scrutiny ofbroadcasts by serving Officers.[21998]
Blockade Policy.France.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 292ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Chief of Naval Staff said that on the 19th november the Cabinet had given instructions that escorted French convoysthrough the Straits of Gibraltar were to be intercepted. One or twovessels had been intercepted, but further action had been suspendedwhen Force Ff had proceeded into the central Mediterranean.Further action could now be taken for the interception ofescorted French convoys. The Chief of Naval Staff asked whetherthe previous instructions still held.The War Cabinet agreed : That their previous instructions regarding the interception of French escorted convoys through the Straits of Gibraltarstill held good.Blockade Policy. 4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that heGerman arms nad received representations from the Brazilian Government andconsigned to from Washington about the interception of the Sequeira Campos.Brazil. He had discussed the matter with the Minister of Economic War-previous fare.  They had reached the conclusion that while, on merits, thereReference: was little case for a concession, it might be advisable to make one,W.M. (40) 293rd provided we could obtain a satisfactory quid pro quo. A telegramConclusions, had accordingly been sent to our Ambassador at Rio de JaneiroMinute 3.) (No. 319) setting out the terms on which we would agree to release the cargo of German war material.The War Cabinet approved the action taken.France.american proposal to .distributesupplies inUnoccupiedFrance.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 299thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the telegram appended to W.P. (40) 471 had now been despatched.While it might ultimately be necessary to agree to a scheme on thelines of Mr. Norman Davis&apos;s proposal, it was clear that the blockadewould thereby be weakened. The balance of advantage was infavour of rejecting the scheme.The War Cabinet approved the action taken.United Statesof America.Disclosure ofsecret-operational andtechnicalinformation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 293rdConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The War Cabinet were informed that when Air Com-modore Slessor had left for the United States of America, he hadbeen provided with a very full statement, which had been approvedby the Prime Minister, giving details of pilot losses from May to august, 1940, estimates of future wastage of pilots and the outputof Training Schools, and the numbers required for the newsquadrons which we intended to form up to June, 1941. Mr.Morgenthau (whom the Air Commodore was seeing on the following day) now asked for further figures of our actual pilot losses inSeptember, 1940, and for the latest estimates of pilot wastage, outputof Training Schools and aircraft production in October and november, 1940.In the course of discussion, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that representations had been made, to him by theUnited States authorities in this country that information given tothem in regard to air matters had recently been very greatly reduced.
The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to submit to thePrime Minister that afternoon a draft telegram to air Commodore Slessor (a) giving particulars of pilot casualties in September,1940, on the same basis as pilot casualties given inthe statement which Air Commodore Slessor hadalready communicated to the United states authorities;(b) pointing out that Mr. Morris Wilson was now the recognised channel for communicating to theUnited States authorities information in regardto aircraft production, to whom reference shouldbe made;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to discuss with the Minister of Aircraft Production and theSecretary of State for Air the question raised by him inregard to communication of information to UnitedStates authorities in this country.United Statesof America.Proposedmessage fromthe PrimeMinister toPresidentRoosevelt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 299thConclusions,Minute 4.)Eire:  future policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 293rdConclusions,Minute 11.)7. The Prime Minister said that he had received a number of amendments from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington. Someof them he would incorporate in his letter, but others must be ruled out on account of their length. He added that he proposed to shorten the passage dealing with our policy towards Eire.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to despatch the letter to president Roosevelt that day subject to detailed amend-ments which would not affect its general substance or tone.8. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by a numberof Ministers dealing with measures which could be taken to reducethe burden on our shipping and finances in consequence of the heavysinkings off the Irish coast (W.P. (40) 472).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in accordance with a request by the Prime Minister, he had held a meeting of theMinisters concerned on the previous day. The Chancellor outlinedtwo plans which had been drawn up, setting out the action whichcould be taken. (A summary of the Chancellor&apos;s statement is being circulated to the War Cabinet as W.P. (40) 475.)The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, broadly,he favoured proceeding on the basis of the first plan, excluding, how-ever, the action suggested in regard to coal and dollars. the primary object of these measures would be to bring home to thepeople of Eire their dependence on shipping. He thought that allthe measures proposed could fairly be justified on grounds ofeconomic necessity arising out of the shipping difficulties, and thatit was most important that they should be so presented. If repre-sentatives of Eire approached us on the matter, we should say thatwe were ready to consult with them on any proposals they might make which would relieve the shipping situation, which affectedthem as well as ourselves. This line of presentation was generally approved.Reference was made to the various steps which Eire might takeby way of retaliation.
The Chief of the Naval Staff read to the War Cabinet a Minutedealing with the military aspect of the situation. After setting outthe disadvantages which would follow if the economic measures proposed resulted in a state of sullen animosity or general hostilityon the part of the people of Eire, the Chiefs of Staff came to theconclusion that, if it was considered that there was a good chance that the adoption of these measures would influence the people ofSouth Ireland to give us the use of the Irish ports, then we should accept the risks involved.The War Cabinet (1) While recording no formal conclusion, favoured theadoption of the first plan outlined by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, excluding, however, at this stage any action in regard to the supply of coal to Eire.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to continue con-consultations with the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, the President of the Board of Trade, theMinister of Shipping, and the Minister of Food, with aview to the detailed consideration of the measuresinvolved.(3) Agreed that the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland andthe United Kingdom Representative in Dublin should beinvited to come to London on Monday next for consultations on this matter.(4) Agreed that no information as to the measures proposed should be communicated to the Dominion PrimeMinisters until after the matter had been again con-sidered by the War Cabinet early in the following week.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,December 6, 1940.7- *X  &amp;&amp;*-*
MOST SECRET.MEASURES TO SECURE THE USE OF IRISH PORTS.jyfr&amp;jb Minute to the Prime Minister.In accordance with your instructions, we have considered the military reactions to the application ofeconomic pressure on Eire.2. The economio measures proposed may succeed in creatinsituation in which negotiations on the subject of oaseswould he possible.     We should then very probably be asked what measures we would take to protect the Irish ports and people from air bombardment.     A scale of air defence for the whole of Ireland has been worked out and, briefly,our commitment would be:-288 Heavy A.A. Guns518 Light A.A. Guns312 Searchlightsand a permanent garrison of at leasf 6 Fighter Squadronswith facilities for the operation of 24.      (See SketchMap attached.)3. On the other hand,  the economic measures may,- either:(i) lead to a state of sullen animosity on the partof the Eire Government and of a large proportionof the population, or,&apos;(ii) provoke the general hostility of the Irish and leadde Valera to offer the enemy all the facilities at his disposal.4. A state of sullen animosity might lead to allpossible action against us short of open hostilities orof an invitation to the Germans.     The following military implications might then arise, and in these circumstancesa German invasion of Eire would be a more likely contingency(a) The I.R.A.  in Northern Ireland might undertakefurther anti-British activities,  in which theymight even be encouraged by the Eire Government,thus increasing the internal security problem in Northern Ireland.(b) They might cut the Atlantic cable communications which are brought in to Southern Eire.      Thiswould seriously inconvenience us, though weshould still have two remaining routes to america with which we could carry on.

(c) They might close down the trans-Atlantic air routes at Foynes.(d) The loss of coast watching facilities would notbe serious,  though we might have to increasenaval patrols to ensure that we received earlyreports of movement of enemy vessels off thecoast of Eire.5. A state of open hostility would result in all theabove disadvantages and in addition:-(a) The Germans would obtain additional flying &quot;boat or air bases from which to extend their attacks against our trade.     Although there would be difficultyin maintaining any sustained effort based onEire, the threat to our trade might be materiallyincreased.(b) The Germans would obtain the use of ports and harboursin Eire for U-Boats.     The use of these might savesome three days steaming, both to and from thehunting areas, but adequate facilities for supplyingsubmarines would have to be made without which the harbours would be of little use.     There would always be the possibility of a damaged submarine findingshelter in which to make temporary repairs,sufficient to complete the passage home.Nevertheless, in view of the proximity&apos;of Frenchbases and the endurance of German submarines, we donot assess the added threat as very serious.(c) Our task in driving the Germans out would be greatly-increased if we were to meet with opposition fromelements of the Irish.     After capturing the portswe should require to establish a measure of controlover the greater part of the country, for the wholeof which our commitment has been estimated at about 10 divisions,6. It is not within our province to say whether theprobable economic measures are likely to influence theIrish to give us the use of their ports but,  if it isconsidered that there is a good chance of this, then we areof the opinion that we should accept the risks, obligations and consequences that may be involved;&apos;
