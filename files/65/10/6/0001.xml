51Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.HomeCommands.1. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on the previous friday, East Coast convoys had again been attacked by dive bombers.Including aircraft shot down by H.M.S. Winchester the totaicasualties had been : Our Own -6 machines lost (3 pilots safe).Enemy 21 certain.10 probable.9 damaged.On the previous Saturday, including Saturday night when3 machines had been shot down by A.A. fire, the casualties hadbeen : Our Own Nil.Enemy 8 certain.2 probable.3 damaged.Of that total, H.M.S. Vigilant had shot down 1 machine and damaged another.On Sunday the casualties had been 1 enemy machine damaged.That day (Monday) a number of Italian machines had appeared in the Thames Estuary. The casualties in fighting with the italians had been : Our Own Nil.Italian 12 certain.2 probable.8 damaged.The casualties in our encounters with the Germans that day had been : Our Own 2 machines.German 11 certain.8 probable.6 damaged.The total casualties for the week-end had thus been : Our Own 8 machines (3 pilots safe).Enemy 47 certain.31 probable.26 damaged.During the previous week the enemy attacks at night hadaveraged about 165 sorties a night.The previous night there had been a number of interceptions,one Beaufighter making as many as 6, but no engagements had resulted. The only engagement had been made by a Defiant machine,which had probably damaged an enemy bomber.
Middle East:operations from Malta.Middle East:air reinforce-ments.naval operations.German raiderin Atlantic.Malta:reinforcementsarrive.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 278thConclusions,Minute 2.)Shipping Losses.During the last three nights our bombers had made on anaverage 80 sorties a night and had lost in all 5 machines. Theprevious night the most successful attacks by our bombers had beenin the Ruhr, although our machines had gone as far east as Posenand Danzig.On the previous Friday, 5 of our Wellingtons from Malta had successfully attacked Brindisi, hitting the railway station. FourWellingtons had attacked Naples, where fires had been started.On passage out to Malta one Glenn Martin had been shot downby the Italians and one Wellington had been attacked, but had escaped with one of the crew killed. The Italians were now aware that we were sending bombers to Malta, and had started interceptingpatrols.The Chief of Naval Staff reported details relating to the attackon the convoy on the 5th November by the Admiral Scheer. TheA.M.C. Jervis Bay had acted in a very gallant way in deliberatelyengaging the enemy in order to give the convoy a better chance ofescaping. There had been 36 ships in this convoy, of which 22 hadbeen accounted for. Twelve were still missing but as the weather in the Atlantic had been heavy, it was still possible that some ofthese might yet report.The Barham, Glasgow and Berwick had safely dischargedtroops, guns and I-tanks at Malta. On the way to Malta the air-craft of the Illustrious had shot down 4 Italian aircraft. Force Haircraft had shot down another 2.The aircraft of this Force had also attacked Cagliariaerodrome. The question whether these aircraft should operate against targets in North Africa was referred to.There had been no shipping losses due to submarine attack.The Focke-Wulfe aircraft operating in the North-western approaches had, however, done some damage. A merchant vesselhad been sunk on the 8th. A second ship (one of the convoy attacked by the Admiral Scheer) had been sunk, and a third attacked that day.Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff- said that owing too operations. heavy air attack our forces had withdrawn from Gallabat on the 7th.The Sudan.       Our total casualties in this sector were 189, including 34 killed.On the 10th November a further attack had been made after fightingpatrols had cleared the front, and Gallabat fort had been re-occupiedwithout opposition.North of Kassala, fighting continued and 262 prisoners hadbeen taken.Italy-Greece. In the northern sector there was no change.   In the Pindussector it was not clear whether the whole of the Third AlpiniDivision (Italian) had been completely cut off. The Greek troops on the Pindus front were only in touch with an Italian outpost linecomposed of Albanian levies.On the Epirus sector the Greeks had withdrawn their mainline to the River Acheron. Cavalry reconnaissance pushed forward from this line had failed to establish contact with the enemy. TheGreek Commander-in-Chief had stated that the first phase of the campaign had definitely gone against the Italians, who would now have to re-cast their plans. General Soddu had now been appointedto command the Italian forces in Albania.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Imperial General staff said that he thought that the Greeks might well be able to hold upthe Italian forces in the mountains for a considerable time duringthe continuance of wintry weather. Their power of standing upto air attack might be the determining factor. It would, of course,be a different matter if German forces were to attack on this front.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
France: FrenchWest Africa.OperationsagainstLibreville.(previous references:W.M. (40) 276thConclusions,Minute 6, andW.M. (40) 280thConclusions,Minute 3.)Poncelet(FrenchSubmarine)sunk.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Chief of Naval Staff said that Libreville had now beentaken by de Gaulle&apos;s forces. The Vichy Government claimed thatwe had bombed Libreville and had helped to land Free French forces and had attacked the French submarine Poncelet. These statements were untrue. The position as regards the French submarine was asfollows: At 2-30 p.m. on the 7th November H.M.S. Milford had heard an underwater explosion. At 3-45 p.m. a submarine had been sighted on the surface and had disregarded signals to stop, and fire had been opened from the Milford. The submarined hull hadbeen pierced by a shell and the submarine had dived. Later thesubmarine had surfaced and had again been engaged. The crewhad then come on deck and surrendered, and had scuttled thesubmarine. All the crew had been saved with the exception of aLieutenant who had been drowned. The submarined log-book hadbeen captured and showed that at 2-20 p.m. orders had been givento fire two torpedoes at the Milford. One torpedo had been firedand the other had stuck in the tube.The Vichy vessel Bougainville had not been sunk by us, butby a Blenheim which we had lent to the Free French Forces. ThisBlenheim had also attacked the Poncelet on the 4th November.At the time when the Milford had been attacked by the Ponceletshe had been 15 miles off the coast near Libreville.The above facts had been published in the Press.The War Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to send a state-ment, setting out in detail the facts of this occurrence,to the French Admiralty through our Naval Attache atMadrid, sending a copy to the Foreign Office for trans-mission to the Ambassador.France: TheFrench Fleet.Jean Bart andRichelieu.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegrams nos. 336, Saving, and 987 from Madrid containing the answer tothe warning which had been sent to the Vichy Government as tothe action we should take if an attempt was made to move either of these vessels to a French metropolitan port. The reply was thatthe French Admiralty had no intention of moving either vessel,but that if they decided to do so, they would do so, and that any interference on our part would be regarded as aggression.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France:blockade policy.The S.S. Cuba.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The First Sea Lord read to the War Cabinet theinstructions which had been sent to give effect to the decisions reached by the War Cabinet on the 8th November as to this ship.Since then, the Minister of Shipping had asked that instructions should be issued that the Cuba should not be released for the present, as the ship would be of great value to us, and negotiations were still proceeding with the Vichy Government inregard to the return of British ships detained in French ports. Noreport had yet been received of the rummaging of the ship, and instructions had been sent that if the Cuba had not been releasedshe should be retained for the present.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
France: free french Forces.Movements ofGeneral de gaulle.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that atelegram had now been received from General de Gaulle (No. 13from Brazzaville) agreeing to return to this country for consulta-tions, and adding that he counted on returning to French equaltorial africa, where his presence was necessary. Arrangements shouldbe made to facilitate the GeneraFs journey.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.France: Rela-tions with theYichyGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 5.)discussions in Madrid.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 2.)blockade policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that atelegram had been received from Sir Samuel Hoare (No. 999 fromMadrid) reporting three long talks which the Minister and he had had with the French Charge d&apos;Affaires. The latter had insisted on two contentions. First, that no French Government could abandon the right to recover the mutinied colonies. Secondly, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had admitted that their sole reason for supporting de Gaulle was to prevent German infiltration into theFrench Empire. As this had not happened, we had nothing to gain by continuing to support the dissident colonies. Although it hadbeen explained to him that we could not repudiate General de Gaulle,the Charge d&apos;Affaires had stuck to his points and Sir Samuel Hoarehad not been able to do more than get him to consider making a start with economic discussions, while maintaining the status quo.The Foreign Secretary thought that the best plan would bethat we should keep matters fluid and should endeavour to starttalks on the basis suggested.The Foreign Secretary also referred to telegram No. 1110 from athens reporting the views of a Frenchman who had just arrived from Vichy to the effect that the French were with us, but that theircourage was only now returning.The Prime Minister expressed general agreement with theForeign Secretary&apos;s suggestion. Matters at Libreville had gonewell with us, but he thought that French opinion generally mightwell be veering in our favour, and that we should adopt a mixedattitude and not play out our hand against the Vichy French tothe uttermost. As regards the blockade, we were not at the presentstopping ships passing through the Straits of Gibraltar. While wemust not allow that position to develop too far, he thought that itshould continue, at any rate for the next few days.The War Cabinet-Expressed general agreement with the line of policyindicated by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary.foreign information.Yugoslavia:Bombing ofBitolj.Eoumania:Earthquake.Germany:orders fortropical kit.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thefollowing :- The Yugo-Slav Commission of Enquiry which had been set upto enquire into the bombing of Bitolj (Monastir) had established that Italian aeroplanes had been responsible. A protest was to belodged in Rome on the 13th November. Germany had offered to mediate in the event of trouble.  (Telegram No. 904 from Belgrade.)During an interview the previous day, the Dutch ForeignMinister had stated that he was satisfied that the earthquake in roumania had had a very damaging effect on the oil wells. TheDutch Foreign Minister had also stated that he had first-handinformation that Germany was placing large orders for tropicalkit in Amsterdam.
U.S.S.R.: visit of M. M&apos;olotovto Berlin.Greece: King ofthe Hellenes&apos;reply to King&apos;message.Spain:   instruc-tions to ItaliansubmarinesregardingSpanishmerchant &quot;X&quot;ships.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 282ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Two telegrams had been received from Sir Stafford Crippsabout M. Molotov&apos;s visit to Berlin (Nos. 976 and 980 from Moscow).M. Molotov was arriving on the night of the 12th and would bestaying for two or three days.The Foreign Secretary added that he was a little anxious about this visit at the best it might be a face-saving device for theRussians and Germans and at the worst it might mean that an anti-Turkish policy was under consideration.The King of the Hellenes had replied to the telegram sent bythe King (No. 1112 from Athens). It would be necessary to consult the Chiefs of Staff as to the answer to be sent.A telegram had been received from Sir Samuel Hoare regardingthe publication of the orders found in an Italian submarine to sink merchant ships belonging to a Spanish shipping line.Sir Samuel was against the publication of these orders until thesituation regarding two Italian submarines at Tangier had clarified.The orders had already been shown to General Franco, who had stated that the Line of ships mentioned in the orders did not exist.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the orders should not be published for thepresent.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to enquire into&quot;X&quot; and to communicate further with the ForeignOffice.aircraft production.Allocation ofHudsonAircraft.8. The Minister of Aircraft. Production said that 7 Hudsonaircraft, which had flown the Atlantic, had just arrived in thiscountry.The question was raised whether these aircraft should be fitted with armaments as quickly as possible and handed over forthwith to the Admiralty for use on the North-Western Approaches, orwhether they should be handed over to the Royal Air Force, asreserves for the squadrons of the Coastal Command armed withthis type of aircraft.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production, the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for air to discuss the use to be made of these aircraft, and toreport to the War Cabinet within the next two or threedavs.Middle EastVisit of theSecretary ofState for war to Egypt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 281stConclusions,Minute 2.9. The War Cabinet expressed a desire to hear from theSecretary of State for War an account of his visit to the middle east.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War to give them areport of his visit at their next Meeting. Copies of theSecretary of State for War&apos;s telegrams from the middle east would be available to War Cabinet Ministers at the offices of the War Cabinet.
Greece.military assistance:information supplied to dominion PrimeMinisters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 282ndConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Prime Minister referred to a telegram which hadbeen despatched, giving certain detailed information as to troop movements. While the Dominion Prime Ministers must, of course,be kept informed of the position generally, and, on occasions,of impending operations, it was undesirable that very specificinformation as to dispositions and future movements shouldbe communicated to any person (including even dominion prime Ministers) other than those who must be acquainted withthem to enable action to be taken.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theAustralian Prime Minister, who was concerned by virtue of theAustralian forces in the Middle East, had asked specific questions towhich the telegram had contained the replies. In the circumstances it had been decided to send the same information to the other dominion Prime Ministers.The Prime Minister said that he did not think it followed thatidentical information need be supplied on all occasions to all theDominion Prime Ministers.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Mr. Neville 11.   The Prime Minister said that, since the War Cabinet hadChamberlain. last met, they had suffered a severe loss in the death ofMr. Chamberlain. This loss would be felt most deeply by all thosewho had worked with him. They had all admired the great couragehe had shown in continuing at work for a fortnight, in failinghealth, after his severe operation. Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s great griefin leaving life had perhaps been that he had not lived to see theend of the struggle in which we were engaged. But maybe hehad lived long enough to feel confident as to the outcome.On the following day, wdien the House met, tributes would bepaid to Mr. Chamberlain. It was usual, after these tributes hadbeen made, for the House to adjourn. On this occasion, however,there would be no immediate adjournment, as a Service was to beheld in Westminster Abbey on Thursday, and this would involvethe adjournment of the House on that day.Discussion then ensued whether the Prime Minister only should speak, on behalf of the whole Government and all the Parties com-prised in it, or whether the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretaryof State for Air as Leaders of the Labour and Liberal parties shouldalso speak.In discussion, it was argued that three speeches delivered fromthe same Bench might seem inappropriate. On the other hand, itwas felt that there was no good reason to depart from the customaryplan, whereby tributes were paid on these occasions by the party leaders. Further, any departure from this procedure would be liable to misinterpretation.The War Cabinet endorsed this view.The Prime Minister said that no publicity should be given tothe Service on Thursday. He would inform the House of commons of the arrangements in Secret Session on the following day.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would follow the same procedure in the Lords.The Prime Minister said that the members of the diplomatic corps and the High Commissioners should be informed of the place and time of the Service in confidence on Wednesday night.The Secretary was instructed to arrange for a wreath tobe sent on behalf of the War Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 11, 1940.
