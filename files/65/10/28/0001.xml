Foreign 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that he had information. had a long talk with M. Dupuy, the Canadian Charg6 d&apos;Affaires atFrance. Vichy, the general effect of which was encouraging.  An account of(Previous it would be circulated to the War Cabinet.Reference:W.M. (40) 304thConclusions,Minute 2.)Violation of The Foreign Secretary said that he had just seen the SwissSwiss Neutrality Minister, who had come to protest against the bombing of Basle,by British The protest was in very strong terms, and stated that, owing to aAircraft. clear visibility, there had been no possible excuse for a mistake.(previous reference: The War Cabinet took note of these statements.W.M. (40) 265thConclusions,Minute 8.)China.Assembly of aircraft forChinese Govern-ment in british territory.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P.(40)481) on the questionwhether the assembly and manufacture of civil and military aircraft for China should be permitted in India or Burma.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that thefactory at Loiwing, in Yunnan, had already been bombed. The real question was whether to permit this factory, which was run underthe auspices of an American company, to be established in India.The factory would assemble material coming from the United Statesof America and already ordered by the Chinese Government, andwould not, therefore, interfere with our own aircraft programmes.The general view of the War Cabinet favoured this proposal,notwithstanding the risk, to which the Secretary of State for theColonies drew attention, that it would increase bad feeling between this country and Japan.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals set out in paragraph 14 of theSecretary of State&apos;s Memorandum, which may be sum-marised as follows : (1) The machinery from the factory at Loiwing could be moved to a site in India for the manufacture orassembly of aircraft for the Chinese Government.(2) The export to China of military and civil aircraft from india or Burma should be permitted, provided that military aircraft were not in a condition to engage in hostilities when en route to China.(3) The assembly, but not the manufacture, in Burma ofcivil or military aircraft, and their export to China,should be permitted.(4) Chinese pilots should be allowed to enter British terri-tory in order to fly aircraft thence into China.Royal Air Rorce.Pre-EntryTraining.Formation ofAir TrainingCorps.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (W.P. (40) 480) proposing improved and extended arrangements for pre-entry training for the Royal AirForce.The Secretary of State for Air explained the arrangements which would obtain under his scheme at the universities, the public[22052]b 2
schools, the secondary schools and other schools. In addition tothese, his scheme would provide pre-entry training for young menwho had already entered industry. This part of the scheme wouldbe drawn up in consultation with the Minister of Labour.Broadly speaking, the object of the pre entry scheme was toprepare for Air Force Service boys and young men from the age of15 upwards, who were not at present up to the educational require-ments.In view of the prospect of heavy casualties in the 1941 and 1942campaigns, it was inevitable that a long waiting list for entry intothe Royal Air Force should be maintained.The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the arrangement made in regard to university candidates for the Fleet Air Arm.He asked that a corresponding arrangement should be made inregard to non-university candidates produced by the present schemewho wished to enter the Fleet Air Arm.The Secretary of State for Air undertook to consider this point.The War Cabinet Approved in principle the scheme outlined in W.P. (40) 480for the creation of an air training corps on as wide a basis as possible, for the provision of pre-entry training foryouths who intend to join the Royal Air Force as air crewsor technicians.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M.
