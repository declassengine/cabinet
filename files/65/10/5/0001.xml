The Chief of the air the previous day had been : Our Own 5 Aircraft destroyed.Enemy 6 certain.5 probable.2 damaged.On the previous night 103 bombers had attacked targets inGermany and Occupied France with good results, the attack on theKrupps Works at Essen, in which over 60 bombers had taken part,being particularly successful.   We had lost 1 aircraft.The Whitleys detailed to attack Italian targets had been unableto do so owing to weather conditions and had attacked a German oil plant at Wesserling instead.The previous night 150 enemy aircraft had been over thiscountry of which 130 had been over London. One interception hadbeen made by our aircraft over Plymouth without result.Coastal Command aircraft had made a successful attack onthe previous night at Lorient and had dropped a number of bombs and mines.An air battle had taken place at Gallabat in which two of ourimprovised Gladiator units had shot down 4 Italian machines and damaged 1.  We had lost 5 machines and 3 pilots.A number of Wellingtons had left for Malta.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to enquire into a reportregarding an enemy attack on shipping by an aircraft flying low andtrailing a wire carrying a projectile at the end. This wire had sweptacross the ship and the projectile had exploded.The Chief of Naval Staff reported that there had been nofurther information of the convoy attacked by the Admiral Scheeron the 5th November except for a German message, stating that asurface raider had attacked a West bound convoy and had sunk86,000 tons of shipping.Later in the Meeting, the War Cabinet were informed that a message had been received from the Cornish City, one of the vessels which had reported being shelled by the Admiral Scheer, reporting that she was being attacked by a submarine. A large explosion hadbeen heard. This ship had been in about the position she wouldhave reached had she continued to steer at 9 knots. The survivingships in this convoy could not reach home waters until the following day.It was reported that the plans of the Massilia sailing toEngland to repatriate French seamen had been cancelled. Accordingto a telegram received from Tangier, she had sailed to Dakar witha cargo of munitions and a number of French naval personnel.The French Submarine Poncelet when outside Libreville hadbeen attacked by our forces and, after surfacing, had surrenderedand then scuttled herself. Survivors had been rescued. TheAdmiralty had telegraphed asking for further information regarding the circumstances of this incident.A convoy near Southend had been attacked by enemy aircraft the previous day. FfM. Sloop Egret had been hit, 3 of her crewbeing killed. One merchant ship of 1,600 tons had been sunk andanother of 1,900 tons beached.A ship of 2,500 tons had been sunk by a mine in the Thames.We now knew enough about the working of the new acoustic mineto put into production certain counter measures. Two trawlersequipped with special apparatus had successfully detonated twoacoustic mines, but the method employed was still in the experimental stage.The First Sea Lord reported certain movements of theMediterranean Fleet.
MilitaryOperations:Sudan.Italy-Greece.Greek Forces onthe BulgarianFrontier.Crete.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that on the6th November a British column had surprised and capturedGallabat. An enemy counter attack had been successfully repulsed,followed by two heavy bombing attacks. The action had not been resumed on the 7th November, on account of mechanical breakdownswhich had affected all our tanks except one.In the Kassala sector a British mobile force was continuing tomaintain pressure on an enemy detachment in the Jebel Tendelaiarea, 45 miles North-East of Kassala.Italian reinforcements were continuing to leave Bari for Greece.A second division of Alpini was reported to have arrived in Albania. .In the Pindus sector the Greeks had advanced throughout theprevious day. The gap between this sector and the Epirus sectorhad been practically closed. An Italian detachment was believed to be cut off in the Dystraton area and its capture was expected.The morale of the prisoners already captured was bad.In the Epirus sector, the enemy had continued heavy pressure in the coastal sector. The Greeks were falling back and apparentlyintended to hold a line just east of the River Akheron. The enemy were continuing heavy dive bombing and machine gunning of troops.The Greek Army&apos;s concentration was continuing satisfactorily.Having now received satisfactory assurances that Turkey wouldguarantee the Bulgarian-Greek Front, General Metaxas had decidedto withdraw all but three or possibly two of the Greek divisions on that frontier.The Prime Minister said that the Greeks wanted to withdrawsix out of the nine battalions in Crete, together with all the artilleryin the island. He had given instructions the previous evening thatwe should meet the Greek wishes, subject to their leaving onebattery behind for the present. We should have to send further reinforcements to Crete. The Chief of the Imperial General staff had telegraphed to General Wavell, pointing out that Crete waspart of his Command, and that he would have to spare men togarrison it. It might be possible for General Wavell to spare someAustralian units who had not yet completed their training. TheDominions Secretary had telegraphed to the Australian Governmentto inquire whether they would consent to a move of this kind.For the present, Crete appeared to be in no great danger of italian attack.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Eire.The formerTreaty Ports.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 275thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Prime Minister said that we could not tolerate a continuance of shipping losses on the present scale. He referred toMr. de Valera&apos;s statement, reported in the Press as follows : &quot; There can be no question of handing over any of these ports on any conditions so long as this State remains neutral.&quot;It was now more unlikely than a few months ago that Eire woulddeclare war on Germany, since Dublin was now within easy range of air attack from occupied France. Even assuming that the Irishwanted to go to war, they would certainly demand large quantitiesof munitions before consenting to abandon neutrality.The Prime Minister thought that the only action which wouldbe of any value would be an approach to President Roosevelt to see what pressure he could put on Mr. de Valera. He might perhapssend a personal telegram on the following lines : -It will be at least two years before America can give usany effective help, since she is only now laying out her armamentfactories. The question is whether Great Britain can holdout for so long without the Treaty Ports. Anything which canbe done to get for us the use of the Treaty Ports would thus be in defence of American interests.
France.blockade policy:  theS.S. Cuba.(PreviousReference3. The War Cabinet were informed that the French ship Cuba,which our Contraband Control had intercepted, was now atFreetown. The vessel was being searched. How should we dispose of the vessel and of the 1,216 sailors on board her \ If the men went to Dakar they might be sent to take part in some expedition againstGeneral de Gaulle. Other possibilities would be to let the Cuba takew&quot;m &quot;(40) 282nd ^he men back to one of the Mediterranean ports of MetropolitanConclusions France, or to Casablanca, or again to send them to one of these minute 1.) &apos;      ports in a neutral ship.On the whole, it might be best to allow the Cuba to proceed toCasablanca, with the 1,216 sailors on board after the removal of allgold or valuable cargo. Casablanca was the port to which she hadbeen officially routed.   This suggestion was approved.The War Cabinet-i Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to issue instruc-tions accordingly.France.The french fleet:   JeanBart andRio helieu.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 4.)4. Further discussion took place as to the action to be takenin the event of the Jean Bart and Richelieu, endeavouring to pass into the Mediterranean. The discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.France.negotiations between the vichy andGermanGovernments.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 281stConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Foreign Secretary said that M. Rougier had now seenGeneral Weygand and had delivered our message. No report ofthe interview had yet been received.The Foreign Secretary also said that Marshal Petain&apos;s reply had now been received to the message sent by The King. The reply was sharp and unhelpful.   (Telegram 334, Saving, from Madrid.)In reply to a question, the Foreign Secretary said that hepersonally believed that nothing had yet been settled between hitler and the Vichy Government. He thought it was likely that negotia-tions would continue in an indefinite form for some time. this might be embarrassing for us.The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to the propa-ganda which was being carried out in unoccupied- France in favourof a &quot;New Order for Europe.&quot; The Foreign Secretary drew attention to a recent telegram from Switzerland, No. 1258, referring to similar propaganda in Switzerland. This was relevant to thework being done by the Committee under the Chairmanship of theLord Privy Seal on War Aims, which was preparing a statement torebut this propaganda.The War Cabinet took note of this information.The War Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to send a personal message to president Roosevelt on the lines suggested.
&quot;France.Movements ofGeneral de gaulle.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Prime Minister referred to the suggestion that general de Gaulle should go to Cairo. He feared that, if he went there,this might arouse the antagonism of General Weygand. He (thePrime Minister) would prefer that General de Gaulle should comehome and consult on the general situation, when his position asregards General Weygand could be discussed.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that recent telegrams from cairo (e.g., No. 1459) showed that General de Gaulle&apos;s supporters in Cairo favoured General de Gaulle&apos;s visit. Nevertheless, he agreed with the Prime Minister that there was much to be said for general de Gaulle&apos;s return to this country, as soon as the position atLibreville had been cleared up.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to draft a personal telegramfrom the Prime Minister to General de Gaulle suggestinghis return to this country for consultations.Egypt. 7.   The Prime Minister referred to a telegram which had beenSecurity of Suez received from the Senior Naval Officer Commanding the Canal ZoneCanal Zone.      regarding the presence of a number of Vichy supporters in the Zone.It was essential to make certain that the military movements in the zone were not betrayed by Vichy supporters. He had sent instruc-tions on the subject to the Foreign Office.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Spain. ^k.   The Foreign Secretary said that, as requested by theDr. Negrin. Cabinet, he and the First Lord had seen Dr. Negrin and had put(Previous to nmi various alternatives of the Secretary of State for Air&apos;reference: suggestion.  Dr. Negrin had been friendly but not very constructive.W.M. (40) 28lst He nacl agreed that he had overstepped the period of his hospitalityConclusions, here, and that he did not wish to increase our difficulties and that minute 6.) &apos; he was in our hands.   The Foreign Secretary said that he and theFirst Lord were to see Dr. Negrin again in two or three days&apos; time.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Tangier Inter-National Zone:Attitude of spain.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 6.)^ $r. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to telegram No. 971from Madrid reporting that the real reason for the Spanish coup inTangier was to forestall the Italians. Senor Suner had come tothe conclusion that the only course was to face them with a faitaccompli.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.China. / 6       The Foreign Secretary referred to telegrams received from(Previous Sir A. Clark Kerr in regard to Marshal Chiang Kai-Shek&apos;s desireReference: for closer co-operation.  He hoped to circulate in a few days a paper&quot;W.M. (40) 274th setting out his proposals for dealing with this matter.Conclusions, The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Minute 3.)
Air Raids.Damage and casualties.(previous reference://  EL The Minister of Home Security said that on the last two nights bombing had been more severe. The main force of theGerman night attacks had again been directed on London; raids ona lighter scale had taken place against the Midlands, the CornishPeninsula and East Anglia. On the previous night there had been.M. (40) 280th 76 killed and 316 injured in London, and 3 killed and 21 injuredConclusions, in the rest of the country. During the day, however, there had minute 7.)&apos;      been only one person injured.The damage in London had included a good deal of damage torailways and the blocking of the Rotherhithe Tunnel. There hadbeen damage to house and flat property, with a good many casualties,at Southwark, Wandsworth and Richmond.Several H.E. bombs had been dropped early in the night atPenzance, causing considerable damage and several casualties.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Air Services.Overseas AirCommunica-tions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 210thConclusions,Minute 2.)t/iSL. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda on OverseasAir Communications by the Secretary of State for Air, thePostmaster-General, the Minister of Information and the Ministerof Economic Warfare, and the Minister of Information (W.P (G.)(40) 290, 291, 293 and 294).The Secretary of State for Air, in his Paper, set out hisimmediate proposals for the maintenance and development ofour overseas air communications in support of our war effort, and the additions to the fleet required for this purpose by the British Overseas Airways Corporation. The other threeMemoranda supported these proposals, the joint Memorandum bythe Minister of Information and the Minister of Economic Warfareurging the importance of setting up a British air line to SouthAmerica.In discussion, the need for the maintenance or establishmentof these overseas air services was urged by the Ministers who had submitted Memoranda, and also by the President of the Board ofTrade and the Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and theColonies. It was argued that these services were required for essential war purposes; e.q., the rapid transport of spares foraeroplanes, of pilots. Staff Officers and important documents. Ifthese services could not be provided by British Overseas Airways,special communication flights would have to be formed. Theimportance of a good mail service to the Middle East was emphasisedby the Postmaster-General. The Minister of Information said thatthis war was a political war, and that political and subversive activities depended on rapid communication. For example, theSpanish Press had been bought by the enemy, but it would make agreat difference if we could distribute British newspapers in spain and Portugal. The Minister of Economic Warfare urged that ahigh priority should be given to the continuance of the service to sweden, which was essential for certain activities with which hewas charged. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thatevidence accumulated daily of the need for strengthening theTakoradi route.On the other hand, the Prime Minister said that, while he appreciated the advantages of improved overseas air communica-tions, he felt that, with the intensification of the war. we must directall our efforts to first essentials. The attack on our merchantshipping was now a very grave danger, and if we were to deal with it adequately we must sacrifice many other needs. He might havetaken a different view, if the strength of our Air Force had been increasing rapidly.The First Sea Lord also urged the need for employing onconvoys and protection duty all the long-distance aircraft whichcould be made available.
The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theheavy sinkings were beginning to have some effect on the mercantilemarine, and that propaganda was being used to persuade Alliedseamen not to continue to serve on ships sailing to this country.The provision of greater protection for our merchant shipping was already a matter of the first importance.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that, in his view,,none of the aircraft which it was proposed should be acquired bythe British Overseas Aircraft Corporation for these services couldbe made available for a considerable time. In the circumstances,he thought that the right course would be to postpone a decisionon the present proposals.In discussion, it became evident that there was some difference of view as to the feasibility of making aircraft available for theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation in the near future withoutsubstantial interference with military needs. It was agreed thatthis aspect of the matter should be cleared up before a decision was reached.The War Cabinet Invited a Committee comprising The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman).The Minister of Aircraft Production.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for Air.The Minister of Information to examine the proposals in the above Papers for themaintenance and improvement of our overseas air com-munications, and to report to the War Cabinet.It should be an instruction to the Committee to examine,in particular, what aircraft could be made available tothe British Overseas Airways Corporation in the nearfuture, and what degree of interference with military needswould be involved.Shipping.Importprogrammesand importing capacity.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 7.)/3l&amp;-   The War Cabinet had before them : (i) A Memorandum by the Minister of Shipping setting out our probable total imports in the second and third yearsof the war (W.P. (40) 411) :(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio on ourimporting capacity in the second year of the war(W.P. (G.) (40) 289).The Minister without Portfolio stressed the need for a reviewof our import programme, bearing in mind not only our shipping losses but also the congestion in the West Coast ports. Representa-tives of the Departments concerned had been sent to Liverpool tosee what could be done to bring about better co-ordination of sea and land transport.The Minister of Labour and National Service thought that thesorting of goods received by sea should be done, not near the port,but in the Mi dlands. The present system led to great congestion in the ports.The Minister of Transport said that the railways could carry the goods, provided their trucks were turned round quickly and sent back to the ports instead of being detained by the consignee.
48Shipping Losses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 275thConclusions,Minute 5).Placing oforders for merchant ships in UnitedStates.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 7.)The Minister of Shipping said that he had been discussing thematter with the Minister of Transport, and proposed to set up thenecessary machinery to deal Avith the situation. While he wouldbe happy to report on the position to the Economic Policy Com-mittee, he assumed that there was no objection to his giving effectforthwith to the measures decided upon.   This was agreed to.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the situation inregard to shipping losses was very serious. In addition to taking all possible steps to give greater protection to ships at sea, hethought that two large projects should be considered. First, to what extent the United States of America would give us help in regardto merchant shipping over and above the 60 ships which were being constructed for us on the cash-and-carry basis. Could the UnitedStates Government be persuaded to amend their Neutrality Legisla-tion in such a way as to give us a share of their merchant ships already built or building? Secondly, could anything be done to persuade the United States Government to go back on the under-takings which they had made and to bring goods to this country in american bottoms ? He proposed to continue the discussions he hadalready had on these matters with Lord Lothian and the Ministerof Shipping.The War Cabinet :-(i) Invited the Minister of Shipping and the Minister ofTransport in collaboration to set up machinery forthwith to take prompt executive action to prevent congestion ofgoods in ports.(ii) Invited the Minister of Transport to take similar actionto secure a quicker turn round on the railways.(iii) Invited the Economic Policy Committee to review theimport programme for the second year of the war onthe lines suggested; any points of major importancebeing referred to the War Cabinet for decision.(iv) Invited the Minister of Shipping and the Minister ofTransport to report the action taken under (i) and (ii)to the Economic Policv Committee.Air Raids. /YM,   The War Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumDropping of by the Home Secretary and the First Lord of the Admiralty, coveringparachute a draft statement for issue to the Press in regard to the droppingmines. of mines on land in the London area (W.P. (G.) (40) 288).  Hitherto,no reference to the dropping of these mines had been permitted inthe Press. It was now proposed to allow the Press a free handin dealing with this matter, subject to no publication taking placeon four specified points.In discussion, the view generally expressed was that, not havinghitherto allowed anything to be published about land mines dropped by aircraft, it was undesirable, on balance, to allow a limitedpublication now.The War Cabinet accordingly decided that the presentposition should be maintained, and that the proposed state-ment should not be issued.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 8, 1940.
