Naval, Militaryand air operations.Air Operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 289thConclusions,Minute 1.)fighter command.1. The Chief of the Air Staff gave the results of air fightingover the week-end.November 15. By day 350 enemy aircraft had been over thiscountry, mostly off the south-east coast.  The casualties had been : -Our own 3 machines (1 pilot safe).Enemy 18 certain.2 probable.4 damaged.(1 shot down by A.A. fire.)On Friday night 310 enemy machines had attacked targets inLondon and the Midlands. There had also been a serious attack onBournemouth. One enemy machine had been shot down by our nightfighters.November 16. By day 70 German machines had been over, but no casualties had resulted to either side.By night 120 German bombers had been over, but activity hadbeen on a greatly reduced scale. One bomber had been destroyed byA.A. fire.November 17. By day 270 enemy machines had been oversouth-east England.   The casualties had been : Our own 5 machines (4 pilots safe).Enemy 15 certain.5 probable.7 damaged.(of the 15 certain, 2 had been brought down by AA. fire.)By night 280 machines had attempted a concentrated attack onSouthampton. This attack had, however, miscarried and only 40bombs had been dropped on Southampton, the majority falling inthe New Forest.  No interceptions had been made.Bomber Night of November 15. 127 of our bombers had attackedCommand. military objectives in Hamburg, with very satisfactory results. Afurther 62 had attacked German aerodromes, with good results onfive aerodromes.  We had lost two machines.Night of November 16. We had sent over 142 machines, ofwhich 68 had bombed Hamburg. Visibility had been poor. We had lost 3 machines.Night of November 17. We had despatched 51 bombers, 43 ofwhich had been detailed to attack Gelsenkirchen Synthetic oil plants, and the remainder to attack Hamm and Lorient. the weather had been bad, and only 16 machines had bombed their primary targets. The others had bombed alternative targets in the ruhr.11 Wellingtons based on Malta had bombed Bari on the night of the 16th/17th, with great success, with the loss of one machine.The Chief of Naval Staff reported the details regarding theloss of a number of aircraft which had been flown off from the A rgusfor Malta on the morning of the 17th. The details are containedin the Secretary&apos;s Standard File.A report had been received from the Consul at Porta del Gadato the effect that a German tanker had taken on board some 1,300tons of aviation fuel. This tanker might intend to rendezvous withthe pocket battleship in the Atlantic. The War Cabinet were informed of the steps which had been taken to intercept these ships.Italy.naval operations
Shipping On the 15th the Apapa (British, 9,333 tons) had been bombedLosses. and sunk some 100 miles west of Blacksod Bay.,   The Planter(British, 5,887 tons) had been torpedoed on the 16th and had sunkon the evening of the 17th north of Bloody Foreland.Tugs had been sent to the assistance of the Fishpool, which hadbeen bombed and had now been reported that she had broken down.The losses from submarine attack had been less during theprevious week.  There was no reason to suppose that there had been any great increase in the number of German submarines operating.Prisoners from submarine crews had, in fact, reported that the crews were overworked.Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the followingOperations.       report of the position on the Greco-Albanian frontier :-- Northern Sector. On the frontier between two lakes Prespathere had been heavy artillery and air activity, but apparently noGreek advance.Bilishti had been captured by the Greeks. A report that alarge number of Italian tanks had retired into Yugoslav territorynear the Prespa Lake had not been confirmed.The Greeks were reported to have reached the ridge about  miles east of Koritza and to be within 4 miles of the town, whichwas under heavy artillery fire.PIndus Sector. Nothing to report.Epirus Sector. Konitza had been recaptured by the Greeks,after being set on fire by the enemy. Greek cavalry were pressing forward to cut the road between Konitza and the frontier.Greek troops were advancing due North through Kalpaki.On the coastal sector the Greeks held the general line Vratilia-Egoumenitsa.General. General Papagos was very satisfied with the courseof operations, but the urgent needs of the Greeks in ammunition andmaterial were daily becoming increasingly obvious. They had madea further urgent request for air support, to counteract Italian air action, especially on the Epirus front.The Prime Minister said that it was clear that we could not increase our air reinforcements beyond what we had already arranged to send. He had seen a report that the landing groundsin Albania were already so congested that the arrival of german air reinforcements on this front seemed improbable.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Air Raids:casualties and damage.Casualties onNovember 17.Attack onCoventry,14th-15thNovember.2. The Minister of Home Security said that the civilian casualties on the previous day were estimated as follows : Day casualties London : 9 killed, 27 injured.Elsewhere : 3 killed, ? 3 injured.Night casualties London : 19 killed, 58 injured.Elsewhere : 26 killed, 63 injured.In a statement on the position at Coventry, which he and theMinister of Aircraft Production had visited on the 15th November,the Minister made the following points : (1) On the whole the damage to munitions production was lessextensive than had been feared. Work was considerablyimpeded by damage to public utilities. The water and gas positions were both bad, but the main structure ofthe electricity supply remained.
3. Attention was drawn to the degree of publicity given in thePress and by the British Broadcasting Corporation to the air raidon Coventry on the night of the 14th-15th November, and to the emphasis laid on the damage suffered. The somewhat unusual stephad been taken of stating the number of casualties incurred in thisparticular raid.The War Cabinet were informed that the number of casualties had been stated in a communique issued under the joint authorityof the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security. .The Minister of Home Security said that, in his absence, the communique had been dealt with by high officers of the Ministry,for whose action he took responsibility. There was advantage instating the number of casualties in a heavy raid, as otherwiserumours of exaggerated casualties passed into currency.The Minister of Information said that the mention of 1,000casualties in the communique showed that the raid had been on anunusually large scale. On the whole, he thought that the treatmentof this raid by the Press had not been unsatisfactory and had had agood effect on the morale of Coventry itself.- He had prohibited any reference to the fact that the attack had been concentrated on thecentre of the city and that far less damage had been done to the factories, which were mainly on the outskirts of the city.Air Raids:B.B.C. and press reports.Attack onCoventry,14th-15thNovember.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 288thConclusions,Minute 1.)(2) Very good work had been put in during the raid and after-wards by all the authorities, including the regional commissioner and his staff, the military authorities, therepresentatives of the Production Departments and the mayor and Corporation of Coventry. Military and civil authorities were working well together.(3) Between 800 and 1.000 people had been injured; the numberof killed so far reported was 290.(4) At first the local people had been shaken by theirexperiences, and had been bitter at what they regardedas the lack of active defences. Nevertheless, they hadkept their heads. The Minister said that he, the Ministerof Aircraft Production and the local Anti-AircraftCommander had explained to the Coventry authorities the organisation of the fighter aircraft defence, and theA.A. artillery defence.(5) The King&apos;s visit to Coventry on the 16th November hadbeen of the utmost value in speeding up the recovery ofmorale.(6) Transport provision had been made for the evacuation of10,000 of the inhabitants of Coventry, but only about 300had availed themselves of the official Ministry of Healtharrangements, though others had gone on their own initiative.The Minister of Labour and National Service suggested thatthe Departments concerned should be instructed to study, as a matterof urgency, the possibility of organising a grid system for gassupplies.The Prime Minister said that this was a matter which could notbe discussed in the absence of the President of the Board of Trade.The most convenient method of raising the subject would be if theMinister of Labour put in a memorandum.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the Ministerof Home Security.
The Secretary of State for War said that he had listened on saturday night to a special account of the effects of the air raid,given by the B.B.C. This had been a most depressing broadcast,and would have a deplorable effect on Warwickshire units.Other Ministers confirmed this view.The Prime Minister said that he did not suggest that thedecision to give prominence to the Coventry raid was wrong. Theeffect had been considerable both in the United States and. from adifferent point of view, in Germany. The enemy seemed to bealarmed at the publicity given to this raid, and to have taken theunusual course of announcing that they had lost 223 dead in ourraid on Hamburg on the following night. Unless the publicity inthe Press had had a bad effect on our morale, he doubted if it had done any harm. Nevertheless, he wished to be assured that thedecision as to the degree of publicity given to raids of this characterwas entrusted to an officer of high standing. He would be glad ifthe Ministers concerned would consider the present procedure fromthis point of view.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Broadcasting.constitution and manage-ment of theB.B.C.4. In connection with the previous Minute in which the account given by the B.B.C. of the position in Coventry was strongly criticised The War Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Information to examine andreport to the War Cabinet what changes, if any, were necessary in the constitution and management of theB.B.C.. in order to ensure its effective control by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that a leakage had taken place regarding the Britishplan for promoting a better understanding with the Soviet Govern-ment. A comprehensive memorandum setting out our plan had been handed to the Soviet authorities by Sir Stafford Cripps on theW.M. (40) 27.9th 22nd October. Possibly M. Molotov had disclosed our offer to theConclusions, Germans during his visit to Berlin, presumably in order to obtainMinute 4.) even better terms from them. However that might be, a leakage,which certainly came from the Soviet side, had occurred on the15th November. As no previous guidance had been given to theBritish Press, they had been taken completely by surprise, and had addressed inquiries to officials of the Foreign Office who hadadmitted the general truth of these reports. He (the foreign secretary) of course accepted responsibility for the action taken.The Prime Minister thought that the answer given should havebeen that the Foreign Office were unable to make a statement;negotiations between Governments were constantly taking place,but were in the nature of things confidential.The Foreign Secretary said he concurred in this view. No doubt the Soviet would try to put the blame for the leakage on us.Probably the incident would have no marked effect on Soviet policy.The House of Commons might, perhaps, be a little sore that thePress had been the first to receive the news, but on the whole there ought to be no seriously untoward results.U.S.S.R.Anglo- soviet relations.(previous reference:
In discussion it was pointed out that it was as well that the left Wing elements in this country should know how baseless wasthe -marge that His Majesty&apos;s Government never made an effort to cultivate friendly relations with the U.S.S.R. It would not be worth while making any further advances to the Soviet for thepresent.The Baltic In reply to a question, the Foreign Secretary thought that weStates. should not be seriously embarrassed by the disclosure that we hadbeen willing to give something like de facto recognition to theRussian occupation of the Baltic States. It might be possible to argue that we had only stated the obvious fact that the russians were in effective control of those countries.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Greece. 6.   The Foreign Secretary drew the attention of the WarFinancial Cabinet to telegram No. 864 from the Treasury to Sir MichaelAssistance. Palairet, and to the latter&apos;s reply (Athens telegram No. 1153). The(Previous King of Greece and the Greek Government were said to be keenlyReference: disappointed at what they regarded as the ungenerous attitude of w.M. (40) 278th the Treasury.Conclusions, j^ne Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Greek Govern-minute 2.) ment had misunderstood the Treasury, who were offering them morethan they had asked. The first advance would be  5,000,000; itwould be unaccompanied by any request for the payment of interest or the repayment of instalments of principal. The object of para-graph 6 of the Treasury telegram (which read : &quot; We would alsolike you to establish the principle that the Hellenic Governmentshould submit proposals for expenditure from the credit to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in advance for approval &quot;) was to elicit fromthe Greeks the information which we should require in order tomake the necessary shipping facilities available. It was not intended to make our assistance conditional on the Greeks sub-mitting proposals in advance for approval. The Chancellor saidthat he would furnish the Foreign Secretary with a draft reply toSir Michael Palairet.The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that a Com-mittee on Assistance to Greece was sitting under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. As a result of their first recommendations, which the Chiefs of Staff had accepted withcertain modifications, four shiploads of munitions were about to besent to Greece.The War Cabinet-Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would furnish the Foreign Secretary with a draft reply to HisMajesty&apos;s Minister in Athens.Blockads 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePolicy. Committee on Foreign (Allied) Resistance, on the Breach in the france Blockade   of   Metropolitan  France  and   the   French   Colonies(Previous (W.P. (40) 446).Reference: j^he Minister of Economic Warfare reminded the War cabinet.M. (40) 286th a month earlier he had protested against French West AfricanConclusions, trade proceeding virtually without interference. Since then the minute 6.) position had gone from bad to worse. It was clear that a Trans-altantic trade was being developed from Martinique to Dakar, and thence up the West African coast. Perhaps the most disquietinginstance was the s.s Fortunata. This was an Italian vessel, loaded with a cargo of toluol, which was now being unloaded at Port
Lyautey at night,&quot; the toluol being sent overland to Libya, fromwhich, presumably, it would be sent to Italy. The present positionreduced economic warfare to a farce.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that shipping was.now being collected at Dakar. The main West African crops,including the Senegal groundnut crop, were now coming forward.If no action was taken during the next few weeks, we should lose anopportunity, which would not recur for a year, of applying fulleconomic pressure on French West Africa. If this trade was notstopped, the resistance of the French West African Colonies against us would be greatly strengthened, and the Free French Colonies in.Africa would be greatly disheartened.The Minister of Shipping said that shipping movements showed a revival of French and French Colonial trade. Shipping from german-eontrolled ports had been released on a substantial scale and had proceeded under escort east-bound through the Straits of gibraltar! Feeder services were being established from Americanports to Martinique. Information pointed to a plan to organiseescorted homeward convoys of French ships now at Buenos Aires.Traffic from North Africa for France was proceeding almostnormally.From a shipping point of view he would like to seize some of theFrench ships engaged on this trade, which would be very valuable tous. Sixty-one British and Allied ships were detained in Frenchand North African ports which the French were under pledge toreturn to us.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theMinisters of Economic Warfare and Shipping had presented a very strong case. He thought we must take it that a considerable pro-portion of the goods passing into unoccupied France found its wayinto enemy territory, since Germany now exercised virtual controlover all communications, whether in occupied or in unoccupied france.In present circumstances, the French were getting the best ofboth worlds. They had not answered our approaches for a modus vivendi, which they were probably using as a lever in their negotia-tions with Germany; and they were benefiting from the fact that wewere not interfering with their trade. The present position couldnot be allowed to continue.He thought that the two chief anxieties of the Vichy Govern-ment at the present time were to retain hold of the French Fleet andof North Africa. The Vichy Government would therefore be anxious to avoid a Naval clash, even if we took steps to enforce our blockade. He therefore favoured instructing the Admiralty to bring in occasional ships for Contraband Control purposes, provided thatthey did not take such drastic action as was likely to result in aserious Naval clash.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the War Cabinet&apos;decision turned on a question of balance. Since the previous June,owing to the number of naval ships undergoing repair, our blockadehad been largely a matter of bluff. The First Lord set out thevarious demands upon the Fleet at the present time; e.g., the strong-effort required to break the enemy counter-blockade; the need for action in the Eastern Mediterranean, and the demands for Mediter-ranean escorts. A clash with the French Fleet at the present time would bring us into a position of great danger: He had had noprevious information of any number of ships proceeding from german controlled ports through the Straits, and he agreed that ifthis happened it would be a very serious matter.Looking at the matter as a whole, he still thought it was.desirable that we should attempt to reach a modus vivendi with the vichy Government.   If it was established that a large proportion
of the trade passing up the West African coast and through theStraits found its way into enemy territory, that was a matter to bedealt with by economic negotiations, aiming at a ration for imports into unoccupied France.In further discussion the Foreign Secretary said that it mustbe remembered that the Vichy Government were in a position inwhich it was very difficult for them to make an agreement with uson these matters. We might have to put them into a position inwhich they could say to the Germans that we had interfered withtheir trade by force rnajeure.The Prime Minister said that the difficulties of the presentsituation arose from its indeterminate character. The consequences of allowing the present position to continue would be very serious.He recounted the steps by which the present position had beenreached.The present time, he thought, might well be favourable to action. The French were sore over the German action in Lorraine.We had had the naval success at Taranto, and General Weygandappeared to be indisposed to work in with the Germans. Hethought, therefore, that we must be prepared to run some risks inorder to interfere with the trade through the Straits. It would ofcourse be very serious if we had a big naval clash with the French,but he did not think that this would happen. The French had made no response to the offers which we had made to them and inthe meantime had continued to build up this trade. He thoughtthat, as soon as a suitable opportunity offered, the Admiralty should try to make a coup and bring in for contraband control as manyships as they could lay their hands on. It would not be necessaryto take such action continuously. The deterrent effect of a fewseizures would be considerable. No doubt the Vichy Governmentwould protest. If they did, we could then point out to them howbadly they had behaved to us.Discussion followed as to when the Navy would be able to make adequate forces available for this operation. The Prime minister thought that this matter could conveniently be discussed at aMeeting of the Defence Committee (Operations).Attention was drawn to the fact that numbers of Frenchmerchant ships were said to be passing through the Straits withalmost nominal escorts, e.g., only a sloop or an armed trawler.The First Sea Lord said that there was no particular difficultyin stopping an escorted convoy on the first occasion. Our realtroubles would begin if, after one convoy had been stopped, the vichy Government sent out merchant ships with a powerful Navalescort. We should then have to collect an adequate force and togive battle, or allow the vessels to proceed. The objections he felt to the course proposed would be largely met if we were not com-mitted to continue to stop French convoys, whatever action the vichy Government took.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought that, if we stoppedFrench ships passing through the Straits, the Vichy Governmentwould be more likely to proceed with discussions to reach a modus vivendi than to send out strong naval forces against us. He addedthat he would like to send a message to the Vichy Government,through our Embassy at Madrid, asking them to send someone todiscuss economic matters with representatives from this country.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that consideration should be given to the question whether the United states administration would take steps to stop ships proceeding from united States ports to Martinique, as part of an operation to run the blockade across the Atlantic.
(PreviousPieference:W.M. (40) 286thConclusions,Minute 6.)After further discussion the War Cabinet decided as follows : (1) It was agreed in principle that action should be taken,on the first convenient opportunity, to apply con-- traband control measures to French escorted Convoyspassing through the Straits of Gibraltar.(2) The First Lord of the Admiralty was invited toconsider what steps could appropriately be taken tothis end. This matter should be discussed at ameeting of the Defence Committee (Operations).(3) No further notice should be given to the Vichy Govern-ment of our intention to stop French Convoyspassing through the Straits of Gibraltar.(4) Notwithstanding (1) and (3) above, the foreign secretary should invite the Vichy Government,through our Ambassador at Madrid, to send a repre-sentative to Madrid to discuss economic matters with a representative from this country.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theProduction. Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (G.) (40) 301)Christmas pointing out that a decision must be reached very soon as to whatbreak for break should be given at Christmas to those employed on work ofworkers national importance.   The Minister suggested that he should beauthorised to start discussions with employers&apos; and workers&apos;organisations. The best plan might be that work should continue upto and including Sunday the 22nd, and should stop on Monday,Tuesday and Wednesday, the 23rd, 24th and 25th December.After a preliminary discussion the War Cabinet decided : That this matter should be disctissed at a meeting of theCivil Defence Executive Sub-Committee to be held thefollowing morning, to which the three Supply departments should be invited to send representatives. The basis fordiscussion should be that the War Cabinet hoped that production would only be stopped for one week-day at christmas, viz., Christmas Day in England and Wales,and New Year&apos;s Day in Scotland. The Home secretary was invited to report to the War Cabinet on the following day the result of the discussion at the Civil defence executive Sub-Committee.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 18, 1940.
