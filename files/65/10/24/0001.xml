Admiral Darlan had said thatthe French Government would resist German pressure to attack the de Gaulle colonies, anyway until February, and possiblylonger. He added that there was now no question of Germanybeing granted the use of French Metropolitan or African bases.If the German pressure became irresistible, they would inviteus in time to take them over. He was confident that the french ships would have time to leave the Metropolitan harbours and,if not, they would scuttle themselves. M. Dupuy had addedthat Marshal Petain had agreed with these views.^pain. The Foreign Secretary reported that he had that morning seen(Previous Mr. Eccles, who had been in Spain dealing with economic matters.Reference:        Mr. Eccles thought that events were taking a favourable turn for usW.M.

Mr. EcclesConclusions,      was returning to Spain with the object of pursuing trade barterMinute 4.)        arrangements, and had suggested that if he was able to get toMorocco he might be able to obtain some information.

He imagined that the present proposals did not affectthis plan.  This was agreed.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal for providing protected accommoda-tion set out in paragraphs (1) to (4) of W.P. (40) 477; and agreed that the Dover Street Tube Station project shouldnot be proceeded with.Royal Air 4.

A number of membersReference: of the House of Lords had opposed this suggestion, and the matterW.M.

Eire. 5.   The Prime Minister said that this matter had been dis-Future policy,    cussed with Sir John Maffey and with the Prime Minister ofp-  . Northern Ireland.   The latter had seen no objection to the courseReference-        o:^ ao^on proposed, and said that he would take the same line asW i\&apos;I (40) 301st        ProPosed by the Government in all public statements.Conclusions, It was agreed that action on the line proposed should be1 Minute 8.)        j ustified on the ground of economic necessity; and that the strongestargument in favour of its adoption was that it afforded the best way of breaking the present impasse.The Prime Minister said that, before taking action on the linesfavoured by the War Cabinet at their last meeting, he thought itwould be wise to consult President Roosevelt. He proposed to telegraph to him in the course of the next few days. ProvidedPresident Roosevelt did not react strongly against the proposal,there would be nothing to prevent action being taken. The WarCabinet would, however, be consulted before action was initiated.The War Cabinet took note of the above position.United Statesof America.ProposedBritish supply council in north america.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 300thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister for Aircraft Production (W.P. (G.) (40) 318&apos; (Revise))recommending for approval proposals which had been agreed as theresult of discussion between the three Supply Ministers andMr. Purvis.The War Cabinet also had before them an unnumbered telegram dated the 12th December from Mr. Mackenzie King to the PrimeMinister.In discussion the following amendments to W.P. (G.) (40) 318(Revise) were adopted :  Paragraphs (1) and (4). For &quot; British-North AmericaSupply Council &quot; read &quot; British Supply Council in north america.&quot;After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed on the followingcourse of action ; (a) It should be explained that the Government were perfectlyready that a statement on this matter should be made inthe House of Lords in open sesssion, on the lines of thestatement made by the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons on the 10th December.(b) In the Governments considered view, however, this matter could not be effectively debated without reference tosecret matters, which must not be revealed to the enemy.Again, public debate would be likely to stir up con-troversy between the Royal Navy and the Royal AirForce.(c) If, therefore, after hearing the Government statement, theHouse of Lords still desired to debate the matter, theGovernment adhered to their view that this should bedone in secret session.(d) The Lord Chancellor was invited to see Lord Trenchardand explain the matter to him on the basis of (a) to (e)above.(e) If the House of Lords debated this matter in secret session,it was essential that the Government spokesmen shouldbe provided with material for their speeches which would justify the Government&apos;s contention that the matter was not one which could properly have been debated in public session.
Paragraph (1). The phrase &quot; under the general aegis and authority of the Ambassador &apos;&apos; should be deleted. The phrase&quot; in harmony with the Ambassador &quot; should be inserted after&quot; The Council &quot; in paragraph 3.Paragraph (3). For &quot; all political issues concerningSupply &quot; substitute &quot; all issues of policy concerning Supply.&quot;The following additional points were made in discussion : (a) It was the intention of paragraph (7) of W.P. (G.) (40) 318(Revise) that the relevant papers of the Supply Com-mittee in London should be circulated to all the interested Departments. There would be a standingsecretariat under the direction of Sir Andrew Duncan.On this understanding, it was agreed that the arrange-ments in paragraph (7) safeguarded the position of thenon-Supply Departments.(&amp;) Some discussion took place on the relationship between theBritish Supply Council and the War Office Mission whichthe War Office were about to send to the United States.The War Office Mission would remain directly responsible to the War Office, and would not be subordinated to theBritish Supply Council on technical matters. On theother hand, the Head of the Military Mission would actin consultation with Mr. Purvis, and under his general guidance. For example, Mr. Purvis would advise him as to the personages and Departments in the UnitedStates with whom he should establish relations.The War Cabinet- .(1) Approved the arrangements proposed in W.P.
