Land mines had also been dropped.  The casualties had been :  London : 85 killed, 534 injured.Elsewhere : 17 killed, 76 injured.At the request of the Prime Minister, the Minister of aircraft production gave an account of a meeting held that morning to review the progress made in methods of defence against night raiders. TheMinister said that, while we should not look for any immediate andspectacular results, many promising developments were beingresolutely driven forward.The Minister of Labour and National Service referred to thesuggestion that had been made at an earlier Meeting of the war.M.

The Secretary of State for A ir undertook to look further intothis suggestion, subject to the general understanding that nothing should be allowed to distract the energies of the Royal Air force from their essential task of providing the best possible fighterdefence for this country.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Parliament.Meeting place.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The War Cabinet were informed that some damage hadbeen done to the Palace of Westminster on the previous night. TheHouse of Commons would meet on the following day in the Annexe.The House of Lords had arranged to meet in the Palace of West-minster on Tuesday, the 10th December. This arrangement wouldbe adhered to, but thereafter arrangements would probably be madefor the House of Lords to meet in the Annexe so long as the Houseof Commons held its meetings there.Royal Air Force.The coastal command.5. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, as theresult of his enquiry into the relations between the Admiralty and coastal Command, a solution had been arrived at which was satis-factory both to the Admiralty and the Air Ministry. The issues involved were quite unsuitable for Parliamentary debate, and itwould be necessary to resist a demand for such a debate which wasto be made in the House of Lords on the following day. Least of allought the Government to pledge itself that Parliament would always be consulted in advance before decisions were taken affecting the relationship between the three Defence Services.The War Cabinet agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s viewson this matter.Espionage. q    The Home Secretary informed the War Cabinet that twoTrial and spies who had entered this country by boat and had been capturedexecution of in September, had since been tried and sentenced to death. Anspies. appeal for clemency had been made, but he saw no reason whysentence should not be carried out. The men would accordingly behanged on the following day.Some discussion ensued whether these men should be hanged orshot. On the one hand, it was urged that public opinion generally would support the view that a spy, when not a traitor to his own country, should be shot and not hanged. On the other hand, it waspointed out that these men were civilians and not soldiers; that theyhad been tried by a Civil Court and sentenced to death by hanging;and it would be very difficult to find good reason to vary thissentence.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to examine this point further,but not to delay the execution of these men.(2) Took note that a communique would be issued when the men had been executed.aircraft production.Dispersal ofaircraftfactories.7. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister of Aircraft Production and the Minister of Food, on the dispersal of aircraft factories (W.P. (40) 467 and 474).In the course of discussion the following points were made : (1) The Minister of Labour and National Service asked that he might be informed when productive establishments were dispersed, in order that he might deal with the trans-ference of labour involved.
(2) The Lord Privy Seal urged that it was a dangerous position that industries should be free to leave areas because theyhad been heavily bombed. If this process was allowedto continue there would be a great loss of productivecapacity.The War Cabinet-(d) Took note of the Paper by the Minister of Aircraft Pro-duction in regard to the dispersal of aircraft factories,including the proposal that any premises not in actualoccupation, even if earmarked for use by some other ^Department, should be at the disposal of the Minister, ifremoval or dispersal was necessitated by enemy action.(b) Agreed that the procedure in (a) above should be subject tothe following conditions : (i) that notification was given immediately to theDepartment concerned, which would have theright to ask for the return of the premises;(ii) that, while discussion on these matters would normally be settled between the Departments con-cerned, any Minister concerned should have theright to refer any point in dispute for settlement,either by the existing priority machinery or by reference to the War Cabinet :(c) Took note that the Lord Presidents Committee had underconsideration the measures necessary to strengthen theorganisation for dealing with warehouse and factoryaccommodation generally, and for improving the system for allocating such accommodation.Germany. 8.   The Prime Minister referred to a discussion which he hadStrength of the ^ad witJl rePresentatives of the Intelligence Staffs of the Depart-German Air ments concerned.   He hoped shortly to submit a Paper to the WarTporce&quot; Cabinet on this subject.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 141st Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,Conclusions, December 9, 1940.Minute 9.)
