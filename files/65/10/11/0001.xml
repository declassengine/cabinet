Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 290thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Greece.NavalOperationsEast african coast.shipping losses.MilitaryOperations.Italy-Greece.1. The Secretary of State for Air reported that fighter opera-tions on the previous day had been on a small scale, and neither sidehad suffered or inflicted any casualties.On the previous night about 130 enemy bombers had been over this country. The raiders had split up, and the majority had flownover Wiltshire. Abnormally large numbers had been engaged inmine-laying off the east coast.On the previous day Coastal Command aircraft had destroyedone D.O. 18 and damaged another. Two Blenheims on patrol had attacked and damaged two H.E. 115&apos;s off Texel.Owing to bad weather the operations of day and night bombershad been cancelled, with the exception of 11 machines which hadbombed Leuna. All had returned safely, but no reports were yet available.On the previous day our bombers had bombed supply dumps20 miles south of Tirana. A standing fighter patrol had been main-tained over Athens.The Chief of Naval Staff reported that Newcastle had arrivedsafely at Malta.Four more Town Class destroyers had arrived in this country.On the previous day the enemy had bombed a number of sloops,minesweepers and destroyers off the East coast. None of these attacks had been successful.The Channel convoy had been bombarded, but had suffered no casualties.The submarine Swordfish, on patrol off Brest, had been overduesince the 16th November and must now be presumed lost.The Dorsetshire had bombarded Dante, in Italian Somaliland,on the evening of the 18th, and had badly damaged the targets onshore.  There had been no shipping in the harbour.The Nestlea (British 4,274 tons) had been bombed and machine-gunned near Fastnet on the previous morning and had sunk. TheFabian (British 3,059 tons) had been sunk by a U-boat south-west of Freetown on the 16th instant. The St. Germain (british,044 tons), with a cargo of pit-props, had been torpedoed 30 miles off Bloody Foreland on the 17th instant, but was still afloat.The Italians had claimed to have shot down a Blackburn Shark.It was possible that this was the Skua aircraft which had flown off from the Argus on the morning of the 17th.The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing toreport from the Greek front. It was evident, however, that the greeks were suffering from attacks by Italian aircraft on theKoritza front.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Greece. 2.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of theMilitary decisions reached by the Defence Committee (Operations) at aAssistance.       Meeting held on the previous night.(Previous A record of the statement is contained in the Secretary&apos;reference:        Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M. (40) 290thConclusions,Minute 1.)
foreign information.Use of naval bases in the americas.Rumoursregarding aseparate peacewith italy .food situation in spain:United states attitude.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams :  .&quot; Mr. Butler had heard from a good source that a proposal was afoot that all naval bases belonging to twenty-one american states should be at the joint services of their naval forces; andthat a second stage was also being canvassed at which latin america would offer a reciprocal arrangement for the use oftheir naval bases to countries of the British Empire.&quot; (Tele-gram No. 2702 from Washington.)This telegram was interesting in its implications of a possiblenew world order.&quot; Mr. Yencken suggested that, if there was no objection, astatement might be broadcast in the British, Spanish andItalian bulletins stating that &apos; as a consequence of rumourscirculated in Madrid, it is officially denied that Italy has madeapproaches to the British Embassy in Madrid, with a view to making a separate peace with Great Britain.&apos; &quot; (TelegramNo. 1058 from Madrid.)The Foreign Secretary said that he had heard nothing of suchrumours, but enquiries were being made. In the meantime, he didnot propose to take any action.The Foreign Secretary said the Cabinet would have read anumber of telegrams referring to the anxieties in regard to the food situation in Spain.The United States had adopted a very stiff attitude in thismatter, and he had telegraphed to Washington urging that theUnited States should not endeavour to obtain from General Francoa public declaration of policy in regard to non-belligerency in exhange for a present of 10,000 tons of wheat, and had suggestedthat we should be content with a private assurance.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.blockade policy.France.(previous reference:VJ.K :40) 290thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The First Lord- of the A dmiralty said that during the next two or three days forces would be available which could be used toapply contraband control measures to French-escorted convoyspassing through the Straits of Gibraltar. He proposed to issue instructions that, if a suitable opportunity arose to bring in french ships for Contraband Control during that period, action should betaken.The Prime Minister said that he agreed to the action proposed.No doubt an endeavour would be made to intercept Vichy french ships in other parts of the world. It would not, of course, be possibleto continue to apply contraband control measures continuously, since our Naval forces had many other tasks to perform.The War Cabinet took note with approval of this statement.France: theFrench Fleet.Jean Bartand Richelieu.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 286thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a personal telegram from President Roosevelt setting out the answer which thePresident had received to the personal message he had sent to marshal Petain in regard to these ships.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
6. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat the scale of attack in the previous 24 hours had been con-siderably lighter.   Casualties had been as follows : By Day-London : None killed, 3 injured.Elsewhere : 4 killed, 15 injured.By Night London : None killed or injured.Elsewhere : 6 killed, 46 injured.Very little damage of importance had been done.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.7. The Home Secretary said that at the Meeting of the civil defence Executive Sab-Committee held that morning, the followingviews had been expressed by representatives of Departments : The Ministries of Supply and of Aircraft Production didnot favour more than one day&apos;s holiday. The Admiralty andthe Post Office were willing to fall in with whatever arrange-ment was agreed upon. The Scottish Office thought that itwould be difficult to ensure only one day&apos;s interruption ofproduction during Hogmanay. The Ministry of Transporturged that, for transport purposes, Christmas Day should betreated as a Sunday, and no special travel facilities given. TheMinistry of Labour pointed out that certain industries were working short time and that output might benefit from anticipa-tion of a holiday and the rest attained thereby. whatever decision the Government took, it would be necessary to carry with them the representatives of employers and Trade Unions.The question of pay for work on Bank Holiday should be dealtwith in accordance with the trade agreements operative ineach industry, or by special arrangement where no such agree-ment existed.The Minister of Labour and National Service pointed out that,on the assumption that production was stopped for only one week-day at Christmas, certain special problems would arise. Forexample, was it necessary that distributive shops should open onBoxing Day, although virtually no business would be done on that day?The view generally expressed was that some latitude should beallowed for special arrangements in cases of this kind.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinetthat he had consulted the Banks which were prepared to fall in with whatever general arrangement was made.The War Cabinet-(1) A greed that the general principle should be that production would be stopped for only one day at Christmas,viz., Christmas Day in England and Wales, and NewYear&apos;s Day in Scotland.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service todiscuss the matter on this basis with employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations.(3) Agreed that it should be an instruction to the Minister ofLabour and National Service:(a) to allow reasonable latitude to deal with special cases; e.g., the distributive trades:(b) that payment for work on Bank Holiday should bedealt with in accordance with the trade agree-ments operative in each industry.
Agriculture. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them : Proposed Memorandum by the Minister for Aircraft Production,increase of (W.P. (G.) (4) 283.)home food Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, the Secretaryproduction of state for Scotland and the Home Secretary.  (W.P. (G.) (40)in 1941. 3020(Previous Extract from Minutes of the Food Policy Committee.Reference: (W.P. (G.) (40) 303.)W.M. (40) 237th m, .    .    &apos;       . ,   .     , . ,. ,-conclusions, The principal points made in the course of discussion were the minute 1.) &apos;      following:-(i) By raising the yield of the existing arable acreage by5 per cent., which was by no means impossible, we could secure an addition to our food supply equivalent to theaddition which would result from ploughing up a million acres of grassland and sowing it to crops,(ii) The best method of dealing with farms where the tenantwas lacking in the cash or knowledge necessary to make his farm fully productive was for Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees to carry out the necessary work on his behalf, even if they cannot in all cases recover the whole cost.(iii) One of the main problems was that of drainage, for which grants of 50 per cent, were available at present. an effective stimulus would be given if the balance of costcould be advanced to Drainage Authorities, pending itsrecovery from the land-owners, over a period of years.About 5,000-10,000 more workers would have to beemployed, and care would have to be taken that the gangswere not dispersed when work was completed on aparticular farm. They should be under the orders of theauthorities concerned in the Drainage Schemes and available for work in any part of the Authority&apos; s area.(iv) The Minister of Shipping drew attention to the recom-mendation in&apos; W.P. (G.) (40) 282 that 200,000 tons of fertilisers should be imported from the United States.The only way of making the necessary shipping availablewas at the expense of other items in the food importsprogramme. This would give rise to some difficultpriority questions.The Minister of Food said that he agreed generally,subject to the proviso that room could not be found in theimport programme for fertilisers (which would not provide food until next year) until this year&apos;s food supply had been assured.(v) The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that, afterthe implications of the new policy had been worked out,it would be necessary to make a public announcement. Itwas important that there should be no leakage in themeantime.The War Cabinet :--(1) Gave a general approval to the recommendations of theFood Policy Committee as set out in WP. (G.) (40) 303,including the offer of a guarantee to the agricultural industry that the present system of fixed prices and an assured market would be maintained for the duration ofthe war and for at least one year thereafter.(2) Invited the Food Policy Committee to examine the implications-tions of the new policy and to agree upon the terms of apublic announcement. The announcement should include a statement that the Government, which repre-sented all political parties, recognised the importance ofmaintaining after the war a healthy and well-balancedagriculture as an essential feature of national policy.
(3) Invited the Food Policy Committee also to consider the priority to be afforded to the import of 200,000 tons of fertilisers from the United States, in relation to theexisting food imports programme.(4) Recognised that Scottish agriculture presented problems ofits own, which called for special action, e.g., the main-tenance of hill sheep farms and methods of dealing withpests, such as rabbits and bracken.(5) Agreed that it would be impossible to recover, in the first year, the full cost of the cash advances made to landowners or farmers in respect of works for improving the productivity of their land. The Food Policy Committeewas invited to settle the terms on which repaymentshould be made.machine tools.(previous reference:&apos;W.M. (40) 274thConclusions,Minute 5.)Proposedadditionalorder in theUnited states for delivery tothe Ministry-of aircraft production.Provision ofMachineTools forGovernmentTrainingCentres.W.M. (40) 274thConclusions,Minute 5.9. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister of Aircraft Production, the Minister of Labour and theMinister without Portfolio (W.P. (G.) (40) 286, 295 and 299).The Minister of A ireraft Production explained that he wanted to place a further order in the United States for machine toolscosting  10 millions over and above the orders described in theMemorandum by the Minister without Portfolio. He wished toplace this order direct with American industry, and not throughthe British Purchasing Commission. He would, however, expect his department to receive their due proportion of the outstandingorders referred to in that Memorandum.The Minister of Supply said that we were already asking for delivery of  22-J millions worth of machine tools in the second sixmonths of 1941 from the United States. It would be very difficult to fulfil this programme, and he did not see how American industry could accept an additional order.The War Cabinet were reminded that Mr. Purvis was on thepoint of reaching London, and the Prime Minister thought that heshould be consulted before aNdecision was reached on this proposal.The Minister of labour disputes\and National Service said that hisCentres were training persons whom the factories could not train :e.g., men between 50 and 60, coming from trades unconnected withengineering. A high proportion of persons trained in these Centreswent to aircraft factories.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that every aircraft factory throughout the country attached more value to machine toolsthan to labour. He strongly urged that all available machine toolsshould at once be allocated to productive establishments.The Minister without Portfolio said that he had made arrange-ments which would result in the Ministry of Labour Centresreceiving roughly three-quarters of their requirements of machine tools.The War Cabinet :  (1) Invited the Minister without Portfolio and the Ministers incharge of the Supply Departments to ascertainMr. Purvis&apos;s views on the proposal that an additionalorder for machine tools, value  10 millions, should beplaced directly by the Ministry of Aircraft Productionin the United States.(2) Reaffirmed the decisions reached on the 21st October inregard to the provision of machine tools for government training Centres.(3) Adopted the recommendations made by the Minister with-out Portfolio in paragraph 13 of his Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (40) 299).
Man-Power.Requirementsof theServices andof Industry.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 193rdConclusions,Minute 1.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (40) 296) by the Chairman of the Production Council andthe Economic Policy Committee, summarising the man-power requirements for the purpose of carrying out the Service pro-grammes, and the steps which had to be taken if the necessaryincreases in the engineering industry were to be achieved.In the course of a preliminary discussion the Minister of Air-craft Production expressed some apprehension as to certain recom-mendations in the Memorandum, on the ground that they might result in interference with the management of factories and lead tosome loss of present production. In the Minister&apos;s view, thesituation did not permit of any steps which would sacrifice presentproduction. Further, the situation was so uncertain that, while itwas clear that an increase in engineering labour was required, noexact calculation could be made of the additional numbers requiredover a given period. In his view, the limiting factor to-day and inthe future would be machine tools rather than labour supply.The Minister of Labour and National Service pointed out that over a million men would be required by the Services over the next12 -months, and he would be failing in his duty if he did not makeplans on a sufficiently comprehensive scale to make good this figure and to provide the increase called for.After some further discussion, the War Cabinet invited : The Minister without Portfolio (Chairman),The Minister of Aircraft Production,The Minister of Labour and National Service,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Minister of Supply,to have a further discussion in regard to the recommen-dations contained in the Memorandum before the WarCabinet, and to report whether those recommendations were acceptable to them, with or without modification.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,November 19, 1940.
