One of our machines had gone too far, and had dropped a few bombs in yugoslavia.On the 21st December 9 Gladiators had engaged a formation of six Italian bombers, escorted by 50 fighters. The result of the attackon the bombers had been unobserved, but eight CR. 42 fighters hadbeen destroyed and probably three more.  We had lost two machines.The Coastal Command aircraft had bombed the Bergen-Oslorailway, and it was thought that this railway had been renderedunusable for the rest of the winter.The destroyer Hyperion had been mined and sunk in theMediterranean on the 22nd December.Swordfish aircraft had attacked Tripoli successfully.No further news had been received of the enemy raider whichwas somewhere west of Freetown.During the raid on Liverpool on the night of the 20th December,the Australia, in a partially-filled dry dock, had been missed by six feet.On the 21st December the destroyer Foresight had been slightly damaged by a near miss.During the previous four days two ships had been sunk by -boats; a British ship of 3,600 tons, and a Swedish ship of 1,246tons.

The total number of italian prisoners was now 37,000.The Secretary of State for War undertook to issue a com-munique announcing this figure.The enemy dead counted after the raid on El-Wak on the16th December amounted to three officers, one N.C.O. and 95Africans.   These figures were in addition to the prisoners taken.In the northern sector there had been nothing to report.

Switzerland.Violation of swiss neutralityby british aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 308thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Chief of the Air Staff said he had now made detailedenquiries. On the evidence available he was strongly of the opinionthat the bombing of Basle on the night of the 16th December hadnot been done by our machines.The Secretary of State for Air undertook to supply the foreign secretary with details of the movements of our aircraft on the night in question, in order that a reply might be sent to the swiss government.Air Policy.Christmas Eveand ChristmasDay.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 305thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. A short discussion ensued on Bombing Policy on ChristmasEve and Christmas Day. The discussion and Conclusions are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.El)?e- 4.   The Prime Minister said that in accordance with theFuture policy. decision of the War Cabinet referred to in the margin, he had(Previous despatched  a  telegram  to  President Roosevelt  regarding  our reference: proposal to put economic pressure on Ireland. No reply had been.M. (40) 304th received, but it was perhaps significant that he had taken no conclusions, exception to the course proposed. He thought, however, that the minute 5.)        War Cabinet Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellorof the Exchequer, might now meet and discuss the action to betaken in this matter.The Secretary of State for the Dominions said that a telegram received from Sir John Maffey showed that there had been a change- of heart on the part of the Irish Government Mr. Walsh had suggested that he (the Dominions Secretary) should go to Dublin.It seemed that the German Minister in Dublin had offended theIrish.The War Cabinet-Invited the War Cabinet Committee, under the Chairman-ship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to meet and discuss the position further, in the light of the latest developments, and to consider what action should be taken,with a view to putting economic pressure on the eire government.Lord Halifax.Appointment asHis Majesty&apos;ambassador in washington.5. The Prime Minister said that he had received a message from President Roosevelt expressing his great pleasure at theappointment of Lord Halifax as His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington, and his appreciation of the immense value of the workwhich he would perform in that capacity.The Prime Minister said he wished to take this opportunityof saying how grateful the War Cabinet were to Lord Halifax for undertaking this vitally important post, on which so much depended.Lord Halifax would probably start about the end of January. TheWar Cabinet would continue to have the benefit of his counsel as one of their number while he was in this country.Lord Halifax expressed his thanks to the Prime Minister andthe War Cabinet for their good wishes.
6. The Prime Minister said that he had been asked by theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Economic Warfare to make a broadcast, directed to the people of Italy. This broadcast would include the personal message which he had sent to Signor Mussolinion the 16th May and Signor Mussolini&apos;s answer.The text of these two messages was read to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet expressed approval of the proposal that thetwo messages should be disclosed by the Prime Minister in his broad-cast to be delivered that evening.France.Relations withGermany.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 306thConclusions,Minute 4.)General de gaulle&apos;smovements.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 292ndConclusions,Minute 6.)7. Lord Halifax said that there was little further informationas to the position in France. It looked as though considerable pressure was being put upon the Vichy Government by Germany,but that this pressure was being successfully withstood. !The suggestion was made that it would be of advantage if general de Gaulle were to visit the French troops now fightingagainst Italians in North Africa.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids. g    The Secretary of State for the Home Department and-Casualties and   Minister of Home Security gave particulars of the casualties inDamage.(previous reference:W.M.

At Manchester the three railway termini had been hit, andalso some industrial units at Trafford Park,re Services. He had set on foot a special inquiry into the adequacy of thethe fire brigade arrangements in the chief provincial centres. It was reported from Manchester that all the fires had been under control by 5 or 6 a.m. It was hoped that they would all be extinguishedbefore darkness fell that night.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Factory andStorageAccommodation.Proposals for control.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 302ndConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council in regard to the control of factory and storage space (W.P. (G.) (40) 326).The Lord President explained the scheme in his Memorandum,and drew attention to the fact that paragraph 2 (/) should be amended to make it clear that the Ministries of Supply and of aircraft Production were on the same footing as requisitioningauthorities.In discussion it was generally agreed that an end must be put to the competitive scramble in which Government Departments and private firms engaged for the limited amount of accommodation available for manufacture and storage. In particular, importance was attached to the measure of control over private firms, referredto in paragraph 2 (d) (ii).The Minister of Aircraft Production said that his factorieswere in the front line, and that when one of them was bombed theremust be immediate and speedy dispersal. Any delay would be fatal to the maintenance of production. He feared that the present scheme would involve reference to a number of authorities, andwould result in delays. He did not see his way to accept the scheme as it stood.The Prime Minister referred to the importance of avoidingdelays in operating the control of accommodation. It might be an instruction that a report should be rendered to the Ministers con-cerned in any case where there had been a delay exceeding 24 hours in putting into effect a scheme for the dispersal of a factory engagedin vital production. It was also of the utmost importance that theregister of factory and storage premises should be kept constantlyup to date.The War Cabinet: Invited the Lord President of the Council and the Ministerof Aircraft Production to meet that afternoon for thepurpose of further examining the proposals in W.P. (G.)(40) 326, in order to arrive at an agreed scheme whichcould be put into operation forthwith.Civil Defence.Recruitment for civil defence services.10. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theSecretary of State for the Home Department and Minister of home security, the Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Labourand National Service (W.P. (G) (40) 324, 329 and 332) on recruit-ment for the Civil Defence Services.The main feature of the proposals made by the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security was that, as men liable for militaryservice presented themselves for registration, they should be given a personal option to join certain civil defence services on a full-time basis; and that those so electing should at once be called up formilitary service and passed to Class W, Army Reserve.
In discussion it was generally agreed that compulsion could beexercised for the recruitment of the Civil Defence Services without raising the issue of industrial conscription. There was some support for the view that the most orderly course would be to take com-pulsory powers forthwith for the recruitment of these Services.This, however, involved legislation which would take time, and therewas an urgent need to fill the gaps in the ranks in several importantareas. It was also suggested that there were a number of points which would require detailed examination. Thus the First Lord ofthe Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air said that the option to join the Civil Defence Services should not be extended to persons in certain reserved occupations earmarked for Servicetrades.The War Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to convene aMeeting of the Ministers concerned, with a view to thesettlement of outstanding points and the early preparationof a scheme which would make good the shortages in theCivil Defence Services and maintain those Services at full strength.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.December 23. 1940.
