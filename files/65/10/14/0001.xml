(40) 292ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Shipping Losses.MilitaryOperations.Egypt.1.   The Chief of the Air Staff made the following report: Day, November 21. Activity had been on a very small scale,consisting almost entirely of reconnaissance flights and visits toconvoys. About 80 enemy aircraft had been over this country.Weather conditions had been cloudy, with bad visibility.Night, November 21-22. There had been no change in weather conditions.In all 120 German aircraft had been over this country. our fighters had been unable to make any interceptions.Attacks had been on a small scale after the first hour of dark-ness. Raids had been plotted chiefly to the Midlands and east anglia, with no particular town as a target.The air casualties for the previous twenty-four hours hadbeen : Our own 1 aircraft lost (1 pilot killed).Enemy 1 destroyed.1 damaged.Our bombing operations over Germany had been cancelled.Hudson aircraft had, however, carried out a successful attack on an aerodrome near Stavanger.The First Sea Lord reported that a patrol had been carried outon the previous day with the object of interfering with eastward-bound escorted French trade passing through the Straits of gibraltar. No results had been obtained; the only French shipobserved had been westward bound. The patrol was being carriedout again that day.Bad weather prevailed in the North-Western Approaches.A Greek vessel of 6,085 tons and a British vessel of 4,768 tonshad been torpedoed off the west coast of Ireland. The former wasafloat, but the latter had sunk. A British vessel of 4,791 tons,ex convoy, with iron ore for the Tyne had been torpedoed west ofBlacksod Bay, and was reported sinking. A destroyer had beensent to her.A British and a Greek vessel had been mined in Milford Haven.The British vessel had sunk and the Greek vessel was damaged.S.S. Port Brisbane (8,739 tons) had reported that she was being attacked by an enemy raider west of the position in which.s. Maimoa had been attacked.Information had been received that the success of the Fleet air arm attack on the Italian warships at Taranto had been helped by the removal of the torpedo nets pi^otecting the vessels.The Fleet Air Arm had carried out a successful attack on oil installations at Bari.According to a report which had been received, 2,500 italian troops were being transported by air to Albania.Another report was that Marshal Badoglio had left for Berlinin order to take part in discussions resulting from a German demandfor a unified military command in the Balkans.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that in the raid south of Sidi Barrani (reported on the previous day), the enemy had had the following losses : Five tanks destroyed and six damaged;two lorries destroyed and two damaged; one Breda gun destroyed and one captured. Ten Italian O.R&apos;s. captured, one Libyan soldiercaptured and 108 killed. Our casualties had been one officer killed,one officer and three O.R&apos;s. wounded, one tank and one truckdestroyed. The enemy forces had included 15 tanks and 60 motor transport vehicles.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.[21955]
foreign information.Home Defence:likelihood of invasion.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 279thConclusions,Minute 2.)Blockade ofFrance.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 290thConclusions.Minute 7.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams : Angora telegram No. 1524, reporting that, according toreliable information, the Hungarian Military Attache was ofthe opinion that a German invasion of the United kingdom might be attempted before Christmas.Berne telegram No. 1365, containing an estimate of thetrade reaching France from Morocco.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Balkans.Bulgaria,Turkey and yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 281stConclusions,Minute I.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that therewas much uncertainty as to the intentions of the Bulgarian Govern-ment. It was believed that King Boris had taken his ForeignMinister with him on his recent visit to Berlin, and had travelledin a German aeroplane. He was thought to have been pressed by herr Hitler and Herr von Eibbentrop to join the Axis. They, weresaid to have assured him that he had nothing to fear from Turkey,and that Turkey would now probably gradually align herself withthe Axis Powers.The War Cabinet would remember that we had repeatedlywarned Bulgaria against allowing herself to fall into the hands ofGermany, and that the Turks had given a private but not apublic assurance that they would go to war if the bulgarian government allowed the Germans to enter their country, or if germany attacked Bulgaria.He had now telegraphed to our Ambassador in Angora instruct-ing him to press the Turkish Government to make a public declaration of their intentions in the event of Bulgaria falling into german hands. Alternatively, if they could not see their way to apublic declaration, the Ambassador was to invite them to leave theGovernment at Sofia in no doubt of their intention to interveneshould Bulgaria fall into German hands.The Foreign Secretary said that two courses were open to us :  (1) The first (suggested by Sir Stafford Cripps) was that theTurks should call upon Bulgaria to demobilise, underthreat of a declaration of war. It was, however, not altogether certain whether Bulgaria was mobilised inthis sense, and moreover, it was very doubtful whetherthe Turks would agree to take the line suggested.(2) The second course fell into two stages. The first stage- would be for us to press the Turkish and YugoslavGovernments to make a joint declaration to Bulgariathat they would make war on her if she allowed theGermans to enter her territory. If Turkey and Yugo-slavia agreed to take this line, we could then advance tothe second stage, namely, that Turkey and Yugoslaviashould invite Bulgaria to join with them in a tripartiteundertaking to resist attack by Germany.The Chiefs of Staff had recently been examining whether or not it was to our advantage to bring Turkey into the war at this stage.They had found the arguments very evenly balanced, but hadfavoured bringing Turkey in, if we could, at the present stage, onthe ground that the sooner she committed herself openly the better.
If she postponed a decision, she might find reasons later for notstanding by the Alliance.The Foreign Secretary said that his own judgment was againstputting any strong pressure on Turkey at the present time. Theimmediate Turkish reaction would surely be to ask for large additional consignments of munitions a request which we shouldnot be in a position to meet.He therefore favoured the second course outlined above. Theonly additional request which he would make to Turkey at thepresent time would be that she should take up a firmer attitudetowards Italy. For example, she might send the Italian Ambassadorhome, or put obstacles in the way of Italian trade in Turkey.The First Lord of the A dmiralty drew attention to a Belgradetelegram in which the Yugoslav Foreign Minister was reported assaying that his Government was determined to resist either an italian or a. German invasion, and further, that they would regard the occupation of Salonika by either of the Axis Powers as a gravethreat to their interests.In discussion reference was made to Moscow telegram No. 1013,which reported that, on the night of the 19th November, the german ambassador had arrived late at a party at the Roumanian Legation.He had immediately sought out the Italian Ambassador, and had given him a short written note, which the latter had read withexcited pleasure. This might be connected with Molotov&apos;s visit to berlin. The Minister of Labour and. National Service thought that russia had made an arrangement with Germany to attack Turkey.The Foreign Secretary rather doubted this, since he thought that russia&apos;s aim was to avoid being involved in war.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary pointed out that two routes to the ^aegean were open to Germany through Yugoslavia and through Bulgaria. A tripartite understanding between Turkey,Yugoslavia and Bulgaria would block both.The Lord Privy Seal supported the line of policy suggested bythe Foreign Secretary.Doubts were expressed whether Russia was likely to disinterestherself if hostilities spread to the Balkans. The Turks professed to feel no anxiety about the Soviet attitude, but their optimism mightnot be well founded.The War Cabinet Approved the course of action proposed by the foreign secretary, and invited him (a) to put pressure on Turkey and Yugoslavia to join in acommon front against German aggression;(b) if a common front was established, to invite turkey and Yugoslavia to make an approach to Bulgaria inorder to persuade that country to join with them;(c) to press the Turkish government to take a firmerattitude towards Italy;(d) to communicate to our Ambassador at Angora, for hisown information, the substance of the Chiefs of staff views on the question whether it would be toour advantage to bring Turkey into the war at thisstage.

Turkey.Supply ofmunitions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 284thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The First Sea Lord drew attention to telegram No. 1481from Angora, stating that the Military Attache had received lists of (a) materials and armaments due from Great Britain but notdelivered; (b) other armaments which were urgently required and forwhich a further credit was asked.The First Sea Lord said that the Committee under theChairmanship of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster haddealt very expeditiously with the co-ordination of supplies forGreece, and the Chiefs of Staff hoped that this Committee might take over the supply of arms to Turkey.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed with thissuggestion, but thought that the Committee should take over theco-ordination of supplies to our Allies generally.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Committee under the Chairmanship ofthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, which had dealtwith the co-ordination of supplies to Greece, should beinvited to undertake the co-ordination of supplies to our allies generally, replacing the existing organisation fordealing with Allied arms requirements.Air Raids.Casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 293rdConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Home Security reported that air raid casualties on theprevious day had been : London : Nil.Elsewhere : 13 killed, 24 injured.The previous night&apos;s casualties had been : London : 1 killed, 2 injured.Elsewhere : 0 killed, 3 injured.The final figures for the casualties in the Coventry raid hadnot yet been received, but as far as could at present be ascertainedsome 400 persons had been killed and between 800 and 1,000 injured.Both Coventry and Birmingham were recovering well.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Danger Zones.Proposed exten-sion in the eventof invasion of eire.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 280thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (40) 452) asking for approval tocertain proposals regarding a suggested &quot; sink at sight &quot; zone to be declared in the Western Approaches in the event of an invasion of eire.The War Cabinet approved the proposals of the First Lordof the Admiralty contained in WP.
