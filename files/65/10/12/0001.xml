Man Power.Requirementsof the Servicesand ofIndustry.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 291stConclusions,Minute 10.)1. A further discussion took place on the Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (40) 296) by the Chairman of the Production Counciland the Economic Policy Committee on the Man Power require-ments of the Services and of Industry.The Minister of Aircraft Production said that he remainedapprehensive as to the powers which appeared to be vested in theMinistry of Labour for the carrying out of the schemerecommended in the Memorandum. He referred in particular to paragraph 4 (e), (g) and (k).The Prime Minister thought that the best plan would be for theMemorandum to be examined by the Committee of Ministersappointed on the previous day.Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 291stConclusions,Minute 1.)Air operations.Bombingpolicy.2. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that on the previous day about 150 enemy aircraft had been over this country, but little damage had been done. During the night about 400 german aircraft had been over, of which some 20/30 had attacked London;60 had attacked Birmingham, where considerable damage had beendone; and the rest had attacked various areas in the Midlands and east Anglia. One interception had been made, a four-engineCondor having been hit but not brought down.The enemy had lost 5 aircraft, one by balloon barrage, 4 fromcauses unknown.63 British bombers had been despatched to attack targets inGermany and the occupied countries, including Berlin, Lorient andthe Skoda Works at Pilsen.  3 of our aircraft were missing.The Prim,e Minister stressed the importance of conserving our bomber resources in present circumstances. The right course was,he thought, to combine heavy blows at particular objectives withattacks on a number of targets, thus interfering with production over wide-spread areas of Germany.10 Gladiators had arrived in Greece on the 18th November.They had already been in action and had destroyed 10 italian aircraft for certain and 2 probably. We had lost no machines, but one pilot had been hit.The First Sea Lord gave the following information : H.M.S. Campbell had sunk an E-boat off Soiithwold on the20th November.3 destroyers of. the Home Fleet had left to attack Germanfishing vessels north of Aalesund.Alexandria had been attacked three times from the air on the13th, 16th and 17th November. Slight damage- had been caused,and the floating dock would be out of commission for a short timefor repair.The French Motor Vessel Ville de Tamatave had been sightedby coastal aircraft 187 miles South of Cape Point.   Two of H.M.Ships had proceeded to intercept her.Shipping During the last few days U-boat attacks on trade had takenLosses. place off the west coast of Africa, south of Freetown, and 4 vessels of 20,000 tons in all had been sunk. U-boat activity had thusextended to a new and important area, through which many of our military convoys had to pass. It was believed that only one U-boat was operating in this area.The First Sea Lord described the measures which were beingtaken to deal with this new menace.The Prime Minister said that he had it in mind to make afurther appeal to President Roosevelt in which he would point outthe additional strain involved on our resources, and would ask whether the United States could spare us some more destroyers.[21950-3] b 2Greece.naval operations.
Military The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that SiwaOperations. had been bombed. The South Aerodrome had been put temporarily-Middle East.     out of action.Italy-Greece. Koritsa Sector. Operations had slowed down and the position was unchanged.Pindus Sector. The Greeks had attacked Borova and Ersekand withdrawn after setting fire to the towns.Epirus Sector. The Greeks had established a bridgehead nearVrysoula (near the junction of the Kalamas and Mpania rivers).General. The Greek Command was much concerned by Italianair attacks on forward troops, who, however, were holding their positions and making night attacks. An advance into Albania was hardly practicable until the enemy air attacks had been countered.The Prime Minister said that we were not in a position toincrease our air reinforcements,lioumania, A report had been received that the German 22nd division was now in lioumania.   This Division, during the operations in holland, had consisted of air-landing troops.Bulgaria. Reports had been received that German Air Force personnel hadbeen seen in Bulgaria.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.blockade policy.France.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 291stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The First Sea. Lord, reported that orders had now beengiven to His Majesty&apos;s Ships to undertake contraband controloperations against French-escorted convoys in the Straits during thenext two days, if suitable opportunities presented themselves. Afterthe 22nd November our vessels would be otherwise engaged.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Air Raids.casualties and damage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 291stConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Home Security said that during the previous day verylittle damage had been done. On the previous night, however, therehad been heavy attacks on the Midlands. Birmingham had been theprincipal objective and considerable damage had been done to com-munications. Regional Headquarters had had to be evacuatedowing to an unexploded bomb. The information available was thusrather scanty, but it seemed that- the raid, although a bad one, hadnot been so serious as that on Coventry. Some 200 houses had been damaged, 30 small factories and a number of shops. About 370people had been injured.  The number of killed was not yet known.Leicester had also been attacked and a number of fires started.The Minister of Aircraft Production gave some details of the damage done to factories in the Birmingham area.The casualties for the past 24 hours had been as follows : London : 11 killed, 50 injured.Elsewhere (excluding Birmingham) : 25 killed, 197 injured.The Minister of Labour said that he was proposing in the nearfuture to visit Coventry in order to address the workers in certainfactories. If these visits which he made were announced before-hand, it created a certain nervousness in the factories, and he wouldbe grateful to the Minister of Information if he could take steps toensure that such visits did not receive any publicity in the Pressuntil some days after they had taken place.The Minister of Information undertook to take steps to meet theMinister of Labour&apos;s request.
Air Defence.defence against nightraiders.5.   The Prime Minister informed the Warprogress made in regard to the development ofdefence against night attack by aircraft.Cabinet of thenew methods ofForeignInformation.Egypt.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 289thConclusions,Minute 3.)general de Gaulle.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 287thConclusions,Minute 4.)Belgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 261stConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the following information :-Sir Miles Lampson had had a very satisfactory first interview with Hussein Sirri, the new Prime Minister of Egypt. (TelegramNo. 1548 from Cairo.)A telegram had been received from Brazzaville (No. 41) givingthe text of a long proclamation by General de Gaulle, which hadbeen broadcast on the 17th November. It was perhaps all to the goodthat the General was now returning to this country.The Foreign Secretary said that he had raised with the PrimeMinister the question whether General Catroux should also be askedto come to this country.The Foreign Secretary said that on the previous day he had seen the Belgian Minister for the Colonies, who had informed him that, as the result of the operation of Italian aircraft from Belgian territory, the Belgian Government had decided to regard the ItalianGovernment as having committed an act of hostility against them.There would be no formal declaration of war, but there would, infact, be a state of war between the two countries. Steps would betaken to round up Italians in the Belgian Congo.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Blockade 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a con-Policy, signment of German munitions, mainly artillery, to Brazil had beenGerman arms awaiting shipment in Lisbon. The Brazil Government attachedconsigned to great importance to obtaining these munitions; but it would, ofBrazil. course, be a breach in the blockade to allow them to pass.   Further,to make a concession in this case would involve us in great difficulties with Japan.The Brazil Government had now ordered the ship with these goods on board to leave Lisbon (Telegram No. 325 from Rio).Although the seizure of the ship would undoubtedly lead toembarrassments for us in South America, and perhaps also in theUnited States, he had decided that it was impossible to make a con-cession in this case. Instructions had therefore been given to th**-Admiralty that the ship should be intercepted.The War Cabinet approved the action taken.The Minister of Labour added that, if the Secretary of Statefor Air could arrange for a few fighter aircraft to patrol over townswhich had been bombed, he thought that it would do something to restore confidence.The Secretary of State for Air undertook to examine thissuggestion.
Propaganda.Future Policy.(previous references:W.M. (40) 233rdConclusions,Minute 6, andW.M. (40) 283rdConclusions,Minute 5.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 275thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on propaganda Policy to which were prefixed covering notes by (a) The Minister of Information and the Minister of economic warfare.(6) The Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 444).Discussion turned mainly on sub-paragraphs (/) to (j) ofparagraph 5.Formulation of War Aims (Paragraph 5 (j)). It wassuggested that in any attempt to formulate war aims at this junctureit would be difficult to steer a middle course between a statement which was so general as to be platitudinous and one which, by making too specific undertakings, led to embarrassment. Further,our military position did not at present justify us in launchingambitious schemes for a post-war settlement.On the other hand, it was urgent that we should sketch out some alternative to Hitler&apos;s scheme for Europe under German rule.Reference was made to reports from Berne that European businesscircles were coming to accept as almost inevitable the idea thatEurope would be dominated economically and financially byGermany. It was suggested that Mr. Maynard Keynes might beinvited to provide material to rebut Germany&apos;s economic andfinancial propaganda.Again, if no statement was made on behalf of this country before the end of 1940, President Roosevelt might take the initiative in his Inaugural Speech in January 1941, and it would then bedifficult for us to differ openly from that statement. The general feeling was that there was much to be said for some general state-ment of the essential fundamentals of our thought, which could beso expressed as to have a wide appeal in this country and elsewhere.Social and Economic Reconstruction (Paragraph 5 (g) and(h) ). The general view was that, in present circumstances, too much emphasis should not be put on the point.Discussion followed as to the reference in paragraph 5 (;*) to a&quot; fair deal &quot; for our enemies in a British peace. While, when thetime came, we should aim at a &quot; fair deal,&quot; any emphasis on this atthe present moment was likely to be resented by public opinion inthis country.It was explained that the reference in the same sub-paragraph to the setting aside of food stocks for future European relieffollowed on a statement made by the Prime Minister in August,after discussion in the War Cabinet. Clearly, however, in presentcircumstances no specific commitment was involved in the general statement made in this sub-paragraph.Propaganda in the Middle East. The Secretary of State forWar drew attention to the great differences between the Middle Eastand this country for propaganda purposes, and the need to adaptour propaganda accordingly. He doubted whether this was donesufficiently at the present time. The authorities in the Middle Eaststrongly deprecated reproducing German and Italian messages inour broadcast statements. A recent example was the quotation of astatement that German troops were in Libya. This statement, whichwas untrue, had been put out deliberately by the enemy with a viewto creating alarm. The Secretary of State undertook to communicate to the Minister of Information certain suggestions which he hadgathered in the course of his visit to the Middle East.Machinery for co-ordinating propaganda policy. Doubt was expressed whether the present machinery for co-ordinating pro-paganda policy was adequate. The general view of the War cabinet was that the present machinery should be continued for the timebeing.
The War Cabinet: (1) Gave general approval to the Memorandum on PropagandaPolicy, in the light of the discussion in the War Cabinetrecorded above.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Information, in consultation, to consider thesuggestion that Mr. Maynard Keynes should be invitedto provide material to rebut Germany&apos;s economic andfinancial propaganda.(3) Took note that the Secretary of State for War would com-municate to the Minister of Information certain sugges-tions bearing on our propaganda in the Middle East.Newfoundland.construction and use ofinternmentcamp.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 257thConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War about the use of the internment camp in newfoundland (W.P. (40) 449). The Canada-United States Per-manent Joint Board on Defence had expressed grave concern that1,000 German airmen prisoners should be located in a camp only miles inland from Conception Bay. The Secretary of State forWar accordingly asked : (1) That the Newfoundland Government should be asked tocomplete the camp at a cost of  10,000, in addition tothe two sums of  20,000 already spent on it; and(2) That, when completed, the camp should be used for internedenemy merchant seamen transferred from Canada, pro-vided the Permanent Joint Defence Board raised noobjection, but not for other civil internees.The War Cabinet approved these proposals.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,November 20, 1940.
