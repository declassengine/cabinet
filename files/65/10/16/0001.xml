The Chief of the Air Staff reported that air activity on theprevious day had been restricted by fog. Eighty enemy aircraft hadbeen over this country, but had mostly been engaged on reconnais-sance work. One convoy had been attacked off North Forelandwithout result.   Casualties had been :  Our own Nil.Enemy- 1 certain.1 probable.On the previous night only 13 enemy aircraft had been over,9 of which had made towards Bristol, and some of which had lost their way.  There had been no interceptions.On the previous night 36 of our bombers had attacked Kiel andWilhelmshaven. One of our pilots thought that he had obtained adirect hit on the Tirpitz.   One of our machines was missing.On the 24th November 6 Italian fighters had made a low-flyingattack on Luga aerodrome, destroying one Wellington and damagingthree others, without loss to themselves.The Chief of Naval Staff reported that, during the night of24th/25th November, enemy destroyers operating from Brest had sunk a Dutch tanker (2.086 tons) off Penzance, and also a number of belgian fishing vessels. These enemy destroyers had been out again on the previous night. Forces had been sent to try and interceptthem, but no news of the result had yet been received.The Behar (British, 6,100 tons) had been mined near milford haven on the evening of the 24th November, and had subsequently been beached. The Bradfyne (British, 4,740 tons) had been torpedoed on the evening of the 22nd about 158 miles west of MalinHead. The Leise Maersk (British, 3,136 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk 130 miles north of Bloody Foreland on the morning ofthe 23rd.Enemy coastal batteries had fired some 200 rounds at a west-bound Channel convoy on the previous day without effect.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that therehad been no further news from the Greek Frontier, as the Greekadvance had outstripped their communications.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.2. Discussion followed as to location of A.A. guns and of fighter squadrons in the United Kingdom. The discussion and conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.Air Defence.Air Defence ofGreat Britain.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionAlleged bombing to telegram No. 701 from Tangier, which stated that the Depecheof Marseilles. Marocaine had quoted a Vichy report to the effect that British aero-planes had bombed Marseilles on the night of the 23rd November.A very tendentious message had also been put out by the German-controlled Radio Paris Wireless Station making out that this was apremeditated attack. The Secretary of State asked the Secretaryof State for Air to inform him of the facts as quickly as possible, sothat he could deal with the matter.[21960-1] b 2
The Secretary of State for A ir undertook to make enquiries and inform the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the result.The Balkans.german intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 294thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air Services.Overseas .\irCommunica-tions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 285thConclusions,Minute 12.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to two telegrams (No. 539 from Budapest and No. 843a from Sofia), which contained reports that no military initiative in South-East europe was contemplated by Germany at present.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer examining the proposals which theWar Cabinet had had before them on the 8th November for themaintenance and improvement of overseas air communications(W.P. (G.) (40) 312).The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the Committeeappointed by the War Cabinet at the Meeting on the 8th Novemberhad been unable to reach agreement, and he had therefore set out thevarious considerations at stake, together with his own recommen-dations.The main recommendation of the Chancellor&apos;s Paper was asfollows : That the following aircraft should be made available to theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation : 3 Boeing Clippers.8 Lockheed Lodestars.8 Flamingoes.10 or more part-worn D.C.2&apos;s or D.C.3&apos;s or Lockheeds.6 Consolidated B.24&apos;s (for the North Atlantic Service).The following were the main points made in discussion :  3 Boeing Clippers.In the Chancellor&apos;s Paper it was stated that these boats wouldtake about 10 months to convert.This view was not accepted by the Minister of Aircraft Pro-duction, who maintained that they could be converted much morespeedily.The First Lord of the Admiralty was anxious to obtain theseflying-boats for use to meet the urgent needs of long-range recon-naissance off the North-West Approaches. He was prepared to use them in their present condition without conversion.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Coastal Commandwould riot regard it as right to employ these flying-boats unarmedfor reconnaissance purposes, more especially having regard to theirlow speed.It was pointed out that the first of these boats would not beavailable until February 1941, and the others in April or May 1941.In the circumstances, there was no need to take an immediate decision how they should be employed.6 Consolidated 5.24&apos;i\The Minister of Aircraft Production said that these aircraft would be very suitable for use either with the Navy or as bombers.Having regard to the urgent need for building up our Bomber Force,he deprecated the diversion of these 6 aircraft to other than strictly military purposes.
The Minister without Portfolio said that Mr. Purvis, who had just arrived in this country, had informed him that these 6 aircraft had been released by the United States Government specifically for communication purposes, and on a tacit understanding that theywould be used for this service. It would therefore be extremelyembarrassing if they were to be used for other purposes.The Minister also stressed the vital need for swift communica-tions across the Atlantic in order to make the best and speediest useof North American aircraft production.It was also explained that it was contemplated that one of the aircraft should be used for turret development.In the light of this discussion, the general view of the WarCabinet, other than of the Minister of Aircraft Production and ofthe First Lord of the Admiralty, was that the 6 Consolidated B.24&apos;sspecially released by the United States, should be used for com-munication purposes, other than the one earmarked for turretdevelopment.North of Scotland to Sweden Route.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he attached great importance to the service to Sweden, which it wassuggested might be carried out by one of the six Consolidated B.24&apos;s.This view was supported by the Minister for Economic Warfare, whoadded that it might be possible to maintain or improve this serviceif two second-hand commercial aircraft of a certain type were boughtin the United States, at a cost of about 200,000 dollars. There was some prospect that the Norwegian Government and prominentScandinavians in the United States might be prepared to put updollars for the purpose.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the North ofScotland-Sweden service should be maintained, if necessary by theuse of one of the six Consolidated B.24&apos;s, and that the possibilityof obtaining commercial second-hand machines in the United Statesof America should be investigated.Priority of other Services.Discussion followed as to the order of priority of the air routescited in paragraph 7 of the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper(other than of the North Atlantic services and of the North ofScotland-Sweden service dealt with above).The vital importance of maintaining adequate communications with our large and growing Army in the Middle East was strongly urged by the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies. Our present communications were negligible andaltogether inadequate. These two Ministers, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Air held that theseneeds were essentially military needs, and formed a vital part of our war effort.The Postmaster-General added that in the case of the Lisbonservice it was not a question of improving a service, but of main-taining an existing service. At the present time we were not in aposition to afford adequate connection with the Clipper service atLisbon.The War Cabinet accepted the order of priority set out at theend of paragraph 7 of the Chancellors paper, viz.: (i) United Kingdom-Lisbon-West Africa.(ii) The     &quot; Horseshoe &quot;     service West     Africa-Cairo-Australia.(iii) Cape Town-Cairo,subject to the addition of : (iv) The Balkan service.
Aircraft required for this service.Discussion followed whether Lockheed Lodestars, DouglasD.C. 2&apos;s and 3&apos;s and Flamingoes could be satisfactorily convertedfor use as fighters and bombers or general reconnaissance aircraft.There was a difference of opinion on this matter between thetechnical experts of the Air Ministry, and the Minister of aircraft production.The former maintained that none of these aircraft could be soconverted.The latter maintained that the Flamingoes were very suitablefor use as hospital aircraft and that the Lockheeds would be ofgreat value to the Navy. It was suggested that discussion should be adjourned until this point of difference had been cleared up. Thegeneral view of the War Cabinet (from which the Minister of aircraft Production and the First Lord of the Admiralty dissented)was that, if it was accepted that the four services set out at &quot; A &quot;above represented a vital military need, a decision could be reached on the main point at issue without resolving this difference ofopinion: and that 8 Lockheed Lodestars, 8 Flamingoes and 10 ormore part-worn D.C. 2&apos;s or D.C. 3&apos;s or Lockheeds should be madeavailable to British Overseas Airways, to enable them to maintainthe services set out at &quot; A &quot; above.Trans-Tasman Service.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that we had recently refused to supply New Zealand with certain aircraft, buthe assumed that there could be no question of taking away anyaircraft at present employed on operating that service. In any event it would be necessary to examine the matter with the Govern-ments concerned, as the service is at present operated jointly by theUnited Kingdom, Commonwealth and New Zealand governments with two flying boats, which were handed over on the understandingthat the New Zealand Government would have first call on their use for military purposes if they were needed for reconnaissance inthe Pacific.  This was accepted.The War Cabinet decision was as follows : (1) As the 3 Boeing Clippers would not be available for somemonths (1 in February 1941, and the other 2 in Aprilor May 1941), a decision as to their use should be postponed. In the meantime, the Air Ministry and theMinistry of Aircraft Production should consult as to how long it would take to convert these flying-boats for operational purposes.(2) The 6 Consolidated 23.24&apos;;*.-One of these aircraft was to beused for turret development. The other 5 should beused for communication purposes : probably 4 on theNorth Atlantic route, and 1 on the North of Scotland-Sweden route.(3) The Minister of Economic Warfare was invited to consult with the Ministry of Aircraft Production and the AirMinistry in regard to the suggestion that 2 second-handcommercial machines should be bought in the UnitedStates of America for the North of Scotland-Swedenroute.: (4) The priority of air routes (other than of the North atlantic route and the North of Scotland-Sweden route) shouldbe as follows : (i) United Kingdom-Lisbon-West Africa.(ii) The   &quot; Horseshoe &quot;   service-West&apos; Africa-Cairo-Australia,(iii) Cape Town-Cairo.(iv) The Balkan service.
(5) The following aircraft should be made available to theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation for the purposesof the Services set out in (4) : 8 Lockheed Lodestars.8 Flamingoes.10 or   more   part-worn   D.C.2&apos;s  or   D.C.3&apos;s  orLockheeds.(6) Any suggestion to abandon the Trans-Tasman service wouldhave to be examined with the Australian and NewZealand Governments before a decision was reached.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,November 26, 1940.
