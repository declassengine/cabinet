25Naval, Militaryand air operations.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 280thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air Operations.Naval The First Sea Lord reported the movements of H.M.S. ArkOperations. Royal.H.M.S. Formidable, a new aircraft carrier, had been corn-missioned at Belfast on the previous day.Five British ships in convoy had gone aground near RattrayHead in the early morning of the 30th October. One vessel of about,000 tons had been sunk; another of about 2,000 tons was a totalwreck.  Two vessels had been got off.The northern entrance to the Admiralty harbour and the com-mercial anchorage at Gibraltar had been attacked on the morning of the 30th October by what appeared to have been two Italian&apos;1 one-man &apos;&apos; submarines. No damage had been caused. One Italianofficer and one rating had been picked up.The armed merchant cruiser Moreton Bay had intercepted theFrench merchant ship Cuba (11,337 tons) 700 miles west of theCanary Islands on the 31st October. She had been bound forCasablanca, but was steering for Dakar. She carried 1,216 sailors,17 invalid soldiers, 21 officers and about 4,000 tons of rice andsoya beans. The view was expressed that no great harm would bedone if the rice and soya beans were landed at Casablanca. Onthe other hand the ship came from Martinique, and there was areport that the ship had gold on board.In view of this fact the War Cabinet decided that, while we did not wish to have the sailors on our hands any longer thannecessary, the right course was to take the ship to Freetown forContraband Control purposes.A report giving the gist of a message from our Military Attacheat Athens was read out. There was little to report on the AlbanianFront. The weak advances made by the enemy had been held by the greeks. A British Military Mission was being established inAthens. Particulars of the steps being taken to furnish aid to the greeks are contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.There was no news of importance from the Libyan Front.It was reported from Bulgaria that Bulgarian troops weremoving in the direction of the Turkish Frontier.  Precautions were apparently not being taken on the northern frontier of Bulgaria.An unconfirmed report stated that a number of german divisions were on the Franco-Spanish Frontier.[21890-1] R 2Military .Operations:Greece.1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that enemy air activity-over this country had been on a reduced scale both by day and night.During the earlier part of the previous day some 65 enemy aircraft had been over this country, chiefly on reconnaissance. In the afternoon, a number of our aerodromes had been visited, but little damage had been done. Several towns had been machine-gunned.One hundred and forty-five of our fighters had been up, but owingto cloud conditions had made no interceptions.During the night about 100 enemy aircraft had been over thiscountry, of which about 30 had had London as their main objective.Nine of our fighters had been up, but no interceptions had beenmade.  Three had crashed on landing.A reconnaissance from Malta had shown that the Italian fleet was still in Taranto and Brindisi.Six Wellingtons had now reached Malta and had been dispatched the previous night to bomb Naples. Five had reached their targets and had dropped about 5 tons of bombs on the centralrailway station and the oil tanks. The anti-aircraft fire had beenheavy but inaccurate.  Our aircraft had all returned safely.A communique would be issued but would not indicate the source of the raiders.
Abyssinia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 274thConclusions,Minute 1.)The attempts to raise a revolt in Abyssinia were now meeting with more success. The Italians were said to be moving troops upto Gojam. The War Office were considering whether they couldmeet a request which had come from the Emperor for 10,000additional rifles.There were no signs of the Italians in Abyssinia running short of supplies.The War Cabinet (a) Took note of the above statements.(6) Confirmed the orders already issued that the Frenchmerchant ship Cuba should be instructed to proceed toFreetown ostensibly on contraband control grounds.Middle East.Visit of theSecretary ofState for &quot;war to Egypt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 280thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Prime Minister said that, in response to the telegram sent to him, the Secretary of State for War was now returning to cairo for further discussions with the British Commanders in theMiddle East.A suggestion was made that it might be desirable for theSecretary of State to visit either Athens or Angora. The PrimeMinister thought that it would be better to let the situation developfor a few days before taking any action on this suggestion.The Wrar Cabinet took note of this statement.France.The PrenchFleet.(previous references:W.M. (40) 276thConclusions,Minute 6,and 278thConclusions,Minute 7.)France.negotiations between the vichy andGermanGovernments.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 280thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet were given certain information as to the movements and possible intentions of certain units of the french fleet. This information, and the discussion thereon, are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The Foreign Secretary read to the War Cabinet telegramNo. 971 to Madrid, despatched to Sir Samuel Hoare that morning.This telegram had pointed out that we were disturbed as to theindeterminate state of the negotiations between France andGermany, and had instructed Sir Samuel to make an approach tohis French colleague on the following lines : At M. Baudouin&apos;suggestion we had started an exchange of views with the vichy government to see if a modus vivendi could be reached. A fortnighthad elapsed since our last communication to the Vichy Govern-ment, but we had had no reply. In the meantime the FrenchGovernment had entered into negotiations with Germany, whichmust affect our security and conduct of the war. We had received no information from the Vichy Government on the matter, and wewere entitled to ask them to make their position clear to us withoutdelay. In particular, we wanted to know whether the enemy wouldbe able to create a position where they could take the French bases for themselves.The War Cabinet took note with approval of the despatchof this telegram.
Egypt- 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs invited attentionAttitude of to telegram No. 1393 from our Ambasador at Cairo, referring toKing Farouk. the non-co-operative and at times obstructive part played by the(Previous Palace and King Farouk.   The Ambassador asked whether, if the reference: matter of the King of Egypt came suddenly to a head, he might&quot;W.M. (40) 268th assume that he and the Service Commanders had authority to handleConclusions, it as, in their judgment, the situation demanded, even to the extentMinute 4.) of getting rid of King Farouk, preferably by way of abdication.The Prime Minister suggested that Sir Miles Lampson shouldmake quite clear to King Farouk, on a suitable occasion, that if headopted an attitude which made it impossible for him to continue asKing of Egypt, the alternative would probably involve internmentin some place well out of harm&apos;s way.The War Cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary to com-municate with Sir Miles Lampson as follows : (1) That Sir Miles Lampson should take a suitable opportunity of putting the position to King Faroukon the lines suggested by the Prime Minister.(2) That in the last resort, if a situation arose whichbrooked no delay, our Ambassador at Cairo, togetherwith the Service Commanders, should be given theauthority asked for.sPain- 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theDr. Negrin. War Cabinet of the history of this case. In November, 1939,(Previous Dr. Negrin had applied for a visa to come to England on privateReference:        business for three weeks.   The issue of a visa had been authorised,W.M. (40) 215th but Dr. Negrin had not then availed himself of it.  He had, however,Conclusions,      landed in England on the 25th June, on a &quot; Provisional Visa.&quot;   in minute 4.)        view of the embarrassment resulting from his presence in thiscountry, Dr. Negrin had been asked if he would be willing to go tothe United States.  He had agreed to this suggestion, but the UnitedStates Government had not been prepared to grant a visa.   Hethought that Dr. Negrin had behaved badly in that, although hehad been given permission to come here for three weeks, he hadstayed for over four months.The Foreign Secretary said that Dr. Negrin&apos;s continuedpresence in this country lent support to the view that we wereintriguing in Spanish politics and plotting the overthrow of theexisting regime. This provided admirable material for german propaganda. Sir Samuel Hoare was constantly being asked by ourwell-wishers in Spain why we permitted Dr. Negrin to stay here.The Spanish Government represented that he was indulging in political activities, but there was no evidence that this was so.If the Germans marched into Spain, the real hope of Spanishresistance turned on the attitude of the army. The army leaders were unlikely to fight the Germans if they thought that we wereintriguing with the revolutionaries in Spain.The Foreign Secretary recognised how difficult it was to askDr. Negrin to leave this country. Our object in this matter had nothing to do with internal Spanish affairs, but turned on the best way to win the war. For this purpose we wanted to keep Spainout of the war and to keep the leaders of the Spanish Governmentfriendly to us. The Left Wing in Spain were in any case likelyto be more friendly to us than to the Germans.The Lord Privy Seal thought that the question whether Spaincame into the war would be decided by Spanish interests, and spanish Xeno phobia.     He did not believe that Dr. Negrin&apos;s
departure from this country would have any material effect on those of the present leaders in Spain who professed to be our friends.On the other hand, the action suggested would have a most dis-ecouraging effect on those people, the world over, who believed thatwe were fighting for democracy, and on those who might otherwisecarry on disruptive activities in the occupied territories.He understood that Dr. Negrin would regard leaving thiscountry at the present moment as the equivalent of running away.Again, if we persuaded Dr. Negrin to leave, what about SenorAscarate and other refugees % The Foreign Secretary thought thatif Dr. Negrin was persuaded to leave the country, we need notworry about the lesser fry.The Secretary of State for Air thought that many Liberalswould take it amiss if Dr. Negrin was asked to leave this country.He wondered, however, whether the matter could not be settled by,for example, arranging for an invitation to be extended to dr. Negrin to visit and address certain Universities, say, in SouthAmerica or some other overseas territories.The Prime Minister wished it to be on record that, in his view,by keeping Dr. Negrin here in this country we imposed a furtherstrain on this country. Nevertheless, having regard to the conflictingviews put forward, and since it was not clearly established that dr. Negrin&apos;s continued residence here involved us in anj^ mortalhurt, he thought that a compromise solution should be reached.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty to see Dr. Negrin and to speak to him on the following lines : It should be pointedout that, much as we disliked appearing to withdraw theright of asylum from anyone in Dr. Negrin&apos;s position, hiscontinued presence caused us great embarrassment.Further he had been permitted to come here for threeweeks, but he had now been in this country for over four months. We should therefore be glad if he would be willingto leave this country, at any rate for the time being, but should be willing to co-operate in making suitable arrange-ments to this end, including suggestions on the lines ofthese put forward by the Secretary of State for Air at&quot;X.&quot; If, however, Dr. Negrin refused to leave thiscountry we had no present intention of compelling him togo.Air Raids.Shelter Policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 280thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of the broadcast statement to be made by the Minister of Home Security(WP. (G.) (40) 280).The Minister of Home Security said that he had agreed withthe Lord President of the Council an alteration of the passage atthe bottom of page 2.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the draft statement contained too many refers^ences to deep shelters. Hethought that this aspect of the speech would be likely to be featured;and that when it became evident how little was practicable in theway of the construction of deep shelters, the statement might prove embarrassing to the Home Secretary. He also thought that it wouldbe desirable to reverse the order of the conclusions set out at (1)..(2) and (3) at the top of page 3.
The Minister of Home Security said that he felt it wasnecessary for him to deal with the deep shelter question at some length. He would, however, give consideration to the Chancellorssuggestions.The War Cabinet-Gave general approval to the draft statement of theMinister of Home Security, subject to the amendmentsagreed between the Minister and the Lord President ofthe Council, and to such further amendments as theMinister might desire to make in the light of the abovediscussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,November 1, 1940.\
