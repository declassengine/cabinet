(43)42ndConclusions).The &quot;War Cabinet wore informed that the&apos; enemy hadeffected a strong fleet concentration in Northern Norway.This made it an unacceptable risk to send convoys to north Russia, unless they were escorted into the barents sea by capital ships of the Home Fleot.     The DefenceCommittee had always considered that it was an unaccept-able risk to send capital ships of the Home Fleet into. the Barents sea     The decision had therefore been reached that the sailing of the March convoy to Russia would haveto be postponed,, 1The question had then arisen whether, if the sailingof the March convoy was postponed,  the escort vessels whichwould have accompanied the convoy should be used to combatthe U-boat menace in the North Atlantic.Authority had been given for this to be done, andas the result it had been possible to establish forthwithsupport groups, which v/ould be available to help our con-voys to fight their way through the U-boat concentration in the North Atlantic.THE PRIMS MINISTER said that ho had consultedPresident Roosevelt, who had agreed that postponement of the sailing of the March convoy was necessary.      Thisdecision would, of course, have to be conveyed to premier stalin, but this had not yet been done.     In the meantime the March convoy was being kept loaded,  and loading wasalso proceeding in the United States of two U.S.. vesselsv/hich had been earmarked to form part of the May convoy.The Prime Minister added that? as it had been necessary to p6stpone the sailing of the March convoy,he had thought it right to use the escort vessels, whichwould have accompanied the convoy,  to help combat theserious situation in the North Atlantic, although itmight take from 14 to 18 days to re-constitute the escortsrequired for the North Russian convoys, when circumstancespermitted the sailing of these convoys,  to be resumed.The War Cabinet took note, with approval,of the action taken in this matter.&quot;W   Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.I.
