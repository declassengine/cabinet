BEGINS.It is clear to me from your second message that yourpresence and that of president Roosevelt at the place inquestion have as their object to conclude with General Giraudcertain arrangements in regard to French North Africa.     youwish to suggest to me that I should take port in the dis-cussions adding however that these arrangements will ifnecessary be concluded without my participation.Until now,  the whole Allied ^enterprise in North Africa hasbeen decided, prepared and executed without any officialparticipation by Fighting   France and without my having any means at my disposal of informing myself directly and objectively ofevents.   Nevertheless you are aware of the very heavy responsibility which I end the French National Committee bear in this waif towards our country and in the service of France.The decision which has been taken, withouth Fighting France,in regard to North Africa and French West Africa and on the otherhand the retention in these areas of an authority derived fromVichy, have led to an interior situation which, it seems, doesnot completely satisfy the Allies and which I can assure you doesnot satisfy Franco in any way.Now president Roosevelt and yourself ask me to take part on thespur of the moment in consultations on this subject, consultationsof which I am unaware both of the programme and of the conditions,and which you will bring me to disauas with you et short noticeproblems which involve in all respects the future of the French Empire and that of France,Nevertheless in spt-te of those questions of form, howevergrave they may be, the&apos;general war situation and the position inwhich France finds herself for the time being will not allow meto refuse to meet the president of the United   States of&quot; Americaand His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Prime Minister.     I therefore acceptyour invitation to come to your meeting,      I shall be accompaniedby General Catroux and Admiral d&apos;Argenlieu.2000A/20Deputy Prime minister foreign secretary mr, PeckSir Edward Bridges,

AIR POLICY - Targets in France. (Previous Reference: W.M. (43) 6th Conclusions, Minute 2).

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR referred to the discussion in the War Cabinet on the 11th January on a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty, asking for approval of air bombing of the U-boat bases in the Bay of Biscay. The decision of the War Cabinet, as recorded in the Minutes, was to approve in principle the recommendation of the First Lord&apos;s Paper (W.P. (43)11) that area bombing should be carried out on the U-boat bases in the Bay of Biscay, and that these targets should be given high priority during the coming months, subject to a proviso as to a renewal of the general warning to French people in the coastal zones.

The Secretary of State for Air added, however, that both he and the Chief of the Air Staff had been under the impression that the Conclusion of the War Cabinet had been that attacks should first be carried out on one port and that the results of these attacks should be assessed before attacks were carried out on the other Biscay ports.

THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that the Board of Admiralty attached importance to all action being taken to disorganise the flow of U-boats from the Biscay ports, and everything possible was being done to render these operational bases useless. The Admiralty had not thought that the approval given by the War Cabinet to area bombing of the Biscay bases had been qualified in the manner suggested by the Secretary of State for Air.

After a short discussion, the War Cabinet - 

Decided that there should be no pause to assess results of the attacks on Lorient before other U-boat bases in the Bay of Biscay were subjected to area bombing. The Conclusion reached on the 11th January was thus reaffirmed, namely, approval in principle of the recommendation of the First Lord&apos;s Paper (W.P. (43)11) that area bombing should be carried out on the U-boat bases in the Bay of Biscay, and that these targets should be given high priority in the coming months.

MINUTE 9*Confidential ,jnext(20th January, 1943 - 5.30 p*m.)The War Cabinet considered STRATAGEM No* 102,^from the Prime Minister, as to his further movements,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY gave reasons why hethought it was inexpedient, on grounds of foreign,policy., that the Prime Minister should seek a meeting in Cyprus with representatives of Turkey.As regards the visit to Cairo, the viewof the War Cabinet v/as   that they doubted whether there were any matters- Qf sufficient importance in cairo to justify the Prime Minister incurring the risks of the further flights involved.From the   point of view of opinion inParliament and in the country, there would be great advantage in the Prime Minister returning home as soonas his conference . with the President was1- overiThe Foreign Secretary was invited to prepare a draft embodying these points.(The Foreign Secretary&apos;s draft was read to the War Cabinet at the conclusion of ,the Meeting and approved - See TELESCOPE .162)1S^TRATAGEli Nostoried thatEo^x^oncQ \ma aieo nnd  fo paragraph 6 o&amp;In this paragraph -the Pfrtee UijriAeterthink of the inclusion in this statement of adeclaration of the firm intention of the United Statesand the British Empire to continue the war relentlesslyuntil we have brought about the &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; of Germany and Japan.-    The suggestion wasthat the omission of Italy would encourage a break-upin that country.The War Cabinet thought that the omission of Italy was liable to be misunderstood in, for example$the Balkans.    Generally, the War Cabinet thought thatit was a mistake, at any rate at this stage,  to makeany distinction between the three partners in theAxi saIt v/as agreed that the Foreign secretary should send a communication in this sense to thePrime Minister.

It looks as if   we s all finish up hereFriday January 22nd, and .Admiral q will.depart &apos;.*thereafter.    He proposes on Friday to give, a Stateluncheon to the Sulton of Morocco to which I am -invited, and   also contemplates a press conference with all the British and American correspondentsavailable, at which he and presumably I willanswer questions as we did at the White House..I see no difficulty in this.    The release will not take place until he has   definitely quitted Africanshores.2,     Yesterday in plenary session it was unanimously agreed that Alexander should becomeEisenhower&apos;s deputy G. in C. of . the whole of north africa.    General Marshall proposed that the command of any sledgehammer or roun:l-up which may beundertaken this year should be British.3.     -I also&apos; raised the.Turkish question, havingexplored the ground beforehand, with Admiral Q.It was agreed that we play the hand in Turkey whether in munitions or diplomacy the Americans taking the lead in China and of course in French North Africa.You will be pleased at this.k*     as soon as Admiral Q has gone I shall, ifweather is good fly Marrakesh to Cairo, where Ipropose to stay for 2. or 3 days and settle several important matters.5.      I have no doubt, and C.I.G.8. agrees,that jumbo Wilson is far and av/ay the best man totake over the Middle East Command when it is vacatedby Alexander,    I am arranging for   him to meet me in cairo.....
Cairo.    I propose that division, of the-  commandthat we made in August shall now he reversed. Thedanger from west has rolled far away and the situationwhich calls for the formation of (? expeditionary)10th Army is   entirely changed.    The Middle east command should eventually resume the full controlof Persia and Iraq.    There cannot he much difficultyin this, hut I will explore it on the spot.   I shall take CI.G-.S. with me.6,     is not this the opportunity and the   moment for   me to get into direct   touch with the Turks?The news of the SYMBOL conferences will have   brokenand I shall be able to speak with the authorities ofboth Britain and the Americas. . I would meet the TurkishPrime Minister and Marshal Cheksonicik could   meetC.I.G.8. at any suitable place.,- possibly Cyprus.   Themost complete secrecy could be preserved.    I can thengo into the whole future with them.    If you both thinkwell of this-, Foreign Secretary should make the proposalto the Turks without delay.    Should they accept, it isfor consideration whether either the Foreign secretary-or Cadogan-should not join me in Cairo,1859A/19 :.

MOST IMMEDIATE -   -TELBSOOPE NO.   182 -Q.   For Prime Minister from Deputy Prime Minister andForeign Secretary.Personal and Most Secret.We hove considered your STRATAGEM NO, 102 on whichwe felt it right to consult War Cabinet.We are in entire accord with paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and5 subject to what follows, and congratulate you warmlyon results.Unless there are special reasons other than thosedisclosed in your telegram, we should frankly feel,much happier if you could forego your visit to Cairo.Parliament, and public will wish to welcome you backend to hear from you as soon as possible what you are able to tell them of meeting with President.     We think,it important not to leave the field to the Presidentalone, sYour special trips have been recognised to be ofhighest importance but it is undeniable that there isa feeling that you-should not run these flying risksexcept in cases of absolute necessity.Could not C. I.G. 8, do all that you want in Cairo?But whatever you decide about Cairo we^feel thatthe Turkish proposal is open to several serious objections.Ambassador reports there has been no change in Turkishattitude.      Suggestion for meeting would certainlyalarm them and it is quite possible that they would refuse.     Even if they felt bound to accept, we thinkit extremely doubtful whether you would get anythingsubstantial out o  them. Our experience in 1941 was thata promise extracted from them in Cyprus was promptlygone back on in Angora,     We do not want you to courteither a rebuff or a failure.Nor do we think that taking even an optimistic view the oresent moment is ripe for an approach to Turkey.Surely wo should at least clear North Africa first.21OVA/20Deputy Prime Minister .Foreign secretary mr. peckCaotain Clifford

USSS-MOST SECRET      -IN24-   2people to devote their whole resources to the defeat of Japan after Germany had been brought toher knees was not in doubt,    I added that I was sure that the War Cabinet would he   fully preparedto enter into a formal treaty or pact with theUnited States on this point.    Admiral q brushedaside the idea since he was confident that theUnited States and the British Empire were entirely of one mind in this matter.    Ke added however thatit would be very desirable if it were at all possibleto get a definite   engagement - secret if necessary -from Russia that they would    join in the struggle against Japan once Germany was out of the war.(3)    Having reached agreement on broad principles the Chiefs of Staff will have to spend the next ten days examining ways and means.   There is a good dealof detailed work to be done and I do not think they ought to separate for several days.    It will in any event be necessary to have another conference of thiskind within the next six months the necessity for thiswas particularly stressed by General Marshall.(ii)    Thought it a good opportunity to broach onplenary session the question that at the right timeAlexander should become Deputy Commander in Chief toEisenhower, see paragraph k of STRATAGEM No. 56.It was warmly welcomed by Marshall and King.   the difficult question of    air command is under active consideration and will I am assured be settledsatisfactorily.(5)    The War Cabinet should know that general marshall asked   to place on formal record his admirationof the profound contribution which had been rendered tothe Allied cause in North Africa by Admiral Cunningham.His Naval leadership and skill had been outstanding   andhis wisdom and counsel had been of the greatest help to General Eisenhower.    Admiral q, also paid a warmtribute to Field Marshal Sir John Dill.   He had come tobe regarded by the Americans as an indispensable link between the United States and British Chiefs of Staff  .on military policy.(6)    We propose to draw up a statement of thework of the conference for communication to the press at the proper time.    I should be glad to know what theWar Cabinet would think of our including in this statement a declaration of the firm intention of the   .United States and the British Empire to continue thewar relentlessly until we have brought about the&quot;unconditional surrender&quot; of Germany and Japan.    the omission of Italy would be to encourage a break upthere.    The President liked this idea, and it wouldstimulate our friends in every country.

MUSMUJMOST SECMET       IN 25- . 3   -(7)    It will also be   necessary on the conclusionof the conference to draw up a statement for communication to Premier Stalin,    Our idea is that this statement.should set out our combined intentions but should contain nopromises.(8)    While the ahove, which has been drawn up under my direction by General ismay, represents the presentposition of our discussions and is, as my colleaguesknow, in the closest harmony with ideas we have shared,it must be admitted that all our military operationstaken together are on a very small scale compared tothe mighty resources of Britain and the United statesand still more to the gigantic effort of Russia I am inclined to think that the President shares this view asHopkins spoke to me on the subject yesterday saying ineffect &quot;it is all right but it is   not    enough&quot;.   Makingall allowances for our tremendous efforts on the sea andin the air? I still feel this most strongly, and duringthe remaining days of our conference we must bendourselves to the task of weighting our blows   more heavily.Deputy Prime Minister.Foreign Secretary.Lord president.Minister of Labour.Minister of production.Home Secretary.1st Lord.Sec. of -State for War.Sec. of State for Air,1st S.L.G, I * G, S.C , j. i, s,Mr. Peck.Sir Ldward Bridges.Capt.
