My colleagues should consider whether the scandalof Admiral Godfroy!s Squadron in Alexandria Harbour should not now be brought to a head.    The joint declaration of GeneralsGiraud and De Gaulle is, I understand, to be published to-morrow January 27.     I suggest that Admiral Godfrey should beshorn this and told that we consider that this removes thelast justification for his inaction and that he should be  .Invited to associate himself with the War against the Axiscommanded by both generals De Gaulle and Giraud and associatehimself with whichever he prefers.    This would apply notonly to him but to all his officers and men.    They should be told at the same time that if they refuse? the five thousanda week we have been so long paying them will be discontinuedas from the end of this month.     Admiral Harwood thinks that should we carry but this threat, Godfroy will retaliate byscuttling his ships.    Their position in the Harbour does not-make this very serious, but we should of course lose the ships.2. I am, however,of opinion that if no violence were offered and no attempt made to seize the ships, the officersand crews might hesitate to deprive themselves of their onlyhabitation, and that they might be very uncertain of the reception which they would get when they landed in their boats..Still less do I think It likely that they would open firemerely because they had failed to extort further money fromthe British Government.3, On the other hand, it is on this money that theyhave so. long lived comfortably and. idly in a neutral harbour at our expense, and the fact that it runs short would throwthem back on their own resources and would after a whilecompel them to come ashore and earn their living by some other means, thus becoming amenable to the laws of the state: onwhose shores they would be seeking refuge.    As these lawsunder wartime conditions are necessarily potent against/aliens of

I should like toknow what Is the international law in the case of a warshipsheltering in a neutral port which scuttles Itself and/oropens fire (the latter purely theoretical) in order toextort money from another government with which no state ofwar exists and which is also using that neutral port:,     Ishould like to have this settled up while I am here.5* Would you kindly send me copy of the Admiraltytelegram drafted by the First Lord in ray presence some fewweeks, ago, in which he states quite clearly that the BritishGovernment will not go on paying any longer.6. I have carefully considered this matter inrelation to French North Africa, - I do not think that it .would have evil consequences as&apos;the whole French Army, navy and Air Force are how fighting on our side, and as there isno doubt at all that the mass of the civil population andespecially the various comprised&apos; leaders are how committed toour victory.7, We have considered also whether we should not askGeneral Giraud and Be Gaulle, following up their jointI amSecondly because I do not wish to ask him favours at a timewhen his whole position must be subject to serious reconsider-ation, and thirdly because of the sectional rivalries andjealousies between the Free French and those under theGiraud administration, and fourthly the loss of time.,    .

Unparaphrased Version of a Most SecretCypher Telegram not One Time-Table,TELESCOPE NO. 333T.0.0. 2030Z/28T.O.D. 2220Z/28MOST SECPET CYPHER TELEGRAM.IMMEDIATE.From:- Air ministry to:-     MideastTELESGOPE NO. 333        28th January, 1943.Following for Prime Minister from deputy prime Minister.War Cabinet today considered your STRATAGEMNO. 258.admiralty s signal to Comma-nder-in-Chief.Mediterranean, 2305/21, which was agreed with theForeign Secretaiy, affirmed our view that the payments to- the French Squadron should now cease and pointedout that withdrawal from the Agreement is fully justi-fied on the grounds that -(a) the total occupation of France has destroyed the basis of the Agreement;(b) the Axis, are to our certain knowledge putting&quot;French warships into service against us.Under Clause 11, this lets us out of theAgreement which provides for its recon-sideration on this event;(c) Godfroy!s continued W/T communication in cypherwitn enemy-occupied territory is an un-friendly act.2m Admiralty invited the views of Admiral Har-wood which are already known to you. and asked AdmiralCunningham what would be the effect in North Africa andwhether Giraud could be induced to order Godfroy toDakar and relieve him of his Command if he failed toobey.. ,/3.Aci^piaX ,

to obey./3, Admiral Cunningham considers it important toavoid having ourselves to take over the ships or tooust dodfroy from his Command, and that we should,if possible, force him into the position of disobeyingthe orders of his superiors.    He thinks the Frenchwill be- ready to order Godfroy to LV kar, as the french navy were very displeased at his previous refusal toobey Darlan.4. We see advantage in working through the north african Authorities, if this can be arranged.    TheForeign Secretary has no objectionto orders being givenby Giraud alone without de Gaulle being associated withhim.    Accordingly, if you agree, we propose to instructAdmiral Cunningham and Commander-in-Chief, Mediterraneanas follows:-Begins.(a) We have decided to refuse any further funds to admiral Godfroy and consider it oesirable thatthe French in North Africa should, if possible,be induced to order Godfroy to Dakar at thesame time as we withdraw from the Agreement.(b) Admiral Cunningham is therefore requested toexplain to Giraud and Michelier that for reasons give in Admiralty Message 2305/21, we holdourselves free to bring the Agreement to anend and will not in future provide for theFrench Squadronj since this only enables themto maintain themselves in ignominious neut-rality whilst their comrades in the French&quot;Navy are fighting the common enemy.     Giraud -since Michelier is junior to Godfroy - should then be asked to order Godfroy to Dakar and to relieve him of his Command should he fail toobey.    It would be important for them toexplain to Godfroy the action that is beingtaken to re-equip the French Fleet and to assure him that if he decides to come over,his ships will be docked at Alexandria and hiscomplements reinforced by French sailors fromDakar5 or North Africa.    He should also be told that the question whether he should pro-i ceed via the Canal or the Mediterranean, wouldbe decided later in the light of the military/situation when
MOST SECRET-NOT TO BE QUOTED
the military/situation when his ships had been docked,his armament completed, and his crews re-- inforced,(0? Soon after Giraud1s message has been delivered to Godfrey, C.-in-C. Mediterranean is toinform the latter that for the reasons givenin Admiralty message 2305/21 we no longerconsider the Agreement to be binding arid thatwe shall not make any further funds or storesavailable for his Squadron if he does not actin accordance with the orders of Giraud.(d) If Godfroy should still refuse to obey, we donot think that there will be any serious con-seguences from the fact that we no longer havean agreement with him.    He is hardly likelyto order the scuttling of the last remnantsof the French Fleet, and the chief risk is thatsome irresponsible elements may decide to ooenfire on the floating dock or some other import-ant target.    This seems improbable, however,in view of the condign punishment which such persons may expect.    In practice, the most likely consequence of Godfroy&apos;s failure toobey and the resulting withdrawal of our financial support, will be wholesale desertionsfrom his crews.Ends..The Cabinet approved the above beforereceipt of your STRATAGEM 283. This, of course,will be considered urgently.T.0.0. 2030Z/28(Circulation)Deputy Prime minister foreign secretary lord PresidentMinister of labour minister of ProductionHome secretary lord Privy SealMinister of Aircra.it ProductionFirst Lord AdmiraltyS. of S.
