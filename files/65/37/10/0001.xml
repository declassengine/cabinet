These includedtelegrams Nos.  8, 9, &apos;11, 12 and 13 from the Minister ofState in Cairo*    telegrams from the Minister of State tothe. Resident Minister at Algiers) and from the latterMinister to the Foreign Office:    and telegram -SS&amp; SaSS*-i*SteSTRATAGEM No. 327^from the Prime MinistersSta-These telegrams showed that the Minister of;e had seen Admiral Godfroy on the night of the 31stJanuary and had told him that he understood that atelegram from General Giraud, which he believed containedan appeal to the French Admiral to join the United Nations,was on its way.  -This had since been deliveredc.Admiral Godfroy, however, was still hesitatingoThe Minister of State had reported that Itxiiu ivio.nxBT.ui&apos; or ox.ax,e na.a reported, wici o ... i, was an essential part of his plan that some publicity should be started which would make Admiral Godfroy&apos;s crews aware that negotiations were in hand.     He suggested that this might be done by means of &quot;a simple unofficial leak from north Africa!&apos;, on which could be built action in Cairo.The Minister of State had telegraphed to the resident Minister at Algiers to the effect that thePrime Minister had put the negotiations regardingAdmiral Godfroy&apos;s broadcast in his (Mr. Casey&apos;s) hands,?and repeating a request for a public reference on the radioto General Giraud&apos;s message to Admiral GodfroyoThe Foreign Secretary had sent an urgent telegram(No. 329&apos;  to Cairo and No. 38 to Algiers) early that morning to the effect that it was felt that a premature -and world-wide publicity about General Giraud&apos;s hand inthe affair would focus public attention on the negotiations at a delicate stage, in addition to causing trouble withthe Fighting French.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had not as yet informed General de Gaulle of the action which hadbeen taken to induce General Giraud to send a message to admiral Godfroy.    The position between General Giraudand General de Gaulle was still delicate, althoughrelations were improving.    The proposal that General G&apos;:-raudrappeal to Admiral Godfroy should be mentioned on the   radioin North Africa would inevitably lead to world-wide publicity, and could only make relations between general Giraud and General de Gaulle more-   difficult.While he agreed that the handling of the details of thenegotiations must be left to those on the spot? the generalconduct of those negotiations must be settled in accordancewith policy as determined by the War Cabinet.,    In thismatter of publicity, the action proposed by the Minister ofState was certainly not in accordance with the views of theWar Cabinet when they had last discussed the mattero

The War Cabinet were also informed thatGeneral Catroux was leaving for North Africa on thefollowing day.    If ptiblicity in regard to general giraud&apos;s&apos;s appeal to Admiral Godfroy could be avoideduntil General Catroux had reached North Africa, mattersmight be considerably eased,  since it   might then   berepresented that the Fighting French were associatedwith General Gir.audT s appeals,In discussion, general agreement was expressed with these views.It was decided that a telegram should be sentto the Minister of State at Cairo, and repeated toAlgiers, emphasising that publicity on the radiowould necessarily be world-wide and, by revivingcontroversial issues,   would have a very unfortunate effect on relations between General Gdraud and General,de Gaulle.-      For this x^eason the War Cabinet should,nalce it clear -that there was   to   bo.   no-publicity in this matter in North Africa at this stage,but - should indicate that local measures could appropriately be taken in Cairo, e. g., a whisperingcampaign, which would influence Admiral Godfroy&apos;screws without having any harmful effects in otherquarters.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Deputy Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to decide the terms of the communications to be sent on the above lines to the Prime Minister, to theMinister of State and&quot;to&quot;tho minister resident in North Africa0It was suggested that the foreign secretary would be well advised notto inform General de Gaulle of whatwas in progress until General Catrouxhad left for North Africa0Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,

Owing to difficulties in communications with algiers general giraud1sreply had not yet been received.   meeting had already been postponed for two and a half hours in hope of messagearriving meanwhile as  it did not come and in view of primemlni stb r1s explicit instructions to take action byJanuary 31 at latest i decided to hold meeting.2.,    i explained that i had been advised by resident minister  in algiers that telegram was on its way containingmessage from (general g ir aud general sense of which i believed to be a personal appeal to admiral godefroy to join theUnited Nations following the successful opening conversations between General GIraud and General [)e Gaulle I  said thati   very much  hoped   that   mdmiral  godefroy  would   find   himselfable to do so discuss  on then developed very much as wehad expected.   admiral godefroy indulged in a series ofarguments based on a distorted sense of honour and patriotismevidently the result of two and a half years brooding overhis particular problems coupled with recent vlolient shocksto which he had been subjected in consequence of the german invasion of Unoccupied France and the scuttling of theFrench Fleet.   The most striking fallacies and contradictionsin his arguments are brought out in a message     sent him   j.today text of which is contained in my immediately follow.; ngtelegram.    i did my best to deal with these arguments andafter discussion of one and a half hours summed up on thefollowing lines.    i urged that when admiral godefroy receivedGeneral Giraub1s message  inviting him (Admiral Godefroy)to   join   his   forces    it   should   receive   his   most   earnestconsideration if however he was not willing to do this put formally and earnestly to him that as an alternative weshould discuss the recasting of the go d e fr 0 y&quot;har woo dagreement on the basis of admiral godefroy and his squadronjoining the United Nations without particularising whichelements he joined for the time being in the meantime whilediscussions were going on present agreement would remainin   existence.     H.M.G.   -   seem  willing  to   allow  a   reasonable time   for   him  to  consider   the   proposals   either   of  which represented   an   honourable   solution   but   if  he   did   not   findhimself   able   to   accept   either   I   was   obliged   to   tell   him   thatHMG  would  not   find   themselves   able   to  continue   to   providepay  and  maintenance   of  his   squadron   at   alexandria./I   would

HE   agreed   however   to  my   proposition  that  theagreement   was   still   in   force   and   i   therefore   thought   it   un-necessary  at   this   stage   to  convey  any  warning   ad outpenalties   for   scuttling.     after   my.

YOUR TEL NO. 2 RESMIN FOLLOWING IS LITERAL TRANSLATION OF ADMIRAL GODEFROY&apos;S REPLY TO GENERAL GIRAUD&apos;S MESSAGE BEGINS QUOTE FROM ADMIRAL GODEFROY TO GENERAL TO GENERAL GIRAUD SECRET AND PERSONAL ON FEBRUARY 1ST I RECEIVED YOUR MESSAGE OF WHICH LAST SENTENCE WHICH WAS PROBABLY BADLY TRANSLATED BEFORE CYPHERING IS UNINTELLIGIBLE TO ME. I AM DETERMINED TO AVOID ALL ACTION WHICH WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATE HARMFUL RESULTS FOR OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT BRINGING AT THE PRESENT TIME THE PROSPECT OF COMPENSATING ADVANTAGES. I REMAIN FAITHFUL TO THE LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY. IF A TIME WERE TO COME WHEN IN THE FACE OF A NEW POLITICAL AND MILITARY SITUATION IT WAS MY BELIEF THAT FOR THE GOOD OF FRANCE MY IMPERATIVE DUTY WAS NO LONGER TO RESPECT BY OBEYING THE HEAD OF THE STATE THE ARMISTICE WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY STILL IN FORCE AND WHICH MILITARY HONOUR COMMANDS ME TO TREAT AS IF I HAD SIGNED IT MYSELF - YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT I SHALL NOT FAIL TO SEIZE THE OCCASION AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO NEED FOR THE MODERNISATION OF MY SQUADRON TO ACT AT VERY SHORT NOTICE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT UNQUOTE. ENDS. I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD NOW BE DESIRABLE TO ASK GENERAL GIRAUD IF HE WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SEND BY AIR A SUITABLE SENIOR FRENCH NAVAL OFFICER TO DISCUSS THE POSITION WITH ME. I SUGGEST THAT THIS OFFICER SHOULD CARRY AN UNDATED ORDER FROM GENERAL GIRAUC TO ADMIRAL GODEFROY INSTRUCTING HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS (GIRAUD&apos;S) AUTHORITY OR ALTERNATIVELY TO HAND OVER HIS COMMAND. I SUGGEST ALSO THAT THIS FRENCH NAVAL OFFICER SHOULD BRING WITH HIM WHATEVER DOCUMENTARY PROOF EXISTS OF THE COMMUNICATION FROM MARSHAL PETAIN TO DARLAN THAT WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR CONVINCING BOISSON OF DARLAN&apos;S AUTHORITY FROM MARSHAL PETAIN. IN VIEW OF GODEFROY&apos;S ATTITUDE BELIEVE THIS EVIDENCE WOULD BE MOST USEFUL AND MIGHT WELL PROVIDED GODEFROY WITH THE FACE SAVER THAT APPEARS NECESSARY. AS REGARDS AIR TRANSPORT FROM ALGIERS TO CAIRO, I AM ADVISED THAT MAJOR GENERAL SPAATZ US ARMY AIR CORPS WOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO ARRANGE.
