The War Cabinet had before them   a Memorandum by-U-Boat Bases the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P.(43)  11) askingin the Bay of biscay. for approval of area bombing of the. U-boat bases inI Previous - the Bay of Bis cay and a    direction   that these targetsReference:V7*M.(42) 172nd should be    given priority during the coming months .Conclusions,Minute 6.) There was general   agreement that the arguments inthe First Lord&apos;s Paper demonstrated that area bombing ofthese ports was likely to have important results inhampering the operation of   the enemy&apos;s U-boats;    andthat the operation should, therefore be carried out.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said   that his attitudetowards the.bombing of   these ports had. hitherto been based on the probable effect of the killing of a numberof French people on the situation in France and french north Africa.    But, in present  circumstances, his view,and   the view of his -advisers, was that the First Lord&apos; apropos al must be accepted.The Foreign Secretary asked, however, whether somewarning could not be given of what    was intended.It was pointed, out    that if any warning was givenwhich was related   to the Biscay ports, the result^ would/be to imperil the effectiveness of the attack, besidesrisking increased casualties   in  the attacking force.The War Cabinet were also    reminded that in/ june last o.  v; arning hod been given to all Frenchmen resident in the forbidden coastal zones  from the Belgian frontier

to the Pyrenees warning .them that these zones were likely to&apos; become in increasing measure a theatre ofwarlike operations , pointing out that it was impossibleto be as re precise in advance as to the moment and thefc.0.S.(42) 394)place of   such operations, and urging all. Frenchmen to3.cave the forbidden coastal zones along the entirelength of the French coast.The view of    the War Cabinet was that it might bepossible for this warning to be    renewed in general terms, without, however, making any specific referenceI to the   Bis cay ports.The &quot;-Var Cabinet  Approved in principle the recommendationof the First Lord&apos;s Paper (W.P.(43) 11)that    area bombing should be carried outre on the U-boat bases in the Say of Biscay,and that these targets should be givenhigh priority during the coming months,subject, to   agreement being reached betweenthe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for Air on thequestion of renewing tho general warning to french people in the coastal zones.Great George StreetS .W.1.
