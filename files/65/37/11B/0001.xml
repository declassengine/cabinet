?ounter ?easures ?gainst Axis ?ctivities.

At a meeting of Ministers on 24th, December, 1942 it had been agreed that, at General Smuts&apos; suggestion, representations should be made to the Portuguese Government, urging them to suppress the activities of Axis agents in Portuguese East Africa suspected of communicating with enemy submar? S.O.E. had been authorised to set up an organisation to counter Axis activities in this area. The Foreign Secretary had also undertaken to consider pressing the Portuguese Government to withdrawn cypher facilities from belligerent Consular representatives.

The Foreign Secretary now reported (W.P. (43) 99) that the Portuguese authorities had responded well to our representations. On the other hand, careful investigations had revealed no foundation for the suggestion that there was direct communication between Axis agents in Portuguese East Africa and enemy U-boats. The Foreign Secretary therefore recommended that General Smuts should now be informed:-

(i) That as S.O.E. activities in Portuguese East Africa would, in the circumstances, probably do more harm than good, it was not now proposed to extend them on the lines previously contemplated.

(ii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government did not consider that it would be to the general advantage at present to press the Portuguese Government to withdraw cypher facilities from belligeront Consular representatives.

(iii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed with the proposal that an Intelligence Committee should be established at Capetown to co-ordinate intelligence concerning Axis activities in the Portuguese African Colonies.

The Minister of Economic Warfare had circulated (W.P. (43)98) copies of communications exchanged between our High Commissioner in South Africa and the South African Government, about the proposed organisation of S.O.E. activities in Portuguese East Africa and the Intelligence Committee at Capetown. This showed that General Smuts had already agreed with the proposals submitted to him. The Minister claimed that General smuts&apos; interest in this matter was not confined to U-boats; and that he wanted an organisation that would be in a position to counter-act any Axis activities in Portuguese East Africa.

The following were the main points in discussion:-

(a) THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS drew attention to the specific undertaking which we had given to Dr. Salazar that we would not conduct S.O.E. activities in Portuguese Terriotry. The Foreign Secretary&apos;s view was that the establishment of an S.O.E. organisation in Portuguese East Africa was calculated, on balance, to do us more harm than good.

(b) The present proposals had their origin in the suggest-ion, made in December, that U-boats were using bases and obtaining assistance from agents in PortugueseEast Africa,     It was now shown that there was nofoundation for this view-(c) THE MINISTER OP ECONOMIC WARFARE emphasised that.an .effective S-OoE,  organisation could not be hastilyimprovisedo     He strongly urged,  therefore, that authority should^be given now for the necessary S.O.E.organisation in Portuguese East Africa8     this organisation would provide a central focus where theinformation collected could bo co-ordinated and thoproblems, studied^   No overt action would, however   bpfen lfe^U%ioa8SGnt of the U^t0^ingffiVgSd b0(d) THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE thought that, if theS.O,E0 project was abandoned,  there was some risk that Field-Marshal Smuts might set up his owno r g an i sa 11 on 0(o) THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that the avail-able evidence showed that most of the information wascollected by Axis agents in Union territory, althoughthe ^xis Consulates in Lorenzo Marques were a link inthe chain for passing on intelligence so obtained,.He feared that the establishment of S.00E.  activitiesmight make the position of the S.I.S.  organisationmore difficult.(f) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS thoughtthat the balance of advantage lay against, acceptanceof the Minister of Economic Warfare&apos;s proposals..THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,said that it must be remembered that there was a reasonablehope that,  in a few months&apos;  time, the Mediterranean wouldhave been opened, and much less shipping would have to passround the Cape,      Tho safety of shipping in tho MozambiqueChannel would then be a matter of less importance.      it now seemed very unlikely that Germany would invade Portuguesemetropolitan territory and that this would load to our having to take control over Portuguese    colonial territories0Furthermore, he thought that it would be very undesirable toagree to the establishment of an S.O.E.  organisation in portuguese East Africa against the strongly expressed opinionof the Foreign Office and the iidniraltyo      In the circum^stances, he thought that the War Cabinet should approve therecommendations in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum,although the matter could,  of course, always be reviewed inthe light of any change in conditions,.The War Cabinet -Approved the proposals summarised in paragraph of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum (W.P. ( 45) 99)and asked the Foreign Secretary, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Minister of Economic Warfare, to arrangefor the necessary instructions to be issued togive effect thereto0
