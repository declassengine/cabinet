SINGLE COPY- NO CIRCULATIONJImost secret -W.M.  (43) 4P.nri CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Anno?:.-(18th March, 1943 - 6.0 p.m.)SJ/AR SITUATION.Corrjnuni cationsIetween therime Ministernd M. Stalin.The War Cabinet had a general discussion on the war situation.THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet two telegrams,  dated 15th March, from Premier Stalin.    Thefirst, in   reply to the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram of 11thMarch, dealt with the need&apos;for hastening a second front in france, and ended by saying that the uncertainty of thePrime Minister&apos;s statements about the contemplated Anglo-American offensive across the Channel   aroused graveanxiety.The second telegram was a messa.ge of congratulationon the successful bombing of Essen and other German cities.The Prime Minister drew attention to the differenttone of these two messages.   The first might well havebeen sent by Premier Stalin after consultation with someofficial body.   The second message he took to be a personal message from Premier Stalin, who was anxious to preservegood relations with him (the Prime Minister) -The Prime Minister said that he thought it might be worth while examining whether, by using the whole weightof our Metropolitan Bomber Force to demoralise the enemy forces on a strip of the French coast, a landing could beeffected more easily than by the methods at present contemplated-   He proposed to have this idea examined.The effect of such an air bombardment could be tested by subsequent landings by Commandos without any great risks,and without disclosing future plans to the enemy.

Convoys torus s ia.) J^(f?viousef erence:.M.(43) 38th)on elus ions,Inut e 2 .)The Prime Minister then informed the War Cabinet ofthe decision reached by the Defence Committee at their meeting on Tuesday, 16th march * that, unless the enemyfleet concentration in North Norway could be enticed, out,we could, not, in present circumstances, send a convoy to north Russia.    It was therefore proposed that the convoyshould sail, but that, if we were unsuccessful in enticingthe enemy into an action this side of Bear Island, it should return to Iceland, for re-fuelling.This decision was reinforced, by the severe losses which had been incurred in the Atlantic, about 20 merchant ships having been sunk in the last two days .    Our Navalresources were stretched to the uttermost, and the strengthof the escorts to our Atlantic convoys was inadequate to*meet the enemy&apos;s concentration of TJ-boats .The Prime Minister then read a telegram which he intended, to send to President Roosevelt, setting out thelines on which he proposed that the decision rea.ched inregard to convoys to North Russia should, be communicatedto Premier Stalin.The Prime Minister added that in any event it would,have been necessary, after the convoy proposed, for May,to discontinue convoys to North Russia until August, owingto the extent of the Naval forces required, for OperationHUSKY&quot;.The Prime Minister thought that the balance ofadvantage lay in stopping, for the time being,  convoysto North Russia,  grievous as this would, be to premier stalin.   But he would prefer not to make this  communica-tion for two or three days, when there might be favourablenews from the North African front.Discussion ensued on the position described, by thePrime Minis t er.x   D.0.(43) 3rd Meeting.

The War Cabinet were in agreement with thePrime Minister&apos;s view that the advantage would lie in discontinuing convoys to north russia for the present, and concentratingall available escort forces on protecting the Atlantic convoys.   They agreed that,subject to President roosevelt&apos;s assent,the Prime Minister should send a oommuni-cation, on the lines proposed, to premier stalin in four or five days&apos;  time.During the course of the above discussion,THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE suggestedthat bombing attacks on synthetic oil plants mightserxously affect the morale of German workers.   he mentioned particularly the oil plants in the neighbour-hood of Stettin.The War Cabinet asked the Secretary of Statefor Air to submit a Report on the bombing of oiltargets (and. particularly the synthetic oil plants near Stettin)  in relation to our generalbombing policy.The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(W.P.(43) 27) stating that S.O.E. had been in touch forsome time, through an intermediary, with MarshalsBadoglio and calviglia, in Italy.   The former, who was prepared at a due moment to establish a. military government, wished to send an emissary, General Pesenti,to Cyrenaica to discuss with us co-ordinated. a.ction totake place at a. given moment .   He also asked thaiGeneral Pesenti should be given facilities for recruitinga force among Italians resident abroad and prisoners ofwar.

THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OP STATE FOR^ FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that this was the first time thatwe had been in touch with influential circles in Italy,and the Foreign Secretary was strongly in favour ofr getting. General Pes enti to leave Italy, provided that he^&apos; was prepared to come out unconditionally.In discussion it was pointed out that we were not likely to get much military value from the proposedItalian forces to be set up outside Italy.   Moreover,dealings with Marshal Badoglio, who had  commanded theItalian forces which had. conquered. Abyssinia, might havepolitical repercussions.The general view of the War Cabinet was, however,that it would be right that we should take this opportunity-nity of establishing contact with General Pes enti,provided that no commitments were entered, into without prior authority from Ministers.Accordingly, the War Cabinet  Authorised, the Foreign Office to informS .0 .E . that they could, proceed with their scheme to get General Pesenti to Oyrenaica,provided it was understood that he came outunconditionally and. that no commitmentswould, be entered into without the priorauthority of Ministers..The Foreign Office were instructed toinform the Foreign Secretary, in Washington,^ of the above decision.a       *       *VOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.
