The Prime Minister urged thatit was worth while making an effort to arrange ameeting? and that, if the Turks refused; no harmwould be done.The Prime Minister&apos;s telegram also containedinformation as to the progress of the Conference.The War Cabinet were informed by the ViceChief of the Imperial General Staff of the general position in regard to military assistance to Turkey..The amount of help which we could give to Turkey was limited by the poor communications in Turkey^The present plan was that, if Turkey was attacked byGermany,we should send air forces (over 20 squadronswore contemplated), together with such limited land forces as would be &apos; required for the protection of aerodromes and so forth.It was now contemplated that we should re-model&apos; this plan on the basis that we, and not theenemyj, held the initiative..   Up till now the mainadvantage   which we had hoped to gain from Turkey cominginto the war had been the opportunity which it would afford to us of being able to operate against Roumanianoilfields from Turkish aerodromes.    But with the war situation turning in our favour, we must also cater forthe possibility of an ultimate land advance westwardsfrom ThraceaAs regards equipment, the Turkish army was without experience of how to use our specialised modern equipment, and we had reached the conclusion thatif equipment sent was not to be wasted? it would alsobo necessary for us to send suitable instructional staffsIt was proposed that all these matters shouldbe  :.taken up in the forthcoming Staff conversations, andthat there should be discussions on the whole matterbetween the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, onhis arrival in Cairo, and the Commander-in-chief,Middle East.

The question was also raised whether, ifTurkey could he persuaded to come into the war in thenear- future, this might result in a demand for militaryforces and equipment for this new theatre which wouldmake it more difficult for us to open up a second frontI in the West.    It was explained that this was unlikely) to be the case.    Any proposal, however, to send to-   Turkey at this juncture additional equipment from theUnited States or from this country would clearly involve an added strain on our shipping resourcesoThe War Cabinet &apos; then turned to considerationof 1&apos;ne political side of the questions    The realobjection to the proposal that the Prime Minister should now invite the Turkish President to a conference wasthat if the offer was refused, or if the meeting was heldwithout achieving the desired result, the position wouldhave been worsened.    Generally, the War Cabinet&apos;s view was that it was unlikely that President Inonu would accept the invitation to come to meet the Prime Minister;and that, if he did so, he would put forward along series of demands which he would claim must oefulfilled before Turkey could enter the war on.our sideaIt was surely better that such demands should beanalysed and defined in Staff conversations, rather thanthat they should be dealt with in high-level discussions.Generally, the War Cabinet&apos;s view was that high-leveldiscussions were unlikely to achieve a successful resultuntil the ground had been further preparedos One point raised in discussion was whether itwould be necessary that a communication should be sentto Premier Stalin before the Prime Minister saw theTurkish Presidents    The War Cabinet was reminded that on24th November the Prime Minister had said in a telegram to Mo Stalin that we ought to make an intense effort tohave Turkey enter the war on our side in the spring. -Premier Stalin had replied on 27th November that he v/asin agreement with the Prime Minister and president roosevelt that it would be desirable to do everything possible to have Turkey enter the war on our side inthe springsThe War CabinetJrAsked the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to arrange for a telegram to thePrime Minister to be drafted on the linesof the above discussion, and agreed toconsider it at a further meeting to beheld at 3 of clock that afternoon.At 3 p.m. the War Cabinet again met and had before them the draft, prepared by the Foreign Secretary.The craft was considered paragraph by paragraph, and anumber of amendments were made.   The telegram?, as f inally;apnr-CT- .d-was despatched, as TELESCOPE. Bo* 274o *Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W,1* *&apos;^ajj

I now wish ancl ask that the following telegram should be; sent, either from me to President&apos; jnonu.or tothe Turkish prime Minister as may be&apos; thought best,2.     Message begins;    I shall shortly be visiting Cairoafter my conference in North Africa with president ofthe U.S0    I have been charged with the duty of speakingfor both Great Britain and the UeSD on the equipment&apos; of.the Turkish Army with the latest weapons which are-now.;at last coming forward in large numbers, and also. of.touching generally upon the matters, affecting generaldefensive security of Turkey^   i should be willing the-refer e^-to come to a most secret rendezvous with the Turkish primeMinister, and i&apos; could also-arrange if desired for C0i,GaSeto meet. Marshal Chakmak or other high -Turkish militaryauthorities.   Cyprus would afford a completely sure and-secret meeting place&apos;for a friendly&apos; talk about generalsituation, and I should be quite willing to come thereif this were agreeable to you,    Ends*3...   President Roosevelt attaches much importance to actionon these lines, and in the event of my colleagues being .willing to send the above message he will himself telegraph to president Inonu as follows begins:   president Inonu..The prime Minister, who has been conferring with me, is going shortly to Cairo.   He will in all probability wish.to -confer with you or with your Pr ime. Minister at some--convenient secret- place.    In case prime Minister Churchilldoes seek a conference I earnestly hope you or your primeMinister will find ,it possible to meet him,   Roosevelt,-   Endskm     Even if the Turks should&apos; say no it will do no harm.    Ihave no false pride in these matters. , The capture of Tripolithe increasing Russian victories and the fact that I speak
for the two great allies creates a most favourable   voccasion.    Do not, I beg you,-lightly dismiss if.5.     !The flight from Marrakesh to Cairo has been very carefully reconnoitred and considered and is not thought to -present any difficulties0     It does not. go over anyenemy territory nor near.any fighting fronts,,     TheC.A.S. and the pilot think it a perfectly good and  / .simple -flighty     The Chief of the Imperial General Staff andI need to go there in any case in order to discuss thewhole question with Wilson of his new command and;&apos; the dispositions of the lot h Army on,which we. are now about -to draw heavily for HUSKYo6*     I t ;?usf that you and. my colleagues.; will give- me      ,- .strict. latitude in my personal movements. whie.h,jE -deem-, necessary to the.public interest a section Two    &apos;Latest information on the ppogsess-&apos; of -fhe&apos;-, Conferencea7o      The weather is delightful,-but there has&apos;net been one single day when a lauding from the sea&apos;would havebeen possible.      It was fwenty-to one against the..Americans finding   the yci?foct day they did,   - ThePresident the.day before yesterday&apos; had a great review -near Rabat. .   The soldiers were astounded and delightedto see him. .   We are moving to. Marrakech tomorrowSunday and separate&quot; on Monday.8.      It    is hoped that some arrangements will be--madewith the French HegoqI had a long talk with, de-.Gaul&apos;lev yesterday and &apos; told ihim plainly, that there must be an- atv^-ahijement *-and    if --v&quot; &quot;--&apos;was the duty of any Frenchman, who.&apos;became an obstacle to french unity or to the relations between the variousFrench sections and   the two great allies,, to effacehimself and   that certainly no individual&apos; wouldbeallowed to obstruct the necessary forward march of thewar, and that.I should not hesitato to &quot;speak in publicabout these matters, much- as. I should&apos; regret to have- to proclaim him as the    obstacle.     The President whom- he saw after dinner was-much more kindly and. paternal.     He;,reminded him about the American Civil War, where brother&quot;had fought against, &quot;brother and yet had come -together,De Gaulle did not make a bad impression, though the....President was somewhat concerned&apos; at the spiritual lookwhich he sometimes had in his eyes.,   .... They parted on almost-affectionate terms.     We shall see what will come of the dual treatment today.     ;Mac.millan;and Mack.think ,that both de Gaulle &quot;and Giraud:.have &quot;plans , . and.ce.pfa.inly de gaulle^s entourage isUall:for settling.      I &apos; shall ofcourse remain here- or! at Marrakech as long as I can be ofany use.9.      We are to meet this afternoon in a plenary Session,at which the President and I will receive final reports ofthe Combined Chiefs of Staff.These..,
These have discussed almost continuously and the results are, from our point of view,, very remarkable:    first, wehave re-established the priority of Hitler&apos;s extinction asagainst Japan,    Second, we have secured, the priority of theMediterranean over HOUHBUP without prejudice to the maximumdevelopment of BOLERO.   Third, we have got HUSKY instead ofBBIMSTOITS.   Fourth, important, naval and landing craft helphas been promised for ANAKIM on which the Americans arevery keen.   Fifth, agreement that we should play the Turkish(?hand).   Sixthj we hope to get a distribution of forces ofall kinds which, broadly speaking, conforms to- the abovepolicy.   Seventh, alterations in command which are agreed to with the greatest cordiality comprise Alexander to be.Elsenhower&apos;s deputy charged with plans and execution ofHUSKY, and also Tedder to command whole Mediterranean theatre.They have further suggested that American-bomberoperations shall be directed by our bomber offensive inGreat Britain,    I have not agreed to this.   There should bethe closest concert but it would be a great mistake forus to take the responsibility of ordering daylight attacks by American bombers into Germany.    However the matter isbeing explored for means of covering this point,10.    It now remains to&quot; add speed and weight to all our actions..Having begun by talking about the end of September- all arenow advanced to the middle of July-,    I am still trying tomake the end of June the target dateD   Of course all will be ruled by the progress of the fighting in Tunisia but in afew days v/e shall know the state of Tripoli harbour on whichso much depends.190Ua/234Advance Copy W, 0.0.

MOST    IMMEDIATE - CLEAR THE LINE,TELESCOPE No,For prime Minister from Deputy prime Minister andForeign Secretary, &quot; ;Personal and Most Secret0War Cabinet have today considered your STRATAGEM No198,lo There is no difference between, us as to the great advantages of Turkey coming into the war on our ridecTelegrams from H.M. Ambassador record.a certain progressin the Turkish mind in the sense in which we would desirebut so far that progress is slow and tentative^   Whetheror not a further advance can be expected will depend upon the course of the war both in Russia and In north africa and upon Germany&apos;s consequent military position inBalkans.   We are apprehensive that any attempt to force the issue with the Turks now before they are. mentally ormilitarily ready might set back the favourable dovelopraenwhich seems now to be beginning to take place, albeitslowly,2. If Turkish suspicions are aroused that you havearrived hot-foot from a conference with the president inorder to persuade the Turks to come into the war they aresurely likely, to withdraw still further into themselves for fear of being made our oafs paw.   For this reason wedo not share your view that there would be no harm in arebuff or in the failure of the meeting if it took place.We feel this all the more strongly since the fact of .yourmeeting would inevitably become public in due course,3* We believe it would be wiser to allow the Stafftalks now accepted by the Turks tc proceed, and that intervention by you would be more likely to succeed at alater stage when the ground has been cleared and when theTurkish mind has become more prepared for intervention inthe conflict.* * * *
Lt-e,     You mention in your draft message to Presidentinonu &quot;that you will speak for &quot;both Great Britain and theUnited States on the equipment of the Turkish Army withthe latest weapons which are now at last coming forward in large numbers&quot;,,    We&apos; imagine thai; this contemplates, something more than the maintenance of. any British land and air forcessent to Turkey and the provision to the Turks of any surplus equipment now available in the Middle Bast.    If so,this would surely involve an additional strain on an alreadydifficult shipping situation, and would divert resources from other operations which you are planning, possiblyincluding HUSKY.    There is also the problem of Turkishcapacity to receive what we can send them owing to the inadequacy of their ports, Aerodromes and communications.5a     Finally, we must expect that the Turks will putforward a big list of demands covering not only equipment of their divisions and a big Air Force requirement, butalso food and other supplies and perhaps military forces0But surely it is better that demands of this kind shouldbe analysed and defined at Staff conversations, rather thanthat they should be dealt with at discussions betweenyourself and the Turkish president06. To sura up; we feel that it is too early for an approach to Turkey on the highest level without previouspreparation.1716a/2^oW.C.O,Deputy prime Minister,Foreign Secretary1st Lord.S/S war.S/S   Air.1st S, L,G* I.
