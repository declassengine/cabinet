APPENDIX.Message sent by Foreign Secretary toGeneral de Gaulle,  20th January,, 1945.I arn authorised to say that the invitation to you to come hero was from the President of the United Statesof America ss well as from mo.I have net yet told General Giraud, who crmeattended only by two Staff Officers, and is waiting here,of your refusal-     The consequences of it, if persisted in, will in my opinion be gravely prejudicial to the fighting french Movement,,     First of all arrangements must be madefor North Africa.     Wo should have been glad for you tohave participated in those consultations, which must other-wise be carried through in your absence^These arrangements when concluded will have thesupport of Great Britain and the United States.The fact that you have refused to oome to themeeting proposed Till in my opinion be almost universallycensured by public opinion.      There can,  of course, beno question of your being invited to visit the UnitedStates in the near future if you reject the President&apos;invitation now,     My attempt to bridge the difficultieswhich have existed betweon your movement and the UnitedStates will have definitely failed as a result of yourrefusal, and I should certainly not be able to renew myexertions in this direction while yon remain the leader of the movement.The door is not closed.     If with  your eyesopen you reject this unique opportunity, the consequences to the future of the Fighting French Movement cannot butbe grave in the extreme.2Qth January,___1945.
