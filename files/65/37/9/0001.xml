The War Cabinet met to consider a telegram from the Prime Minister (STRATAGEM 283) setting out the procedure proposed by the Minister of State for dealing with admiral Godfrey&apos;s squadron. This telegram had crossed the telegram sent to the Prime Minister after the meeting of the Cabinet on the previous afternoon (TELESCOPE 333).

The War Cabinet also had before them a telegram from the Prime Minister (STRATAGEM 286) containing a survey of the juridical position by Judge Besly.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that one of the two main differences between the procedure proposed by the Minister of State and that approved by the War Cabinet was that,under the latter, the first stop would be that General Giraud should be induced to order Admiral Godfrey to take his squadron to Dakar and to relieve him of his command if he failed to obey. The cutting off of the supply of funds and stores was to take place if Admiral Godfrey did not act in accordance with General Giraud&apos;s orders. Under the Minister of State&apos;s proposal, however, the proposed meeting in Cairo between Admiral Godfrey and the Minister, at which we should threaten to cut off supplies, came first in the programme.

The general view of the War Cabinet was that it was better that the first step should be that General Giraud&apos;s should give an order to Admiral Godfrey before we threatened to cut off supplies.

The second main difference was that the Minister of State&apos;s scheme appeared to involve a good deal of publicity. From every point of view this seemed undesirable. We should avoid publicity as much as possible, but if it was unavoidable, we should direct attention to the fact that Admiral Godfrey had refused to obey General Giraud&apos;s orders.

The following other points were made in discussion:

(1) THE VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF thought it was a pity in the first instance to include warnings as to punishment for violence and scuttling. We should proceed on the assumption that Admiral Godfrey would obey the orders given to him.

(2) If any criticism was made of the fact that wowore asking General Giraiid to. give an order to admiral Godfroy and wore leaving General doGaulle out of the picture, the answer might bethat wo were Booking to ensure the offoctivccollaboration of Admiral Godfrey&apos;s squadron withthe French naval units operating from Casablancaand Dakar, i*o, , ports in &quot;GirautJ. Territories&quot;.(5) ^3 regards the legal points referred to inSTRATAGEM 286, the viow taken was that tho action taken by tho Allies vis a vis admiral Gcdfroywas a separate  issue from any action which might be taken by the Egyptian Government in the eventof an attempt to do acts of sabotage in an egyptian port.     The legal issues set out inthis telegram, howovor, deserved examination bytho Foreign Office as a weapon which might comoin useful at a later stage.The general view of the War Cabinet was that tholine of action set out in TELESCOPE 333 should bo adhcrodto subject to such nodifioations as could conveniently be incorporated from the plan sot out in STRATAGEM 283.The War Cabinet -Invited the Foreign Socrctary to arrange fora reply to tho Prime Minister to be drafted in consultation with the Admiralty in tholight of the above discussion and despatched to the Prime Minister. /See TELESCOPE 3W *&quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, 3.W.1,

Jan., 1943.Prime Minister to Deputy Prime Minister.Following is draft of-procedure which Ministerof State suggests for dealing with Admiral Godfrey?ssquadron.    Subject to your comments, it seems to mevery sound.     I hope to hear from you soon.    Draftorocedure for -dealing with Force X.    it- is proposedthat the following steps be taken: -(i)   Payment of Force X to be put on a weekly basis.This has been arranged and the Base AccountantOfficer has been instructed to inform the paymaster of Force X accordingly when he calls for the monthly payment on January 28.(ii)   When replies are received to the Prime Ministerlstelegrams, the Connmnder-in--Chief would inviteAdmiral Godfrey to come to Cairo for a meeting with the Mini seer of State, His Majesty&apos;ambassador and himself.    Admiral Godfrey hasalready intimated his willingness to meet theMinister of State.    The Minister of State,would then speak to Admiral Godfrey on thefollowing lines:--D dav.     His Majesties Government are notprepared to acquiesce in the present situation as regards Force X,    Since the violation ofthe Armistice terms by the Germans, the Government- of Vichy is no longer a free agent and con-sequently an entirely hew situation has arisen.Moreover, we have definite proof that the Axisare already using French ships captured at Toulonagainst us, and under Article 11 &quot;che agreementmust now be reconsidered.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment therefore propose a revision of theagreement on the basis of Force X adhering tothe United Nations and resuming the fight./The Minister
;m&apos;Q-:T .....rK,T TO BE/QUOTED
t The Minister of State would point out that theGiraud - de Gaulle declaration published on. January 27 provided a most suitable opportunityfor Force X to take its place at the side ofall the other,French Forces outside Axis controlnow collaborating in task of liberating France.Admiral Godfroy would be told that a reasonable time would be allowed for the negotiations for-&quot;1revising the agreement, but that if no satis-factory solution was reached, it would no longer be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to continue toprovide pay and food for Force X.     admiral godfroy would be asked to think the matter over and to resume the discussion with theMinister of State the following day.    Meanwhile,preliminary steps would be taken to clear the harbour of shipping and to prepare preventivemeasures against actions by Force X (operationSNEEZE).- 10 + 1*(iii)   If Admiral Godfroy refused to.negotiate onthis basis or attempted to prevaricate, theMinister of State would inform him at their second meeting that he would like him to returnto Alexandria to discuss the matter with hisofficers.    Meanwhile, however, His majesty&apos;s government now felt obliged to publish a communique giving particulars of the recent negotiations with the commander-in-Ohief andthe offer which had now been-made to admiral godfroy.    The Minister of State -would alsowarn him that any act of violence committed by Force X (including scuttling) would not onlylead to the punishment of the person or personsgiving or carrying out the order, but to therigorous internment of the rest of the personnel for the duration of the war in Central Africa -or elsewhere.     In these conditions they wouldnot be entitled to receive pay.    admiral Godfroywould also be told that if he sought to leavethe harbour this would be considered&apos; a hostileact.D -i- 2.(iv)   The communique would be published and, onAdmiral Godfrey :&apos;s return to Alexandria, steps would be taken to bring it to the attentionof the personnel of Force X,    This would befollowed up by suitable radio, leaflet and otherpublicity including the warning given to admiral godfroy about food and pay, and punishment forviolence and scuttling;   action would also betaken to curtail the amenities of Force X in alexandria, e.g. denial of the use of clubs./ D 4- 7.

(v)   If Admiral Godfrey- had made do forward moveat the end. of, say. a week, ho would be in-formed that as no agreement had been reached,His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to handover all responsibility for Force X to general giraud&apos;s,    Meanwhile, the warning referred toin (ii) above would still apply.    general giraud&apos;s, whose agreement would have been previously obtained, would then.inform admiral godfroy that he was now under his orders as&apos;High Commissioner for North Africa and that hewas sending an officer to Alexandria to discussfuture arrangements.D 4; 8.(vi)   If Admiral Godfroy refused to take the orders of General Giraud, the latter&apos;s emissary would inform him that he was relieved   of his command and would request him to hand over to him.(vii)   It is to be expected that the combined pressure; and publicity&quot; won lit lead to Admiral Godfroycoming over before this * stage is reached.    If,however, all these efforts had failed, weshcuLd merely have to sit back and wait, untillack of food compelled him to capitulate.(viii)   If at any stage. Admiral Godfroy showed signsof being willing to negotiate, he would be told that:-(a) He need not commit himself to any one Frenchsection at the present time.(b) Arrangements would be made for his crewsto be made up from French forces in north africa or from the Royal Navy to enable him to proceed to a United States portor any other destination which after dis-cussion appeared to be preferable.     Itmight be desirable to complete the crews of certain vessels from the Force as awhole to enable them to proceed at once,leaving the remainder under care andmaintenance parties until such time ascrews -could be provided,/(c) His Majesty5sD 4- 7,

S3a(c)   His Majesty&apos;s Government, would pay and maintain Force X at full rates of pay&apos;until such time as other arrangements could be made,Cd)   If Admiral Godfroy felt that it wouldbe in the interests of the families ofthe crews to do so. steps might be takento make it appear  hat he and his crewswere acting under force majeure.T.0.0.1120Z/28(Circulation)Deputy Prime Minister,Foreign Secretary.Lord President.Minister of Labour.Minister of Production,Home Secretary.Lord Privy Seal.Minister of Aircraft Production.First Lord, Admiralty,S. of S.

Unparaphrased Version of a Most Se^rst^ Cypher.....Telegram not One Time Table.STRATAGEM NO, 286TOO. 1435Z/28TOR,   0255Z/28MOST SECRET CYPHER TELEGRAM.IMMEDIATE,From.:- Mideast,To:- Air Ministry.STRATAGEM NO. 286       28th December, 1943For Deputy Prime Minister andForeign Secretary from Prime Minister.1. Following is opinion of Judge Besly.&quot;rule seems to me to be an admirable survey ofthe juridical position and one whose legalismshould appeal to the French mind coupled, as I trust it will- be, with all other necessary measures..2. BEGINS.     Belligerent men-of-war in neutral ports are normally bound under internationallaw to leave port after a stay of 24 hours, whichmay be slightly extended for repairs.    while there they enjoy the extra-territoriality givenin time of pea.ce by international law to ailmen-of-war of a foreign power, and the officersand crew are therefore immune from the jurisdiction of the local courts in respect of offences committedon board.     According to Oppenheim (InternationalLaw     1912 Edition, Volume 11, Section 345), how-ever, if such a vessel is granted asylum for thewhole time of war, and is therefore dismantled,she loses the character of a man-of-war and nolonger enjoys the privileges of extra-territoriality.The legal situation which will arise in the-hypothetical event of the French men-of-war in alexandria harbour either scuttling themselvesthere, or doing damage to British or Egyptianvessels or installations, is complicated by two factors, namely:-(a) The anomalous

factors namely:-/(a) The anomalous position of the-Vichy Governmentand(b) The anomalous position of the Egyptian Govern-ment.There is, in fact, no exact precedent to follow,In my opinion -(a) an Armistice is not the same as peace, andtherefore the French Man-of-war arestill in strict law belligerent(b) the Egyptian Government, though because of herTreaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government anon-belligerent ally of the United Kingdom,is still in Internatiml Law neutral, she must therefore fulfil her duties as a neutral except in so far as her treaty obligations compel her to act otherwise.It follows from this that the French tten-of-war which have stayed on at Alexandria for beyond the normal24 hours, and as far as the Egyptian Government knowsor is concerned, may be staying for the whole of theWar. and which nave been at least partially and symbol-ically dismantled by the removal of breech-blocks andother important parts, can properly be regarded as having lost their character&apos;as men -of-war and as nolonger enjoying extra-territoriality under InternationalLaw.    I do not think that the French authorities would agree &quot;to this view of the Law, or that the egyptian authorities necessarily would.    The attitude of thelatter would probably depend on the degree of pressurethat could be brought on&quot; them to do so &apos;(which Is nowconsiderable), and&quot;on their estimate of the risk of  ,French or Axis reprisals (which seems now remote).But if the French&quot;Admiral were informed that this isthe view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and that in theevent of any such action the Egyptian Government wouldbe requested to deal with those responsible underEgyptian La,w, perhaps it might never have to be put to the test.Once the difficulty of extra-territoriality isovercome the Egyptian Law is very adequate to deal with/these offences,

deal with/these offences, thanks to the amendments that havebeen made at our request during this war to the PenalCode,    The maximum -penalty for injuring any vesselor installation for war purposes, whether the orooertyof Egypt or of the Allies, is, durin.R the present&quot;&quot;emergency, death.    Injury to the harbour by scuttlingwoula, I think, come within the above definition.These offences are. triable before Egyptian military courts set up under Etat de Siege, so there&apos;&quot;would dq- &quot;&quot;no risk of complications such as might have arisen -if the proper (?) tribunal were the mixed, courts whereFrench or other Foreign Judges might be sitting.I have purposely refrained from reference tothe Cunning ham-God iroy agreement.    No doubt this hasin the past coloured the&apos; attitude of the egyptian government towards the French Fleet at Alexandria,They accented their presence as one of the thingsrequired by their ally under Article 7 of theTreaty, and have treated them as proteges of theirAlly, instead of apnlying to them the strict rules of international Law.    But when that agreement lapses,which is the hypothesis now being considered, the true-position will emerget which isv I- think, that indicated -above. &apos;   - ,&quot;    &apos; .:;;/T.Q,0. 1435^/28(Circulation)Deputy Prime minister foreign SecretaryIsord President-Minister of labour minister of ProductionHome secretary lord Privy SealMinister of Aircraft ProductionFirst Lord Admiralty &apos;S. of S. for WarS. of S, for AirFirst Sea LordC0I0G0S0G , A , S aMr. PeckCaptain Clifford

The main difference between the procedure inour Telescope 333 and that of the Minister of State isthat we propose that Giraud should order Godfroy to take his ships to Dakar before we administer the medicine,whereas the Minister of State wishes to do the latter first.2, We think it important from the point of view ofFrench reactions in North and West Africa that, if possible9Godfroy should have disobeyed his French superiors before we proceed against him.    We prefer that our action shouldbe supplementary to that of Giraud rather than, the other way round,3, For the same reason, and because we think the riskof violence from irresponsible elements in the Squadronwould be increased, we are doubtful about the wisdom both of mounting Operation&apos;&quot;SNEEZE1&apos; and of broadcasting threats of punishment for acts of violence.    Such a procedure mayonly make the French realise that, we fear their power to dous harm and it will, we think, alienate French opinion else-where.     Unless, therefore, local irrformation about the squadron renders the mounting of Operation &quot;SNEEZE&quot; absolutelyunavoidable, we should prefer, if possible, to let thesalutary measure of stopping all further pay and suppliestake its effect unaccompanied by overt threats,4. We imagine that in para? (ii) the Minister of Statemeans, by revision of the Agreement, not the execution of a formal new agreement, but only a promise to continue thebenefits of x,he old Agreement until Godfroyfs Squadron canbe assimilated into the main body of the French Navy*5. Your para, (viii) C&amp;)*    We feel that it would bedifficult to create a sufficient impression of force majeurefor the benefit of the families of the crews and, at the sametime, retain the good opinion of Frenchmen elsewhere *    The/latter consideration

. latter consideration seems-&quot;to us- the more important,.,particularly as the stoppage of pay and supplies may be0 enough to win over the Squadron and is, by itself, a form of force majeure.6. On the above basis and embodying points made bythe Minister of State, the plan in our Telescope 533would work out somewhat as follows:-(i) Admiral Cunningham would take action as in4(b) of Telescope 333a     It would be leftto Giraud1s discretion whether to send a message or an emissary, though we should prefer the former0(ii) If Giraud agreed to order Godfrey to place himself at the disposal of the French high commission, the Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, soon after Giraud&apos;s message had. been delivered, would invite Godfroyto Cairo for a meeting with the.Minister ofState. H.M. Ambassador and himself.    TheMinister of State would then act as forD-day in Stratagem 285, with the differenceonly that(a) a formal new agreement would   not be proposed, but a guarantee of thebenefits of the old until the french ships are assimilated into the french navy;(b) unless actual mounting of Operation&quot;SNEEZE11 is considered   unavoidable,preliminary steps would not go beyonddetailing necessary forces and unobtru-sive preventive measures.,(iii.) If Admiral Godfroy either at once or at thesecond meeting refused absolutely tonegotiate on this basis, the Minister ofState would inform him chat he wished himto return to Alexandria to discuss thematter with his officers and that he wouldbe given, say, two further days in which tomake his decision/-- The Minister of state would go on to say that if, at the end ofthe time allowed, Godfroy still refused toplace the Squadron a;o the disposal of theFrench High Commission, all pay and supplies would at once be cut off; the Minister ofState would then, if Godfroy5s demeanourseemed to require it, warn him that any* attempt to leave harbour would be considered a hostile act and any acts of violence,including scuttling, would be punished withthe utmost severity.    Wo are opposed tothe form of punishment being specified in anyway because if Giraud were to intervene in/the first instance,

tho first instance, we should hope thathe would also agree to subject any mlfactors to French Naval-..coiirtHi]artial.This-would relieve us of the odium ofpunishing the French sailors.(iv) We agree that a suitable communiquereciting Giraud&apos;s intervention and thegrounds of our action should be preparedtogether with judicious propaganda, butfor. the reasons given in para. 3 above .we are opposed to threats of punishment for scuttling or other acts of violencebeing broadcast, unless the hostilebearing of the Squadron demands it.7. If the above procedure fails to bring the Squadronover, and it may have to be given a little elasticity accord-ing as the situation develops, we shall forthwith cut offall pay and supplies.     It seems almost certain that theresult will be a rapid increase in the desertions either tothe Free French or to North Africa.    This may lead   Godfroyto capitulate even before he runs out of ships stores, of.which he may possess sufficient to last him some time yet.8. If you agree we shall at once instruct AdmiralCunningham to initiate the action in para. 4(b) ofTelescope 333,T.0.0. 1945Z/29.Circulation.Deputy Prime Minister.Foreign Secretary.Lord President.Minister of Labour.Minister of Production.Home Secretary.Lord Privy Seal.Minister of Aircraft Production,First Lord of the Admiralty.S. of S, for War, .S. of S, for Air.First Sea Lord,   .C.
