SUPPLIES TO RUSSIA? (Previous Reference: W.M. (43) 44th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had sent a telegram to the Foreign Secretary in Washington on the 25th March, in which he had asked him to raise with the President the question whether it would not be better to tell Premier Stalin at once that after May it would be necessary to postpone convoys to Russia by the Northern Route until August or September. (The President had been in favour of withholding this information for the present). He had also sent to Mr. Eden, for communication to the President, the draft of the telegram which he proposed to send to premier Stalin.

A reply had now been received from the President to the effect that he agreed that it was advisable to give Premier Stalin the bad news now. The President also thought that we should not be justified in keeping loaded the ships in the March convoy to North Russia.

The President had accordingly approved the terms of the prime Minister&apos;s telegram to Premier Stalin, subject to certain amendments. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the proposed message as amended.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he thought the Prime Minister ought to know that our latest information was that the statement in paragraph 1 of the draft telegram to Premier Stalin, as to the German naval concentration at Narvik, was no longer accurate. It was known that most of these ships had left Narvik Fjord, but two or three days might elapse before we could ascertain where they had gone to.

THE FIRST SEA LORD felt confident that it would be found that they had gone to Alten Fjord.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Allied supplies Executive should decide whether the ships of the March convoy should be unloaded. He thought, however, that the unloading might be postponed for a few days, in view of the uncertainty as to the wherea? of the German battle fleet.

The War Cabinet:-

(1) Approved the terms of the draft telegram which the Prime Minister proposed to send, in the name of himself and of the President, to Premier Stalin,  subject to such amendments as might be found necessary in the light of the latest available information as to the location of the German Battle Fleet.

(2) Invited the Allied Supplies Executive to reach a decision on the question whether the ships in the March convoy should be unloaded.
