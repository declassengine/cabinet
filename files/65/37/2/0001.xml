Arc xex,(l8tb January, 1943 - llc30 a,Di0)THE SECRETARY&apos;OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSBald that a telegram had been received from the PrimeMinister on Saturday afternoon (STRATAGEM No, 35)**&quot; to   .the effect that after long talks with General Eisenhower,Mr. Macmillan and Mr? Murphy, he and the president had agreed to invite Generals Giraud and de Gaulle tocome out and to meet each other and them immediately.Tho Prime Minister had asked the Foreign Secretary tosee General de Gaulle and.: after binding him tosecrecy, to give him the following message&quot;I should be glad if you would come to join mehere by first available plane which we shall provide.,  as it is in my power to bring about an (group undo cypher o d) meeting between you and General Giraud under conditions of completesecrecy and with the best projects.:-     Itwould be advisable for you to bring Catrouxwith you as Giraud will want to have somebody,probably Borgeretc      The conversations would however proceed between the two Frenchprincipals unless found otherwise convenient&apos;iGiraud will be here on Sunday and I hopeweather permitting you to arrive Monday&quot;.The Prime Minister had said that if his colleagues agreedto this, he hoped that the results of the foreign secretary&apos;s interview would be reported to him as quickly as possible,  and that General de Gaulle would leave on SundayeTHE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER said that he andthe Foreign Secretary had decided that it was unnecessary to consult the War Cabinet before the Foreign Secretarysaw General de GaullenTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had felt some difficulty about a further paragraph in the PrimeMinister&apos;s telegramf which had stated that it was unnecessary to tell General de Gaulle of president roosevelt&apos;s presence.;.     At hiy interview with general de Gaulle on Sunday morning (at which Sir A. Cadoganhad been present)  after exacting a promise of secreay,he had informed the General that the Prime minister had gone to North Africa for military conversations withimportant American personages.     General de Gaulle had then added that while he had not heard of the PrimeMinister&apos;s departure,, he had received a report that thePresident had boon recognised at Acera6

The Foreign Secretary then gave the War Cabinet afull account of his interview with General do Gaulle on sunday morning (See TELESCOPE No.  87)%.     General do gaulle had said that, after Darlan&apos;s assassination ho had wanted to meet Giraud-. but the latter had not agreed.     The time was not now so opportune for a meeting, and he was reluctant to meet Giraud at a meeting of the Allies, who might presshim to some compromiseoThe foreign Secretary said that he and Sir AlexanderCadcjan had strongly pressed General de Gaulle to attend the proposed meeting,  which the Prime Minister had obviouslybeen at pains to arrange, and had urged that such a meeting was in the best interests of all parties.     General doGaulle had replied that out? interests and his might not bethe sameo     There were only two alternatives, Fighting Franceand Vichyr      General Giraud, who tried to balance betweenthe two, held no position at allQ..vftor a long discussion,    the most that general de   Gaulle had boon willing to do was to undertake to reflect &quot;pon the matter and to see the Foreign Secretarylater in the day.      Ho had agreed to come at 3.30 p.m, buta message had then been received&apos;to say that ho was not ready and would come at 5 pcm*At 5 p..ma de Gaulle had come to the Foreign office with Mo Pleven,  and had given the following message for thePrime Minister:--&quot;The message from you which was addressed to me do-dap by Mr,5 Eden was somewhat unexpected.As you know, I have telegraphed several times toGeneral Giraud since Christmas urging him to meet me.Although the situation has moved since Christmas in a direction which now renders an understanding less easyl would gladly meet General Giraud in French territoryanywhere he likes and as soon as he wishes with all necessary secrecy,      I am now sending him an officer tomaintain direct liaison between us,      I value most highly the sentiments which inspire your message andthank you rery heartily for them.     Allow me to say,however, that the atmosphere of an exalted Allied forumaround the Giraud-  de Gaulle conversations as well asthe suddenness with which those conversations have been proposed to me do not seem to me to be the best for an effective agreement.      Simple and direct talks betweenFrench leaders would in my opinion be the best designed tobring about a really useful arrangement.I should like to assure you once again that theFrench National Committee in no way dissociates thehigher interest of   France from that of the war and ofthe United Nations,      It is for this reason that,  inmy view, a rapid and complete rehabilitation of theinternal situation in North Africa is necessary in conditions consistent with the maximum war effort andthe success of our principles.I am telegraphing again to General Ci.Taud to repeatonce more my proposal for an immediate meeting, aproposal to which I have so far received no precisereply from him,&quot;-2- r   cAf**y   ^

In summarising the upshot of the two meetings,THE FOREIGN SECRliTiiRY said that he and Sir Alexander Cadogan-I had been entirely unable to get General de Gaulle to seeg* matters in&apos;true perspective4      One or two remarks whichhe had dropped lent support to the view that General de gaulle had made up his mind that he would not attend theproposed meeting and was seeking excuses not to do so.    Hehad spoken of General Gatroux with hardly concealedhostility, and of Gonerai Giraud with some contempt.     Heseemed to have no consideration for the general advantage ofthe Allies.      His attitude was that the right course wasthat Gonerai Giraud and any other French leaders who wishedto fight for the allies should join the Fighting Frenchmovemente     It was difficult to escape the view that hewas looking forward to a state of. affairs in which he wouldbe the virtual dictator of France after the war.In gonerai discussion which followed,  it wasagreed that there was no action which could be taken untilthe Prime Minister&apos;s reply was received.Reference was made to the fact that severalinfluential persons in the Free French movement had soughtinterviews with various Ministers in the last few days.     Itwas felt that the right&apos; course would be to avoid suchinter views for&apos;, say, the next 24 hours, until it could beseen how the situation developed.One rather awkward feature of the situation wasthat it was impossible to give a fair account of the offer &apos;which General de Gaulle had refused,  and to discuss the resultant situation, without disclosing the fact that thePrime Minister and the President were meeting in NorthAfricao     For the time being, the fact that such a meeting was being held, and in particular its whereabouts, must bokept strictly secret.      At the same time it must be recognisedthat although none of the other French leaders had aprestige and position comparable with that held by General de gaulle, if General de Gaulle adhered to his present attitudeit would be impossible.for us to continue our presentrelationship with him.      But before matters came to a breakit would be right that our position in this matter shouldbe clearly explained, not only to the General but also to.the French National Committee,     The procedure tc be adoptedin handling this matter &quot;would require a good deal of thought;   but no decision could be reached until the PrimeMinister&apos;s reply to General de Gaulle&apos;s message was received.8th January,  1943

HUSH MOST SECRET MESSAGE OUT2211A/17th JanuaryDate:  17o1.lj.3oTELESCOPE No. 87 ,( 1000?). :    v&quot;MOST IMMEDIATE.Following personal for?&apos;Prime Minister from foreign secretary.;:T sent for General de Gaulle this morning,    Sir A.Cadogan was also presentsI told him I had a message for him from you andexacted promise of absolute secrecy,I said you had gone to Ho Africa for military conversations with important American personages.   Hesaid he had not heard of your departure though he hadreceived report that principal American personage hadbeen recognised at Ace.ra0I then gave him your message to read.    He readquietly until coming to reference to Bergeret, whichelicited angry exclamation.When he had finished, he expressed no pleasure.He had wanted to meet Giraud after Darlan&apos;s assassination,but Giraud had not agreed.    Time Was not now so opportune,and he was reluctant to meet Giraud under auspices of allies, who might press him to compromise.I urged advantage of meeting, both to the Generalhimself, the cause of France and that of Allies.    You hadobviously been at pains to arrange it;    we stood loyallyby our engagements to him, and a meeting, the sooner the better, was in interests of allaGeneral de Gaulle said our interest and his might notbe the same. We had never understood that Fighting Frenchmovement was the real force in France to-day. There were only two alternatives, Fighting France and Vichy. Giraud,who tried to balance between them, held no position at alloWe made a mistake in going into N.Africa without de Gaullewe were in difficulties now, and asking him to come and help
We contested all these statements, and asked him whether he still wished to come to terms with Giraud..,    He said hewould meet Giraud nexu week at Fort Lamy, alone, and he hopedyou would press this on Giraude    Eight course for latter wasto rally to Fighting French^   He could then become member ofNational Committee and be appointed to command forces.General de Gaulle said he would bo doing a disservice toFrance by compromising with Giraud and the Viohy mensurrounding him at the behest of AlliesaWe retorted that attitude of Giraud to Vichy was justone of the matters that could be discussed with him, and weemphasised that your message proposed direct talks betweenthe two Generals,    I could not believe he would refuse toplay his part.   Moreover, here was an opportunity for himto explain his position to the president, which he had beencomtemplating.General de Gaulle said that was a different proposition,,If president wished to see him he could always summon him to america.I said I should deeply regret a refusal by him to meetAllies&apos; and co-operate with them for1 bringing war to a victoriousconclusion.    He argued that if victory was-- won for Vichyelements, France would not nave won much.Most he would offer was to reflect upon the matter and seems again this afternconeAt 5 o! clock he appeared with the following message toyou:-   Begins oThe message from you which was addressed to me to-day byMr.Eden was somewhat unexpected.As you know, I have telegraphed several times to general giraud&apos;s since Christmas urging him to meet me.    Although thesituation has moved since Christmas in a direction which nowrenders an understanding less easy, I would gladly meetGeneral Giraud in French territory anywhere lie likes and assoon as he wishes with all necessary secrecy.    I am now sendinghim an officer to maintain direct liaison between us.    Ivalue most highly the sentiments y/hich inspire your message andthank you very heartily for them.   Allow me to say, however,that the atmosphere of an exalted Allied forum around theGiraud - de Gaulle conversations as well as the suddenness withwhich those conversations have been proposed to me do not seemto me to be the best for an effective agreement.    Simple and direct talks between French leaders would in my opinion bethe best designed to bring about a really useful arrangementsI should like to assure you once again that the FrenchNat ional. *0
National Committee in no way dissociates the higherinterest of France from that of the war and of the united nations,,    It is for this reason that, in my vie?/, a rapid and complete rehabilitation of- the internal situationin North Africa is necessary in conditions consistent with the maximum war effort    and the success of ourprinciplesoI am telegraphing again to General Giraud to repeatonce more my proposal for an immediate meeting, a proposalto which I have so far received no precise reply from him0Ends.I once more pointed out that your proposal providedfor &quot;simple and direct talks between French leaders&quot;,,He reverted to his fear of &quot;pressure&quot;.    He stillhoped for a meeting with Giraud on his conditions.I held out no hope of this, and said results of his decision must be most unfortunate,,    He&apos; was throwing awayan opportunity of an arrangement with Giraud with full supportof two principal Allied, leaders which would have greatlyhelped war effort.Nothing, however, would move him and X have no alternative but to forward his rncss&amp;ge0221iA/17oDeputy Prime Minister.Foreign Secretary.Mr.peck0Captain Clifford.
