He thought that it was impracticable for the issues involved to be handledfrom this end, and that the War Cabinet should supportthe Viceroy in the line of action which he proposed.He added that he thought that if the War Cabinet didnot now approve of    aotj&amp;m    being taken on the lines proposed, the Viceroy might well be faced with the resignation of most of his CounciloIn discussion, various criticisms were raised of the line of action proposed by the viceroy and his &quot;Councils-(l)    The War Cabinet had agreed, with somereluctance., to the view that, if Gandhifasted;) he should be let out of detentionas  oon as the doctors advised that this must bo done in order to prevent his dyingin dotention0   But the War Cabinet hadnev ;r agreed to the present proposal^ whichwas that Gandhi should be let out of detention on a threat to fast.(2)   T? e present proposal seemed to involve anundertaking by Gandhi to return todetention after his fast was over.    strong objection was seen to any arrangement oxunderstanding being arrived at with Ganc&amp;hi.

(o)   larLiumoroj the proposal was open to 09practical objections^   What would happen        o if GaYdhip after his release, at oncestopped his fast:   was he to be re-detainedat on-..e?   Moreover, if Gandhi refused togive the undertaking referred to, andstarted his fast in detention, was theViceroy1s Council then prepared to let himfast to doath in detention?(4) Again, there were risks that Gandhi, if released .from detention), would re-establish contacts andthat this would lead to a revival of agitation inInc,Uu    (See,, for example, the points raised bySir Maurice Hallott and summarised in telegram 316Sfrom the Viceroy to the Secretary- of State.) v-,v(5) It was also pointed out that the new proposalinvolved what might be described as &quot;cat andmouse11 procedure;    io0o, it was proposed that ghandi should be lot out for a period and later putback into detention again without fresh cause.   TheCabinet saw strong objections to this.     hither to the utmost they had contemplated had been that ghandi^ if released on grounds of health, might bore-detained if he gave fresh cause for such action-(6) Strong objection was taken to the terms of thedraft announcement (telegram 335S)*     This draftscorned to contain an admission that tho Governmentfc:lt bound to yield to Gandhi&apos;s threat to hunger-strike--      It was thought that it would create an impression of great weakness.For these reasons tho War Cabinet were gravelydisturbed by- the viceroy--s proposals.     While realisingthat the Viceroy had proceeded a long way on tho basis ofthese proposals - the War Cabinet reached the conclusionthat it was essential that he should be informed of theirmisgivings, and asked for a further expression of his views before action was authorisodo      In particular, it should bemade clear to the Viceroy that he would have effectivesupport from the War- Cabinet if he decided to adhere, eitherto the line of action for which the War Cabinet had thera-solves expressed a preference in previous discussions, orto the line of action on which they had previously agreedthat the Viceroy should have authority to proceed i.e.*release only at the point when danger to life was involved.The War Cabinet accordingly -(l) Gave directions for the immediate despatch tothe Viceroy of a telegram informing him thattho War Cabinet did not feel able to approveaction on tho lines proposed without furtherconsideration,  and asking him to suspendaction on those proposals until further notice.(A telegram in this sense was drafted and despatched during the Meeting as No.2360to the Viceroy of 7th February)(s) Invited the Lord President of the CoLinciljtho Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of Statefor India to draft a telegram to the Viceroyin tho light of the discussion.    This telegram should be submitted to the Prime Minister,who would authorise its immediate despatchunless any point arose which, in his opinion,called for consideration by the War Cabinet.(This telegram was later sent as No.2361to the Viceroy of 8th February).Offices of tho ..or Cabinet

The Turkishattitude at Adana had boon realistic and encouraging, and theywere obviously profoundly impressed by the news reaching themabout conditions inside Germany.     This was apparently con-firmed by the latest news via Stockholm.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR suggested that the Chiefs ofStaff should provide tho Cabinet with an appreciation of thopresent situation in Germany, and enquired whether our armed forces wore in a position to take immediate advantage of anyGorman decision to withdraw to her own frontier,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not regard such a withdrawal as at all likely, but it would be as well for theChiefs of Staff to sec that plans for an emergency entry intothe Continent were brought up to date.Subject to the approval of the War Cabinet, he was proposing to appoint General Wilson to succeed general alexander when the latter took up his appointment as Deputyto General Eisenhower.      General Wilson&apos;s tasks would be, inorder of priority, to feed the Eighth Army, to prepare for&quot;HUSKY&quot;, to nourish the Turks and to prepare for amphibiousoperations in the Eastern Mediterranean.THE PRIMS MINISTER said that the weight of opinion in tho Middle East was -in favour of keeping Persia/Iraq, as aseparate command.     No change would, therefore, bo made forthe present.     No decision had yet been reached as   toGeneral Wilson&apos;s successor,   in this Command.Tripolitania. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was most impressed witheverything that he had seen in Tripoli.     The bearing of thotroops was magnificent, and their turn-out on parade trulyremarkable in the circumstances.Tremendous exertions were being made to build upadequate reserves in Tripoli for tho advance into Tunisia, andit was General Montgomery&apos;s intention to retain the initiative and to maintain close contact with the enemy, using light forces, until such time as he was ready to attack.     It was most important that no reference should be made to tho factthat we were now able to got largo ships into Tripoli.DHo had received from General Alexander a message say-ing that tho directive which had been given him on August 18thhad boon fully accomplished, us the enemy had now boon drivenout of Egypt, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, and that further instructions wore therefore required.Ho proposed to road this moss ago out to the House ofComm..mo.

Changes in command.French north africa,Telegram toPremierStalin,With the advance of our forces into Tunisia, the time had come to place the Eighth Array under the command ofGeneral Eisenhower.

Tho Minister of Information should take the necessary steps to guide editors in this matter.?HEMINISTER, referring to his telegram to theForeign Secretary (Stratagem 36l), said that he had had a veryfrank talk with Mr. Murphy regarding the two documentssigned by President Roosevelt   which dealt with the positionof General Giraudj, and which were in certain resuectsunacceptable from the British point of view.     /The text ofthese documents v/as contained in telegrams Nos. 14 and 15 of28th January from tho Resident Minister at Algiers to theForeign Offico.^7     He had dealt with this matter on thobasis of the principle of equality between Generals Giraudand de Gaulle0     He had asked General G-iraud to  restorothe laws of the Republic, particularly those affecting thoJews.     It v/as essential for the prosecution of the war in north Africa that we should have a tranquil countryside andunsabotaged c oia.runi cat ions .The Prime Minister suggested that, here again, theMinister of Information should give some guidance to thePress, and might refer them to Peyrotiton&apos;s record, part-particularly his attitude towards Laval.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the enquiry by premier stalin regarding our plans for a Second Front in 1943 and read to the Cabinet the draft reply35 which he had telegraphedto the President for his comments.*Those comments had just been received, and the PrimeMinister asked the Chiefs of Staff to examine them and lethim have their observations later in the evening.The War Cabinet -(a) Invited the Minister of Information to giveguidance to the Press as to the line whichshould be taken in regard to the Command arrange-ments in North Africa, which the Prime minister proposed to announce on tho 11th February,(b) Invited the Chiefs of Staff -(i) To ensure that emergency plans for a re-entry to the Continent, immediately therewas any marked deterioration in german military power, were kept in a state ofc onst ant r e a dine ss;(ii) To prepare an appreciation, of the presentGerman military situation-, with particular reference to the situation which would arise if the German Eastern front were to collapseand the Russian armies were to press forwardWestwards.K STRATACEM 331.
