Air Operations. 1. The Secretary of State for Air said that some Fighter (Previous Command patrols had been despatched the previous day to identify

Eeference:       doubtful enemy raids, none of which had materialised. W.M. (39) 58th        A leaflet-dropping raid had been carried out during the Conclusions,      previous night in the Berlin, Magdeburg and Hamburg areas. All Minute I.)       the aircraft employed had returned safely. The pamphlets dropped on this occasion were those containing the summary of the Prime Minister&apos;s recent Statement.   German aircraft were reported to have dropped pamphlets the previous day over an area about 50 miles north of Lyons.

The usual Coastal Command activities had been continued. Bad weather had prevented an attack on an enemy submarine sighted 100 miles west of the Lister light.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 57th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. On the 24th October a German submarine had sunk three British ships Tafna, Menin Ridge and Ledbury not in convoy, some 100 miles west of Gibraltar. On the same day a Greek ship Konstantinos Hadjipateras had been sunk by a mine off Spurn Point. To offset these losses we had captured two German ships, Poseidon and Bianca, in the North Atlantic, though the tonnage gained did not balance the loss from sinkings. Four destroyers and aircraft from Gibraltar were hunting for the U-boat operating west of Gibraltar. Further submarine-chasing operations had taken place off Orfordness. Contacts had been made, but no definite results were yet known.

Early that morning a report had been received that a U-boat was stranded high and dry on the Goodwin Sands. An explosion had been heard, and a boat had been sent to investigate, but no details had yet been received. No information would be given by the press on the matter, as it would be important to keep this knowledge from the enemy.

The operations of German U-boats as far south as the approaches to Gibraltar would necessitate additional destroyers for convoy work. The withdrawal of a flotilla from the Mediterranean would temporarily immobilise the Mediterranean Fleet, but the Admiralty were hopeful of obtaining five destroyers from Australia. It was proposed to suggest to the Australian Government that, since their only danger was from surface raiders, and not from submarines, it would be to the general advantage to exchange their destroyers for two cruisers, to be stationed in Australian waters.

The War Cabinet were informed that careful watch was being kept for two German tankers reported to have left South America with fuel for submarines.

The latest information as regards the American ship City of Flint was a Tass Agency report that the ship had arrived at Kola Bay in Soviet territory and that the German prize crew had been interned. This action might well raise serious difficulties between the United States and German Governments.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Authorised 3.   In connection with the discussion on the previous item, the

Press Reports oi First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to the great difficulties Operations. in reconciling on the one hand the desirability of giving the public some news of the operations of the forces, and on the other hand the danger of disclosing thereby information which would be of value to the enemy. He read out a telegram which he had received from the Commander-in-Chief pointing out in detail the useful information which an enemy would be able to glean from recent public announcements of the exploits of H.M.S. Spearfish, the sinking of r20210l b 2


494

the Royal Oak and the raid on the Firth of Forth. When such information was announced publicly, a rigid censorship of letters from the personnel of the Fleet was difficult to apply. There could be no doubt that the Commander-in-Chief had made out a very powerful case against this free disclosure of information, and that it would be necessary to be more careful in future.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 58th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

Weekly Reports.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 13.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said there had been no change in the military situation.

5.   The War Cabinet took note of the following Reports: 

(a) Seventh Weekly Report by the Secretary of State for War

(Paper W.P. (39) 99). (6) Seventh Weekly Report by the Secretary of State for Air

(Paper W.P. (39) 96).

Air Raid 6.   The War Cabinet had before them the draft of a Statement

Warning which the Secretary of State for Air proposed to make that

System. afternoon in the House of Commons, in reply to a Private Notice

(Previous Question, relating to the Government&apos;s Policy with regard to the Reference: sounding of Air Raid Warnings (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 55). W.M. (39) 52nd The Secretary of State for Air stated that the Home Secretary Conclusions, an(j himself thought it desirable to make a public statement on this Minute 6.) question, and the draft now before the War Cabinet had been agreed between them.

The War Cabinet approved the draft Statement contained in Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 55, subject to certain amendments which were agreed upon during the course of discussion.

Russia.

Proposal for a Trade Agreement. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 58th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

Russian Submarines. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 54th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, iD accordance with the conclusion reached by the War Cabinet on the previous day, he was seeing M. Maisky that afternoon with regard to the improvement of trading relations between this country and the U.S.S.R.

The Foreign Secretary added that he had not yet had any reply from Sir William Seeds to his telegram of the 19th October regarding the report that Soviet submarines had passed through the Kiel Canal to the North Sea.

India and the War.

(Previous References: W.M. (39) 47th Conclusions, Minute 12, and 53rd Conclusions, Minute 1.)

8. The War Cabinet had before them the following Memoranda by the Secretary of State for India : 

(i) Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 53, to which were annexed two

telegrams (2367-S and 2368-S) from the Viceroy, dated the 22nd October, 1939.

(ii) Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 54, containing a telegram from the

Secretary of State to the Viceroy, dated the 22nd October (793) and the Viceroy&apos;s reply, dated the 24th October (2385-S).

The Secretary of State for India developed the points set out in his Memoranda. He referred in particular to the suggestion in the latest telegram from the Viceroy (2385-S) to the effect that, after the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons, he should invite Jinnah and Sikander for the Moslems, and Gandhi and Rajendra Prasad for the Congress Party, to see him, and should ask them whether they could agree on any suggestions to put before him. If they could, he would attempt to steer any proposal for associating popular leaders with the Central Government on to the general lines proposed by Sir Muhammad Zafrullah Khan. The Viceroy, however, went somewhat further in his proposals than Sir Muhammad Zafrullah Khan, and suggested that a native of India should take over the Portfolio of Defence in the Central Government.

There were obvious difficulties in the way of such a proposal, but he (the Secretary of State) thought that it was only by action on these lines that anything could be done to meet the wishes of Congress Nationalists. On any other alternative he thought that the Provincial Congress Ministries would resign, that civil disobedience and agitation would rapidly increase, and that we should have to face serious trouble in India itself, and a situation which would provide material for hostile propaganda abroad. Unless we took some further steps to meet the wishes of Congress, he thought that the moderates would be quite unable to stand up to the extremer elements, and that the situation would rapidly deteriorate. The moderates might, however, be rallied to our side as against the extremists, if we were prepared to take some step forward. For this reason he recommended that the Viceroy should be authorised to invite representatives of each of the two major communities to come to see him. If the two communities could agree on a compromise proposal, which was quite possible, we should probably have to accept it. The Viceroy thought that the Moslem League could be relied upon to adhere to the attitude they had so far adopted, but that the younger Moslems might very well adopt an attitude more like that of the Congress Party. In any case, if we had made an approach of this kind, our moral position would be stronger and we should have asked the representatives of India to face the real difficulties of the situation which were not of our making.

The Lord Privy Seal said that he hoped very much that we had not got to face the blank alternatives of repression or, as some would call it, surrender. Dealing more particularly with the line to be taken the following day in the House of Commons, he thought the right line would be to make the best possible use of the Statement already issued by the Viceroy, so that when it was properly understood, opinion would be sufficiently rallied to an understanding of our position to secure that the Congress Ministries did not resign, and that there would be no question of civil disobedience, &amp;c. He agreed that the Viceroy should see the representatives of the Moslem League and of Congress, but felt that the burden of putting forward suggestions should be left to them; and that it was not for the Viceroy to put forward Zafrullah Khan&apos;s proposals. The first step must come from the Indians themselves, though it would be well for the Viceroy to hint that he might see them again if they could not immediately reach an agreement.   He should appeal for their


496

co-operation on the basis of the common war aims and war dangers with which India and Great Britain alike were faced, and should proceed throughout on the assumption that, if only the Indians themselves could agree, we must be ready to go further than we had already, even if this meant the appointment of an Indian as Minister of Defence.

The First Lord of the Admiralty urged that we should not go so far as this in yielding to the pressure of parties which were, after all, only exploiting the dangers with which Britain was faced. Such action would come as a shock to a large body of opinion in this country, and would break down the essential conditions of internal safety in India. At the same time, the Congress Party would remain unsatisfied, as they wanted real power over defence and finance. Moreover, no effective material for anti-British propaganda would be provided, if it could be shown that Congress was attempting to exploit our dangers by making further demands at a time when Congress Ministers were already in power in the Provinces. Nor was it obvious that firm action would necessarily lead to difficulties in India. On the contrary, the restoration of British rule in those Provinces in which Indian Ministries had resigned would lead to efficiency and economy and would be widely welcomed. But, if we once accepted the procedure which had been suggested, we should be on a slippery slope and should have to accept whatever proposals the Indians might agree upon, even if as a result we were quite unable to maintain internal order. Serious disorder was more likely to spring from a weakening of the Central Government than from resistance to unreasonable demands, and such disorders would be exploited as propaganda against us in the United States and elsewhere. We ought, therefore, to encourage the Viceroy to understand that we should stand by him in a policy of firm administration, both in the Central Government and in any Provinces in which Congress Ministries might resign.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that a refusal to make any advance to meet Indian opinion would lead to a very serious situation. The Indian leaders would soon find it impossible to draw the line between passive and violent resistance; the Moslems might fairly easily be persuaded to take the same view as Congress, and the Princes also were quite ready to associate themselves with Nationalist claims. Indians not unnaturally asked why India should be less capable of managing her own affairs than, say, Egypt or Iraq.

He agreed with the Lord Privy Seal that we should keep the door open, and he therefore supported the Viceroy&apos;s proposal, and would go even further. But he thought it very important to distinguish between fundamental Constitutional issues and any ad- hoc arrangements which might be necessary to meet war conditions. The Constitution could not be altered without general agreement; but it was necessary, for war purposes, to associate Indians with the Central Government. He would like to see the proposed advisory body develop into something like a &apos;&apos; National Indian War Cabinet,&quot; concerned with the prosecution of the War and the whole life of India as affected by the War. We should certainly have to move in that direction in the end, and it was far better to go willingly than to be pushed.

It might sound disastrous to propose an Indian Minister of Defence, but it would make all the difference who the Indian was, and the Minister would be selected by the &quot;Viceroy. In any case, the Viceroy would retain his own powers. If it were urged that nothing short of complete power would satisfy Congress, it had to be remembered that Indians meant something rather different than we did when they talked of &quot; independence.&quot; Their chief anxiety was to see that, when we talked of &apos; j safeguards,&apos;&apos; we were concerned with the interests of India and not merely with defending our own interests.

W.M. 59 (39).

The Secretary of State for India agreed that, while the proposed course of action would almost certainly not conciliate the Left Wing of Congress, it would be regarded as a very generous gesture by the people of India whole.

The Home Secretary said that he regarded the further development of the proposed consultative machinery as necessary in the present situation. The Constitution could not be changed in war time, but it was equally certain that it would have to be changed eventually as a result of the War. He would, therefore, like the impression to be conveyed that the ultimate changes would largely depend upon the behaviour of political India during the War, and in the meanwhile to tide over the difficulties of the moment by some more elaborate and formalised machinery of consultation than had been suggested in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram.

There was obviously a strong case in war time for a powerful Executive, i.e., for preserving the Viceroy&apos;s responsibility and the wide powers of the Commander-in-Chief. But it would be useful if Congress were to acquire experience in every Department of Government, and he would therefore encourage the Viceroy to start talks regarding the form of a consultative organisation that would give the Indians more control of Finance and Defence for the period of the War. Everything should be based, however, on the need for special war-time measures, and he criticised the Zafrullah Khan proposals as confusing war-time issues with permanent Constitutional questions. He would not go so far as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs unless we were pressed hard.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, while it was unsatisfactory that Indians should be ignorant of Defence issues, it would not be satisfactory to hand over the Department of Defence to an Indian Minister. Indian ideas of Defence problems, particularly in relation to internal security, were radically different from our own; for example, Congress wanted military organisations all over Hindu India, by contrast with our policy of recruiting the Army mainly from the Punjab. It would be useful to give the Indians more say on Defence matters in an advisory capacity, but, if an Indian Minister held the Defence portfolio, continual interference by the Viceroy would be necessary.

With regard to the suggestion that it might be possible to divide the military and civil sides of Defence and to appoint an Indian as Minister in charge of the latter only, the Secretary of State for India said that he doubted whether this was desirable. Under the scheme of Central Government contemplated in the 1935 Act, the Commander-in-Chief would, in any case, cease to be a member of the Government, and the proposal that he should cease to be so now and that his place should be taken by a Minister of Defence could not therefore be regarded as revolutionary. It would certainly involve a risk to appoint an Indian to the post, but everything depended upon the person chosen. For example, Zafrullah Khan himself, whom the Viceroy had in mind to appoint, was a Punj abi Moslem, who would certainly not agree to any change in recruiting policy of the kind referred to by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he found it difficult to express his views on the question which now had to be faced, because he had always doubted the wisdom of the original declaration in regard to Dominion Status.&quot; It was now inevitable that any concession should only lead to further demands. He could not help thinking of the analogy of Ireland, where concessions had resulted in the establishment of a Government which was being far from helpfulto us in our present difficulties. There was no doubt that the Congress Party wanted control of Defence and Finance, and he thought that any further steps towards meeting them, so far from leading us to a point on which we could make a stand, would almost certainly lead to still further concessions.


498

The Prime Minister thought that just as, in the case of the Dominions, it had been inevitable that we should make concessions to their desires for greater self-government, so we should have to make concessions to the idea of self-government in India. His wish had been to slow down the process, so that the effects would be less unfortunate than if self-government developed too quickly. In the present case he thought that we were being asked to go much quicker than was wise. If we had been at peace,, he would have been disposed not to make any concession. But the whole position was altered by the fact that we were at war. Reference had been made to the position in Eire. He thought that if we had taken a stiffer line with Eire in the past, we might well now be in a worse position vis-a-vis that country, and faced with a definitely unfriendly neutrality.

What mattered to-day was the outcome of the war. We might soon be fighting for our very existence. The real question was therefore how the Indian question would affect the War. What damage would we suffer if we were to break with Congress and if a fresh campaign of civil disobedience were to break out? Should we have to despatch more troops to India ?

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that the basis of his Report on the Defence of India had been to arrange matters so that the forces in India would be sufficient to deal with India&apos;s local defence and with her internal security, after the forces provided for external defence had been sent overseas. The force provided for India&apos;s internal security was regarded as sufficient to deal with a major internal disturbance, and it was believed that the loyalty of the Indian Army and police could be relied upon. It was in order to allow adequate provision for internal security that it had been decided that India should not be called upon for any great military effort. It was true that troops had been removed from India before the process of modernisation had been completed. Modernisation was, however, of more importance from the point of view of the North-West Frontier than from the point of view of internal security.

The Lord Privy Seal thought that the real danger was a great civil disobedience movement in India, which would nave a very bad effect, particularly in the United States and South Africa. In the event of a serious civil disobedience movement breaking out, the position would be difficult to hold, and it would be more difficult to hold now that we were at war.

The Secretary of State for India agreed with the Lord Privy Seal, and said that a civil disobedience movement would throw a very serious strain on the Services. Further, it would mean a slowing down in the production of goods which India was supplying for the War, e.g., ammunition, boots, sandbags, and clothing. It was clear that the Congress Party did represent the aspirations of Nationalist India. It might be suppressed for a time, but only for a time.

Some discussion took place as to the Defence portfolio in the Government of India. The Secretary of State for India explained that Zafrullah Khan&apos;s idea was that this portfolio should be held by a British member of the Indian Civil Service. The Minister without Portfolio suggested that, as we were at war, it would be right to leave the Commander-in-Chief in the Viceroy&apos;s Council, since this would result in greater efficiency.

Further discussion was adjourned to the ensuing Meeting of the War Cabinet.
