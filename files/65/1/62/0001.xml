The Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M&quot;. (39) 61st Conclusions, Minute I.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that successful reconnaissances had been carried out by the R.A.F. component of the Field Force.

A bombing attack had been carried out on a submarine to the westward of Gibraltar, but the result was unknown.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Narvik

Operations. convoy, consisting of 13 or 14 British ships, loaded with ore and (Previous        timber, had sailed.  The Germans might attempt to intercept this

Reference: convoy.

W.M. (39) 61st A number of U-boats had been reported at various positions Conclusions, round the coast, but there had been no contacts. The submarine Minute 2.)       aground on the Goodwins was believed to be the U-16.  Divers had

been aboard, but had not been able to enter the ship yet on account

of rough weather.

H.M.S. Beagle had picked up four bodies, near Cap Gris Nez,

wearing escape apparatus  labelled U-14.    It was probable,

therefore, that the submarine of that number had also been destroyed

recently.

A German cargo ship of 4,000 tons had been intercepted. She had been scuttled by her crew, who were being brought into port.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military 3.   The Secretary of State for War referred to the Press

Situation. rumours of intense railway activity along the North German coast.

(Previous Continuous movement on these railways had, however, been taking

Reference: place for some time and the War Office attached no special

W.M. (39) 61st significance to the rumours in question.

Conclusions, -pj^ ^ar Qapinet took note of this statement.

Poison Gas. 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that he had been

German report invited (at the meeting referred to in the margin) to examine the of British allegations made in a pamphlet which had been distributed through supply to the post in Great Britain. The Board of Trade returns showed that

Poland. the only munitions (other than Government exports) exported from

(Previous this country and unloaded in Poland before the war were some Beferenee: 3,000 rounds of 40 mm. ammunition in January 1939 and four W.M. (39) 6lst 6-inch guns in August 1939.

Conclusions, He had been informed, however, that the leaflet distributed in

Minute 4.) this country was very moderate in tone compared with leaflets which were being distributed in neutral countries. He proposed to issue a further statement to the Press in connection with the matter.

In reply to a question by the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for War said that postal censorship did not, at the present time, cover the entry of letters from neutral countries. He proposed to see what steps could be taken to prevent German pamphlets from being distributed in the country by this means.

Tbe Far Eastern Situation.

The Tientsin Garrison. (Previous Eef erenee: W.M. (39) 57th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

5. The War Cabinet were informed that the War Office, in consultation with the Foreign Office, had now issued orders for the withdrawal of the battalion now stationed at Tientsin and its replacement by a company drawn from a battalion stationed at Shanghai. The battalion Withdrawn from Tientsin would be sent to the Middle East.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Russia. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the

Soviet Note on Note which had been received from the Soviet Government on the

Contraband subject of our Contraband Control Measures. He was considering

Control. whether a reply should be sent, but, as similar representations had

Conversation between Egyptian and Italian Ambassadors in this Country.

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Egyptian Ambassador had called on him the day before, and had reported a talk he had had with the new Italian Ambassador. The most interesting point was, perhaps, that Signor Bastianini had stated that Herr von Ribbentrop had been convinced that Great Britain and France would not fight if Germany entered Poland. He had persisted in this view, in spite of the efforts of Count Ciano at their meeting at Salzburg, and in spite of a personal communication from Mussolini to Hitler.

The Egyptian Ambassador had spoken in a helpful spirit to Signor Bastianini about the Turkish Treaty, and the two Ambassadors had agreed to continue discussions on the theme that it was to the advantage of the Mediterranean Powers to keep the war out of the Mediterranean.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Italy. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the War

Particulars of this information are contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

Finland. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

Negotiations      had the previous evening seen M. Gripenberg, the Finnish Minister, with Russia.      who had appeared highly gratified at being informed that he (the (Previous        Secretary of State) had given M. Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador, Reference:       to understand that it would be very difficult for us to pursue our W.M. (39) 57th proposal for the initiation of wider Anglo-Soviet trade negotia-Conclusions,      tions, if the Government of the U.S.S.R. were to adopt too Minute 8.)        intransigent an attitude towards Finland.   M. Gripenberg had indicated that for their part the Finnish Government were not likely to raise unnecessary difficulties in regard either to the proposed cession of certain Finnish islands in the Gulf of Finland, or in regard to the non-fortification of the Aaland Islands. They were, however, determined to resist any proposal for the introduction of Soviet garrisons* n the Finnish mainland.

In the course of discussion, the view was expressed that from the purely strategic angle an increase in the naval strength of the U.S.S.R. in the Baltic through the acquisition of additional ports, &amp;c, was to the advantage of this country, since Germany would inevitably be forced thereby to take greater naval precautions in the Baltic, thus weakening her resources west of the Kiel Canal. On the other hand, due weight must be given to the political dangers following upon an extension of Soviet influence in this region. The introduction of Soviet garrisons into the Baltic countries might very probably lead to their bolshevisation, and there was a possibility that the extension of Soviet influence in Scandinavia might lead to similar results.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

The Balkans. 11.   The Secretary of State for War referred to telegram

Plan for the No. 630 to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome. While he fully appreformation of a ciated the need for securing the co-operation of Italy in the plan neutral Balkan for the establishment of a neutral Balkan bloc, he hoped that it bloc. would be possible to give due credit to the action of Turkey in

(Previous initiating the movement in this direction.   Turkey was now our

Reference: ally, and it was important that we should do everything possible W.M. (39) 6lst to build up her prestige and power.

Mnut^gT&apos; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he shared

the view of the Secretary of State for War that we must do nothing which would detract from the importance of Turkey&apos;s action in this matter. He was anxious, however, that Italy should also be allowed to think that she had taken the initiative for the formation of the proposed Balkan bloc.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Use in War of 12.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a Note by the

the Inter- Minister for Co-ordination of Defence covering a Memorandum by national the Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Censorship on the

Telephone use of the international telephone services in war (Paper W.P. (39) Service. 54).

The Secretary of State for War said that the first proposal in this Paper was to extend the use of the existing telephone services to France, Holland, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland, and of the radio-telephone  services  to  Canada,  the  United  States and


524

Scandinavia, to individuals and private firms. The check on these calls would be by a censorship control which would listen in. The second proposal was to permit press calls to the Balkans by cables which pass through Germany. These calls would be made from a previously censored script and would also be subject to control by listening in. The facilities now proposed were already accorded by the French, who controlled them by the same methods as we intended to use.

There was also an additional proposal, which was not mentioned in the Paper, to allow press calls to Scandinavian countries by telephone cables passing through Germany, as a stand-by to the existing radio-telephone service via Denmark, which was somewhat unreliable.

The Postmaster-General said that Germany had hitherto allowed latitude for through telephone calls, but all telephone connexions with neutrals had been cut off on the previous day, and only selected messages were at present admitted. The Post Office saw no objection to extending telephone facilities, as suggested in the Paper, though Reuter&apos;s News Service was transmitted very quickly by radio telegraph to the Balkans and we had telephonic communication via Denmark to Scandinavia.

The Minister without Portfolio had no objection to the proposals, but thought that the working of the scheme should be watched very carefully. Being, an island, Great Britain was in a different position to Germany, and valuable information regarding ship sailings and cargoes might be given away in a telephone message by an innocuous sounding code. It had already been found necessary to institute a postal censorship on internal mail at Inverness to cover the movements of the Fleet.

The President of the Board of Trade welcomed the proposals as granting additional means of communication for exporters, but referred to the delay, in postal censorship, which was having a serious effect on the export trade, through delay to samples and invoices. He suggested that, if this delay were due to shortage of personnel, additional expenditure on staff would be amply justified.

General agreement was expressed with the view that the maximum extension of communication facilities, consistent with security, was of great importance.

The War Cabinet : 

(a) Approved the recommendations of the Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Censorship for the extension of facilities on the international telephone and for the institution of telephone censorship control, as detailed in paragraphs 10 and 11 of Paper WP. (39) 54.

(&amp;) Approved the use of cable telephony for Press calls to Scandinavia, as a stand-by for use only when the radio telephone service is not available, and subject to the safeguards laid down for the Balkan telephone service in paragraph 11 of Paper W.P. (39) 54.

(c) Invited the Secretary of State for War to examine, as a matter of urgency, what steps could be taken to reduce the delay in postal censorship.

Russia.

Proposal for a Trade Agreement. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 58th  Conclusions, Minute 9, and W.M. (39) 59th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

13. The President of the Board of Trade informed the War Cabinet that he had now seen the Soviet Ambassador on the subject of the proposed negotiations for an Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement. He had conveyed to M. Maisky the communication which the War Cabinet had authorised on the first of the two occasions referred to in the margin. M. Maisky had appeared to be gratified, but had indicated that he would have to refer to his Government before he was in a position to begin negotiations in London. Indeed, it was apparent that each item in the negotiations would have to be referred to Moscow. This procedure was bound to cause considerable delay, but no great harm would result, provided that it was clear that it was the Russians who were responsible for the delay.

The President said that he had handed to the Ambassador the lists which had been prepared in the Board of Trade of possible imports from Russia and possible exports from the Empire to Russia. M. Maisky would not be in a position to inform us of the Russian desiderata until he had heard from Moscow.

The next move was with M. Maisky.
