W.M. 66 (39).

The Air Situation.

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that the previous day had been one of considerable air activity. The force of long-range (Previous fighters and reconnaissance aircraft which had been sent out in Beference: connection with a German air attack on some of our destroyers, as W.M. (39) 65th reported on the previous day, had returned without having met any Conclusions, enemy aircraft. This air attack had consisted of two bombs only, Minute 1.)       probably dropped by reconnaissance machines.

A force of heavy bombers, working in co-operation with long-range fighters, had been sent out to attack a force of German destroyers reported by one of our submarines. Very poor visibility had been met with, and the enemy ships had not been located. All our aircraft had returned safely.

A reconnaissance of aerodromes and estuaries in North-West Germany had been carried out to test the accuracy of reports of concentrations of aircraft and transport vessels. This reconnaissance had been carried out with great determination, in the face of heavy anti-aircraft fire and fighter opposition. Photographs had been taken from very low altitudes and an initial examination of the results suggested that no unusual or significant concentrations had, in fact, taken place. One of our aircraft had failed to return. A considerable number of other reconnaissances, patrols and searches had been carried out. Escorts had been provided for a number of convoys and two submarines had been attacked. A German reconnaissance aircraft had been shot down by our fighters on the Western Front.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Beference: W.M. (39) 65th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that owing to weather conditions it had not yet been found possible to board the German submarine stranded on the Goodwins.

He understood from a preliminary report of the aerial reconnaissance over North-West Germany (referred to in the previous Minute) that there were at present no German capital ships at Wilhelmshaven. It appeared probable that the German battle-cruisers were at the Eastern end of the Kiel Canal.

Two neutral ships had been sunk, either by torpedo or mine} in the previous twenty-four hours. One British ship had been sunk} and the ship reported as being in tow on the previous day had now sunk. Two attacks had been made on German submarines, one of which appeared to have been successful.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The &quot; City of Flint.&quot;

(Previous Beference: W.M. (39) 64th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

3. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff informed the War Cabinet that the City of Flint had called at Tromso and had sailed from there flying the German flag and escorted by a Norwegian torpedo-boat. The reason for the presence of the warship was not yet clear; she might have been sent to ensure that the City of Flint left territorial waters^pr to prevent our destroyers from capturing the City of Flint in territorial waters.

It was recalled that in the last war the Germans had sent a captured British ship into an American port with a prize crew on board. The American Government had, however, removed the prize crew and released the ship. In view of this precedent there was a good case for representing to the Norwegian Government that they ought to have removed the prize crew when the City of Flint entered Tromso.

The Prime Minister thought that, as the City of Flint was an American ship, such representations were a matter for the United [20246] b 2


552

States Government. There was, however, little time to lose, and it was suggested that the Foreign Secretary should send for the United States Ambassador as soon as possible and should suggest to him that, if the United States Government wished to prevent the City of Flint from reaching Germany, they should make immediate representations to the Norwegian Government. These representations might be to the effect that the Norwegian Government should either remove the German crew and release the ship, in accordance with the precedent which had been mentioned, or compel her to leave territorial waters. If this were done, the British Navy were ready to stop the ship, to remove the German crew and release the ship to her American owners.

The Minister without Portfolio referred to the length of time which it took for reports to reach us from our agents in Norway. He suggested that the possibility of expediting these reports might be examined.

The War Cabinet 

(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to

communicate immediately with the United States Ambassador on the lines suggested above.

(2) Took note that the Admiralty would examine the possibility

of expediting the receipt of intelligence reports from Norway.

The Military 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that there were no

Situation.        German troop movements of any importance.

(Previous -phe War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Minute 4.)

Possibility of 5.   The Secretary of State for War said that rumours of an

sea-borne and impending German attack on &quot;Great Britain, either by a sea-borne

air-borne attack expedition or by large air forces, were now being received from

on Great sources as widely diverse as The Hague and Peking.  There seemed

Britain. little doubt that these rumours were being deliberately spread by

(Previous Germany.  The moral was that we should not allow ourselves to be

References: deflected from our main strategy.

W.M. (39) 65th        Further discussion took place in regard to precautions which

Conclusions, should be taken in this country.   Details of this discussion are

Minute 3, recorded in the Secretary&apos;s  Standard  File of  War Cabinet

and 64th Conclusions.

Conclusions, m    tit     r\ i   j

1 he War Cabinet agreed  Minute 4.) .  

(i) That no modification should be made as regards the action

approved by the War Cabinet at their 63rd Meeting (Minute 5), with the exception that the motor transport required to place two Divisions on a mobile basis should not for the present be requisitioned.

(ii) To invite the War Office to report to the War Cabinet as

early as possible their plan for ensuring the necessary degree of mobility of troops stationed in this country, without undue disturbance to the training of the Army or to civil industry, (iii) To take note that, if the Admiralty desired to modify substantially the present disposition of Naval forces reported at the Meeting referred to, the matter would be submitted to the War Cabinet.

W.M. 66 (39).

Elr6, 6.   The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that Fleet movements

Control of com- which had just taken place had already been broadcast in English, niimications apparently from Germany. The rapidity with which information between Eire,    had reached Germany was disturbing.

Northern

Ireland and this        The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet

country. tnat censorship of telephone conversations between this country,

(Previous Eire and Northern Ireland would begin to take, effect during the

Eeference: course of the day.   On the previous evening he had received a

W.M. (39) 65th suggestion from the First Lord of the Admiralty, which he had

Conclusions, communicated to the Secretary of State for the Dominions, that

Minute 11.) further and more drastic measures should be taken in order to prevent any uncensored messages from reaching Eire.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that, in order to ensure that no uncensored information reached Lire, it would be necessary to impose postal and telegraph censorship and some form of check on passengers, in addition to the censorsnip of telephone conversations. A large organisation would be necessary to make the scheme effective. The Eire authorities were already carrying out a censorship scheme, and were co-operating with us in these matters. He had been informed that the German Minister in Dublin was not permitted to send cypher messages. There were two direct cables from Eire to the United States, and the Eire authorities were giving us copies of all messages sent by this route.

The Secretary of State for War said that he had been informed that the route for information to Germany was by private telephone call to the German Legation in Dublin, by cable to the German Embassy in Washington, and from there to Germany by wireless.

The Secretary of State for Air referred to the possibility of the operation of private wireless sets in Eire.

The Prime Minister thought that it might be wisest not to impose any prohibitions between this country and Eire at the moment, but to see what information we could obtain from listening to telephone conversations. He suggested, however, that the enquiry which was already taking place into the question of communications with Eire should cover all forms of communication with both Eire and Northern Ireland.

The War Cabinet 

Invited the Minister without Portfolio and the Secretary of State for War, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to examine the question of the control of communications between this country, Eire and Northern Ireland, including the control of passenger traffic, and to report to the War Cabinet.

Poison Gas. 7.   The Secretary of State for War gave details to the War

German report Cabinet of the very small consignments of munitions which had of British been despatched to Poland in 1938 and 1939. He had proposed to supply to specify these consignments in a. statement to the Press, in order to Poland. counter the German propaganda that Poland had received consign-

previous ments of poison gas from Great Britain. The Foreign Office, Eeference: however, thought that such a statement was to be deprecated, since W.M. (39) 62nd &quot; would show that we had in fact given the Poles practically no Conclusions      material assistance.

Minute 4.)&apos; The view was generally expressed that there was no need to

specify in detail the consignments of war material which had been


554

made from this country to Poland. In view of our reputation for good faith in such matters, it would suffice to say that we had examined in detail all the export licences and trade returns, and that this examination had disclosed th&amp;t no consignment whatever of poison gas had been despatched to Poland from this country.

The War Cabinet 

Invited the Secretary of State for War to make a statement on the lines suggested in the discussion.

Poison Gas.

Censorship in Prance of proposed statement.

8. In connection with the discussion on the previous item, the Secretary of State for War drew attention to Paris telegram No. 818 (Saving), which stated that the British Advisory Censor in Paris had received instructions from the Censorship in London that no mention was to be made of possible gas attacks, and to request the French censors to observe the same rule. The French authorities were anxious to co-operate in discrediting the German story of the use of gas by the Poles, but in view of this ban were unable to do so. The War Office had in fact imposed no general censorship on references to possible gas attacks, though they had censored an alarmist story which it had been proposed to publish in one of the Sunday newspapers. Clearly some misunderstanding had arisen. The Secretary of State undertook to clear the matter up.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for War.

Press oorres- 9.   The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet

pondents from that some difficulty had arisen over the proposed despatch of Press neutral correspondents from neutral countries to the British Expeditionary

countries Force.   They were due to leave on the 5th November, and all

with the British arrangements had been made. Lord Gort, however, on seeing the Expeditionary list of names, had expressed reluctance to receive these correspon-Foroe. dents.   Many of them were from Baltic countries, and he felt it

would-be difficult to ensure that information of importance to the enemy did not leak out through them. Moreover, he had pointed out that the present was not an auspicious moment for their arrival with the British Expeditionary Force, since our troops were not in the line facing the enemy and there would be very little of interest to report. He had suggested that at the most they should be allowed to pay a short visit during which they would be taken on a specially conducted tour in order to see some activities of our forces which would be of interest.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs emphasised the unfortunate effect of a cancellation of the arrangements. For example, the Japanese Press had made a great feature of the fact that their correspondents were for the first time being accredited to an Army of one of the Western Powers. They would be most disappointed and suspicious if the arrangements were now upset, and there would no doubt be similar feelings in all the other neutral countries affected.

Some discussion took place on the probable effect on neutral opinion of the news that the British Army in France was not actually in contact with the enemy.   It was pointed out, however,

 that our forces were now located in accordance with the wishes of the French, and that we had had no say in the matter. At the time when the decision was made, the positions occupied by our troops seemed the most likely to be attacked.  The general view was


361

555 W.M. 66 (39).

strongly opposed to cancelling the arrangements which had been made, especially as the French and the Germans were both giving full facilities to the neutral Press. The War Cabinet agreed : 

That the arrangements previously made for the reception of neutral Press correspondents with the British Expeditionary Force should be allowed to stand.

Military Assistance to Turkey.

(Previous Eeference

10. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence on the subject of Military Assistance to Turkey (Paper W.P. (39) 104).

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, before

  *----- the question of military assistance to Turkey had been examined

W.M. (39) 64th by     Committee to which it had been referred by the War Cabinet, Conclusions,      he had arranged for a preliminary examination of the problem by Mmute 6.)        the Chiefs of Staff, a copy of whose Report was attached to the Paper under consideration.  He emphasised that the whole of the recommendations of this Committee and of the Chiefs of Staff were based on the assumption that the neutrality of Italy was assured.

After discussion, the War Cabinet 

(i) Took note of the Report of the Chiefs of Staff on Assistance

to Turkey against German and/or Russian Aggression on the assumption that Italy is an assured neutral (Paper C.O.S. (39) 94 Annex to Paper W.P. (39) 104).

(ii) Approved the recommendations contained in the Memo-

randum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (Paper W.P. (39) 104), which may be summarised as follows: 

(a) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should be invited to inform General Orbay, without entering into any definite commitment in the matter, that, in the event of actual or threatened aggression against Turkey, we should probably be prepared to lend immediate assistance with Naval forces, but that it was essential that the Turkish Government should lose no time in inviting our Naval forces to pass through the Straits in such a contingency in order to forestall a surprise attack by the Russians on the Bosphorus; the First Lord, in making this communication, to emphasise the importance of ensuring that the Turkish naval bases are adequately defended for the use of our Fleet, and to suggest that Staff Conversations on this question should be put in hand forthwith between the respective Naval Staffs.

(6) That the Chiefs of Staff should institute a detailed enquiry into the administrative implications of despatching to and maintaining in Turkey the forces contemplated in paragraphs 18 and 26 of their Report (Annex to Paper W.P. (39) 104), and should estimate the time that would elapse between the issue of the order for their despatch and their concentration in Turkey.

(c) That the War Office and Air Ministry should furnish the Ministry of Supply with such information of their respective requirements as would form a basis for the examination of a project for the establishment of factories in Palestine for the supply of forces in the Middle East.


556

(d) That in no circumstances should British forces operating in Turkey be placed under the command of a Turkish Commander-in-Chief.

Military 11.   The Prime Minister said that he had had under considera-

Co-ordinatlon    tion a proposal to set up a Standing Committee to consider matters Committee.      0f   general   strategic   interest,   comprising   the   Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (in the chair) and the three Service Ministers, who would bring with them as their advisers the three Chiefs of Staff, and other officers if occasion should so require.

He thought that there should be a Committee charged with considering problems of general strategic interest, lest these matters should be lost sight of in day to day work. The proposed Committee would, however, in no way supersede the War Cabinet. The Committee would meet regularly and would submit their Conclusions to the War Cabinet and would make a preliminary consideration of any very lengthy or complicated reports from the Chiefs of Staff. The Committee would be valuable for considering long-term projects and for ensuring that full advantage was secured from the experience gained in the war. It would also be useful to refer matters ad hoc to this Committee.

General agreement was expressed with this proposal. In reply to a question by the Lord Privy Seal, the Prime Minister agreed that it would be important that this Committee should keep the War Cabinet informed at frequent intervals of their deliberations. The existence of this Committee would not, of course, prevent other Members of the War Cabinet from raising strategic matters.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To set up a Standing Ministerial Committee on Military Co-ordination, comprising: 

the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (in the

chair);

the First Lord of the Admiralty; the Secretary of State for War; the Secretary of State for Air;

with the three Chiefs of Staff as advisers :

with the following Terms of Reference : 

&quot; To keep under constant review on behalf of the War Cabinet the main factors in the strategical situation and the progress of operations, and to make recommendations from time to time to the War Cabinet as to the general conduct of the war.&quot;
