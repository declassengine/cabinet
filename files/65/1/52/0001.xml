Air Operations. 1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that enemy reconnaissances {Previous had taken place the day before at Scapa Flow. Fleet Air Arm Reference: aircraft had made contact, but there had been no losses on either W.M. (39) 5lst side, and no bombs had been dropped. Aircraft had gone up to Conclusions, investigate reports of enemy aircraft at various places off the East Minute l.)       Coast, but had made no interceptions.

A leaflet-dropping raid had taken place during the night over

Hamburg, Hanover, and Bremen.   All aircraft had returned

safely.

Aircraft had located an enemy submarine off St. Abb&apos;s Head. Destroyers had been directed to the spot, and had attacked with hopeful results. *

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the attack on

Operations. a convoy, off Cape Finisterre, by a German submarine, in which (Previous two ships had been sunk, and which he had reported to the War Reference: Cabinet the day before. The loss of life was not yet known. Most W.M. (39) 5lst of the convoy had now been reunited under escort. Some of the Conclusions, ships in it had been attacked, but so far as was known had managed Minute 2.)       to escape.

There had been two attacks on enemy submarines; one in the

Atlantic, which was judged successful, and one off St. Abb&apos;s Head,

to which reference had been made by the Chief of the Air Staff.

In the latter case also reports showed that the attack had been

successful.

The preliminary results of the enquiry which had been held into the sinking of the Royal Oak gave no support to the supposition that internal explosions might have been responsible. It was almost certain that she had been sunk by torpedo. (Previous There was still no news of the Admiral Scheer.

Military 3.   The Secretary of State for War said there was no further

W.M. (39) 5lst One German mechanised Division had moved from the Saar Conclusions, to the Cologne area, and one more Division had arrived near Basle. Minute 5.)       There had been some reduction of the number of Divisions on the

Eastern Front, and the figure was now believed to be between 23

and 37.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Employ- 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office

ment of Major- were proposing to re-employ Major-General J. F. C. Fuller, in General J. F. C. view of his particular qualifications for work in connection with Fuller. mechanised formations.  In view, however, of General Fuller&apos;s past

history and his strong Fascist views and connections, he had thought it right to consult the War Cabinet before making the appointment.

In the course of discussion, the War Cabinet was informed that General Fuller was a man of ability and imagination, who had had considerable experience, particularly in the last war, on matters connected with tanks. On the other hand, certain of General Fuller&apos;s

[20174]


432

actions since leaving the Army, and his Fascist connections, were likely to give grounds for considerable criticism if he were re-employed in the Army.

The Secretary of State for War said that, in view of the doubts which had been expressed as to the advisability of employing General Fuller, he would wish to consider the matter further, and would not press for a decision.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Security of Fleet Bases.

(Previous Beference: W.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 4.)

5. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence informed the War Cabinet that a Meeting which had been held the previous afternoon had reached conclusions, which had been regarded as eminently satisfactory by all the Departments concerned, as to the steps to be taken to provide a secure base for the Fleet on the East Coast. Particulars of the steps taken are set out in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

Air Raid Warnings.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 50th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

6. The Prime Minister asked the Minister for Home Security if he could make any statement with regard to the improvement of the air raid warning system as a result of the experience at Rosyth.

The Minister for Home Security replied that no settlement of the matter could be reached in the absence of the Secretary of State for Air. On technical grounds he could express no opinion, as this was the responsibility of the Air Ministry. On general grounds, however, he felt that there were grave disadvantages in playing too much for safety, on account of the effect of frequent warnings on the morale of the public and on industry. He therefore considered that we should be justified in taking more risks. We should tell the public our reasons for taking these risks, and explain that in certain circumstances they might get no warning of the arrival of enemy aircraft other than the firing of guns. In his judgment the public would not resent an absence of warning, if they knew that it was due to deliberate policy and not to ineffective organisation. He hoped to work out some arrangements on these lines with the Air Ministry, which he would report to the War Cabinet in due course.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Italy: Possible Mediterranean Detente.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 46th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper W.P. (39) 92) and a Report by the Chiefs of Staff (Paper W.P. (39) 85) on the subject of a possible detente with Italy in the Mediterranean.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs welcomed the principle put forward in the Paper by the First Lord of the Admiralty that we should endeavour to keep the U-boat warfare out of the Mediterranean, and in the process of doing so, bring about improved Anglo-Franco-Italian co-operation. It would, however, be trying the Italian Government rather high to ask them to agree at this juncture that no submarines, except those belonging to the Mediterranean Powers, should be allowed in these waters, as this would be tantamount to naming Germany as the specific Power to which exclusion should apply. The action taken by the United States of America to proscribe belligerent acts by warships in the vicinity of the United States was hardly analogous, since although Italian intervention on the side of Germany seemed unlikely at the present time, Italy was still theoretically Germany&apos;s ally. Discussion of this question with Italy would, therefore, need very careful handling.   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome was


433

W.M. 52 (39).

shortly due to return on leave and he (the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs) would like to take this opportunity of discussing the matter with him.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence invited attention to paragraph 24 of the Report of the Chiefs of Staff, in which it was suggested that the French might be prepared to consider the withdrawal of troops from North Africa in return for some quid fro quo in Libya from the Italians. According to the latest reports, the Italians were increasing the strength of their garrison in Libya.

The Secretary of State for War said that there were six Italian divisions in Western Libya and two divisions in the East. 10,000 blackshirt troops were reported to have been sent there recently and this would bring the garrison up to approximately 10 divisions.

In reply to a question, the Chief of Naval Staff said that, according to Admiralty information, there were no German U-boats at present in the Mediterranean, and they would not be able to operate in this area unless they could make use of bases either in Spain or Italy.

The War Cabinet 

(a) Agreed that no approach to the Italian Government should

be made with regard to the military questions raised in the Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty and in the Report by the Chiefs of Staff, until they had been discussed with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome, who was shortly returning on-leave to this country.

(b) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to make an approach to

the Italian Government on the question of Balkan unity, without awaiting the upshot of the discussions referred to in (a).

Turkey. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Signature of the to telegram No. 624 dated the 18th October, 1939, from His Anglo-Franco- Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, stating that arrangements had Turkish Treaty, been made for the signature of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty to take (Previous place that day (the 19th October, 1939) at 4-30 p.m. G.M.T. (i.e., Reference: 5 30 p.m. summer time in England). He (the Secretary of State) W.M. (39) 5lst considered that it would be helpful if an arrangement could be made Conclusions, by which the business of the House of Commons could be interrupted Minute 8.) at a suitable hour that afternoon to enable the Prime Minister to inform the House that the Treaty had been signed.

The Prime Minister said that he thought that the best course would be for him to make the announcement at some time between 6-30 p.m. and 7 p.m. that evening, by which time he hoped that it might be possible for a message to be received by the Foreign Office from Ankara reporting that signature had actually taken place.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Wages in the Coal Mining Industry.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 12.)

9. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, as agreed at the meeting referred to in the margin, he had seen the Ministers concerned the previous afternoon and had concluded from his talk with them that it would be a mistake for him to see the miners&apos; representatives. He had been very much impressed by the view urged upon him by the Ministers that in the miners&apos; present leaders the Government had to deal with a relatively reasonable set of men, and that it was therefore important to help them to preserve their authority, and not to drive them to accept responsibility for terms of settlement which they could not hold, with the [20174] b 3


434

result that they would then be replaced by extremists. He was advised that the concession of an increase in wages now was not likely to lead to demands for further increases other than those which would result from the normal ascertainments. Miners&apos; wages were normally determined by periodical ascertainments of the profits of the industry, and it could be argued that the Government, by their control of prices, were preventing the men from obtaining an increase in wages, which would have resulted if prices had been left to the operation of supply and demand.

The Secretary for Mines said that, after the Ministers concerned had met the Prime Minister, he and the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury had seen the coal-owners&apos; representatives. He gave the War Cabinet a summary of the proceedings, a copy of which is annexed to these conclusions. He found that the arguments which he was prepared to advance on behalf of the Government merely reinforced the views already held by the owners. The latter were anxious to settle with the mine-workers for an increase of the smallest possible amount, and fully appreciated the undesirability of its being related to the rise in the cost of living. They would try to settle on the basis of an increase of Sd. a shift and might have to concede 9^., but would definitely not concede so much as Is. There was no escaping the fact that the Government, through the control of prices, exercised an indirect control of wages in the industry.

The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that any increase in wages now conceded would be merged in any later increases under the ascertainment procedure. The increase in wages proposed was, therefore, only an anticipation of what would be obtained under this procedure.

Stress was laid on the importance of preventing so far as possible any association of the proposed wage increase with the rise in the cost of living. The Minister of Labour pointed out that, at a recent discussion, Trade Union leaders had expressed the view that they did not wish wage increases to be directly related to the cost of living.

The Prime Minister said that he was convinced that it was the right course to agree to a small increase in wages in order to avoid disturbance of the existing good relations in the industry.

The War Cabinet accordingly agreed 

To authorise the Secretary for Mines to inform the Mining Association that 

(1) the  Government  concurred   in  their  proposal to

negotiate with the Mineworkers&apos; Federation for an immediate increase of wages, which increase 

(a) should be as small as possible and, in any case,

less than Is. per shift;

(b) should be merged in any increase which might

accrue later ctS cl result of the normal ascertainments;

(c) should ostensibly be granted, so far as possible,

on grounds other than the rise in the cost of living :

(2) the Government would be prepared to take into

account such an increase of wages in considering the figure to be approved for the pit-head price of coal.

W.M. 52 (39).

The Urgent Freight Requirements of the Ministry of Food and the Chartering of Neutral Tonnage. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 50th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on the urgent freight requirements of the Ministry of Food (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 42).

The Prime Minister said that, in view of the alarming character of the document, he had thought it advisable to have it brought before the War Cabinet at once, in order that they might be informed as to the steps which were being taken to deal with the situation.

The Minister of Food said that the total tonnage chartered for cereals and cereal products to arrive by the 30th November showed a deficit against the amount of these commodities which would be consumed in that period of 981,000 tons, or nearly five weeks&apos; consumption. The normal human consumption of wheat was about 115,000 tons a week. At this time of year 700,000 tons were normally landed in six weeks, but this year the amount landed in that period was approximately only 350,000 tons. His Memorandum had been written after some Departmental discussions. He had hoped that the situation would be eased in three ways : first, by the Treasury providing gold exchange for shipments from Canada; secondly, by the Board of Trade arranging for freights from Roumania and the Mediterranean; thirdly, by the Board of Trade meeting requirements from the River Plate, where we had purchased wheat but had few British ships to carry it. Notwithstanding the action taken by the Board of Trade, however, there remained a substantial deficit. The crux of the matter was the need for further tonnage. It was difficult to obtain British shipping at the present time partly because of the dislocation arising out of the institution of the convoy system. As regards neutral shipping he was hampered by not being able to charter shipping at freights above certain levels. The freight market was rising, and neutrals were already paying higher rates.

In the course of a preliminary discussion the following points emerged: 

(1) The amount of wheat landed in the first six weeks of the

war was not a fair criterion, owing to the slowing down of trade caused by the outbreak of war and the institution of a convoy system.

(2) The figures in the Memorandum had been based on the

assumption that an allowance of 25 per cent, should be made for sinkings.

The view was expressed that this figure was too high and should be reviewed in the light of consultation between the Departments concerned. It was clear that a figure of this magnitude would affect the shipping requirements of all Departments.

(3) The difficulties encountered by the Freight Department of

the Ministry of Food in chartering neutral shipping were due to the need for co-ordinating negotiations as to freight rates between the various neutral countries. Nevertheless, the importance was appreciated of making as rapid progress as possible with these negotiations.

(4) Negotiations with Greek shipowners were held up, since

the Greek Government had placed a ban on Greek shipowners chartering their ships.

The Minister for Shipping had already discussed the matter with the Greek Minister, and it was desirable that early pressure should be brought to bear on the Greek Government.

(5) Negotiations with the Norwegians were in hand, but it was difficult to see how they could be expedited.


436

(6) Stocks of maize and barley, which normally consisted of only a fortnight&apos;s supply, were now practically exhausted.

It was pointed out that this appeared to have some reaction on the production of munitions, as it affected the manufactures of maize starch and glucose.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(a) That, in view of the urgency of the problem, a Meeting

comprising the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Food and the Minister of Shipping, with representatives of the Foreign Office and Admiralty, should be held at 3 p.m. that afternoon to consider further the situation disclosed in the Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 42) on the urgent freight requirements of the Ministry of Food.

(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should&quot;

confer with the Minister of Shipping as to the terms of a telegram, which should be despatched on the earliest possible date, to His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Athens, giving him instructions to bring pressure to bear on the Greek Government to come to an early settlement of the negotiations already in progress for chartering Greek tonnage.

(c) That the matter should again be brought before the War

Cabinet at the first opportunity.

Press and Censorship Bureau.

(Previous References: W.M. (39) 35th Conclusions, Minute 9, and 44th Conclusions, Minute 16.)

11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Home Secretary (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 40) dealing with the question of Ministerial responsibility for the staff of the Press and Censorship Bureau, and for certain general matters related to the functions of that staff.

The Home Secretary said that he would be prepared to accept the additional responsibilities in question, if the War Cabinet thought fit so to instruct him. He thought that this responsibility would, with difficulty, be confined to routine matters and was likely to cover a somewhat wider field. Illustrations in paragraph 3 of the responsibilities which might be expected to fall on the Minister to whose Department this staff was attached were based partly on recent Parliamentary Questions, and partly on the experience of 1914-18.

In discussion, it was explained that, under the arrangement proposed, the Home Secretary would not be responsible for the staff of other Departments serving in the Press and Censorship Bureau. The arrangements proposed did not constitute any departure from the decision announced by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, by which each Department was to be responsible for its own news, and for the censorship of items of news falling within its subject matter.

The War Cabinet 

(a) Invited the Home Secretary to be responsible for the staff

of the Press and Censorship Bureau.

(b) Approved the definition of his responsibilities set out in

the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum.

Eire.

Wearirjg of uniform by members of the United Kingdom forces when on

12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 38) relating to the question of the wearing of uniform by members of the United Kingdom forces when visiting Eire on leave.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs stated that Mr. de &quot;Valera was well aware that large numbers of Eire citizens had enlisted and were enlisting in the United Kingdom forces. Mr. de Valera had done nothing and wished to do nothing to interfere with this, but was afraid of political repercussions owing to the presence in Eire of large numbers of persons in British uniform. The position had been considered by the Service Departments and, although it would entail some administrative difficulties and expense, they were prepared to devise arrangements to meet Mr. de Valera&apos;s request.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should inform Mr. de Valera that we were prepared to meet his request, and that arrangements would be made to ensure that members of the United Kingdom forces, proceeding on leave to Eire, should wear plain clothes.

APPENDIX.

Sta&amp;ement by the Secretary for Mines.

SIR HORACE WILSON and I saw the Coalowners&apos; representatives last night at the Mines Department. At the outset, Sir Evan Williams explained the position of the discussions which he and his colleagues have been having with the Miners&apos; representatives, in the course of which agreement had been reached in principle as to an advance of wages. Sir Evan Williams&apos; starting-point was the very greatly improved relations within the industry as compared with the position with which we were all familiar in the past. He said that he and his colleagues had come to the conclusion that it was of the first importance to do nothing to disturb these good relations. Moreover, on the present occasion, instead of presenting the owners with a mandate which had been imposed upon the leaders of the Mineworkers&apos; Federation by the Districts (a technique with which past Governments have been only too familiar), the miners&apos; leaders had entered into negotiations on their own responsibility and were ready, the owners thought, to carry through any settlement that might be arrived at.

It was clear from what Sir Evan Williams said that he and his colleagues had had prominently in mind the disadvantage of starting a wage cycle, and, in particular, that they had come to the conclusion that, at all costs, they must separate this advance from the cost of living as far as that was practicable. They had devised a draft agreement, which carefully refrained from making any reference to the cost of living.

The Coalowners&apos; representatives were all firm in the view that it would be disastrous if the Government were to intervene in the present case. They referred to past interventions by the Government and said that, whereas at present they felt convinced that the pitch of the wages spiral could be kept low if the industry itself were allowed to deal with the wages, bringing in the Government must inevitably raise the pitch of the spiral. They had no doubt that, if they were to refuse some advance or if they were to press for deferment, the present hold which the leaders have upon the Miners would be lost, there would be agitation and, in their view, notices would be tendered with the result that, instead of the owners being able to get away with a modest increase, the Government would perhaps have to concede a greater increase under the threat of a strike. This must destroy the good relations in the industry and it would also loosen the hold which the present reasonable and constitutional leaders had over the Federation and strengthen the position of the wilder district leaders, such as Mr. Horner of South Wales. This would turn out presently to be very expensive. (In the course of the discussion Sir Evan Williams referred to the negotiations in March 1915, when, after Mr. Runciman, then President of the Board of Trade, had acted as arbitrator between the owners and the men at the instance of the Cabinet, the men refused his award and Mr. Lloyd George subsequently met the men and was forced to concede the advance which had been refused by the arbitrator.)

I explained the position of the Government as discussed earlier in the day at the War Cabinet and as settled by the Prime Minister at his meeting in the afternoon; in view, however, of Sir Evan Williams&apos; statement, it was clear that my arguments merely reinforced a position which the owners had already found for themselves. All that remained seemed to be to try and ensure that the settlement was at the lowest possible figure. Sir Horace Wilson explained the position from the Treasury point of view and we then discussed the form which the agreement might take and the form of any subsequent public announcement. Sir Evan Williams and his colleagues thought that they might be able to settle on a basis of 8d. a shift, but they might have to go to 9d. They would not go to a Is.
