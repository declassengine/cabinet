Interrogation of German Airmen Prisoners.

Western Front.

L The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet that, apart from the raids on Scapa Flow, there had been a series of &quot; tip and run &quot; approaches to this country along the whole length of the East Coast, between 11 a.m. and 3-30 p.m. the previous day. Warnings had been given at various places, including Newcastle, Hull, Grimsby, Ipswich and Dover. It was thought that these were probably flights by reconnaissance aircraft looking for the Fleet in the East Coast ports and possibly for convoys. They had approached the coast from a number of different directions, but had crossed in only two places in Norfolk and in Kent. Two enemy aircraft had been shot down over the sea a Heinkel bomber and a Dornier flying-boat. Our own aircraft had suffered no casualties.

The leader of the formation which had attacked Rosyth two days previously had been taken prisoner and had stated that his orders forbade him to attack the Forth Bridge or ships in berth. This might be due to a desire on the part of the Germans to avoid attacking targets likely to involve civilian casualties. An examination of the German aircraft which had been brought down showed that the rear gun was protected with armour, but that there was no armour in front. There was reason to believe that the speed of our Spitfire aircraft had impressed the Germans.

Aircraft belonging to the Field Force had carried out from France a successful reconnaissance the previous day over the Munster-Osnabruck-Bremen area. There was no foundation for the report which had appeared in the Press of a raid on Emden.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the attack on

Situation. Scapa Flow the previous day had had no effect on the fighting power

(Previous 0f the fleet. One man had been killed and twenty-three slightly Reference:       injured in the Iron Duke.

W.M. (39) 50th There was one enemy reconnaissance aircraft over Scapa Flow Conclusions, at that moment and six Skuas were in pursuit, but with their Minute 2.) comparatively low speed he was not hopeful that they would be successful.

The destroyer Boreas had been attacked by enemy aircraft in the Downs. A large number of ships were congregated in the Downs for contraband examination. This was undesirable, but steps were under consideration for remedying the position.

The Juno on its way up the East Coast had been shadowed by aircraft; this vessel had picked up the crew of the Dornier which had been shot down by the Royal Air Force.

While steps had been taken to arm merchant shipping leaving these coasts, there still remained many unarmed ships which had yet to come in. One of these unarmed and unescorted convoys had been attacked by a German submarine the previous day off Cape Finisterre. The Bibby liner Yorkshire (10,000 tons) and the Ellerman liner City of Mandalay (7,000 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk. British and French destroyers had been sent to the aid of this convoy.

The steamship Saigang had been chased by a submarine off Cape Finisterre, and the steamship Imperial Star had been shelled in the same area. Both had escaped. A report received that morning stated that three other ships were being molested.

The First Lord referred to the very great strain which was being imposed on destroyers, and intimated that where we were not able to provide escorts, for lack of numbers, we should have to be prepared to accept losses.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

[20172J

Eire. 3.   The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to a Paper on

Use of ports as   the use of Berehaven (W.P. (39) 93) which he had circulated to naval bases.      his colleagues, prepared by the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. (Previous        The previous day he (the First Lord) had based the need for the Bef erence:       use of Irish ports in part on the need for alternative anchorages w.M. (39) 50th for the Fleet. He had perhaps rather over-stated this part of the Conclusions,     case, since other anchorages were available.   The main argument Minute 3.)       was the need for a port in Southern Ireland for use by ships engaged in protecting our trade far out on the Western Approaches. In particular, the fact that we were using Battleships for escort duties accentuated the need for Berehaven, since under present conditions these Battleships themselves had to be provided with Destroyer escorts to Plymouth and Devonport on approaching the danger areas near our coasts, thereby making the Destroyer situation even more difficult.  He tberefore trusted that the Dominions Secretary would do everything in his power to persuade Mr. de Valera to meet us over the question of Berehaven as soon as possible.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had recalled Sir John Maffey to London in order to discuss the question with him. He (the Secretary of State) felt that the most hopeful line of approach would be to show that we were asking for the use of Berehaven as a base from which to fight the U-boat menace, from which Irish trade would also suffer. It would be of assistance if arguments could be adduced to show that this course was not inconsistent with the attitude of neutrality which Mr. de Valera had adopted.

In discussion it was also suggested that a promising line of approach might be that, without express permission of the Eire Government, we should make use of the facilities of Berehaven periodically, but not continuously. Such an arrangement might not expose Mr. de Valera to strong attack from critics in his own country. Again it might be possible to route our shipping through Irish territorial waters, and to point out to the Government of Eire that they could not protect them even in these waters without our assistance.

The War Cabinet took note&apos;of the above statements, and of the arguments which might be adduced in the negotiations with Mr. de Valera.

4. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence suggested that certain lines of enquiry should be pursued in regard to the attack on H.M.S. Royal Oak.

The discussion on this point is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

It was agreed that the suggestions made should be examined by the Officers now at Scapa who were enquiring into the circumstances of the sinking of the Royal Oak.

Discussion then turned on the measures which should be taken to provide a base for the Fleet on the East Coast secure against air attack. It was felt that, in present circumstances, this had a prior claim on our anti-aircraft resources, since it was essential that the Fleet should be able to operate freely in the North Sea. The War Cabinet agreed 

That a Committee, composed as under, should examine as a matter of urgency the arrangements to be made to provide a secure base for the Fleet on the East Coast:  The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, The three Service Ministers, The Minister without Portfolio, The three Chiefs of Staff.

5. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that the Germans were apparently carrying out operations to clear the French out of German territory in front of the Siegfried Line. In the attack on the previous day the French claimed that the Germans had suffered 1,000 casualties and lost 20 tanks. The French had suffered practically no casualties, since they had abandoned their advanced positions before the attack.

There were many rumours from neutral sources of an impending major offensive. According to one source, Hitler on the 9th October had given orders for a &quot; pincer &quot; attack through Switzerland and Holland to be kept in readiness. General Gamelin thought that such an attack was possible up to the 10th November, but our own General Staff took the view that it was already too late. These rumours might be deliberately circulated by the Germans.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a report had been received in the Foreign Office from our Minister at The Hague of a conversation which he had had with the Netherlands Foreign Minister. The latter had thought a German attack through Holland to be most unlikely. In any case, the Dutch Government expected to receive at least 3 to 5 days&apos; warning of such an attack. At the present time they were not in any way apprehensive.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that there were now 27 German Divisions south of the Rhine opposite Holland, in the Essen-Dusseldorf area. This was a formidable concentration of troops. There were, in addition, 13 Divisions opposite Belgium and Luxemburg, but only 30 opposite the Maginot Line west of the Rhine.

The Minister without Portfolio informed the War Cabinet that considerable progress had already been made with the arrangements proposed to deal with the contingency of a German attack through the Low Countries.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

German report of British supply of Gas to Poland.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 49th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

6. The Secretary of State for War said that the Foreign Office had ascertained (telegram 136 from Berne) that Professor Staehelin was a leading Swiss physician who was believed to be pro-Ally in sympathy. He had reported that the German soldier in question did die of gas poisoning, but he had declined to commit himself to saying of what type.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Possible Use by 7. In continuation of the discussion on the previous item, the Germans of the Secretary of State for War said that, bearing in mind the an Unexpected contents of Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s letter to the Swedish Government Form of Poison on the subject of retaliation by the Germans in certain contingen-Gas. cies, it seemed clear that the Germans would not hesitate to use gas

(Previous        if they thought it would be to their advantage.   It had now been Reference:       ascertained that the German respirator, in addition to giving W.M. (39) 46th protection against a heavy concentration of arsenical smoke, also Conclusions,      protected against arsene gases.   The French and ourselves had Minute 10.)      failed in all experiments for the projection of this type of gas, but it was possible that the Germans had been more successful. An additional protective device for incorporation in our respirators had been produced, and delivery would begin on the 25th October. Detector papers to show up the presence of this gas had already been despatched to France.   Our own research establishment at Porton was in close touch with the French on this question. The Treasury had sanctioned the provision of the additional protection [20172] b 3


424

to 400,000 Service respirators which would suffice for the Expeditionary Force, but if there was any possibility of the Germans using this gas, the question would arise of giving the necessary protection to the whole of the Defence Services, and also to the civilian population.

The Minister for Home Security pointed out that arsene gas was very readily decomposed by explosion, but that it might possibly be put over by some form of projector which did not involve the use of a bursting charge. The civilian respirator could not be adapted to give protection against it, and would have to be completely re-designed.

The War Cabinet took note that the three Service Departments and the Ministry of Home Security were actively engaged, in collaboration, in examining the measures necessary to combat the possible use of arsene gas.

Turkey.

The Turco-Soviet Conversations and the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 50th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 616 dated the 17th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, regarding the breakdown of negotiations in Moscow in regard to the proposed Turco-Soviet Pact.   The substance of this telegram was as follows: 

The breakdown had occurred in regard to the two points which had been originally raised by M. Stalin on the 1st October, and then withdrawn. Later they had been raised again by M. Molotov, who had agreed to withdraw them, subject to the approval of M. Stalin. At the last interview M. Stalin had renewed these demands, which had been rejected by M. Sarajoglu.  The demands in question were : 

(i) The redrafting of the Suspense Clause to cover the case

of the U.S.S.R. and Germany;

(ii) The Soviet demand that Turkey should now, under

Article 22 of the Montreux Convention, deny passage through the Straits to warships and transports belonging to non-Black Sea Powers.

The Turkish Government were now anxious to sign the Anglo-Turkish Treaty as soon as possible in the form in which it had been initialled, subject to necessary minor alterations. They hoped that the signature would be possible on the 19th October, 1939. They attached the greatest importance to the maintenance of secrecy about signature, until M. Sarajoglu had safely left Soviet territory.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was satisfactory that the Turkish Government had stood so staunchly by their undertakings to us, but the fact that they had had to break with the U.S.S.R. put an end, at present at least, to our hopes of building, through Turkey, a bridge between the Government of the U.S.S.R. and ourselves. The breakdown suggested the possibility that some secret arrangement might exist between the U.S.S.R. and Germany in regard to the Balkans. If this were the case, the arrangement must be sufficiently favourable to the U.S.S.R. to have convinced M. Stalin that he could safely dispense with close relations with Turkey. The prospect was, therefore, black for Roumahia, and might lead to unfavourable reactions-on the question of Roumanian oil supplies. These considerations reinforced the conclusion that we should do well to establish close relations with Italy and with her help to establish a neutral Balkan block.

As regards the Anglo-Turkish Treaty, he (the Secretary of State) had sent a telegram No. 534, dated the 17th October, 1939, to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, stating that he assumed that


280

425 W.M. 51 (39).

the alterations proposed to be made in the text as initialled, were those referred to in his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) telegram No. 491 of the 6th October, 1939, and that there was now no question of making Article 3 consultative, or of changing the Protocol as regards the U.S.S.R.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Roumanian Oil 9.   Arising out of the discussion recorded in Minute 8 above,

Exports. the Minister without Portfolio said that considerable difficulties

(Previous were arising in the exercise of contraband control on oil exported Reference: from Roumania to European countries and, in particular, oil W.M. (39) 22nd exported to Italy through the free port of Trieste. Our control in Conclusions, this matter would be greatly aided if the Turkish Government were Minute 6.) prepared to grant us assistance, e.g., permission for us to use a Turkish port.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thought that once the Anglo-Turkish Treaty had been signed, the Turkish Government might be prepared to assist in this matter.

The First Sea Lord said that the plan at present was to exercise contraband control by means of an accommodation ship anchored outside the three-mile limit at the western end of the Dardanelles. This plan would not be easy to operate, but it was practicable.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

W.M. (39) 47th in the margin.

Minute8^8&apos; Tile War Cabinet agreed ; 

That in view of the fact that the form of the record of the War Cabinet&apos;s decision on Air Policy might not be altogether appropriate for communication to the French Government, the Committee of Ministers, the appointment of which is recorded in Minute 4 above, should examine the record and agree upon the form in which the War Cabinet&apos;s decision in this matter should be communicated to the French Government.

Wages in the 12.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the

Coal Mining Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G.) (39) 39) setting out the con-Industry, elusions of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy on the

action to be taken in regard to a proposed increase of wages in the

Mining Industry.


426

The- Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that at a meeting between the Mining Association and the Mine-workers&apos; Federation, summoned for the discussion of methods of increasing the production of coal, the question of an increase in wages had been unexpectedly raised. The employers&apos; representatives had proceeded, without any consultation with the Government Departments concerned, to offer an immediate increase of wages, to be related to some extent to the rise in the cost of living and on the understanding that they would be able to recover the cost by an increase in the price of coal. This, in effect, threw the onus of the decision on the Government, as the price of coal had to be approved by them. The Economic Policy Committee had considered the matter very carefully and had reached the conclusion set out in the Paper quoted above, namely, that an increase of Qd. per shift would be reasonable, but that great care would have to be taken in the way in which any increase were granted. An increase of Qd. per shift would result in an increase of about Qd. per ton in the pit-head price of coal, over and above the increase which would be necessary on other grounds. The question for decision was whether the Government should make such an increase possible, or should refuse to do so at the risk of a miners&apos; strike.

The Minister for Mines said that the owners were very emphatic that good relations with the men were an essential condition of increased production. They thought it was better to agree quickly and ungrudgingly to a wage increase, rather than to grant it after a long period of dissatisfaction and consequent poor production. They also wished to strengthen the position of the present leaders of the Mine-workers&apos; Federation, who were being subjected to a good deal of pressure on this matter from the districts, for fear of their being supplanted by leaders of a more violent type. Both sides realised the dangers of starting the &quot; spiral&quot; of increasing wages and costs.

The Minister of Labour said that, if the wages in question were in a field for which he were responsible, he would have advised that every effort should be made to avoid the Government being drawn in as a party to the dispute. He would regret any decision that wages should be directly related to the cost-of-living index figure, or that a rise in wages should be granted to be conditional upon an increase in the price of coal. He urged that wages should be determined as between the employers and workers, on the basis of the normal ascertainments by which they had hitherto been determined. He did not think that it would be possible to take the line that all claims for increases in wages should be resisted in wartime; the wages in some industries for example, in the textile industry had been before the war at a level which could not be justified. In the Munitions Industry both sides had agreed on the policy to be adopted by way of dilution, &amp;c, for securing an increase in production, and he did not anticipate that there would be any need for special appeals or interference by the Government.

The IjOrd Privy Seal said that he could not help being influenced by the view that almost anything would be better than a battle between the Government and a strong Trade Union such as the Mine-workers&apos; Federation. If an increase in wages had to be conceded, it should be possible to prevent its becoming a dangerous precedent by linking it closely with a bargain for securing a large increase in production.

On the other hand, it was strongly urged by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War that the miners&apos; claim should be resisted. The serious risk of starting an inflationary spiral was stressed. It was essential to exercise a strong control from the outset over wage movements, if this process was to be avoided.  The mining employers had behaved in a most


28

427 W.M. 51 (39).

reprehensible manner in reaching an agreement of this kind without any consultation with the Government. Further, while this agreement might suit the two sides in the coal industry, it was calculated to make it more difficult for us to win the war. It was suggested that the Mining Association might be informed that, while the Government would not raise objection to a certain increase in wages, they could not undertake that the price of coal should be increased correspondingly; some part of the increase might have to be paid for by the employers.

The Secretary of State for War said that, if an increase in wages were associated with increased production, it would have unfortunate repercussions in other directions, since it would establish the principle that an increase in remuneration was necessary to secure the maximum effort in the national cause.

The suggestion was made that the Prime Minister should see representatives of the employers and of the miners in order to explain the position to them; but no decision was reached on this suggestion.

The Secretary for Mines said that he had been intending to see the owners&apos; representatives that evening and that the owners and workers were proposing to meet on the afternoon of the following day.

In view of the complexity of the problem, the War Cabinet did not attempt to reach a decision, but-invited the Prime Minister to go into the question further that afternoon with the Ministers concerned, it being understood that the Secretary for Mines would, if necessary, arrange for the postponement of the meetings referred to above.
