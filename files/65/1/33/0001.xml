W.M. 33 (39).

The Air 1.   The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff reported that 5 Battles

Situation.        carrying out reconnaissance in the Rheims area had been attacked (Previous        by 15 Messerschmidt Fighters at 22,000 feet.   Four out of the Reference:       5 Battles had been shot down, but one German fighter was known, W.M. (39) 32nd and a second believed, to have been destroyed.   It was understood Conclusions,      that the majority of the crews of our aircraft had escaped in their Minute l.)       parachutes.   Two Hudsons had been lost in a reconnaissance over Sylt the previous day.   The Germans   admitted the loss of 2 fighters in the action over the Heligoland Bight on the 29th, when we had lost 5 Hampdens.   The French claimed to have brought down 6 Messerschmidt fighters the previous day.

In discussion, it was brought out that the balance of the losses seemed to be against us. The enemy was apparently lying in wait for our reconnaissances, and it might be necessary to use larger formations and to escort them with fighters, as did the French. Variation of the times and routes of reconnaissances was, of course, essential.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, if nothing

Operations.       happened by 1 p.m., a whole week would have passed without a (Previous        single attack on any British merchant ship.   German submarines Reference:       were still about, however, and anti-submarine operations were being W.M. (39) 32nd vigorously pursued.  He gave details of some attacks, one of which, Conclusions,      south-east of Plymouth, was most promising.   The Germans had Minute 2.)       now announced in a broadcast that they would begin unrestricted submarine waff are against our shipping, since, as they alleged, our merchantmen were now armed and had fired on their submarines. The allegation was untrue, but the Admiralty had thought it right to send a warning message to all shipping that unrestricted attack should now be anticipated.

No sign had been found of the reported concentration of German vessels in the Southern Atlantic.

Mention was made of a German submarine reported to have been seen in Donegal Bay, and it was suggested that the attention of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should be drawn to this report, and that, if it were substantiated, it should be added to the list of breaches of Eire neutrality which he was preparing.

The War Cabinet 

(1) took note of the above statement;

(2) agreed to invite the attention of the Secretary of State for

Dominion Affairs to the report of a German submarine in Donegal Bay with a view to the suggested action, as 0j&amp;a recorded above, being taken.

The Military 3.   The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that

Situation. there had been considerable movement on the railways in the area

(Previous        between Frankfurt and Koblenz.   The air defences in that area Reference:       seemed to have been strengthened and three new aerodromes had W.M. (39) 32nd been opened up.   There was also some road movement southward Conclusions,      from Aachen.   The indications were that a concentration was Minute 3.)       beginning opposite  the Maginot Line.    This would support General Gamelin&apos;s theory that an attack on the Maginot Line was probable, although it might well be that the reason for this concentration was fear of a French attack.

The Secretary of State for War thought that the Germans might intentionally be spreading reports of troop movements from east to west. News to this effect had been broadcast from Moscow the previous day.

The War Cabinet took bote of the above statements.

British Air 4.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to Paris

Strength in telegram No. 354, in which Sir Eric Phipps had stated that France. M. Daladier was anxious that more British bombers and fighters

(Previous        should be sent to France.

WMFeif39i 29th ^ was P inte&lt;^ out  y t^ie Deputy Chief of the Air Staff that Con i si General Gamelin and M. Daladier were not speaking with the same

Minute 6)&apos;      voice, since it was with the former&apos;s unqualified agreement that

the despatch to France of the Second Contingent of the Advanced

Air Striking Force had been held up.

Arising out of this discussion, the view was expressed that communications on military matters of this kind, which did not involve questions of high policy, ought to be passed through the existing machinery for liaison between the British and French Staffs.

The War Cabinet agreed 

To invite the Service Ministers concerned to ensure that the liaison arrangements between the Allied Staffs and Commanders left nothing to be desired.

Italy. 5.   Sir Orme Sargent said that he did not consider that too

Growth of much importance need be attached to the gloomy views regarding German the growth of German propaganda in Italy, expressed by the

propaganda.      Belgian Ambassador in Rome, reported in telegram No. 982, dated

the 29th September, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome.

Views such as those expressed by the Belgian Ambassador were

widely held in the smaller neutral countries, all of whom favoured

peaceful negotiations with Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

German Allegation of the Sinking of H.M. Aircraft-Carrier

Ark Royal.

6. Arising out of the discussion recorded in Minute 5 above, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that, as regards the German allegation that His Majesty&apos;s Aircraft-Carrier Ark Royal had been sunk, the position was as follows : 

(i) The United States Naval Attache&quot; was with the Fleet, and had thus seen H.M.S. Ark Royal since the date on which it was alleged by the Germans that she had been sunk.

(ii) Full particulars regarding the recent air attack on the Fleet had been sent by the Admiralty to our Naval Attache in Rome for the confidential information of the Chief of the Italian Naval Staff.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

W.M. 33 (39).

Staff Conversa- 7. Sir Orme Sargent drew attention to telegram No. Ill, tions with which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had the previous Belgium. day (the 30th September,  1939) addressed to His Majesty&apos;s

(Previous        Ambassador, Brussels : 

Reference: (i) expressing the hope that it might be possible for him to

W.M. (39).32nd obtain facilities for the Military Attache&quot; to visit the

Conclusions, Belgian defences on the Belgian-Netherlands frontier,

Minute 11.) as suggested in a conversation with M. Spaak;

(ii) authorising him, at his discretion, to return to the idea put forward in the course of a recent discussion between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. van Zeeland, that it might be possible to find some means of achieving at any rate part of our object through unofficial contacts by the employment of a discreet civil intermediary to represent the views of our Staff to a similar individual in Belgium, who would in turn pass these views on to the Belgian Staff.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey. 8.   Sir Orme Sargent drew attention to telegram No. 455

Leakage of which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had the previous information day (the 30th September, 1939) addressed to His Majesty&apos;s regarding the Ambassador, Ankara, in regard to the leakage of information which conclusion of the had occurred in Ankara regarding the conclusion of the Anglo-Anglo-Turkish Turkish Treaty. In this telegram the Secretary of State had Treaty. informed the Ambassador 

(Previous (i) that, while he appreciated why the Turkish Government

Beferenee: .had permitted the leakage of information regarding the

W.M. (39) 32nd provisions in the secret Second Protocol, by which

Conclusions, Turkey would be relieved from her obligations under the

Minute 13.) Treaty if the U.S.S.R. were involved in war against us,

he regarded this leakage as most unfortunate, and that in the circumstances he felt that the only course might well be to publish this Protocol as an integral part of the Treaty;

(ii) that every effort should be made to ensure the non-publication of the exchange of letters; (iii) that the publication of both the Military Convention and the Financial Agreement should be opposed so far as possible.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Anglo-Soviet Trade

Negotiations.

Position of British Ships at Archangel and Murmansk. (Previous Bef erence: W.M. (39) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 15.)

9. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was increasingly^ anxious regarding the position of the British ships at Archangel and Murmansk and their crews. From the latest report it appeared that, while these ships were not as yet formally detained by the Soviet authorities, it was the intention of those authorities not to permit them to sail until payment had been made by the British importers either in United States dollars or in Swedish kroner, and also until certain machinery now in this country had been delivered.

Sir Orme Sargent agreed that the position was serious, and referred to telegram No. 340, dated the 29th September, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, stating that he had entirely failed in his efforts to communicate with the ships in question, and that he considered that the Soviet obstruction in this matter was highly suspicious. He (Sir Orme Sargent) had no information regarding the progress of the negotiations in this matter now being undertaken by the Minister of Supply.


266

The War Cabinet agreed 

That, in view of the urgent need for securing assurances that neither the British ships at Archangel and Murmansk nor their crews should be interfered with, arrangements should be made for the War Cabinet to be informed at the meeting to be held the following day (Monday, the 2nd October, 1939) of the stage reached by the Minister of Supply in his negotiations with the Soviet Trade Commissioner in connection with the proposed exchange of rubber and tin for Soviet timber.
