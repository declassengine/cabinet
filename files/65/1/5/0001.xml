W.M. 5 (39).

Gold held by 1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the Bank of

the Bank of England, as an institution holding gold on behalf of the Bank of England on International Settlements, had received an order to convert 106 bars-Bank of Inter- Gf the gold so held into dollars to be available in New York to the national Settle- order of the Bank of International Settlements. In accordance ments Account, vvith the normal banking practice, the Bank of England were not informed by the Bank of International Settlements, on whose account this order was made, and it might, therefore, be on enemy account. Immunity of the property of the Bank of International Settlements, both in time of war and in time of peace, was most rigorously protected by special international treaty. The legal position was not altogether clear, but it appeared likely that the British Municipal law (the Trading with the Enemy Act) might be in conflict with this international treaty. It was extremely likely that if the Bank of England were forbidden by His Majesty&apos;s Government to carry out this order, protests would be received from Governments of neutral countries on the ground that the immunities guaranteed to the Bank of International Settlements by treaty had been directly infringed. It had been agreed that the Bank of England should not act in this matter save by permission of the Treasury. The question for the War Cabinet to decide was whether, and, if so, under what conditions, the order now received should be carried out.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that the Treasury should inform the Bank of England that,

as a temporary measure, His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided that no order received by the Bank of England from the Bank of International Settlements for the transfer or sale abroad of gold or other assets held in the United Kingdom on Bank of International Settlements account was to be complied with, until the Bank of England had satisfied the Treasury that the order in question was not likely to benefit the enemy :

(b) that if the Government of any neutral country were to

protest against the decision in (a) above, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the Representative of the Government concerned :

(i) that our action was a temporary step, pending

enquiries :

(ii) that if we were satisfied that the order was on

account of the neutral Government concerned, we should agree to allow the order to be carried out.

Turkey.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 3rd Conclusions, Minute 8.)

2. The War Cabinet gave further consideration to the means of obtaining the proposed political treaty with Turkey at the earliest possible moment. There was general agreement that the need for such a treaty was becoming still more urgent by reason of the growing deterioration of the situation in Poland. Hitherto the main difficulty had been the demand of the Turkish Government for a gold loan of  15 millions, and it was still believed that the British refusal to agree to a loan of this magnitude was the principal reason why definite agreement had not been reached with the Turkish Government. The position had been slightly eased the previous day (the 5th September, 1939), when an undertaking had been secured from the French Government that they would provide part of the proposed gold loan.

The present position was that the Turkish Government had promised to submit fresh comprehensive proposals; and a telegram had been sent by the Foreign Office to the British Ambassador at Ankara expressing the hope that these would be furnished by the Turkish Government as soon as possible.

[19970] b 2

It was not possible altogether to rule out the possibility that the Turkish Government were merely playing for time, and were not prepared to sign any treaty, no matter what the financial inducement offered, until the general political situation had become clearer.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that immediately after the meeting, the Secretary of State

for Foreign Affairs should prepare a telegram for despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, stating that, in view of the general political situation, the War Cabinet was feeling a growing anxiety at the delay in concluding the proposed political treaty with Turkey; that the War Cabinet were of the opinion that the situation was not changing to the advantage of Great Britain, and that it was,, therefore, of the utmost importance that the Ambassador should take every step in nis power to ensure that the treaty should be signed at the earliest possible moment; that for this purpose the War Cabinet authorised him to agree to the financial proposals already submitted by the Turkish Government, including an undertaking that His Majesty&apos;s Government would furnish a gold loan, if necessary, up to the sum of  15 millions (the amount asked for by the Turkish Government) though it was hoped that it would be possible to secure agreement at a lower figure :

(b) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, after agree-

ing with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the terms of the draft telegram referred to in (a) above, should despatch it to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, as early as possible in the course of the same afternoon :

(c) to defer for later consideration, if found desirable, the ques-

tion whether it would be of advantage to despatch Field-Marshal Lord Birdwood to Ankara to assist His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in his discussions with the Turkish Government.

The Position of        3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he

Turkey in Rela- proposed shortly to circulate a Memorandum discussing the position

tion to the of Turkey in relation to the Straits Passage. Straits Passage. The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Possibility 4. The Secret^ of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he of Establishing proposed shortly to circulate to the War Cabinet a Memorandum Communications discussing the possibility of establishing communications with with Poland Poland through Roumania. From the indications which he had through new received, it appeared that the difficulties involved were even

Roumania.       more serious than he had anticipated.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Italy. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the

Commercial discussion at the Meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin

Contacts. regarding the possibility of establishing commercial contacts with

(Previous Italy.   The Secretary of State strongly favoured the establishment

Reference: of such contacts, which would, he believed, be of great value when

W.M. (39), 4th the time came to consider the application of the British blockade

Conclusions, to Italian sea-borne trade.   The method which he favoured was that

Minute 3.) His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, should be instructed in the first instance to make an unofficial approach to Count Ciano, and that


31

W.M. S (39).

this approach should be made without the French Ambassador, though the latter should be kept informed. If the suggested approach were well received, it might, he hoped, be possible at a later stage to suggest the despatch of a British Commercial Mission to Rome.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should pre-

pare a telegram for despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, informing him : 

(i) that the practicability of establishing commercial

contacts with Italy through the export of coal from the United Kingdom in exchange for war material, &amp;c., was being examined as a matter of urgency by the Departments concerned;

(ii) that, if the result of this examination were to show

that the proposal was practicable, instructions would be sent to him to make an unofficial approach to Count Ciano on the subject, without the French Ambassador, who should, however, be kept informed; but that pending the receipt of such instructions no approach should be made to the Italian Government;

(b) that the Prime Minister should be given an opportunity of

seeing the draft proposed, before the telegram was actually despatched.

Air Operations.

(Previous Eef erence: W.M. (39), 3rd Conclusions, Minute 8.)

6. The Secretary of State for Air explained the reasons why an air raid warning had been issued in the early morning of 6th September.

The question of a communique was discussed. It was agreed not to issue one at the moment, but that the Secretary of State should have discretion to issue one later if necessary.

Naval 7.   The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that five

Operations. merchant ships, four British and one French, had been sunk by sub-previous        marine the previous day.

Eef erence: There was reason to believe that the position from our point of

W.M. (39), 3rd view was probably now at its worst, and would improve. Conclusions, Rigorous steps were being taken to ensure that merchant ship

Minute 9.)       captains obeyed the instructions given them. Sinking of two ^wo German merchant ships had been sunk by H.M.S. A jaoc on

German *&quot;ne Previ us day.   The sinking had been in accordance with the

Merchant Ships ru^es  $ warfare, but it was not clear why H.M.S. Ajax had been unable to find prize crews and to take the ships into port. The Admiralty would take steps to ensure that wherever possible enemy merchant ships were captured and not sunk.

Army Operations.

Poland. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 3rd Conclusions, Minute 10.)

8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave an account of the situation in Poland, which had deteriorated very rapidly. Information was very meagre, but the Polish Army still appeared to be intact.


32

Ministry of Information.

Responsibility for Issue of Communiques.

9. Discussion took place arising out of a notice which had been issued the previous day at the instance of the Admiralty in connection with the sinking by H.M.S. A jax of two German merchant ships.

The Minister of Information said that, in view of the attitude taken by the Admiralty, he had felt obliged to issue the notice in the form prepared by the Admiralty, although it had appeared to him that the presentation of the facts was not altogether happy. He asked for a definition of his responsibilities in regard to the issue of information received from the Service Departments.

Some discussion took place as to whether it would be advisable to issue a further communique&apos; stating the full facts in connection with the sinking of these two German ships by-H.M.S. Ajax, and explaining that the action taken was in accordance with international law. It was agreed to leave this matter to the discretion of the Minister of Information.

After further discussion the War Cabinet agreed: 

(1) that it was within the competence of the Service Depart-

ments to say that certain information was of a secret nature and should not therefore be published;

(2) that the Minister of Information should also have discretion,

if he thought fit, to decide that certain information should not be published notwithstanding that the Defence Departments saw no objection to its publication;

(3) that responsibility for deciding the manner in which

information should be published rested with the Minister of Information;

(4) that, wherever possible, the Department concerned should

be given an opportunity for final scrutiny of matter prepared for publication by the Ministry of Information;

(5) to invite the First Lord of the Admiralty to submit to the

War Cabinet a Paper setting out his proposals in regard to the question whether information as to our shipping losses, and the losses inflicted on the enemy, should or should not be published, and that in the meantime no information as to sinkings should be published.

Evacuation of 10.   The War Cabinet were informed that at a meeting held

Government earlier in the morning the Chiefs of Staff had considered the question Departments. of the evacuation of Government Departments. The Chiefs of Staff were now definitely of the opinion/ from a military point of view, that immediate steps shouULbe taken to evacuate from London the whole of the &quot; non-essential \ staffs, e.g., the Ministry of Supply and the Supply Departments of the Admiralty and Air Ministry. Most of the big business houses, banks, insurance companies, &amp;c, had already left, and it was unreasonable that the whole Government machine should remain in London. Even if serious casualties should not occur, those who stayed in London would suffer&quot; lowered morale and output.

The present position was that accommodation had been earmarked in the country for the Government staffs now in London, and the owners of the property had been warned, but that the accommodation had not been requisitioned. Ought not requisitioning to be put in hand at once ? The move might have to be carried out at very short notice, and requisitioning at the present stage might mean the saving of as much as seven days when the decision was taken.

The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that he had this matter under constant review, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned. They had not as yet thought it necessary


ft

33 W.M. 5 (39).

to recommend any immediate action. In his own judgment it would be difficult to hold the position, as regards the continued retention of other Departments in London, when once the evacuation of the Supply Departments had been ordered.

A general move from London would undoubtedly result in loss of efficiency.

He agreed, however, that this was a question in which military considerations must be paramount. He proposed to call at once a meeting of the Treasury Committee which had reviewed this matter in the past and to instruct them to examine immediately all the repercussions of the advice given by the Chiefs of Staff. The right decision might be to move the whole Government machine from London, and not merely the Supply Department.

As regards the preparation and furnishing of the accommodation which had been earmarked in the country, he understood that this could be completed in from seven to ten days from the moment that the order was given. The installation of telephones could be completed in a much shorter time, since the main telephone cables had already been laid up to the buildings in question.

The War Cabinet 

(1) instructed the Official Committee to meet that afternoon and

review the matter as one of great urgency;

(2) agreed to consider this matter further at a Meeting to be

held at 6 p.m. that afternoon.

Adjournment of the House of Commons.

Ministerial Statement.

11. The War Cabinet were informed that a promise had been given to the Leader of the Labour Opposition that a statement on the situation would be made on behalf of the Government before the House of Commons adjourned on the following day.

It was agreed that this matter also should be considered at the Meeting to be held at 6 p.m. that evening. The Service Ministers and the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security were invited to prepare passages suitable for inclusion in the statement.
