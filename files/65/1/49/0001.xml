The Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 48th Conclusions, Minute 1.) Dropping of leaflets

containing the British reply to Herr Hitler&apos;s Speech. (Previous Bef erence: W.M. (39) 46th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

French Aircraft Production.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) Conclusions Minute 2.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that a number of-aircraft had set out on the previous night to drop pamphlets containing the Prime Minister&apos;s statement. Owing to the bad weather, however, all except two, one from England and one from France, had had to turn back. The aircraft from England had carried out a successful flight over Berlin and returned safely. There was, however, no news of the other aircraft. News that the leaflets had been dropped had already appeared in the foreign Press, and he therefore proposed to publish the fact that the raid had taken place.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

2.   The Prime Minister asked whether there was any confirma-

tion of the statement put out by the French Propaganda Ministry that French aircraft output was now five times what it had been in August; and that the British and French output together was three 4tn   times that of Germany.

The Secretary of State for Air said that the statement considerably over-estimated the position. He was seeing the French Air Minister in the near future, when he would no doubt obtain the latest figures.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 48th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

Number of Submarines sunk. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 47th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave certain further particulars as to the sinking of the Royal Oak. These are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The attack by a German submarine on the fast unescorted convoy, which had been reported at the previous meeting, had resulted in the loss of one French ship in addition to the one reported at the previous meeting, i.e., one British and two French ships in all. There were now only two more unescorted groups of ships to come in.

No further attacks had been made on British ships in the previous twenty-four hours, but one French ship had been sunk.

The* First Lord emphasised the acute shortage of Destroyers. A number of steps were being taken to alleviate the situation, but the strain was very heavy. It would be a great help if we could obtain the use of Berehaven.

It now appeared that we had sunk four submarines on the 13th October, and not three, as reported at the meeting referred to in the margin. Since then there had been two more probable successes.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

[20161]

Purchase of

Chilean

Destroyers.

(Previous Ref erence: W.M. (39) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 8.)

4. During the discussion on the previous item, the Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs asked whether the Admiralty had given any further consideration to the possibility of purchasing Chilean destroyers.

The Chief of Naval Staff said that, in the Admiralty view, while Chile  might be prepared to violate her neutrality in our favour, this might prove to be a most undesirable precedent, as it might result in Germany&apos;s obtaining submarines from Russia.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 39th Conclusions, Minute 2.) (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 48th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

5. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that the steamer Marwarri containing anti-aircraft guns and equipment, which had been damaged by a mine, had now been docked and the equipment was being taken off.

He gave particulars of additional troops which had crossed to France the previous day.

On the Western Front 4 more German Divisions had been identified on the frontier between Holland and Saarbrucken, the total number now being estimated at between 62 and 87. The French had issued a warning on Sunday that they expected a German attack on Monday, but this attack had not taken place yet.

The War Cabinet was informed that at the present time there were probably very few French troops in the advanced positions in front of the Maginot Line. It was General Gamelin&apos;s intention to fight on the Maginot Line itself.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval, Military and Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 40th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

Propaganda regarding the number of British troops in France. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 31st Conclusions, Minute 5.)

6. The War Cabinet took note of the Weekly Resume (No. 6) by the Chiefs of Staff (Paper W.P. (39) 88).

7. In the course of the discussion on Minute 5 the Secretary of State for War referred to telegram No. 789 (Saving) of the 13th October from our Ambassador in Paris, in which it was reported that unfavourable comparisons were being made in France between the size of our Expeditionary Force (158,000 men) and the total of the French Army (3-| million men). In the broadcast which he intended to make on the 21st October he proposed to point out that the British Expeditionary Force was at present an advance guard only.

In the course of the discussion which followed it was suggested that it would be desirable to emphasise in the broadcast that the force we had already despatched was more than we had actually promised to the French. While it was undesirable to mention the figure of 55 Divisions, on which our present plans were based, it would be desirable to repeat the statement already made that the 32 Divisions on which our pre-war plans were based did not represent the limit of our present effort. In order to make this information more vivid to the French public, it would probably be better to quote the actual numbers of men rather than the numbers of Divisions.

The War Cabinet agreed 

To invite the Secretary of State for War to frame his proposed broadcast on the lines suggested above.


403

W.M. 49 (39)

German report 8. The Minister without Portfolio drew attention to the fact of British that German broadcasts still contained false reports that the Polish supply of gas to Army had used gas which had been supplied by the British. They Poland. stated that evidence of the use of gas had been provided by the

(Previous        investigations of a Swiss, Professor Staehelin.  He suggested that Reference:       the Foreign Office should confirm the existence of this person. v\ .M. (39) 48th        Xhe general view expressed in the discussion was that it was Conclusions,      most important to counter this propaganda of the Germans, and Minute 5.)       to point out that statements of this kind were an invariable prelude to some act of bestiality on the part of the enemy.  We should call the attention of the world to this fact.   It would probably not be worth while trying to get a neutral observer to investigate the accusations, since such investigation, though it might establish the fact that casualties had been caused by gas, could not prove who had supplied or administered the gas.   It was quite possible that the Germans had produced artificial gas casualties for their own purposes.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(i) to invite the Foreign Secretary, as a matter of urgency, to make enquiries regarding the Professor Staehelin referred to in the German broadcasts; (ii) to invite the War Office, in consultation with the Ministry of Information, to arrange for the issue of statements stating in unmistakable language the deduction to be drawn from the persistent false German reports of the use of gas by the Allies, namely, that they intended to use this weapon themselves.

Turkey.

The Turco-Soviet Conversations and the Anglo-Franco-Turkish treaty. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 48th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to the following telegrams relating to the conversations in Moscow between M. Sarajoglu, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, and M. Molotov on the subject of the proposed Turco-Soviet pact: 

Telegram No. 607, dated the 14th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, reporting that it had been agreed to accept the modification of Article 3 in the Anglo-Turkish Treaty desired by M. Stalin, and that the proposal regarding the Protocol by Russia had been submitted by M. Molotov to M. Stalin for approval. Two additional points had been raised by M. Molotov, but on these M. Sarajoglu had been adamant;

Telegram No. 608, dated the 14th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, reporting that M. Sarajoglu had been pressed by M. Molotov to agree that Turkey should declare neutrality vis-a-vis Bulgaria, a course which would involve the cancellation of the relative obligations in the Balkan pact. It was not thought that this proposal would be followed up, and M. Sarajoglu had remarked upon the apparent desire of the Government of the U.S.S.R. to be friendly, from which he deduced that in present circumstances they felt to a certain degree increasingly dependent upon Turkey.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he now anticipated that agreement would shortly be reached between Turkey and the U.S.S.R. There were two points in Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen&apos;s telegram No. 607, referred to above, to which he (the Secretary of State) desired to draw the attention of the War Cabinet: 

(i) In paragraph 4 (a) of that telegram M. Molotov was reported as having stated to M. Sarajoglu that the German Government had pressed for the inclusion of [20161] B 3


404

a Suspensive Clause as between the U.S.S.R. and Germany on the same lines as those between Turkey and the U.S.S.R. and Turkey and ourselves, i.e., a clause providing against hostilities between the U.S.S.R. and Germany in corresponding circumstances.

It appeared from this statement as though the Government of the U.S.S.R. did not exclude in all circumstances the possibility of war between the U.S.S.R. and Germany, (ii) In paragraph 7 Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen reported having pointed out to the Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Office that one of the conditions on which we had agreed to the modifications to the Anglo-Turkish Treaty desired by M. Stalin was that we should see the Turco-Soviet Pact before it was signed.

His (the Secretary of State&apos;s) recollection was that we had not done more than make the condition that we should see the text of the Turco-Soviet Pact and associated documents before we actually signed the Anglo-Turkish Treaty.

He (the Secretary of State) was taking steps to clear up both the foregoing points.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Policy of tbe Soviet

Government.

(Previous Beference: W.M. (39) 30th Conclusions, Minute 6.)

10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had arranged to see M. Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador, that afternoon. It was possible that at this meeting he might obtain some further indication of the general attitude of the Government of the U.S.S.R.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Germany. 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

State of public to telegram No. 65, Saving, dated the 11th October, 1939, from His opinion. Majesty&apos;s Minister, Bucharest, reporting a short conversation which

(Previous        he had had with M. Crutescu, the Roumanian Minister in Berlin, Reference:       who had been in Bucharest for a short visit.  M. Crutescu had not W.M. (39) 47th had very much to say beyond the striking fact that he had himself Conclusions,      been present in one of the popular restaurants in Berlin when^the Minute 9.)       music was stopped in order to allow an official announcement to be made by loud speaker of the &apos;&apos; premature &apos;&apos; fall of Warsaw. He had been astonished not to be able to detect the slightest sign of enthusiasm and added that the company had appeared to him to look down at their plates almost with embarrassment. He admitted that the Polish victories had improved morale, but only in the negative sense of relieving the profound gloom and not in creating any sense of optimism whatever.   Sir Reginald Hoare added that, when M. Crutescu had left Bucharest for Berlin six months before, he had been regarded as extravagantly pro-Nazi, whereas now he had not a good word to say for them.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Germany.

Possible development of German policy. (Previous Reference : W.M. (39) 45th Conclusions, Minute 6.)

12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to a telegram just received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Lisbon, reporting that the British Military Attache- had learned from an absolutely reliable source that a notification had been received in Lisbon from German armament firms to the effect that in three or four weeks&apos; time they would be in a position to supply all the armaments required by Portugal. A similar notification had apparently also been sent by German contractors for civil supplies. The significance of this information was obscure. It might imply that the German Government still thought that there was a possibility of an early peace, but this message might on the other hand have been sent merely to reassure the Portuguese, since in other markets also the Germans were at present finding it difficult to give delivery of supplies ordered.

The Secretary of State then gave the War Cabinet certain additional information regarding the possible development of German policy received from the source referred to at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin. Details of this information are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the foregoing statements by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he proposed to present to Parliament two White Papers. The first gave particulars of the information in the possession of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the conditions in German concentration camps. The second contained the text of a lengthy despatch from Sir Nevile Henderson recording the events in Berlin during the fortnight before the outbreak of war. The document relating to the internment camps constituted the most damning indictment of German methods, while Sir Nevile Henderson&apos;s despatch was also of considerable value as showing the development of the situation immediately before the outbreak of war.

The War Cabinet 

Approved the presentation to Parliament of the two White Papers referred to by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

&quot; Stop the 14.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the

War &quot; Home Secretary (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 36) dealing with various

Propaganda. recent manifestations of &quot; Stop the War&quot; propaganda, and discussing the desirability of action being taken under Defence of the Realm Regulation 39 B. It was explained in the Memorandum that prosecutions could not be undertaken under this Regulation in England or Northern Ireland except with the consent of the Attorney-General. In Scotland all prosecutions were subject to the control of the Lord Advocate.

In a statement explanatory of his Memorandum the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that it was necessary to distinguish between (a) publications which attempted to make a reasoned statement against the Government&apos;s policy, and (6) publications of cruder type, which, without reason or argument,

 advocated stopping the war. At the present time he did not think that anti-war propaganda was making any headway. There were some indications that Sir Oswald Mosley was not likely to take action at present which would expose himself to a prosecution. The Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate expressed their general concurrence in the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum. Subject to the views of the War Cabinet, it would be their policy to

Germany.

Publication of two White Papers.

undertake prosecutions very sparingly, unless a case arose in which there was a direct incitement to refrain from co-operation in the war effort. The Attorney-General pointed out that the powers under Regulation 39 B were more extensive than the powers taken by Regulation in the last war.

The general view of the Cabinet was as follows:  (i) Anti-war propaganda had so far been of a comparatively harmless character and had made no headway. Public opinion in the country was practically unanimous in support of the Government&apos;s war policy. In these circumstances, prosecution of the Pacifist elements in the country was likely to do more&apos; harm than good, (ii) On the other hand, measures would have to be taken if the Pacifist elements appeared likely to have any success in spreading a defeatist spirit.

(iii) It  would  be  undesirable  to prosecute  the relatively&apos;

respectable Peace Pledge Union and not the Communist Party. Up to the present, however, the Communist Party, which had just executed a sudden volte-face, had not issued any &quot; Stop the War &quot; leaflets. This was a further argument in favour of not instituting prosecutions for the time being.

(iv) Attention was drawn to the danger of Russian-subsidised

Communist publications, which in the long run might exercise an influence on the British Labour movement..

The Home Secretary said that his Department had this aspect of the matter under constant review, but it was extremely difficult to be sure of the channels through which Russian money reached this country.

The War Cabinet agreed 

That, for the reasons indicated above, it would not be desirable to institute prosecutions in respect of the &quot; Stop the War &apos;&apos; propaganda leaflets already issued, but that the position should continue to be closely Watched.

Change of 15.   The War Cabinet had before them the Conclusions of a

Meeting Place Conference presided over by the Lord Chancellor, and attended by of Parliament. Mr. Speaker, the Attorney-General, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, and the Earl of Lucan, on the question of the change of the meeting place of Parliament, at a time when the Houses stand adjourned, if it should become impossible, owing to enemy action, for the Houses to continue to sit at Westminster (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 33).

The War Cabinet were informed that the Conference had proceeded on the assumptions that it would be impracticable to make arrangements in advance by Act of Parliament, Defence Regulation, or Resolutions of the Houses, and that it would be possible in the emergency for the House to meet in secret session and pass Resolutions adjourning themselves to H.K. The only alternative to the procedure suggested by the Conference would involve Parliamentary debates in advance of the actual emergency, and it would be very difficult for the Government to refuse to disclose in the debates the name of the place to which it was contemplated that the Houses would adjourn.

In the course of a brief discussion the following considerations were urged in favour of the procedure suggested by the Conference: 

(1) It was very desirable that the name of the place designated by the letters H.K. should be kept secret as long as possible, and in any event until after the Houses had adjourned from Westminster.


407 W.M. 49 (39)

(2) It would be represented that it was unwise for Parliament to leave a well-defended area, like London, for an undefended area like H.K.

(3) In order to ensure secrecy we had deliberately abstained from requisitioning the buildings at H.K., and, while sittings of the Houses could no doubt be held there at short notice, it would take some weeks to make the place reasonably convenient for Parliamentary purposes.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(1) To accept the assumptions on which the Conference had based their conclusions, namely : 

(i) that no procedure for effecting the removal of Parliament from Westminster should be laid down in advance, either by Act of Parliament, Defence Regulation or Resolutions of the Houses; (ii) that the contingency that it might be impracticable for the Houses to meet at Westminster in order to adjourn themselves to some other place could be disregarded.

(2) To approve generally the conclusions* set out in paragraph 12 of Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 33, and, in particular, the procedure described in sub-paragraph (/) of that paragraph.

Requisitioning 16.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the

of hotels and     increasing volume of public criticism of the action of the Office school premises, of Works in requisitioning hotels and school premises for Government purposes.   It was suggested that it might be desirable to consider whether some of the school premises might not be released from requisition and handed back for educational use.

It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the position was not nearly as bad as had been represented, that there was considerable exaggeration in certain of the complaints, and that the Government case for requisitioning premises of the kind in question called for more publicity in the Press. At the outbreak of war the position of the First Commissioner of Works had been a difficult one, in that he had had to make preparations on a very extensive scale for provi ding alternative office accommodation for the London Departments if and when evacuated.

The view was expressed that the difficulty in regard to hotels was mainly a question of the amount of compensation to be paid. The prescribed basis of compensation did not take into account goodwill. The case for school premises was quite different. In order to continue, the schools had to obtain alternative accommodation and to incur capital and other expenditure in connection therewith. The difficulties of many of them were aggravated by the parlous financial condition in which they had found themselves during the last few years. The suggestion was made that, in regard to the premises earmarked for the &quot; B &quot; evacuation scheme, it might be found practicable to release school premises from requisition and to hand them back to the school authorities, on condition that those authorities again evacuated them in favour of the Government at very short notice, if and when called upon to do so. gS&apos;il The War Cabinet took note that the whole question of the

requisitioning of school premises would shortly be brought for consideration before the Social Services Sub-Committee of the Home Policy Committee.

Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1, October 16, 1939.

* For convenience of reference a copy of these Conclusions is annexed hereto as an Appendix.

ANNEX.

Summary of Conclusions of a Conference held in the Speaker&apos;s Library, House of Commons, on Monday, October 2, 1939, at 6 p.m.

(a) Apart from the arrangements specified in (6) and (g) below, no procedure

for effecting the removal of Parliament from Westminster should be laid down m advance either by Act of Parliament or by Defence Regulations or by Resolutions of the Houses.

(b) The consent both of the Crown and of the Houses is necessary before the

Houses can constitutionally adjourn to a place other than Westminster.

(c) The contingency that it might be impossible or impracticable for the

Houses to meet at Westminster in order to adjourn themselves to some other place could be disregarded.

(d) The expression &quot;at Westminster&quot;  means the present Parliament

building and its precincts.

(e) The arrangements should accordingly be based on the assumption that

the Houses (being adjourned) will meet once again in the Palace of Westminster or its precincts for the purpose of adjourning themselves to H.K.

(/) The actual procedure should be on the following lines : 

(i) In pursuance presumably of a decision of the War Cabinet a submission would be made to His Majesty by the Prime Minister that Messages under the Royal Sign Manual should be sent to both Houses; the operative part of each Message being to the effect that His Majesty, considering that in present circumstances the House may not be able safely and conveniently to continue to meet at Westminster, is graciously pleased to declare His Consent to the House meeting at * in the event of any adjournment of the

House during the present Session of Parliament, (ii) The Message would be announced in the House of Lords by the Lord Chancellor, and in the House of Commons would be delivered at the Bar of the House by the Prime Minister and read to the House by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker.

(iii) Each House would then send an Address thanking His Majesty

for His Gracious Message.

(iv) Each House would then adopt a Resolution adjourning itself

to H.K. to meet there at an hour and on a date named in the Resolution.

(v) Finally, in order to give notice to the public of the changed

meeting place of Parliament and to place the whole matter on a formal basis, a Royal Proclamation should be issued as soon as it would be convenient for His Majesty in Council to approve the Proclamation.

(g) In the improbable event of the House of Commons refusing in the first

instance to adopt the Resolution in (/) (iv) above, it would be necessary to re-introduce the Resolution.

(h) That copies of these Conclusions in their approved form should be sent

to those present at the Conference and also to the Prime Minister and to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Minister for Home Security, in order that the question may in due course be brought before the War Cabinet.

* Naming the place designated by the letters H.K.
