W.M. 22 (39).

All Operations. 1. The Secretary of State for Air reported that a number of (Previous reconnaissances had been carried out of the road and rail systems Eeference: in Western Germany. Aircraft had carried out two attacks on W.M. (39) 21st submarines. Otherwise there was nothing of particular interest to Conclusions, report.

In reply to an enquiry by the Foreign Secretary, the Chief of the Air Staff said that the Air Ministry were in touch with the Polish authorities, with a view to making use of Polish pilots and mechanics.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements.

Minute 1.

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty observed that, according to a recent telegram, the German Government had told the Swiss Government that, although they wished to continue to observe the rules of war and to confine hostile acts to military objectives, they reserved the right to depart from this policy if the rules were broken by their enemies. In conveying this warning, the Germans had made particular mention of our blockade as an inhumane method of warfare. This sounded like a German manoeuvre to justify an air attack on this country. The next fortnight, while there was a good moon, and before the weather broke up, might be a time of particular danger.

There was a discussion on the distribution of the air defences of Great Britain, and particularly of the strength of the defences covering the main aircraft manufacturing centres, and the naval port of Chatham, about which the First Lord of the Admiralty expressed concern.

The Chief of the Air Staff explained that the relative importance and requirements of the different vulnerable targets in Great Britain had been fully considered and were constantly reviewed. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, had been made fully aware of the importance of protecting the aircraft industry, and his attention would be directed to seeing if some adjustment could be made to give further cover to Chatham.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff emphasised the importance of securing delivery of as many Bofors guns as possible. Forty were awaiting despatch at Gothenberg, but they were held up until the transaction, of which they formed a part, and for which the Ministry of Economic Warfare was responsible, could be completed.

It was agreed that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should investigate this matter, and should take any action that might be called for to expedite matters.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there was also a delay in the delivery of Oerlikon guns from Switzerland.

The War Cabinet: 

(a) Took note of the above statements.

(b) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to make

representations to the Swiss Government about the delivery of Oerlikon guns ordered by the Admiralty.

Air Defence of Great Britain.

Naval 3.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty informed the War Cabinet

Operations. that there had been no sinkings of British ships since Monday,

(Previous and no attacks by enemy submarines had been reported since 6 p.m.

Eeference: on Tuesday. We had carried out four attacks on enemy submarines.

W.M. (39) 2lst The Polish submarine, which had escaped from Estonian waters,

Conclusions, had arrived safely. This was a very courageous performance whicfi

It was pointed out that the Soviet Government had used the escape of this submarine as an excuse for sending warships into Estonian waters, and it looked as though the Soviet Government was using this episode as a pretext for picking a quarrel with Estonia. Notwithstanding this fact, it was felt that it would be better not to publish the news of the arrival of the Polish submarine in British waters immediately.

There was no truth in the reported capture of the Bremen.

The Secretary of State for Air said that two bomber squadrons were now available for anti-submarine duties in the Western Approaches.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military 4.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that Lemberg

Situation in was reported to be in Russian hands. The Poles were still holding Poland. out in Warsaw and to the south of the capital.   Fighting was

(Previous taking place to the northward of the city. It seemed clear that Eeference: the Germans were retiring from certain areas of Poland. According W.M. (39) 2lst to their own account, they were retiring to a pre-arranged line. Conclusions, Germany would, however, have to leave a number, of troops in Minute 3.) Poland to watch the Soviet troops, and it seemed difficult to imagine that the German forces could be disengaged quickly from Poland.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Military 5.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the

Situation in movement of the British Field Force had continued without incident.

Roumania. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had

Attitude to the previous evening seen Count Raczynski, the Polish Ambassador, members of the who had informed him that the Roumanian Government had Polish Govern- interned Marshal Smigly-Rydz on the ground that he was a military ment in officer, but that there was a possibility that they might refrain from

Roumania.       adopting this course in the case of the civilian members of the (Previous        Polish Government.  On the other hand telegram No. 432 dated the Reference:       19th September, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, W.M. (39) 2lst Bucharest, indicated tbat the Roumanian Government, acting at Conclusions,      the virtual dictation of Germany, had decided to intern all the Minute 13.)      members of the Polish Government.   The Polish Ambassador had urged that we should condemn publicly the attitude of the Roumanian Government and also that we should issue a statement that we recognised President Moscicki&apos;s administration as the de jure Government of Poland.   He (the Secretary of State) had informed Count Raczynski that he was in agreement as regards the second of these points, but that the adoption of the first appeared to him to require further consideration in the light of the general situation.   He (the Secretary of State) had given instructions late the previous evening that a telegram should be addressed to Sir Reginald Hoare restraining him from exerting extreme pressure on the Roumanian Government, but instructing him at the same time to make it perfectly clear to that Government how strongly we disapproved of their attitude towards the members of the Polish Government.

In the course of the subsequent discussion, stress was laid on the following considerations :  

(i) A deplorable impression would be made on public opinion both, here and in the United States and elsewhere when it became known that the action of the Roumanian Government had been taken at the dictation of Germany.

(ii) The   attitude   of   the   Roumanian   Government was

particularly deplorable in view of the fact that we had guaranteed her against German aggression. Against this, it must, however, be remembered that our guarantee was purely unilateral, and that in consequence the Roumanian Government might not regard us as entitled to bring such pressure to bear on them as might risk their country being invaded.

(iii) Although there was no longer any free Polish territory, it

was important that a Polish Government should remain in existence in order to organise the employment of Polish resources against Germany. These resources included a large sum in gold, certain naval units, and a large Polish man-power capable of being organised into Divisions for use on the Western Front. In this connection it should be noted, however, that the Polish Ambassador in his interview the previous evening with the Secretary of State had expressed the view that it would be possible to organise a Polish Government in France, even if the members of the present Government were not permitted to leave Roumania. (iv) The obligation of a neutral under international law was believed to be confined to interning members of the armed forces. It was suggested that the Foreign Secretary - should telegraph to Sir Reginald Hoare to the effect that, after investigating the matter, we were satisfied that under international law the Roumanian Government were under no obligation whatever to intern civil members of the Polish Government.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the above points would be taken into consideration in the drafting of the instructions to be sent to Sir Reginald Hoare.

Italy.

Commercial Contacts. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 20th Conclusions, Minute 13.)

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had sent a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome informing him that arrangements had been made for the despatch to Rome the following week of an economic expert who would bring with him all the material required to enable the opening of discussions with the Italian Government with regard to commercial questions.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

France.

Commercial Contacts with Italy. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 16th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was at present unable to supplement the information given in telegram No. 327 dated the 19th September, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, reporting the terms of a commercial agreement reached between France and Italy. He regarded, however, as most objectionable the proposal that Italy should acquire for sale to France ships at present under the German flag, and he had arranged for this particular proposal to be dropped.

In the course of the ensuing discussion the following considerations were stressed: 

(a) there appeared to be a danger of the French Government

keeping us insufficiently informed in regard to their commercial negotiations with Italy, thus creating a

Hdanger that we and the French might find ourselves in competition with one another :

(b) it was particularly necessary that we should be fully

informed as to the method by which the French Government, with their large gold reserve, proposed to pay Italy for the purchases made, since the employment by them of gold for this purpose might prejudice us when we came to discuss this aspect of the question with the Italian Government.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to consider the question of securing closer liaison between the French and ourselves when engaged in commercial negotiations with neutrals.

The War Cabinet agreed to take note of the above discussion.

Ministerial \\   Arising out of the discussion in regard to the commercial

Responsibility    agreement concluded between France and Italy, recorded in Minute for Commercial io above, the attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the fact Negotiations      that there was at present no clear dividing line as to the responsi-with Neutrals,   bility of various Government Departments concerned in negotiating commercial agreements between this country and neutrals. The Ministry of Economic Warfare and the Board of Trade were both largely concerned, the role of the Foreign Office being of a limited character.   The view was expressed that it was very important that there should be no uncertainty in this matter, in view of the large political issues often implicit in such negotiations.

W.M. 22 (39).

The War Cabinet: 

Took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would consider the question of securing a better definition of ministerial responsibility for the conduct of commercial negotiations between this country and neutral Governments, with a view to laying before the War Cabinet suggestions for the improvement of the machinery of Government in this respect.

The Balkans. 12.   In the course of the discussion of the attitude of the

(Previous Roumanian Government towards the members of the Polish Govern-Beferenoe: ment, recorded in Minute 8 above, a general discussion took place in W.M. (39) 2lst regard to the position in the Balkans.

Conclusions, A Note of the discussion on this matter, and the conclusions

Minute 8.)       reached, is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The Far Eastern        13.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

Situation. had in preparation a short Note on the Far Eastern situation, which

(Previous he hoped it would be possible for the War Cabinet to consider on the

Reference: next day but one. . . ( 9) 21st       rpj^ -^-ar Cabinet agreed : 

Conclusions,  

Minute 14.) To consider the question of the Far Eastern question at

their Meeting to be held on Saturday, the 23rd September, 1939.

Herr Hitler&apos;s 14.   The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the

Speech at Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on Herr Hitler&apos;s Speech at

Danzig on Danzig on the 19th September, 1939 (W.P. (39) 39). September 19

Turkey. 15.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by

Negotiations for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the negotiations with Anglo-Franco-    Turkey for an Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty (W.P. (39) 40).

ur is   reaty. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, though

Reference-       ^ne Turkish Government still had to be satisfied on the financial W M (39) 21 t anc^ econom^c side, agreement had been reached on the draft of the Conclusion       political treaty. He wished to authorise our Ambassador in Ankara Minute 16 )      ^  s*^&gt;n      ^reaty as 800X1 as ^ne Turks were ready to do so. We had urged that this should take place before the Turkish Foreign Minister left for Russia, and the latter had, in fact, postponed his departure.

The Treaty did not go beyond what had previously been authorised. The first main point concerned Article 4. The provisions of this Article fell short of full reciprocity; but the Foreign Policy Committee had agreed, on the 1st August, that we should not insist on full reciprocity, if this would involve a breakdown of the negotiations.

The words in Article 4 &quot; The High Contracting Parties will immediately consult&quot; were abrupt, but the Turks had refused to specify the purpose for which consultation should take place.

There were obvious objections to the provision that the Treaty should run for 15 years, but the Turkish Government had insisted on this.

Protocol II (which was to be kept confidential) required us to assist the Turkish Government as soon as military action started by a European Power should reach the frontiers of Bulgaria or Greece. We were already committed to help Greece, and the Chiefs


178

of Staff had advised that, if the Germans were to attack Bulgaria, we should probably in any case wish to take action. The Protocol did not therefore add substantially to our existing commitments.

On the question whether, as had been suggested in several earlier telegrams, the Turks might still refuse to act under the Treaty, if it were signed, until they had received war supplies which they regarded as adequate, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that they might try to make reservations on this point in the discussion of the Economic Treaty, but he hoped that they would not do so; and that such action would be contrary to the provisions of Protocol I of the draft Treaty.

Sir William Malkin explained that a position of some difficulty might arise under Protocol II, if we were at war with Russia as well as with Germany (or Italy) before Turkey was at war with Germany (or Italy). In his view Turkey would, in such circumstances, be free to help us by allowing our forces to pass through the Dardanelles. It was however generally agreed that in such circumstances the Turkish Government would be able to use this Protocol as an excuse for not giving us assistance, even in this form, if they wished to do so. At the same time the risk involved was one which must be accepted.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Ankara should be authorised to sign the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty as set out in Annex I and II to the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as soon as the Turkish Government were willing to do so.

Richmond Terrace, S.W.I, September 21, 1939.
