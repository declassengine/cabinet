The Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 55th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet that two air attacks had been carried out the previous day on the East Coast convoys.

The first attack, at about 10-30 a.m., had been delivered by about six aircraft on the Southbound Convoy off Flamborough Head. A squadron of Spitfires was believed to have accounted for two of the raiders. It was not yet definitely known if any bombs had been dropped on the convoy in this attack.

The second attack had been delivered by about twelve German aircraft at about 3 p.m., by which time the Northbound and Southbound Convoys had practically met between Flamborough Head and Spurn Head. The attackers had been intercepted by Nos. 46 and 19 Squadrons, which had shot down four, and had good reason to believe that they had accounted for a fifth. A number of bombs were dropped on the convoys in this attack, but with no success. There were no casualties to our own aircraft.

An enemy submarine had been attacked by aircraft off the Fastnet the previous morning, but without result.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval 2.   The Chief of Naval Staff informed the War Cabinet of

Situation. the movements of the Home Fleet.

(Previous Information had been received which pointed to the probability

Beference:        that the Deutschland, as well as the Admiral Scheer, might be in W.M. (39) 55th the Atlantic.  The evidence came from the crew of the Norwegian Conclusions,      ship Lorenz Hansen, who had been captured and taken on board a Minute 2.)        German &quot;pocket battleship&quot; on the 12th October 400 miles north-east of Cape Race, off Newfoundland.  After 12 hours they had been transferred to another Norwegian ship which had just been brought in to Kirkwall.  This accounted for the news having only just reached us.   The Chief of Naval Staff explained the dispositions which had been made by ourselves and the French to deal with this possibility.

The Sheffield had captured the German ship Glorio (5,800 tons) between Iceland and Greenland, carrying a cargo of wheat and bones.

There had been no enemy submarine activity in the Western approaches, but a certain amount on the East Coast, one 3,000-ton French ship having been sunk.

Two other ships had been sunk off the East Coast a Norwegian tanker and a British ship of 1,800 tons but it was thought that both of these sinkings had been due to mines.

One attack had been carried out on a German submarine with what result it was not known.

The experimental &apos;&apos; magnetic &apos;&apos; sweep, which had been carried out off Cardiff, had been successful in exploding a mine. This was satisfactory and a number of these sweeps would soon be available.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Magnetic mines.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 55th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

3. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that the total number of German divisions on the Western Front was now estimated to be somewhere between 71 and 96. The latter was an absolute maximum figure. A reduction of one division was reported in the Bale area, and an increase of 4 to 6 in the Saarbriicken-Eifel area. The maximum number estimated to be in Poland was 27.

It was significant that the Germans had again advanced on to French soil at some points in the Saar area, although only to seize minor tactical features.

The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the War Cabinet a description of his recent visit to the British Expeditionary Force, in which the principal points brought to notice were: 

(a) The very wet state of the British Front, which would make

an attack on it quite impracticable at present.

(b) The British Front had been made very strong with anti-

tank obstacles, wire entanglements, and additional field defences.

(c) The French sector on the right of the British Expeditionary

Force was now very strong. On the left, the country was quite unsuitable for operations of any kind. The French division which was holding this sector was to be reinforced by the addition of two British machine-gun battalions.

(d) Small parties of British Officers and a British signal unit

were being sent to the French front. General Gamelin did not at present seem to want any British troops in the Maginot Line, but General Gort was perfectly ready to send, say, a Brigade group, if this were thought desirable for political reasons.

The Minister without Portfolio said that he had heard from the British Military Attache in Brussels that day that the lowlands in the northern half of Belgium were at present waterlogged. The roads in this part of the country were for the most part narrow pave roads, heavily cambered, which were unsuitable for the passage of tanks. The Military Attache&quot; had also informed him that the Belgian demolition arrangements seemed very thorough indeed. Three of the bridges prepared for demolition had already been blown up owing to accidental explosion of the charges. *
