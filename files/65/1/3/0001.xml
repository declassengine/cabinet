W.M. 3 (39).

Alleged Viola- 1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a

tion of Nether-   communication had been received from the Netherland Government land Neutrality  which alleged that R.A.F. machines had infringed Netherland by the R.A.F.    neutrality while flying either to or from Germany on the 3rd and 4th September, 1939.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the Netherland Minister, who had arranged that day to bring to the Foreign Office the detailed evidence plotted by the Netherland Authorities, that strict orders had been issued to all the R.A.F. units concerned to respect Netherland neutrality; but that the evidence furnished by the Netherland Government would be carefully examined, and if as a result it was established that Netherland neutrality had inadvertently been violated, His Majesty&apos;s Government would express their regret to the Netherland Government.

Alleged Flight 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he

by a Foreign had received a communication from the Belgian Government alleging

Aircraft over that a foreign aircraft of unknown nationality had violated Belgian

Belgian neutrality by flying over Belgian territory near the Belgian-French-

Territory. Luxemburg frontier.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the Belgian Ambassador that strict orders had been issued to all R.A.F. units to respect Belgian neutrality, and that in the absence of evidence to the contrary it must be assumed that these orders had been strictly observed; but that if later it were to be established that in this case Belgian neutrality had evidently been violated, His Majesty&apos;s Government would express their regret to the Belgian Government;

(6) that the Air Ministry should furnish to the Foreign Office any information which they might obtain in regard to this alleged incident.

Dropping of a Bomb on Danish Territory.

3. Reference was made by the Prime Minister to the allegation in the Press that it was a British bomb which had fallen yesterday on the Danish port of Esbjerg.

The Secretary of State for Air said that up to the present there was no evidence to support this allegation, though it was possible that it might be well founded.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), Conclusions Minute 1.)

2nd

4. A discussion took place on methods of expediting the Franco-Anglo-Turkish Treaty negotiations.

The War Cabinet were unanimous in the view that it was now essential that Turkey should declare herself on the side of Great Britain and France without further delay. Reference was made to the dangers and difficulties we had created for ourselves in the last War by neglecting the opportunity of securing Turkey&apos;s friendship (or neutrality) beforehand.

There was no difference of opinion that at the present juncture it would be worth paying a stiff price to avoid a repetition of similar dangers and difficulties.

The draft Treaty would not bring Turkey into the War on our side unless the War spread to the Mediterranean area. Some members of the War Cabinet, however, suggested that it was desirable to look further ahead, and that it might be possible to regard the signature of the Agreement now under negotiation as a prelude to Turkey&apos;s entry into the War against Germany.

The view was also advanced that, after the signature of the Treaty, it should be possible to obtain Turkey&apos;s permission for a few British warships to enter the Black Sea, This would have a most salutary effect, particularly on Roumania.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Turkey would have to become a belligerent before she would be entitled, under the Montreux Convention, to give permission for the warships of other belligerents to pass through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. He was preparing a note on the use of the Straits, which he would circulate to the War Cabinet at an early date.

The latest reports from the British Ambassador in Turkey as regards the progress of the Treaty negotiations indicated that comprehensive proposals were now on their way from the Turkish side. It would be desirable to await these proposals, although it was fully expected that Turkey would maintain her demand for a gold bullion loan. We were, of course, unwilling to see our gold reserve further diminished. Further, it was very important to induce France to share in any gold loan to Turkey (as she had shared in the Polish loan), more particularly since the grant of a gold loan to Turkey would be the signal for similar demands from other countries.

The discussion was not carried further in view of the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had arranged to meet later in the day to discuss the matter.

The Far Eastern 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Situation. instructions had been issued tJhat the four men accused of terrorism (Previous should be handed over to the local Court yesterday. At the last Eeference: minute, however, proceedings for Habeas Corpus had been started W.M. (39), 2nd in the Shanghai Court, and the British authorities at Tientsin had Conclusions, suspended action as regards handing over the four men. This had Minute 3.)       created a very bad effect in Japan.

The Foreign Secretary said that the Law Officers, who had again examined the case at his request, had decided that there were good grounds on which the four men should be handed over. In particular, they had advised that there was no ground for regarding a Judgment of the High Court in Shanghai as having any greater authority than a Judgment by the High Court in England, which had refused to issue a writ of Habeas Corpus. He had therefore issued instructions to the effect that the four men should be handed over forthwith.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Eire. 6.   The situation regarding Eire was discussed, with par-

previous ticular reference to the availability of ports in Southern Eire for Eeference:       use by our naval forces.

W.M (39), 2nd        The War Cabinet wag informe(i that Mr. de Valera had ex- nc T^T&apos;s&apos;      pressed the desire to help, with the proviso that the non-belligerency of Eire was maintained.   The Admiralty were preparing a statement of their case, and it was suggested that, in any negotiations with the Government of Eire the point should be stressed that it was the interest of Eire that the ports should be available for naval

use. Without them we should be severely handicapped in protecting Eire&apos;s trade and communications, a task which Eire was incapable of achieving with her own resources. The negotiations would need very tactful handling.

Reference was also made to the anomalous position whereby we had no High Commissioner in Dublin.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs explained that the intention was that Canada should take the first move in this matter, and he undertook to see whether there was any action he could usefully take.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, in consultation with the Admiralty, should continue negotiations with the Government of Eire with a view to ports in Southern Eire being placed at our disposal for use by naval forces.

South Africa. 7. The Secretary of State for the Dominions reported that

(Previous General Smuts had carried his amendment to General Hertzog&apos;s

Reference: Motion by 80 votes to 67. This amendment proposed that the Union W.M. (39), 2nd Government should sever relations with Germany. This was a Conclusions, larger majority than had been anticipated, and it appeared that Minute 4.) General Smuts might be able to form a Cabinet with a working majority.   General Hertzog, however, might demand a dissolution.

A private telegram, prepared in collaboration with the Lord Chancellor, had been sent to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union giving him certain information as to precedents in case it might be useful.

Air Operations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 2nd Conclusions, Minute 5.)

8. The Secretary of State for Air gave an account of the attack carried out on the German Fleet in the afternoon of the 4th September, in which he referred to the bad weather conditions in which the attack had been carried out, the extent of the damage inflicted, and of the losses sustained.

The Secretary of State for Air also referred briefly to the leaflet-dropping carried out over Germany on the night of the 3rd-4th September, and again on the night of the 4th-5th September.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement, and expressed their high appreciation of the great gallantry with which the attack had been carried out.

Naval Situation.       9   Particulars were given by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Previous        and the First Sea Lord of enemy submarine activity, and of Reference:       successes reported by the British and French Fleets. W.M. (39), 2nd        The steamship Blairberg, reported as sunk on the previous day, Conclusions,      ha(j orQy been damaged by gunfire, and had reached port. Minute 6.) An account was also given of the progress to be expected in

increasing the number of anti-submarine vessels, and of a redistribution of our Destroyer Flotillas which was being effected, with a view to strengthening the anti-submarine forces at home. Italian The postion in regard to Italian submarines in the Mediter-

Submarines. ranean was giving rise to anxiety. So long as our Fleet was liable to encounter Italian submarines submerged in the Mediterranean (except in their practice grounds) there was the risk that an Italian submarine would be mistaken for a German submarine, and that an incident would arise.


22

The War Cabinet agreed : 

that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultation with the Admiralty, should instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome to inform the Italian Government of the danger of incidents arising if Italian submarines operated submerged in zones where hostile submarines might be encountered, and to invite them to take action which would avoid the risk of such incidents arising.

Army Situation. 10.   With regard to the military situation in Poland, the War

(Previous Cabinet were informed that the German army had broken through

Reference: at Czestochowa with three or four motorised divisions.   This threat

W.M. (39), 2nd must be taken seriously since it might result in Germany capturing

Poland. There was as yet little activity to report on the other sections of the Eastern front.

Anglo-French 11.   After some preliminary discussion on this subject, with

Operations. particular reference to Air operations, it was decided to defer a decision until the War Cabinet had received a report, from the Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, on their visit to France. It was decided to hold a further Meeting that afternoon for this purpose.
