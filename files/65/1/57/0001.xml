Air Operations. 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that fighter patrols

(Previous had been operating during the previous twenty-four hours over

Reference:        sections of the coast from St. Abb&apos;s Head to Portland Bill. There W.M. (39) 56th had been various reports of enemy raids, but only one had been Conclusions,      identified as such, when our aircraft patrolling over the East coast Minute 1.)        South-bound Convoy had intercepted a German Heinkel ill bomber, 4 miles East of St. Abb&apos;s Head.   The enemy was successfully attacked and had fallen into the sea.  Three members of the crew had been picked up by H.M.S. Ghurka.  Two of our aircraft were slightly damaged.

Discussion ensued as to why in their recent air attacks the Germans had used such small numbers of aircraft.

It was thought possible that they might be carrying out experiments to test our defences, and to give training to different units of their air forces. Alternatively, it was suggested that the German General Staff would view with disfavour the utilisation of large air forces at sea, rather than in collaboration with the Army.

Press Reports. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that there

was a danger that a section of the Press was inviting the public to draw unduly favourable conclusions from the successful defeat of the small attacks which had so far taken place. He suggested that steps should be taken to point out that it was too early yet to draw any definite conclusions as to the efficacy of our defences.

The Prime Minister agreed that it was undesirable to let the country take too complacent a view of what was likely to occur. At the same time accounts of our successes had a value in encouraging morale, and in discounting peace proposals from Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 56th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 38th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the S.S. Stonegate had been sunk on the 5th October by the German pocket battleship Deutschland, 500 miles east of Bermuda. On the 15th October, the crew of the Stonegate had been transferred under a German armed guard to the American S.S. City of Flint, which had arrived at Tromso on the 21st October. The City of Flint was now en route from Tromso to Hamburg, and it was expected that she would be met by German naval forces in the Kattegat. Our naval forces were endeavouring to intercept her.

There was further evidence of the activities of a German raider in the South Atlantic. A frozen meat ship of 7,000 tons had been sunk 250 miles south-west of Freetown on the 22nd October. A number of other ships were now overdue at Freetown and had possibly fallen a victim to a German raider.

The First Lord of the Admiralty explained to the War Cabinet the naval dispositions which had been taken, with the co-operation of the French navy, to bring the raiders to action. There seemed little doubt of the identity of the pocket battleship Deutschland, since the crew of the Stonegate had described the plaques on her mess deck commemorating the losses she had sustained from the air attack made on her at Majorca during the Spanish Civil War.

The S.S. Orsa (1,478 tons) and the S.S. White Mantle (1,592 tons) had been mined off the East coast.

The submarine Thetis had now been raised.

Further information now made it quite certain that H.M.S. Royal Oak had been torpedoed. Fragments of a torpedo had been discovered.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Unrestricted action by German submarines.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 14th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

3. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that it had now been ascertained that about 50 per cent, of the military personnel and their families, who had been travelling in the transport Yorkshire, were missing. He thought we should make more in our propaganda of the fact that the German submarines were waging a ruthless war on women and children.

The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed. The Report of the Commodore of the convoy showed that the Yorkshire had been torpedoed without any warning.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a)

That the Admiralty, in making announcements to the public about sinkings by German submarines, should mention specially any cases of attacks made without warning, and of casualties caused to non-combatants.

To invite the Lord Privy Seal to take up with the Minister of Information the question of including in our propaganda throughout the world particulars of the ruthless sinking of merchant ships by German submarines, and the loss caused thereby to non-combatants, including women and children.

Military Operations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 56th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said that during the week-end there had been an increase of 4 or 5 German Divisions in the Saar area. One more had also been identified near Cologne.

The British Liaison Officer with the French had reported that there was a weak point in the Maginot Line, about 10 miles broad, in the Saar area, where the defences were only of the type to be found on the Franco-Belgian frontier.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply to an enquirj by the Prime Minister, said that this gap in the Maginot Line was due to the fact that the French had not started work on this sector while the future of the Saar was in doubt. The French were now working on the sector, and would be able to inundate the country in front of it if necessary.

The Secretary of State for War said that, in conversation with the Director of Military Intelligence, General Gamelin had given the impression that he was now thinking more in terms of a German offensive in the Spring than in terms of the immediate future. He had appeared confident, and had expressed his satisfaction with the French tanks, and also with the Curtis Fighter.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty enquired whether the General Staff were now convinced that no major German offensive was impending.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it was not possible to be absolutely definite on this point, but a major operation in the present state of the weather, and so iate in the season, was not one which he himself would be prepared to undertake.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had had an interview with the Swedish Minister, and had taken up with him the question of stocks of arsenic now accumulated in Sweden, in view of possible German intentions to use gas. The Minister had promised to convey the Secretary of State&apos;s representations to the Swedish Government without delay.

Bofors Guns. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, at

(Previous the interview referred to in the previous Minute, he had taken a

Reference:       very stiff line with M. Prytz as regards the embargo placed by the W.M. (39) 55th Swedish Government on the delivery of the Bofors guns to this Conclusions,      country.  He had told M. Prytz that the unnecessarily strict inter-Minute 7.)       pretation placed by the Swedish Government on their neutrality in this matter appeared less than friendly to us, and that their attitude, if adhered to, would inevitably react adversely upon relations between the two countries.   M. Prytz had promised to report faithfully to his Government the communication made to him by the Secretary of State, but he had held out little hope that they would modify their attitude.  He added that he had been given to understand that the War Office accepted the position taken up by the Swedish Government.  To this he (the Secretary of State) had replied that, on the contrary, the War Office were the spear-point of the feeling of resentment against Sweden common to all members of the Government.

The Secretary of State added that he did not feel at all sanguine as to the prospect of the Swedish Government meeting us on this question.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Finland.

Negotiations with Russia. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 55th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that in the course of his interview with M. Prytz, the Swedish Minister, recorded in Minutes 6 and 7, he had enquired whether the Swedish Government had any news as regards the development of the situation in Finland. M. Prytz had replied that the Finnish Government had, he thought, acted with great wisdom in maintaining the utmost secrecy regarding their discussions with the Government of the U.S.S.R., since they had thereby given the latter an opportunity, should they so desire, of receding from their extreme demands without loss of face. He (M. Prytz) understood that the Finnish Government would be prepared to surrender to the U.S.S.R. two or three islands in the Gulf of Finland, and would probably be willing to undertake not to fortify the Aland Islands. They would not, however, be prepared to accept Russian bases on the mainland of Finland nor any right of Russian inspection of the Aland Islands. He (M. Prytz) considered the situation was serious, but did not think that the Government of the U.S.S.R. were likely to proceed to extremities owing to the great offence which such action would give in the United States, the only country which they (the Soviet Government) thought to be in a position to curb Japan.

The Secretary of State drew attention also to telegram No. 161, dated the 21st October, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Helsingfors. In this telegram Mr. Snow recommended in effect that, in the event of Soviet aggression against Finland, we should either formally or informally declare a state of belligerence between the U.S.S.R. and ourselves. From this telegram it appeared also that Mr. Snow anticipated that the Government of the U.S.S.R. might be preparing to establish themselves on the north coast of


478

Norway. In these circumstances he (the Secretary of State) suggested that it would be useful if the Chiefs of Staff Committee could take into consideration the advantages and disadvantages of our declaring war against the U.S.S.R., taking as their basis the telegram received from Mr. Snow.

The Prime Minister agreed that such an examination would be valuable.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that this question, in its bearing on Sweden, was already under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That the Chiefs of Staff Committee should be asked to prepare in the light of telegram No. 161, dated the 21st October, 1939. from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Helsingfors, and other material available, an appreciation of the relative advantages and disadvantages which would accrue to us if, either formally or informally, we were to declare war on the U.S.S.R. as the result of Soviet aggression against Finland or any of the other Scandinavian countries.

The Far Eastern       9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Situation. to telegram No. 647, dated the 20th October, 1939, from His

(Previous Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, reporting his discussion with

Reference: khe United States Secretary of State regarding the policy which

W.M. (39) 50th we proposed to adopt in China in relation to the Japanese Govern-

Oonclusions, ment. Lord Lothian&apos;s report might be summarised as follows : 

Mmute 6.) q^e United States Government intended to maintain

their troops in North China irrespective of what others might do, though there might be some rearrangement as between Tientsin and Peking. Mr. Hull was at great pains to make it clear that he did not feel that he could give any advice to Great Britain as to what she should do in the Far East, but he had made it clear to Lord Lothian that he (Mr. Hull) would regret the removal of all British troops from Tientsin and Peking, because it would discourage China, and at the same time encourage the military party in Japan. If we were to withdraw our forces entirely from North China, he did not think it would be possible to prevent the impression that we were doing so in response to the &quot; friendly advice &quot; tendered by the Japanese Government.

Mr. Hull had enquired whether, even if we decided to withdraw our Forces, we could not maintain both at Tientsin and Peking the equivalent of an International Settlement&apos;s guard. Lord Lothian had then asked him whether public opinion in America would be disturbed at the action we proposed to take. To this Mr. Hull had replied tharhe did not think that the disturbance would be serious because people recognised our necessary preoccupation with Europe.

Lord Lothian reported also that he had had a conversation with Mr. Hornbeck, who had taken the same line as Mr. Hull, but had added that, if we decided to carry out the policy proposed, he hoped we should make it clear that we were doing so on our own initiative and not as a result of consultation with the United States Government. Lord Lothian added that his impression was that, while the United States Government fully understood our difficulties, they would greatly prefer that we should keep the flag flying by maintaining in both places a few men as Legation or Consular guards so long as the Americans maintained their forces there.


479 W.M. 57 (39).

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, after reading Lord Lothian&apos;s report, he now hoped that it would be possible to maintain a small symbolic force both at Tientsin and Peking, in view of the great importance of not antagonising opinion in the U.S.A.

The Secretary of State for War said that, while he was prepared to fall in with the suggestion made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he would prefer on military grounds to see all our forces in North China withdrawn. It was doubtful if later we should find a better opportunity.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, for administrative reasons, a platoon (about 30 men) would probably be the smallest unit which could be conveniently left either at Tientsin or Peking.

The War Cabinet agreed  

That, in view of the report received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, regarding the attitude of the United States Government, the British forces at present stationed at Peking and Tientsin should not be completely withdrawn, a small token force being left in each place; the exact size of this force to be settled between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for War.

Germany. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the Wax

(Previous Cabinet certain particulars regarding the internal situation in

W.M. (39) 49th Pile of War Cabinet Conclusions.

Conclusions, The War Cabinet took note of the above statement by the

Minute li.) Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Diversion of Shipping from East Coast to West Coast Ports.

Effect on Production. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 47th Conclusions, Minute 6.)

11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Supply (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 49) dealing with the serious effect upon production of the diversion of shipping from East Coast to West Coast ports.

The Minister of Supply pointed out that there were facilities at some East Coast ports for special types of cargo, and that trades using these materials were fixed round these ports. If, therefore, it was at all possible on strategic grounds, it was very desirable that ships should not all be diverted to the West Coast without discrimination, but that special consideration should be given to cargoes of such special types. As an example, he referred to the case of iron-ore for Middlesbrough, mentioned in his Memorandum, and explained that the facilities for unloading this at Barrow and transporting it by rail from-there to Middlesbrough were quite inadequate. In any case, the ships in which iron-ore was imported would probably proceed later to East Coast ports to load export coal.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, on the advice of the First Sea Lord, he was prepared to suggest some relaxation of the full diversion policy for the time being. It seemed clear that at the moment the Germans were not prepared to press their air attacks on shipping with full force; for example, they seemed to have decided not to attack ships in harbour. They might, however, at any time change their policy, and it was therefore very important .to press on as rapidly as possible with improvements to the Western ports.


480

The Prime Minister said that the proposed modification of policy would necessarily involve some risk, but he thought the risk worth running, as the alternative was the certainty of delay and increased cost.   There was general agreement with this view.

The Minister of Shipping enquired as to what was meant by the proposal to restrict the modification of policy to special cases. It was agreed that ships could be sent to Eastern ports when it was clear that the alternative diversion to the West Coast involved substantial increase in expenditure and delay which would have serious effects on production; that the use of the East Coast ports should be restricted as far as practicable, the Western ports continuing to be used to capacity.

The Minister without Portfolio asked whether it would be possible to take retaliatory air action against German convoys along the Coast to Rotterdam, as he understood that important cargoes of iron-ore for Western Germany were sent by this route.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that this would not be practicable, as it would be impossible to identify the ships as German.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(a) that, for the time being, instead of all shipping being

diverted to West Coast Ports, ships should be allowed to use East Coast Ports in special cases where this was necessary to avoid substantially increased expense, or delay that would have serious effects on production;

(b) that, in the meantime, the examination into the possibility

of effecting improvements in the capacity of the Western Ports and the related transport facilities should be pushed on as rapidly as possible.

Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1, October 23, 1939.
