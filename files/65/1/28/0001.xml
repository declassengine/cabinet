The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet

Situation. that reconnaissances had been carried out the previous day of the

(Previous railway between Beilefeld and Kamen (in Westphalia), and also

Reference:        in the Ruhr to determine the presence of balloon barrages. No W.M. (39) 26th unusual activity had been observed.  One of our aircraft had been Conclusions,      attacked at 18,000 feet and hit in the petrol tank, but had returned Minute l.)       safely.  Anti-aircraft fire had been negligible.  Three aircraft had dropped leaflets the previous night over north-west Germany, and had returned to France.  Aircraft had also left early that morning to carry out a reconnaissance of the German Fleet.   Three of our aircraft had had encounters with enemy aircraft over the North Sea the previous day without casualties to either side. Intelligence reports describe a certain activity in the Frankfurt area, including the presence of transport aircraft, which might indicate a transfer of advance parties from Poland to the West.   There seemed to be no foundation for the report in that morning&apos;s newspapers of a raid by the French on F&apos;riedrichshaven.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

151

Dropping of Leaflets on Germany.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 26th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

2. The Lord Privy Seal questioned the wisdom of announcing the dropping of leaflets over Germany at a moment when Warsaw was being so heavily attacked. WMm

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that opinion in the Dominions took the same view.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer doubted whether the reports of the dropping of leaflets were of as great news value as formerly, and suggested that too much attention was being devoted to them, in particular by the B.B.C.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs mentioned a report which had been received from two non-Nazi business men, saying that up to mid-September the dropping of leaflets was not having a good effect.

The Secretary of State for Air said that when previous attempts had been made to withhold reports of leaflet-dropping from the Press, the news had filtered back from abroad and this had provoked complaints.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To invite the Lord Privy Seal to ask the Director-General, Ministry of Information, to explain the position to the Press with a view to persuading them not to give prominence to reports of the dropping of leaflets on Germany.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 26th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet that the Submarine which had been reported as having been damaged had been met by four Destroyers off the Danish coast, and was being escorted home. No merchant ship had been sunk in the previous 24 hours. A trawler had reported sighting a stationary submarine, with three seaplanes in attendance, 90 miles East of Flamborough Head the previous day. Aircraft had been sent out at dawn that day to investigate. Various attacks had been carried out on enemy submarines. A rendezvous of German ships was reported to have been arranged to take place South-West of Ascension Island on Thursday, the 28th September. Suitable dispositions had been ordered, in the hope of making contact.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Eire. 4.   The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the position

(Previous of Eire, which was unsatisfactory from the. Naval point of view. Reference: yAg Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the

W.M. (39) 19th  jre Government had now agreed to the appointment of Sir John Conclusions,      Maffey as our Representative in Dublin.   Sir John Maffey was Minute 7.)       taking up his appointment at once, and he thought that it was better that any representations which it might be desired to make on this matter should be made by Sir John Maffey after he had taken up his appointment.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Military 5.   The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet

Situation in of the measures he was taking to reinforce the Field Force with Franoe. 2 Infantry Brigades, 2 Machine Gun Battalions, and an Anti-

(Previous        Aircraft Regiment.

Reference: He had seen representatives of McAlpines, and had arranged

W.M. (39) 26th for one of their engineers to accompany a senior Royal Engineer Conclusions,      Officer to examine the construction of a defensive line in France. Minute 4.)        In all, 10 Field Companies, Royal Engineers, with mechanical diggers, would shortly be despatched.   These resources would be over and above anything the Field Force already had.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, according to reliable information, there were now the elements of 7 German Divisions opposite the Dutch frontier, North of the Rhine. South of the Rhine, there were only 2 Reserve Divisions. The Rhine might be regarded as the boundary between offensive operations against Holland alone, for which purpose troops would be massed North of the river, and an invasion of Holland and Belgium which would take place South of the river. An invasion of Holland would no doubt be resisted, but unfortunately we had no knowledge of either the Dutch or the Belgian plans.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Staff 6.   In connection with the preceding Minute, discussion ensued

Conversations    as to what further action could be taken to persuade the Belgian with Belgium.    Government to initiate Staff Conversations forthwith. Reference (Previous        was made to Telegram No. 118, dated the 25th September, fromT Reference:       Brussels, from which it appeared that our Ambassador had been W.M. (39) 25th reluctant to pass on to the Belgian Government our views as to how Conclusions,      the situation might develop and of the action which we should Minute 5.)       probably have to take against German forces passing through Belgium.   Further, the Belgian Government still did not realise that, if they called on us for assistance at the last moment without having consented to previous consultation, we should not be able to help them.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs doubted whether it would be in our interest that we should press the Belgian Government beyond a certain point. He agreed, however, that it was right that the full facts should be put before the Belgian Government objectively. If a German advance through Belgium should develop, it was very undesirable that the Belgian Government should afterwards be able to assert that they were not aware of the action which we intended to take.

The War Cabinet agreed 

That further instructions should be sent to our Ambassador in Brussels authorising him to explain fully


152

217 W.M. 28 (39).

to the Belgian Government the course of events which we anticipated in the event of a German advance through Belgium, on the lines set out in Telegrams Nos. 80 and 94

to Brussels.

Sino-Japanese 7.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that, as agreed Upon by the

Hostilities. War Cabinet at the meeting noted in the margin, the Chiefs of (Previous Staff had prepared an appreciation regarding the situation reached Eeference: in the Sino-Japanese hostilities. The main conclusions which they W.M. (39) 26th had reached were as follows: 

Conclusions, (a) at the present time there was no ground for anticipating

that Chinese military resistance was likely to collapse : (6) so long as the neutrality of Italy was not assured, it was essential to avoid fresh embarrassments, and for this reason it would not be to our advantage to free Japan of her entanglements in China, which (except from the naval point of view) were serious. On the other hand, it was important not to assist the Chinese Government to an extent which might exasperate the Japanese Government into taking action against us : (c) from the strictly military point of view, the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese conflict was to the advantage of this country.

In the course of the subsequent discussion the following considerations were stressed : 

(i) from the political point of view it was important to

remember that after the establishment on the 10th October next of the new Government under Wang Ching-Wei there was a danger that civil war might break out in China with possibly serious embarrassments to us. Moreover, if our relations with Japan deteriorated too much, she might thereby be forced into the hands of the enemy, with consequent danger to the Netherlands East Indies and elsewhere in the Pacific :

(ii) once freed from embarrassments in China, the Japanese

might launch an attack on the Netherlands East Indies. Against this, it was pointed out that, even if hostilities were to cease in China, the Japanese would be faced with a tremendous task in that country, and would be by no means freed from their entanglement. From telegram No. 1076, dated the 22nd September, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Shanghai, it appeared that according to the French Ambassador it was the intention of the Government of the U.S.S.R. to attempt to bring the Chinese and Japanese Governments together. It was important that, if the parties were to be brought together, this should not be done under the aegis of the Soviet Government:

(iii) the passage  in telegram No.  1284,  dated the 23rd

September, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, in which it was suggested that the Government of the U.S.S.R. with its new commitments in Poland might temporarily abandon General Chiang Kai-shek, taken in conjunction with the telegram from Sir Archibald Clark Kerr referred to in (ii) above, suggested that the Chinese National Government might be well advised to give careful consideration to the proposal for a meeting with the Japanese at Hong Kong put forward by Sir Robert Craigie.


218

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That, in view of the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Shanghai, had already arranged shortly to visit Chungking, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct him, while there, to inform General Chiang Kai-shek privately of the proposal reported by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, in his telegram No. 1284, dated the 23rd September, 1939, namely, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should use their good offices for arranging a meeting between Chinese and Japanese representatives at Hong Kong to discuss ways and means of bringing the present Si no-Japanese conflict to an end; that the Ambaisasdor should make it clear to the General that we had no intention of taking any action which might break his front against the Japanese, and that it was for this reason that we wished to ascertain his views before deciding on the reply to be made to the Japanese Government.

Policy of Soviet Russia.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 25th Conclusions, Minute 6.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave certain information regarding the motives underlying the recent action in Europe of the Government of the U.S.S.R. and the probable future policy of that Government.

A note of this information is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The Setting Up 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

of a Polish had sent a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Bucharest (in

Government. reply to Sir Reginald Hoare&apos;s telegram No. 473, dated the 24th

(Previous September, 1939), urging the importance of steps being taken to

Reference: constitute a new Polish Government by nominating persons as

W.M. (39) 26th substitutes for the members of the Polish Government now detained

Conclusions, W in Roumania.  One of the chief difficulties appeared to be that the

Minute 8.) number of suitable representatives was limited.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Armament 10.   The Chief of the Air Staff stated that the. S.S. Clan

Supplies to Menzies, carrying, among other armaments, 15 Battle aircraft,

Poland. 5,000 Hotchkiss guns and 15 million rounds of small-arms ammuni-

(Previous tion, had now arrived at Malta.   These stores had originally been

Reference: intended for Poland, and were in a sense complementary to those

W.M. (39) 21st sent out in the S.S. Laselle, which had now been offered to Turkey.

Conclusions, The question for decision was, to what port the S.S. Clan Menzies

Minute 15.) should be. sent, and to whom the stores should be given.  The Chiefs of Staff recommended Turkey.

The War Cabinet agreed 

That the S.S. Clan Menzies should be ordered to proceed to Istanbul, and that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Ankara should be authorised to offer the stores consigned in her to the Turkish Government on the same terms as those in the S.S. Laselle.

W.M. 28 (39).

Evacuation of 11.   The Lord Privy Seal said that hitherto the Press had been

Government      forbidden to refer to this subject, but it had become widely known Departments.    that  the  Government  had  provisionally  arranged alternative (Previous        accommodation for various Departments in other parts of the Eeference:       country.   It was also known that there had been complaints as to W.M (39) 8th  the methods employed in securing the alternative accommodation. Conclusions,      He asked that he should now be authorised to arrange for the First Minute 5.)       Commissioner of Works to communicate to the Press a short statement dealing with certain aspects of this matter.   The statement would answer some of the complaints raised, but would not add to what was already publicly known.

The War Cabinet agreed to the course proposed.

Facilities to enable Members of Parliament serving in His Majesty&apos;s Forces to attend to their Parliamentary Duties.

12. The Secretary of State for War said that a Question was to be asked in the House of Commons that afternoon by Mr. Henderson Stewart, MP., as to the facilities which would be granted to Members of Parliament serving with His Majesty&apos;s Forces to enable them to attend meetings of Parliament and to visit their constituencies. It had been decided that Officers serving overseas should obtain leave once every six months. He thought that difficulties would arise if Members of Parliament were treated in a special manner. He was therefore disposed to answer the Question to the effect that no special facilities could be granted.

In the discussion which ensued, The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed to the precedent of the last War, when Members of Parliament had frequently returned from their units to take part in important Debates.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had given a ruling in the Treasury to the effect that the facilities for free railway travel at present accorded to Members of Parliament travelling to Westminster from their constituencies or their homes would be extended to Members of Parliament serving with the Forces and travelling to Westminster from the place where they were training.

In the course of discussion, general agreement was expressed with the view that the right procedure was not to raise the question whether Members of Parliament were entitled to any special facilities, but to take the broad line that the precedent of the last War would be followed, and that the question of allowing Members of Parliament facilities to attend to their Parliamentary duties without undue interference with their military duties was one which was capable of adjustment as in the last War.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To invite the three Service Ministers, in consultation, to frame a reply to Mr. Henderson Stewart&apos;s Question on the lines of the above discussion.

Richmond Terrace, S.W.I, September 26, 1939.


154

A Meeting of the War Cabinet at which only the Ministers   Members of the War Cabinet, and no officials were present,was held at No. 10, Downing Street, at 6.0 p.m. on Tuesday, the 26th September, 1939

No record of the proceedings at this Meeting was made.
