Report by the 1,   ihe Minister of Supply said that our present plan was to

Minister of ~ despatch overseas 32 Divisions in the first year of war. But the Supply. plan was not due for completion before October 1940.   The capacity

already developed would admit of only 16 Divisions being sent in the first year. Any increase in this number would entail an immediate and large expansion in the factory programme, particularly for cordite and explosives. Apart from the requirements of our own troops, allowance would also have to be made for the Dominions, for our Foreign Allies and for the French. It was essential, therefore, that he should be given instructions as soon as possible as to the size of the Land Forces for which he must plan supply, and their date of despatch overseas.

In discussion it was urged that the Cabinet ought to lay down at a very early date the size of the Forces on which planning was to be based. The personnel for 32 Divisions existed and it was vitally important to accelerate supply for these Divisions. As regards further expansion it was suggested that we should make preparations on the basis, of say, 60 Divisions, which might comprise : 

Divisions.

British ............... 32

Dominions   ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 13

Foreign Allies and various...      ...      ... 15

To provide for Forces on this scale it would be necessary to mobilise our industrial resources, to safeguard the raw material situation and to make the best of any source of labour available.

It was also suggested that the scales of consumption of the Field Force should be re-examined since the scale would necessarily come down as the number of formations increased. Moreover, units had fought and could fight with something less than the ideal scale.

The Prime Minister suggested that the whole problem would best be examined by a small Committee of Ministers.

It was essential that the Committee should not attempt too comprehensive an examination, but should produce a scheme which should afford a basis for immediate action; although the scheme might well have to be modified in detail subsequently.

The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that any increase in the Army would involve an increase in the number of Royal Air Force units allocated to co-operation with the Army.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To set up a Committee composed as under:  Lord Privy Seal (Chairman), Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, First Lord of the Admiralty, Secretary of State for War, Minister without Portfolio, Minister of Supply,

With power to co-opt:  President of the Board of Trade, Minister of Labour and National Service;

to report to the Cabinet as quickly as possible on the size of the land forces at which we should aim, and the date of completion of equipment for the various contingents, as a basis for the production arrangements to be made by the Ministry of Supply.

Evacuation of 2.   The Home Secretary said that at the desire of the War

Government     Cabinet a special Committee attended by a number of Ministers and Departments.    their advisers had met that afternoon to determine whether the mili-(Previous        tary considerations put forward by the Chiefs of Staff regarding the .Reference:       evacuation of Government Departments were such as to counter-W.M. (39), 5th balance the adverse effect upon public morale in London, which Conclusions,     might be anticipated if the move were decided upon now. Con-Minute 10.)      tinuing, the Home Secretary pointed out that there were already in existence plans which had been in preparation for a long time, and which were complete down to the smallest detail.   These provided for the move of the entire staff of all Government Departments in two Echelons.

In the light of these considerations the Committee had asked him to put forward the following proposals : 

(a) that the Office of Works should be authorised immediately to requisition the accommodation required for offices for both the Echelons. The Ministry of Health should at the same time exercise the necessary complementary billeting powers in the same neighbourhoods. The necessary staff of the two Departments concerned were on the spot and ready to begin work the moment the order was given. It would require ten days to complete the requisitioning of the buildings, and their equipment, &amp;o, on a reasonable scale, which meant that everything could be ready on the 16th September, if the orders were given now :

(6) that the Railways should stand by to carry out their part of the existing plan, if, and when, the War Cabinet decided to put it into operation. The Railways were ready to act at 12 hours&apos; notice, and transportation could be completed in four days :

(c) that, assuming that the Cabinet decided in favour of (a) and

(b) above, the question whether the move should, in fact, take place should be kept under review by the War Cabinet for decision later in the light of developments and advice from the Chiefs of Staff;

(d) that in the meantime arrangements should be made to begin

as quickly as possible and in advance of the general move the transfer of a limited number of departmental staffs, of which the supply organisation of the Air Ministry &apos; &apos;{., was an outstanding example, in so far as this was found

practicable in the light of what the Office of Works and the Ministry of Health were able to do in the areas to which the departmental staffs in question were to move :

(e) that if the War Cabinet agreed to (d) above, the selection of

the departmental staffs should immediately be considered by an inter-departmental committee, which should settle the details on a basis of priority.

The Home Secretary explained that in making these recommendations the Committee had taken into account the possible reactions on the general morale of the public. He referred to the risk if these, measures became known to Germany, thereby precipitating an attack before our plans were complete.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That preliminary action to facilitate the evacuation of Government Departments should be taken forthwith in accordance with the recommendations made by the Home Secretary, on behalf of the Committee which he had assembled to consider this question, in paragraphs (a) to (e) above, on the understanding that the final decision to order the move should be taken later by the War Cabinet in the light of subsequent developments and advice from the Chiefs of Staff.

Parliamentary 3.   The War Cabinet were informed that requests had been

Oppositions: received from both opposition parties in Parliament that they should

Request for be given special facilities for receiving confidential information

Information regarding the conduct of the war.   The requests received, which

received from, were not identical, were as follows : 

(i) Liberal Party.

Sir Archibald Sinclair had indicated his desire to be furnished regularly and at short intervals with confidential reports for the information of himself and his colleagues.

(ii) Labour Party.

Individual leaders of the Labour Party in both Houses of Parliament had approached various Ministers of the Crown. In each case the Minister concerned had been informed that the Labour leader in question had been nominated by the Labour Party to keep in touch with him for the purpose of obtaining information regarding the work of his Department.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that it was not possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to

share responsibility for the conduct of the war with the leaders of the Parliamentary Opposition, and therefore that no information on this subject could be given to them as a matter of right;

(b) that, subject to the maintenance of the principle set out

in (a) above, there was no objection to the Ministers concerned maintaining informal contacts with the leaders of the Parliamentary Opposition.

Union of South 4 The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he Africa. ]ja(j ^w0 matters to report to the War Cabinet in regard to the

State of War     position of the Union of South Africa : 

(i) An official notification had been received that the Union of Flag to be flown South Africa was now in a state of war with Germany;

by the Monitor (ii) The question whether the flag to be flown by the Monitor Erebus. Erebus should be the White Ensign or the South African

flag had now been settled satisfactorily, and the Monitor would sail under the White Ensign.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Eir8, 5.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported that

(Previous only a limited approach on the question of co-operation had so far Reference: been made to the Government of Eire, this approach having taken W.M. (39), 3rd the form of a request for the grant of permission for the stationing Conclusions, of a salvage vessel in a southern port of Eire. This request had Minute 6.)       so far been well received.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Northern q    The Home Secretary reported that a number of unfortunate

Ireland. incidents had occurred in Northern Ireland, attacks having been

made on persons in uniform by Republicans or persons holding extreme Nationalist opinions. The Government of Northern Ireland had suggested that as these incidents were a development of Imperial policy and not of local policy, His Majesty&apos;s Government


40

should take the matter in hand. The Government of Northern Ireland had been informed that, on the contrary, this was essentially a matter of maintaining local order.

The Home Secretary added, however, that he was of opinion that the custody of persons interned in Northern Ireland should be undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Government, since it was very undesirable that the officers actually in charge of the internment camps should be drawn from the ranks of the political opponents of the interned persons, as would otherwise be the case.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Poland.

Provision of additional cash resources.

Safe keeping of Polish gold assets.

7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had two developments in the matter of the grant of financial aid to Poland to report to the War Cabinet: 

(i) An agreement had to-day been made between the British,

French and Polish Governments for the provision to Poland of additional cash resources to the extent of  8| millions for the purpose of war material, &amp;c. The Polish Government proposed to spend part of this credit on purchases from the U.S.S.R. which, it was understood, was prepared to supply the requirements of the Polish Government.

(ii) An order had to-day been received by the Bank of England

from the Bank of International Settlements under which a large deposit of gold at present held by the Bank of England on Bank of International Settlements account would in future be held by the Bank of England for the account of a Polish bank in Warsaw. It was understood that the object of this arrangement was to secure that, if Warsaw were to fall, no nominee of the German Government should have any power to claim the gold deposit in question through the Bank of International Settlements. There was, therefore, no danger of a repetition of what occurred after the occupation of Prague by Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey.

Commercial Negotiations. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39), 5th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

8. The President of the Board of Trade said that in the course of discussions that afternoon on the Trade Negotiations with Turkey, it had become evident that the Turkish representatives would not be prepared to make an Agreement with us, unless we would agree to take a substantial amount of Turkish tobacco for a period of years. The demand put forward had been that we should take a million pounds of Turkish tobacco per annum for fifteen years. He had just informed the United States Government that it would be necessary for us to reduce our purchase of United States tobacco, and it would be very unfortunate if we allowed it to appear that our real motive in reducing our purchases of United States tobacco had been to enable us to purchase Turkish instead.

After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed: 

(1) to authorise tlhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to despatch a telegram to our Ambassador at Ankara to inform him that, if need be, we were prepared to agree that the gold loan to Turkey might be repaid in the form of Turkish tobacco;


41

W.M. 6 (39).

(2) that, as it was impossible to negotiate simultaneously on

the same matter both in London and Ankara, the trade negotiations in London should be held up until the result of Sir H. Knatchbull-Hugessen&apos;s negotiations at Ankara were known;

(3) that a telegram should be despatched to our Ambassador

at Washington, authorising him to make a direct approach to Mr. Cordell Hull and to inform him that it might be necessary for us to make an agreement with Turkey whereby we undertook to accept, in repayment of our loan to that country, a certain amount of Turkish tobacco each year. Mr. Cordell Hull should, however, be informed that we should not put this tobacco into circulation, to the detriment of United States tobacco, without prior consultation with the United States Government.

SECRET -

WAR CABTWET 6 (59) T Conclusion J.

Puller report of remarks made bv the Secretary of State for War.

In discussion THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR

urged that the War Cabinet ought, at a very early

date, to lay down the size of the forces on which

planning was to be &quot;based.   He thought that the

assumption should be that the War would be of long

duration, say at least five years, and that our

effort should be an extreme one.   The personnel of

32 Divisions existed, and it was vitally important

to accelerate supply for these Divisions. As

regards further expansion, it was suggested that

we should make preparations on the basis of, say,

60 Divisions, which might comprise -

British ... 32 Divisions

Dominions ... 13 Divis ions Foreign Allies

and various ... 15 Divisions.

This total of 60 Divisions thus reached would be a

rough and ready measure of calculation of the

equipment which would be available for use either

by British or Allied personnel as determined later.

In order to provide for forces on this scale

it would be necessary to take a number of important

steps to mobilise our industrial resources, to

safeguard the raw material position, and to make

the best use of labour available.   For example,

tonnage

priority control would be necessary for kKsxSoSkX Exchange (particularly the Dollar Exchange) and raw materials.   Steps should be taken to accumulate stocks, and care taken to husband them and ration them frugally.   Reserve^ should be accumulated against the time, some two years hence, when the output of munitions would consume resources of raw

-1-


42

materials far in excess of current supplies. Steps should be set on foot to marshal   our industrial resources and to institute at once a simple automatic system of Admiralty, Air Force and Army priorities in our factories.   Priority for material should be accorded to every war contract, and supreme priority should be accorded to contracts for the construction of factories and munition plants.

Steps should also be taken to dilute labour If&apos; Above all, it was essential to take steps to accelerate the production of guns a4 and Tanks.   While the supply and use of ammunition could be rationed, it was impossible to ration guns.
