The Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 29th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

Dropping of leaflets in Germany. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 28th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet that the reconnaissance carried out the previous day over the west and north-west of Germany had been very successful, and that photographs had been obtained of 17 out of 18 aerodromes. All aircraft returned without having encountered enemy fighters, though strong anti-aircraft fire was experienced over the Ruhr. The results of this reconnaissance had yet to be examined in more detail, but first impressions suggested there was little or no camouflage, and that air activity was slight. There were some indications from other sources that aircraft, formerly concentrated in north-west Germany, had returned to their parent aerodromes for maintenance.

A reconnaissance was carried out the previous night of roads and railways behind the Low Countries, and another was being made that morning.

Leaflets were dropped during the previous day&apos;s reconnaissances, all aircraft returning safely.

Attention was drawn to the fact that reports had appeared in this morning&apos;s Press regarding the dropping of leaflets, notwithstanding the Cabinet decision noted in the margin. It was explained that this had occurred through some error, and that steps would be taken to prevent a recurrence of this mistake.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference!: &apos;&apos;J W.M. (39) 29th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

H.M.S. Spearfish.

Attack by German Flying boats on the Fleet.

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, if nothing untoward happened before 1 p.m. that day, four days would have passed without any British merchant ship having been sunk or molested. By contrast, we were continuing vigorously to press home our attacks on enemy submarines, which included during the past twenty-four hours a number of attacks in which good contact had been obtained.

Meanwhile, the convoy system was working well. Our ships were met far out to sea by our destroyers, who then escorted them in.

The First Lord gave an account of the experiences of the Spearfish, the submarine which had been damaged off Heligoland. The submarine had now returned, and it was hoped to obtain valuable information from the officers and crew, which would throw light on German methods of submarine detection.

The Spearfish had been met at 1 o&apos;clock the previous day by four destroyers and then escorted home by the Fleet. At about 11 a.m. three German flying-boats appeared in the vicinity of the Fleet, flying at roughly 200 feet above sea level. (It was the crew of one of these flying-boats which had been captured.) Later, our ships had been attacked in force by bombers. Dive bombing attacks had been carried out on the Hood and the Ark Royal from clouds, out of a blue sky, from 6,000 feet. There had been no direct hit, but one ship had sustained a graze which had done little damage. These attacks had been succeeded by a high altitude bombing attack on the Aurora and Sheffield at 5 15 p.m. In this case, twenty-six bombs had been dropped, and all had missed.

Our anti-aircraft fire had been ineffective. The First Lord accounted for this by the fact that our practice in the past had been confined to sleeve targets towed at about 100 m.p.h. It was essential that arrangements should immediately be made to begin practices against high-speed targets of the order of 250 m.p.h.

It was agreed that the necessary arrangements to this end should be set in train between the Admiralty and Air Ministry.

At 11 a.m. the previous morning two German aircraft arrived off May Island in Scotland and attacked two of our escort vessels,

[20071]

the Valorous and the Hastings. Thirteen bombs were dropped, but no damage was done. Fighter aircraft was sent out, but too late.

Our warning system seemed to have been at fault (possibly the result of previous false alarms). It was agreed that steps should be taken by the Air Ministry to ensure better warning of the approach of hostile aircraft.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Ref erence: W.M. (39) 29th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

3. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that the Germans claimed to have captured Warsaw, but that Modlin and the Hela Peninsula were still holding out.

On the Western Front, one more Landwehr division had been identified, but there was no corroboration yet of the widespread reports from neutral countries that a large German concentration was taking place. It was possible that these reports were spread by the Germans themselves.

The Secretary of State for War described the steps being taken to produce a strongly fortified line for the occupation of the British Expeditionary Force.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Treatment of 4   The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to a news-

Enemy Aliens paper report that a German destroyer had taken off seven British found on board seamen from a Swedish merchant ship. He suggested that we should Neutral Ships, ^j^g steps to detain German seamen, and that at a suitable moment (Previous we should publicly announce that for every one of our men taken Reference: in this way by the enemy we should take two of theirs. It was, W.M. (39) 29th of course, particularly desirable not to offend the United States Conclusions, and Italy in this matter, but no doubt it would be possible to Minute 11.) collect the necessary numbers from the ships of other neutral countries.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had not yet completed his enquiries into this question and would like a little more time to consider this proposal.

The War Cabinet deferred further consideration of this matter.

Turkey. 5    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

Negotiations for had that morning seen M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, who Anglo-Franco-    had stated that, while M. Daladier was as anxious as we were \ to Turkish Treaty, secure the Treaty with Turkey, he found some difficulty in accepting (Previous        the wording which we had suggested in the article dealing with Reference:       the provision of gold to Turkey.   M. Daladier hoped, therefore, W.M. (39) 29th that we would give discretion to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, Conclusions,      to settle any minor outstanding points, in order to secure the Treaty Minute 8.)       forthwith.   He (the Secretary of State) had replied that he was willing to do this, provided that he was assured that the French Government accepted our view that no gold should be handed over to Turkey until the Treaty came into force.  M. Corbin had replied that this was certainly the view of the French Government.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer sai(f that he was in complete agreement with the line taken by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Policy of the 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said tJhat he

Soviet Govern. nad had a conversation the previous afternoon with M. Maisky, ment- the Soviet Ambassador, when the latter had given him the answer

(Previous to the questions he had asked on the 23rd September. The substance Eeference:       of M. Maisky&apos;s statement was as follows: 

W.M. (39) 28th (a) there had been no change since the Spring of this year in Conclusions, the policy of the Government of the U.S.S.R.;

Minute 8.) (j) relations between the U.S.S.R. and Germany were governed

by the Non-Aggression Pact which the Government of the U.S.S.R. had signed with that country;

(c) the line of demarcation between the portions of Poland

occupied by Germany and the U.S.S.R. respectively was provisional, and did not represent a final settlement. The future attitude of the Government of the U.S.S.R. towards Poland was complicated by so many imponderable factors that it was not possible for the Government of the U.S.S.R. to declare their position at the present time. In reply to a question by the Secretary of State as to whether the Government of the U.S.S.R. contemplated the ultimate establishment of an independent Poland, M. Maisky had said that he had nothing to add on this subject. M. Maisky had dilated upon the administrative measures taken by the U.S.S.R. in the occupied portion of Poland, the Soviet advance into which constituted a great act of liberation;

(d) the Government of the U.S.S.R. intended to maintain their

attitude of neutrality towards the conflict in Western Europe, provided that we and the French did nothing to render this impossible;

(e) there was nothing obscure in the attitude of the U.S.S.R.

&apos; towards Roumania, which was defined by the declaration of neutrality given by the Soviet Government to the Roumanian Government simultaneously with the similar declaration given by that Government to us;

(/) Estonia had nothing to fear from the Government of the U.S.S.R., provided that they maintained a correct attitude of neutrality and refrained from aggression against the Soviet Union;

(g) as regards Anglo-Soviet trade, the Government of the U.S.S.R. were prepared to enter into discussions, provided that these were really desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government. M. Maisky anticipated, however, that considerable difficulties would arise in any such negotiations in view in particular of our action in holding up export permits for materials ordered in this country and paid for prior to the outbreak of war with Germany.

The Secretary of State added that as regards Anglo-Soviet trade he was in consultation with the Minister of Economic Warfare and that he proposed also to consult His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, before asking for a decision from the War Cabinet. It would in his view be unwise to despatch a Trade Mission to Moscow unless assured in advance of its securing a successful issue.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

German-Soviet 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

Sino-Japanese 8.   The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to tele-

Conflict, gram No. 1102, dated the 26th September, 1939, received from His

(Previous        Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Shanghai.   This telegram showed that Eeferenee:       Sir Archibald Clark Kerr was under a misapprehension as to the W.M. (39) 28th policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, since he appeared to think Conclusions,      that during his forthcoming conversations with General Chiang Minute 7.)       Kai-shek at Chungking it would be his duty to do all in his power to facilitate the opening of negotiations for the purpose of bringing to an end the present conflict in China.  In fact the War Cabinet had not done more than agree that the Ambassador should sound&gt; General Chiang Kai-shek as to his attitude towards the Japanese suggestion forwarded by Sir Robert Craigie.  The Chiefs of Staff had expressed the opinion that from the strictly military point of view the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese conflict was to the advantage of this country.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thought that the position had now been made perfectly clear to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Shanghai, in a further telegram (No. 963) which he had sent him the previous afternoon (the 27th September, 1939). On the general question of our attitude towards the Sino-Japanese conflict, it should be remembered that the Chiefs of Staff had qualified their advice by stressing the importance of doing nothing which might exasperate the Japanese Government into taking action against us.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff Committee had now prepared a report recording the conclusions which he had communicated to the War Cabinet at their meeting held on the 26th September, 1939.

The Prime Minister said that in his view it was to our interest to steer a middle course and to avoid giving offence either to the Chinese or the Japanese Governments. It was important to encourage those elements in Japan which were friendly to us. At the same time we must be careful not to prejudice General Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s position in any way.

The War Cabinet-Took note of the discussion and asked to be furnished with the appreciation prepared by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on the situation reached in the Sino-Japanese hostilities.

The Far Eastern       9.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegram

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considered that the prospects in this matter were encouraging, and that we should be well advised to take no hasty action. He had not yet received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, a statement of the views of the United States Government in this matter.

10. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs stated that the Dominion High Commissioners were very anxious to have another discussion with the Foreign Secretary and other members of the War Cabinet. One point on which they were particularly anxious to ascertain the views of the Home Government, was the

Meeting with the Dominion High Commis sioners.

It was arranged that the following Ministers should see the Dominion High Commissioners at 6 p.m. the same day : 

The Prime Minister.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence. The Minister without Portfolio. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.

Suggested Loan 11.   The First Sea Lord stated that the Australian Government

of Ships from had offered to put one of tJhe Cruisers from the Royal Australian the Royal Navy at our disposal.   The Admiralty did not propose to accept

Australian this offer, but they were very anxious to obtain the loan from Nayy. Australia of five Destroyers.   These vessels were not performing

any very valuable service in Australian waters, and it was proposed to invite the Commonwealth Government to agree that these Destroyers should proceed to the Mediterranean, where they would relieve other Destroyers which would proceed to Home waters.

The War Cabinet authorised the Admiralty to arrange for this proposal to be submitted to the Commonwealth Government.

Establishment 12.   The War Cabinet took note of a telegram which had been

of Flying Train- prepared in consultation with the Secretary of State for Air and ing Schools In the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and which the Prime the Dominions. Minister had despatched on the 26th September to the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. These telegrams put forward the suggestion that the Dominion Governments should contribute to the common cause by establishing in their own countries elementary, subsidiary and advanced training schools.

The War Cabinet warmly approved this proposal. In the event of favourable replies being received, the scheme was one which it would be very desirable for the Prime Minister to bring to the notice of the House of Commons, in one of his weekly statements.

Meetings for the Consideration of Periodical Reports.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 7th Conclusions, Minute 14.)

13. The Prime Minister drew the attention of his colleagues to the weekly, fortnightly and monthly Reports which they were now receiving, as a result of the decision taken at the meeting referred to in the margin. With the exception of the Reports circulated by the Service Ministers and by the Chiefs of Staff, these documents had not so far been placed on the Agenda paper for any meeting of the War Cabinet. He suggested that there should be special meetings of the War Cabinet, perhaps twice a month, at which the business would be the consideration of these periodical Reports.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) that special meetings should be held to consider the

periodical Reports submitted by Departments, the first such meeting to be held on a day to be arranged in the following week;

(ii) to invite Departments to append to these Reports, in

suitable cases, a summary of Conclusions or recommendations. (This would not, of course, apply to those Reports which are in effect summaries of information under a few main headings.)

Article by Mr. 14.   The Prime Minister referred to an article by Mr. Lloyd

Lloyd George.   George, which had been published in a Sunday newspaper, Question of      reflecting on the Polish Government&apos;s conduct of affairs during the Censorship.       German invasion of their country.  A reply to Mr. Lloyd George (Previous        by the Polish Ambassador had also been published in the Press.

article to be released forthwith.

The article contained a good deal of contentious matter, but he

was satisfied that it was impossible to prevent its publication.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Ministry of        15.   The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with the Information.     decision of the War Cabinet at the Meeting noted in the margin, (Previous        he had prepared a Paper on responsibility for the supply of news Reference:       to the public, which he had circulated to the Departments and to W.M. (39) 20th the Ministry of Information.  The Secretary of State for War had Conclusions,      indicated that, while he was prepared to work the scheme, he Minute 15.)      thought it would be better that each Department should be responsible for the issue of information to the press on matters which concerned it.  This was very much the conclusion which had been forming in his own mind.   He had discussed the matter the previous day with Lord Macmillan, who had formed the same view. He was satisfied that it would be better from every point of view that each Department should be responsible for the issue of material to the Press on its own subjects.   The Ministry of Information would continue to be responsible for propaganda and for general

 censorship. General agreement was expressed with this view, and it was agreed that the details of the proposed re-organisation should be worked out before any announcement on the matter was.made.

239 W.M. 39 (39)

The War Cabinet agreed 

(i) that there should be a reversal to the system in force prior to the institution of the Ministry of Information, whereby each Department was responsible for the issue of information to the Press on matters within its own sphere;

(ii) that the Ministry of Information should continue to be responsible for propaganda and for general censorship; (iii) that the Ministry of Information, in consultation with the Departments concerned, should at once proceed to work out the changes in organisation involved. Until this had been done, no public announcement should be made
