W.M. 11 (39).

1. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of the arrangements which had been made to ensure that, in addition to the daily summary which was communicated to the War Cabinet by the Chiefs of Staff, any highly important and secret information should be communicated to Ministers as soon as possible. The channel of communication would be from departmental War Rooms to the Central War Room, and from thence to the War Cabinet Offices, which would be responsible for informing the Ministers concerned. It was hoped that this system would obviate the need for Ministers to ring up the Central War Room or other Departments for news of the situation.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

2. The Secretary of State for Air said tlhat, apart from the dropping of leaflets which had taken place successfully on the night of the 9 / 10th September, there were no operations to report. The dropping of leaflets would not be carried out every night, but from time to time at his discretion.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported certain information to the effect that at present propaganda as such was ineffective in Germany, but that anything in the shape of news was eagerly received.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To invite the Minister for Information to prepare a Report, in the light of all available information, on the efficacy of the present propaganda campaign undertaken in Germany through the agency of the Royal Air Force.

Naval Situation. 3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there was (Previous evidence that our measures for the protection of trade were

Reference:        becoming more effective. No shipping had been lost in the Western W.M. (39), 10th approaches during the last three days, but two merchantmen had Conclusions,      been sunk off the East Coast in the last two days.  In the first five Minute 2.)        days of war our average loss had been 11,000 tons per day, whereas in the last three days it had fallen to 5,000 tons per day, but it was too early to accept these figures as definite proof that our measures were meeting with success.  The figures for attacks on enemy submarines were also encouraging.  A considerable number of attacks on enemy submarines were reported, but the results could not be assessed with certainty.

A German tanker, which had been chartered by the German Government during the Spanish war, was now anchored at the &apos; entrance of Ferrol.   This had been reported to the Foreign Office with a view to diplomatic action in Spain.

Publication of The First Lord of the Admiralty regretted to have to report

Losses. the loss of one of our submarines, which had been torpedoed by

another of our own submarines in mistake for an enemy. The question arose whether to publish the loss or not.

After some discussion, the War Cabinet agreed as follows: 

That for the present the policy to be followed should be that the publication of losses of fighting ships, about which the enemy had no means of discovering otherwise, should be withheld. It would be necessary, of course, to inform the relatives of personnel lost with the ship, but the notification could take the form of a telegram stating simply that the men had been killed in action.

The Military Situation.

(Previous &apos;Reference: W.M. (39), 9th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

Poland.

France.

4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet of the situation of the Land Forces in Poland and on the Western Front, and made a brief reference to the despatch of the British Field Force.

The Poles were putting up a good fight, and were defending Warsaw vigorously. Their main army was still intact. Eight divisions had been caught in the Pozen Salient, but it was hoped that some might break through. A line of defence was being taken up on the Vistula. Polish difficulties were increased by the very dry weather, which made the Vistula fordable at all points.

The French had established a line of infantry along the whole front of the Siegfried Line. There were now no Germans in front of that line.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Exchange Position: Inflation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 2nd Conclusions, Minute 10.)

Exhaustion of

Exchange

Resources.

5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (39) 15) dealing with (i) Our exchange resources, (ii) Inflation.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed his colleagues that certain figures contained in his Memorandum must be regarded as highly secret.* The Chancellor briefly explained the position disclosed in the Memorandum. In time of war this country could make payments abroad in only four ways : 

(a) by borrowing from abroad, and in particular from the

United States:

(b) by means of exports :

(c) by requisitioning foreign securities owned by United

Kingdom nationals :

(d) in gold.

As regards (d), after making due allowance for the present currency value of the  , the position was better than in 1914. As regards (a), (b) and (c), the position was, however, far worse than in 1914.

The most urgent of the problems confronting the Treasury was that of making payments in the &quot; difficult currencies,&quot; namely : 

American and Canadian dollars. Swedish and Norwegian kroner. Swiss and Belgian francs. Dutch guilders. Argentine pesos.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer invited the War Cabinet to issue directions immediately calling for 

(1) the maximum possible restriction of unnecessary imports

involving payments in these currencies and early action as regards rationing schemes for home consumption of commodities needing to be bought with such currencies;

(2) the greatest possible encouragement to the export trade. In

this connection steps should be taken to restrict the consumption at home of goods which might be marketed abroad, and to expand as much as possible the production of export goods available in this country, and particularly of coal, which seemed likely to be almost as valuable to us as gold;

* In view of this, all copies of the document are being recalled.


79

W.M. 11 (39).

(3) the restriction of payments by the Defence Services,

particularly in North America, to the absolute minimum of essential and speedily available services;

(4) the maintenance of a firm attitude towards demands from

our Allies on our exchange resources, particularly in the case of France, which possessed more gold than this country.

The War Cabinet were informed of the main directions in which the Exchange problem affected Departments. In the case of both the War Office and Air Ministry there was an irreducible minimum of certain items which could only be obtained from the United States. The chief of these was machine tools. Fortunately, the number of commodities in which we were entirely dependent on the United States was much smaller than in 1914-18.

In regard to the Ministry of Supply, there would be abig demand, amounting perhaps to  8,000,000 or  10,000,000 a fath, for zinc and electrolytic copper from Canada.

In the Ministry of Food a Purchasing Board had already been set up and had been given directions to pay regard to the Exchange position in making their purchases. In regard to raw materials, such as copper and aluminium, there was the possibility of making a bargain within the British Empire, whereby producers would continue to supply at the pre-war price, provided that we would undertake to accept delivery of their total output throughout the war.

In regard to the export trade, action had already been taken which would substantially reduce our imports, and further action was contemplated.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the second main task-confronting the Treasury was to counteract the strong tendency to inflation, which was the usual accompaniment of a great war. The essential, instruments to prevent or restrict inflation were (a) monetary policy, (b) taxation and (c) loan policy.

In regard to (6), taxation, the necessity for raising loans on a large scale was not an argument in favour of abstaining from severe additions to taxation. Broadly speaking, the subscribers to war loans were not individuals, however wealthy, but the various institutions which collected savings, such as the insurance companies and the building societies.

In the course of the discussion, it was suggested that the present was the proper time for introducing the heavy taxation and other drastic proposals of which the Chancellor had spoken.

Reference was also made to the need for ensuring that reserves were not consumed in non-essential civil demands: the use of steel in cinema construction was instanced.

It was felt that there would also have to be a considerable reduction in civil building generally, but that it would probably be desirable not to force the pace of such restrictive measures in the period of dislocation immediately after the outbreak of war, which was likely to result in a temporary rise in unemployment.

After discussion, the War Cabinet: 

(i) approved generally the line of policy outlined in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Paper, and in particular the four proposals set out at A-A above : (ii) authorised the Treasury to co-ordinate action in regard to our Exchange resources and to arrange for the necessary measures to give effect to the exchange policy contained in these four proposals, in consultation with the Departments concerned.

Air Raid Precautions.

Question of Payment of Personnel.

6. In the course of discussion on the preceding item, the attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the possible effect of payment to whole-time A.R.P. personnel of remuneration at the rate of  3 a week. Even if such payment had no inflationary effects, criticism would fasten on the comparison between this rate and the emoluments of the private soldier. It was also suggested that there was grave risk that payment at the rate of  3 a week to whole-time A.R.P. personnel might encourage a claim that all A.R.P. personnel should be paid.

The Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security informed the War Cabinet that the great majority of A.R.P. personnel were voluntary workers. A claim to make fro rata payments to part-time workers had been firmly resisted. There was, however, an essential nucleus of whole-time workers in certain services, particularly the Auxiliary Fire Brigade, the Police War Reserve and the Stretcher-bearers. There were certain areas in which the complement of whole-time workers in these services had not been filled, while in other areas there had been a rush of volunteers, and it was possible that a certain number of men might have been taken on too freely. The whole position would be most carefully investigated in the light of reports received, and if the number of whole-time A.R.P. workers was found to be excessive in any area, the number would be reduced.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Trade with Italy.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), Conclusions, Minute 7.)

8th

7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum (War Cabinet Paper W.M. (39) 20), in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated the nature of the potential demand of the various Departments for Italian materials and commodities, expressed the view that it should be a condition of the export of coal to Italy that it should be carried in Italian bottoms, discussed the possibility of financing increased trade with Italy through the existing clearing agreement, and stressed the importance of insuring that no arrangements made were inconsistent with our general plans for blockade and economic warfare.

On the blockade aspect, emphasis was laid on the need for taking into account Italian imports from all sources. In this connection attention was drawn to telegram 822, dated the 8th September, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, which suggested that the Italian authorities were themselves anxious to prevent their country from being utilised as a channel for German trade, that they fully appreciated that we must satisfy ourselves as to the bona fides of the destination of goods imported by Italian firms, but that they were equally anxious that the genuine requirements of Italian trade should meet with the minimum of interference. Sir Percy Loraine considered that there was good reason to hope that it would be possible to find means for setting up, in collaboration with the Italian authorities, adequate control machinery in the more important lines of trade.

As regards exports of coal to Italy, a discussion took place as to whether it would be wiser to keep our hand on the stream of supplies and in the first instance to make a short-term agreement with Italy, or whether, in view of the risk that Germany might be able to export largely from the Polish Teschen coalfields, it might not be desirable at once to enter into a long-term agreement. The War Cabinet were informed also that, from the point of view of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, especially in connection with forthcoming discussions with neutral Governments, it was desirable that the total output of United Kingdom coal should be increased substantially beyond the anticipated figure of 260 million tons per annum.   This would, however, involve a lengthening of working


81

W.M. 11 (39).

hours, a course to which the Board of Trade considered the Trades Unions would only agree when miners at present unemployed had been absorbed by the industry.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that the Secrtary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform

His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome : 

(i) that the War Cabinet took note of the view expressed

in his telegram 822 of the 8th September, 1939, that the prospects of securing an agreement with the Italian Government on trade questions were favourable;

(ii) that the Secretary of State hoped very shortly to be

in a position to furnish the Ambassador with the material required to enable him to open discussions with the Italian Government, both as regards our blockade policy and as regards measures to ensure that the genuine requirements of Italian trade should meet with the minimum of interference;

(iii) that it was accordingly proposed at an early date

unobtrusively to despatch to Rome a number of experts who would be in a position to assist the Ambassador in his discussions with the Italian Government :

(b) that it should be left to the Secretary of State for Foreign

Affairs to determine, in consultation with the Ministers concerned: 

(i) the main lines of the proposals which our Ambassador should put before the Italian Government; and

(ij) what officers should be sent to Rome to assist the Ambassador as indicated in (a) (iii) above :

(c) to invite the Minister of Economic Warfare, in connection

with (b) (i) above, to furnish the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as soon as possible, with a statement of his proposals :

(d) that, as regards the purchase of air material, the repre-

sentative of the Air Ministry to be sent to Rome should consider not only British requirements, but also the possibility of purchasing bombers for re-sale to the French Government:

(e) that, as regards coal, it would be necessary to determine, in

the light of the actual negotiation, whether or not it would be necessary at once to enter into a long-term agreement in order to avoid being forestalled by the Germans.

^ai&lt;* 8.   The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet

Warnings and that he had discussed with the Minister for Home Security and the bscuration of Commander in Chief, Fighter Command, first, whether the general Snttag. air-raid warning could be given in any other way, and, secondly,

(Previous        whether the black-out could be mitigated.

Reference: On the first point, after full discussion with the Commander

w.M. (39)( in Chief, Fighter Command, he was satisfied that there should be Conclusion^ no substantial alteration in the existing warning arrangements until Minute 15.)      after further experience.   Some mitigation might be possible if a

more satisfactory method of identifying aircraft could be found.

Steps were being taken for the protection of key workers in certain

factories so that they could continue at work after the general

warning.


82

Secondly, he was advised that the black-out in its present form was essential. He strongly advised that matters should be left as they were, though consideration could be given in the future to alterations based on practical experience.

The Minister for Home Security said that there had been a serious increase in the number of traffic accidents due to the blackout, and that arrangements had been made for the Minister of Transport to recommend certain measures to the public. He also reported that he was taking special measures to deal with certain factories where the screening arrangements were either defective or behindhand.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty questioned the basis on which the black-out had been conceived. He believed that precision bombing could be carried out only by daylight or moonlight, and he doubted whether the black-out as at present arranged would effectively prevent more indiscriminate bombing, while it constituted a serious burden on the nation as a whole.

After discussion the War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) that no alteration should be made in the existing arrange-

ments for air-raid warnings or for the black-out, pending further experience of their operation :

(2) that in the meantime, the Secretary of State for Air should

consult   with   the   Commander   in Chief, Fighter

Command, as to the possibility of modifying the

black-out, in particular in regard to the lighting of motor vebicles.

Richmond Terrace, S.W.I, September 11, 1939.
