W.M. 55 (39).

Air Operations. 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that the approach of

(Previous single enemy aircraft at a great height and speed had caused air Reference: r&amp;id warnings to be given on two occasions the day before in the W.M. (39) 64th Edinburgh area. No contact had been made by defending aircraft, Conclusions, an(j ft was doubtful whether the enemy had penetrated over the Minute 1.) coast.

A German submarine had been attacked by an aircraft off Aberdeen with hopeful results.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Naval Operations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 54th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a report had just been received that an East coast convoy near Flamborough Head was being shadowed by enemy aircraft, but an attack had not so far materialised. One merchant ship had been sunk near the Shetlands, and another, which had formed part of the convoy attacked off Cape Finisterre, was now thought to have been sunk, as a Swedish vessel had reported sighting two lifeboats with men on board. It was not known why the Swedish vessel had not picked the lifeboats up, but destroyers on their way home from the Mediterranean had been sent to investigate.

The Master of a Norwegian vessel, intercepted in the Northern patrol, said that he had been stopped by a warship of the Deutschland class on the 12th October, east of Newfoundland. Further enquiries were being made, but it was possible that this might be the Admiral Scheer, about which there was still no authentic news.

In view of our present Fleet dispositions, the First Lord thought that the possibility of a German landing ought not to be entirely overlooked, especially now that the nights were getting longer. He thought the Chiefs of Staff should bear the possibility in mind.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that there was a constant air patrol over the North Sea, but he agreed that the possibility that something might be attempted when the weather was suitable should not be overlooked.

The War Cabinet 

(a) Took note of the statement by the First Lord of the

Admiralty.

(b) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider whether there was

any risk of a seaborne invasion or raid, and, if so, what steps should be taken to meet it.

W.M. (39) 54th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

Military 3   The Secretary of State for War said that the numbers of

Operations. German Divisions in the various areas had changed and were now (Previous        estimated as follows : 

?^e,ren- f.: .... Divisions.

Poland    ...   *............ 25-29

Centre of Germany     ...      ...      ... 20-33

Western Area ......... ... 67-91

There had been some increase in the German strength in the Saar area, but they had withdrawn their troops everywhere behind the German frontier an action which might be the prelude to a renewed &quot; peace offensive.&quot;

Two Territorial Army machine-gun battalions were about to go to France, and he had invited the United States Military Attache to visit them.

The War Cabinet took note of the above.statement.

Manufacture of Arsene Gas in Germany.

Stocks of Arsenic in Sweden. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 7.)

4. The Secretary of State for War referred to the large quantities of arsenic accumulated in Sweden as a waste product m the production of iron-ore. As it appeared probable that Germany had succeeded in making arsene, and might be intending to use it, it would be advisable to take steps to ensure that the Swedes should not supply arsenic to Germany.

There was some discussion as to the best way of handling the matter, in the course of which it was pointed out that, if we were to buy arsenic ourselves, our motives might be misinterpreted, but that, if we approached the Swedish Government and asked them to ensure that the arsenic was not exported to Germany, they would probably comply very readily when they realised the use to which it might be put.

The War Cabinet agreed 

To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to consult with the Secretary of State for War, and to consider what steps might usefully be taken to prevent supplies of arsenic being exported from Sweden to Germany.

Air Policy.

(Previous References: W.M. (39) 47th Conclusions, Minute 4, and 51st Conclusions, Minute 11.)

5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff covering a draft communication for the French Government concerning our air policy (Paper W.P. (39) 86).

The Chief of the Air Staff drew attention to certain differences between the form of the record of the original War Cabinet&apos;s decision on Air Policy and that of the draft communication to the French now under consideration.

Some discussion took place on the wording of paragraph 3 (iii), which it was felt should be expressed rather less definitely.

The War Cabinet 

Approved the draft Memorandum for communication to the French, subject to the following amendments to paragraph 3 (iii): 

(a) after &quot; latter,&quot; in line 6, insert the words &quot; it would

be a matter for immediate decision by the British War Cabinet whether&quot; :

(b) delete the last sentence.

High Altitude 6.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum

Spray with by the Secretary of State for War proposing certain trials of high Mustard Gas.    altitude spray with mustard gas (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 46).

The Secretary of State for War explained that the War Office desired authority for the trial of this form of warfare in Algeria, where suitable ground was available. The French were doubtful of the efficacy of high spray, and it was desirable to convince them conclusively. They would like to have the trials completed before the 1st November. Our spray containers would not fit French aircraft, and it was necessary therefore to use our own machines. There was, of course, some risk of political capital being made out of these trials if knowledge of them should leak out, but this risk must be faced.

The War Cabinet-

Authorised the War Office to carry out, in collaboration with the Air Ministry and the French, trials of high altitude spray with mustard gas in Algeria.

Bofors Guns, 7   ihe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, since

(Previous he ha(j lagt

brought the question of Bofors Guns before the War Reference: Cabinet on the 14th October, General Orbay had seen the Swedish W.M. (39) 47th Minister with a view to Turkey taking over the outstanding portion Conclusions, 0f our contract. The Swedish Minister had been somewhat evasive Minute 7.) an(j ^ao&gt; passe(j General Orbay on to Captain Combe, the Bofors representative in London. Negotiations were apparently still proceeding, but Captain Combe stated that, while the company were quite prepared to fulfil the contracts either for us or for the Turks, they had orders to manufacture only for Sweden, and the Swedish Government had placed officers in the factory to see that these orders were carried out.

On the financial side, General Orbay had promised to refer to his Government on the question of Turkey paying for these guns from the  15,000,000 gold loan which we had offered, but had been doubtful whether they would agree. The only other way of financing the transaction would be for us to provide the necessary foreign exchange against the Turkish Armaments credit. He had discussed this matter with the Service Ministers on the 18th October, 1939, and they had come to the conclusion that it would be to our advantage to let the Turks have the foreign exchange required for this purchase, even if it meant a reduction in the amount available for our own purposes. The limit suggested was  750,000 which would more than cover the cost of the 162 guns which the Turks stated were their immediate requirement. It might also be possible to arrange for the Turks to lend us, say, half the guns until our own production could meet our needs.

There was another aspect of the situation. Captain Combe alleged that the Swedes were extremely surprised to find that we had so quietly acquiesced in their refusal to continue deliveries of these guns. He (Captain Combe) was of the opinion that we might still obtain deliveries, if we applied pressure on the ground that the Swedes were breaking their word to us because they were frightened of the Germans. There was no doubt that morally we had a good case.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was glad to hear that further pressure might produce results. He was prepared to help in any way he could, but felt that he must have some indication of the means by which we could apply pressure on the Swedes.

The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consult with the Minister for Economic Warfare.

The Prime Minister thought that we could take the line with the Swedish Government that they had broken their word, which could only be considered an unfriendly act with unfortunate consequences to the future relations between Sweden and this country.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer welcomed the suggestion to apply pressure on the Swedish Government to obtain delivery of these guns. He had heard of the conclusion of the Service Ministers mentioned by Lord Chatfield, that they were prepared to surrender  750,000 of foreign exchange to enable the Turks to purchase the guns, but he found this conclusion somewhat indefinite, since no indication was given of what compensating sacrifice would be made. The foreign exchange situation was causing him great concern, more particularly since the requisitioning of securities was producing much less than had been expected. The War Cabinet could not evade the dilemma that, if they bought guns for the Turks from Sweden, they must, for instance, reduce purchases of aircraft from Canada.

The War Cabinet: 

(a) Took note of the statement by the Minister for Co-ordimv tion of Defence.

(6) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, after consultation with the Minister for Economic Warfare, to bring pressure to bear on the Swedish Government in order to obtain delivery to this country of the Bofors Guns outstanding on our contracts.

Italy- 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

Eeported War Cabinet that, according to a recent telegram from Sir Erie

Refusal to sell Phipps, Germany had been attempting to buy a number of Submarines to submarines from Italy. These would, according to the report, have Germany. become part of the German Navy and would have been manned by

German crews.

The Italian Government were said, to have refused the offer on the ground that all submarines in the Italian Navy were needed for their own use.

The War Cabinet took note of this report.

France.

Anticipated French reactions to a further peace offensive launched against France alone.

9. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet that a report had reached him, from Roumanian sources, that the French Government and people might show signs of weakness if Germany should launch a peace offensive against France alone, with the object of detaching her from Great Britain.

It was agreed in discussion that the German tactics might very likely turn out to be as suggested. This would be in consonance with the attitude adopted by the German Press. It might also be significant that German troops had voluntarily retired behind the German frontier in the Saar area. It was not anticipated, however, that such tactics would succeed in dividing French and British opinion. On the contrary, the signature of the Turkish treaty had probably given the Frencb additional confidence.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed with this view. Nothing which he had heard from Sir Eric Phipps or M. Corbin had led him to doubt the steadfastness of the French. He would, however, ask Sir Eric Phipps for an up-to-date appreciation of the state of feeling in France.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Finland.

Negotiations with Russia.

10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informe~d the War Cabinet that he had no very recent information on this subject.

Italy.

War Trade Negotiations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (89) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 10.)

11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister for Economic Warfare dealing with the recent discussions in Rome on Italian trade with this country and with Germany under war conditions (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 47).

In the course of a statement explanatory of his Memorandum, the Minister for Economic Warfare brought the following points to the notice of the War Cabinet: 

(1) The appointment was proposed of a permanent Anglo-Italian Commercial Committee to deal with 

(a) Anglo-Italian   trade   relations   and additional

purchases in Italy for our war requirements;

(b) the machinery of payment;

(c) contraband control.


465

W.M. 58 (39).

(2) Of these questions, contraband control was the most

delicate. It was the Minister&apos;s view that a permanent Commercial Committee offered the best chance of securing Italian collaboration in the limitation of their trade with Germany. It had emerged from the discussions in Rome that the Italian authorities might be prepared to consider the institution of a scheme which might in time develop into a system of rationing for Italian imports.

(3) Sir Percy Loraine had informed the Italian Government

that we should be prepared to consider the draft of an Agreement for the establishment of such a Committee.

The Italian authorities had accordingly sent a draft agreement for our inspection (Annex A to W.P. (G.) (39) 47), which took the shape of a formal agreement between Heads of States.

(4) An Agreement in this form was open to the political

objections 

(a) that it might be regarded in Germany as a diplomatic sequel to the Turkish Treaty, and might call down German wrath upon Italy to an extent which the Italian authorities had not appreciated;

(6) that it would involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in a recognition of the King of Italy as King of Albania.

(5) In the Minister&apos;s view, an agreement in inter-Govern-

mental form, such as that attached to the Memorandum as Annex B, would meet these objections and also a further objection to which Annex A was open, namely, that it conferred somewhat excessive powers on the Commercial Committee.

(6) It was now a matter of extreme urgency that our negotiators

should return to Rome, and should be followed (as soon as the Agreement had been signed) by representatives of our Purchasing Departments. In the absence of our negotiators the German representatives in Rome were sparing no pains to forestall us. These considerations were brought out in a telegram sent by Sir Percy Loraine on the previous day (telegram No. 69 from Rome).

The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that information would be likely to reach our contraband control through the channel of the Commercial Committee much more quickly than through the ordinary diplomatic channels.

Some discussion followed regarding the &quot;Heads of States&quot; form in which the Italian authorities had chosen to draft the Agreement. It was not thought that there would now be any great political objection in the House of Commons, or in this country as a whole, to our recognition at this stage of the Italian conquest of Albania. There might, indeed, be positive advantages in the adoption of the &quot; Heads of States &quot; form, e.g., a document in this form would attract far more attention in the neutral press than one in inter-Governmental form. On the other hand, it would be well to be sure that the Italian authorities had adopted the &apos;&apos; Heads of States&apos;&apos; form after consideration of the possibility of trouble with Germany. It would be unfortunate if, in deference to German pressure, the Italians were at the last moment to re-open the drafting of the agreement.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) To authorise the Minister &quot;for Economic Warfare to arrange for the continuance of the negotiations on the


466

lines proposed in his Memorandum, and that for that purpose his representative should be instructed to return to Rome forthwith, (ii) That we should propose to the Italian Government that the Agreement for the establishment of an Anglo-Italian Commercial Committee should be in the inter-Governmental form. If, however, the Italian authorities indicated that they wished the &quot; Heads of States &quot; form to be adopted, and did not anticipate trouble from Germany on this account, we should be prepared to assent.

Lighting Restrictions.

First Report of War Cabinet Committee. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 29th Conclusions, Minute 13.)

12. The War Cabinet had before them the First Report of the Ministerial Committee appointed at the Meeting referred to in the margin to consider and review the existing lighting restrictions (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 44).

The Lord Privy Seal said that the Committee had not been able to submit any drastic proposals. He hoped however that they might be kept in being to watch experiments, and asked to report again in a few weeks&apos; time. In his view, this was a bad moment to suggest any important relaxation of restrictions. The country was getting used to the &apos;&apos; Black-Out&apos;&apos; and it was quite likely that, if it were modified, there would be an outcry in opposition. The Minister of Supply had taken the line that output was not seriously suffering and, while the Secretary of State for Air was not able to be so optimistic, improvements in the internal lighting of factories were being carried through quite rapidly which would facilitate output generally. Small relaxations were also proposed to facilitate urgent outdoor work.

The Committee had accepted some proposals for the improved lighting of trains, but were satisfied that it would be dangerous to go further at present. There had been a very large number of accidents on the roads as a result of the &quot;Black-Out,&quot; but the figures for the later weeks were better than those for the first weeks of the War.

The First Lord of the Admiralty was not convinced by the arguments in the Report, and thought that, if enough trouble were taken, it should be possible to devise a carefully controlled system of diminished lighting, thus avoiding the heavy loss of life that was being incurred and the unnecessary restriction of productive capacity.

The Lord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfolio said that they had gone into the matter with very strong hopes of being able to propose important relaxations, but there were very real difficulties; e.g., a few street lights were more dangerous than none, and a continuous chain of lights, if they were bright enough to be of any use, could be seen from so far away that it was not possible to turn them out in time on receipt of an Air Raid warning.

The Secretary of State for Air said that there was no desire on the part of his Department to make difficulties, and he hoped that some satisfactory way of relaxing the restrictions might be found; but on present information he thought it advisable to wait for a few weeks before making any further changes beyond those recommended in the Report. ;vV  &gt;

The Prime Minister thought that, if there ythve to be relaxations at the present moment, this might encourage the view that the War was not being seriously conducted and might have a dangerous effect in weakening the public resolution.   He felt that


305

467

W.M. 35 (39).

it would be far better to accept the Report, and then to wait a few weeks. During this period further proposals could be devised to ameliorate lighting conditions, and it could be seen how far people could accommodate themselves to the restrictions.

There was general agreement with this view.

The War Cabinet accordingly agreed : 

To accept the recommendations of the Report, namely 

(i) that, subject to the particular relaxations indicated

in the Report, the existing lighting restrictions should for the present remain in force:

(ii) that the Committee should be retained in existence

and should report to the War Cabinet further on the matter in a few weeks&apos; time.
