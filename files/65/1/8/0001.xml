Air Operations. 1.   The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet

(Previous that further leaflet dropping operations had taken place over

Reference: North-West  Germany,  including Kiel,  on the night of the

W.M. (39), 7th 7/8th September.   The aircraft had been unopposed and had all

Conclusions, returned safely.   Apart from certain reconnaissances, there had

Minute 1.) been no other operations worth mentioning. ||3k

A discussion took place as to whether the dropping of leaflets should be continued. It was pointed out that there was a strong feeling in some quarters that it was not right that, while Poland was being severely bombed by Germany, our operations should be confined to the dropping of propaganda. On the other hand, there was good reason to believe that the German&apos; authorities feared the effect of our propaganda, and the fact that our aircraft were able to fly with impunity all over the North-West of Germany would have a depressing effect on the morale of the German people.

It was generally agreed that the material which should be incorporated in the leaflets was a matter which could best be left to the discretion of the Ministry of Information, but that the suggestion that the Prime Minister&apos;s Broadcast to the German people would form a suitable leaflet should be brought to the notice of the Ministry.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That the distribution of propaganda leaflets by the Royal Air Force was a valuable operation which should be repeated from time to time as and when opportunity offered.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 7th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that, in the previous twenty-four hours, four British merchant ships had been sunk out of a total of eight attacked. There had been no loss of life, as the ships, had been sunk by gun-fire after the crews had been removed. He proposed to prepare a calculation which would enable a comparison to be made between the present losses and those sustained at the height of the German submarine campaign in 1917, in relation to the total tonnage involved in each case. This, he thought, would show that the present campaign, though intense, was not comparable in its results to the previous one.

. All possible steps were being taken to introduce the convoy system, and the Admiralty were proposing to restrict the sailings of valuable fast ships until they had been armed. There were numerous reports of attacks on enemy submarines by our Destroyers, though the results could not be assessed with certainty.

It was proposed, subject to the concurrence of the Air Ministry, that two Squadrons of long-range flying-boats, now in the Mediterranean, should be moved to stations where they could assist in the protection of trade on the South-Western approaches and off the coast of Spain. ,

The Chief of the Air Staff signified his concurrence with this suggestion.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Army 3.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the

Situation. War Cabinet of the latest situation on the Polish front.  The most

(Previous important battle in progress was taking place 34 kilometres north of

Reference: Warsaw. On the rested! the front the Germans appeared to be W.M. (39), 7th re-organizing. The Polish Army was fighting well and had not Conclusions,      been broken.&apos;

On the French front it seemed that the French Armies had everywhere reached the Franco-German Frontier and.perhaps in a few places had crossed it.

In reply to an enquiry by the Prime Minister, the Chief of the Imperial General Stan said that the French were fully prepared against a possible turning movement through Holland and Belgium.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Assistance from 4 The chief of the Imperial General Staff read to the War India. Cabinet a telegram which had been received by the Secretary of

State for India from the Indian Government, a copy of which is

annexed to these Minutes (Annex).

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That an expression of their appreciation of this generous offer of assistance should be conveyed to the Government of India.

5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Note by the Minister of Home Security on the Evacuation of Government Departments (W.P. (39) 10).

The Minister of Home Security said that the Inter-Departmental Committee, which had been set up by the desire of the War Cabinet to consider the moves of certain special staffs in advance of the general move, had now reported. Their recommendations were given in his Note, and he drew particular attention to their views: 

(a) that first priority should be given to the moves of the supply

organisations of the Air Ministry and Admiralty to Harrogate and Bath respectively,

(b) that none of the moves should be ordered before the Office of

Works reported that arrangements were reasonably ready.

The First Commissioner of Works reported that instructions had been issued on Wednesday night to carry out the requisitioning of the premises required for the whole move. As regards the move of the Air Ministry to Harrogate, accommodation would be available on Monday, the 11th September, but under conditions which might be somewhat chaotic, and he would prefer that the move should be postponed, at least until Wednesday, the 13th September.

The accommodation for the Admiralty at Bath could also be got ready by Monday, but here again he would prefer to postpone it until later next week. In that event, however, owing to railway difficulties, the move could not take place before Thursday, and would then have to be carried out in two echelons extending over Friday. The 1,500 Ministry of Supply staff from Woolwich, which was second on the list of priority, was an entirely new demand, which had not been included in the original scheme, and he asked to be given a few days grace to find the necessary accommodation.

The Minister of Health reported that billeting notices were now being served, and that he was satisfied that the necessary room was everywhere available, though in certain cases it might at first be cramped and involve sleeping on floors.

A discussion ensued as to the time when these initial moves should take place. It was generally agreed that there was no imminent danger of an attack on Central London, and that it was therefore preferable that the moves should be delayed until the staffs concerned could move into quarters which were in proper order to

Evacuation of

Government

Departments.

receive them, so as to reduce to a minimum the interruption of work which these dislocations would cause.

The War Cabinet agreed ; 

(a) to authorise the evacuation of the Departmental staffs set out in paragraphs (1) to (3) of the Note by the Minister of Home Security (Paper No. W.P. (39) 10):

(6) that the time at which these moves should take place should be settled in consultation between the Minister of Home Security, the Ministers of the Departments concerned, the First Commissioner of Works and the Treasury, on the understanding that none of them should be ordered before the Office of Works and Ministry of Health were satisfied that the local arrangements had reached a sufficient stage of preparation to enable the staffs concerned to settle down to work with reasonable efficiency :

(c) to approve the further recommendations of the Inter-

Departmental Committee in paragraphs (A), (B), (C) and (D) of W.P. (39) 10, the Minister of Home Security being responsible for taking the necessary action with the Ministry of Information :

(d) that it was undesirable that publicity should be given to

this matter by questions in Parliament, and that this aspect of the matter should be carefully watched. (The Prime Minister undertook to bear this point in mind.)

(e) that the question of the main move should be a matter for

decision later by the War Cabinet.

Turkey. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in

(Previous accordance with the decisions of the War Cabinet noted in the

Eeferences:      margin, he had telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, W.M. (39), 5th  impressing upon him the urgency of securing the definite con-Conclusions,      currence of the Turkish Government in the proposed political treaty Minute 2, and   and authorising him as regards the proposed gold loan to go as far, 6th Conclusions, if necessary, as  15 millions. He had also sent him a telegram with Minute 8.)        regard to the Turkish tobacco question.   The Ambassador had since reported (Telegram 406 from Ankara) that he had seen the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs and had informed him that we were anxious to conclude the proposed treaty.   As regards the gold loan, the Ambassador had increased the offer to  10 millions. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had confined himself to promising to hand in to-day the comprehensive proposals of the Turkish Government.    The Secretary of State added that the Turkish Government was still making certain difficulties with regard to Article 1 of the proposed treaty. The form of words which they proposed was more provocative to Italy than that which we had proposed, but if the Turkish Government was insistent, he (The Secretary of State) was at present of the opinion that the importance of meeting the Turkish point of view was such as to outweigh the possible bad effect on Italy.   He had, however, invited our Ambassador at Rome to express an opinion on this subject.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that, while the French Government were not prepared to contribute to the gold loan pari passu with this country, they had now agreed to contribute towards a loan not exceeding  10 millions in the proportion of two to three. If, however, the total loan exceeded  10 millions, the French were not prepared to increase their contribution beyond  4 millions.

The War Cabinet took note of the position in regard to   \ &gt; Turkey as summarised above.

Italy: Internal 7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the atten-Politloal tion of the War Cabinet to the secret unnumbered telegram from His

Situation. |g Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome (despatched at 3-35 p.m. on the 7th September), circulated the previous evening, in which Sir Percy Loraine gave particulars obtained from a usually reliable source regarding certain important developments in the internal situation in Italy which were stated to have taken place in the last few days. This information fitted in well with other reports received by the Foreign Office regarding the state of Signor Mussolini&apos;s health.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Naval 8.   In the course of the discussion on the internal political

be made, it was difficult for them to say what they were prepared to order; (ii) That as regards the financing of such purchases, it would be difficult to expand exports of coal to Italy, but that the possibility of employing the balance in the Italian Clearing for financing these purchases was being examined.

The Secretary of State for Air said that he thought the object of the War Cabinet could best be attained by the despatch to Italy of a small exploratory Mission.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that if the Admiralty desired to make any purchases (of, for example, fast coastal motor boats), they would wish to be represented also on the proposed Mission.

The War Cabinet agreed

To give further consideration to this question, and in particular to the suggestion to send a small exploratory Mission to Italy- at their meeting to be held on Monday, the Hth September, in the light of a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer which would then be available.

The Balkans. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that,

(Previous as arranged at the Meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin,

Majesty&apos;s Government hoped that the French Government would not authorise action in the Balkans by the French Military Authorities such as had been discussed between the British and. French Military Authorities prior to the outbreak of the war, when it had been assumed that Italy would take sides with Germany. The Foreign Secretary also reported that he had addressed a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Representative in each of the Balkan countries asking for their views with regard to the practicability of establishing a neutral Balkan bloc.

The War Cabinet took note of this,statement.

ESypt* 11.   Xhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

(Previous War Cabinet that he had received a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Reference: Ambassador, Cairo, reporting that he had received an intimation W.M. (39), 7th from the Egyptian Government that, if he was to inform them in Conclusions, writing that the measures so far taken, including the declaration Minute 4.)        of martial law, were not sufficient, they would declare a state of

war between Egypt and Germany.  Action was accordingly being

taken on these lines.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

United States Naval Patrol In the Western Atlantio.

12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that a telegram had been received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, giving particulars regarding the naval patrol in the Western Atlantic which the United States Government had decided to establish. The Admiralty had been asked to consider the information supplied, and to inform the Foreign Office whether they were satisfied with the action proposed to be taken by the United States,in this matter.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Far Eastern 13 The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Situation. -^ar Cabinet that two or three days previously the Japanese

Government had addressed a note to the British, French and United States Governments, suggesting that to prevent incidents in China during the present conflict in Europe each of those Governments should withdraw their military forces and their warships, and offering, if this suggestion were adopted, to look after the interests in China of the Governments concerned. Previous to the outbreak of war, consideration had been given to the practicability of withdrawing these forces, but with the exception of the General Officer Commanding, Hong Kong, the local authorities had all been opposed to such a course. The garrisons in Tientsin and Peking had been in existence since 1901, and that in the International Settlement in Shanghai since 1927. In each case the size of the garrison had been progressively reduced, and in his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) opinion these garrisons would have to be withdrawn whenever the time came to secure a general settlement of the position in China.

As regards the present situation, the Secretary of State favoured the dispatch of the following communications: 

(i) An acknowledgment to the Japanese Government stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government took note of the intention of the Japanese Government to adopt a neutral attitude towards the conflict in Europe, that they were unable to see why difficulties should arise in China between


58

ourselves and Japan by reason of that conflict, that we shared their wish to avoid any unfortunate incident but that we intended to retain our garrisons and warships in the Far East for so long as they were not required for service elsewhere; the Note to conclude with a statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government took note of the offer of the Japanese Government to look after British interests in China if and when it was decided temporarily to withdraw the forces under consideration :

(ii) A Note to the French Government asking for their views,

and stating that unless they (and the United States Government) were prepared to take a vigorous line, there would be no alternative but to comply with the suggestion of the Japanese Government:

(iii) At a later stage a Note to the United States Government

asking what reply they proposed to send to the Japanese Government.

In discussion it was pointed out that at the end of the War our position might be much stronger, and that, even if we were to decide on withdrawal of any of our forces in the Far East, we should not concede our legal rights in any respect.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should

address communications on the subject of British garrisons in the Far East to the Japanese and French Governments on the lines of his statement to the War Cabinet as summarised above;

(b) That no final decision regarding the withdrawal or other-

wise of the British naval and military forces in the Far East should be taken without further reference to the War Cabinet.

14. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that an emissary had just flown back from Poland with a message from General Carton de Wiart, reporting on the Polish military situation, which was now extremely serious, and suggesting that Great Britain and France would have to find some means of conveying military supplies to Poland; the greatest needs were aeroplanes, machine guns and ammunition. Reference was also made to public opinion in Poland over the delay which had taken place between the German invasion of their country and the presentation of the British ultimatum.

Members of the War Cabinet pointed out that, without in the least minimising the effort which Poland was making, there was only one way in which we could give her substantial help, namely,, by waging war on Germany until Poland was rehabilitated.

The Chiefs of Staff were invited to report immediately to the War Cabinet on the answer to be sent to General Carton de Wiart&apos;s message.

Obscuration of 15.   Discussion took place as to whether the present policy in

Lighting. regard to the obscuration of lighting had not gone too far. A

suggestion was made that lighting could rapidly be dimmed by being turned off at the main. It was pointed out, however, that street lighting could not, for the most part, be suddenly turned off without also turning off electric power and interior lighting.

It was explained that the present system had been introduced to meet the demands of the Air Staff, and modifications had been made, where necessary, to meet particular circumstances.

The Secretary of State for Air said that, while it was the Air Staff who were insistent on the most effective black-out obtainable, the production side of the Air Ministry was disposed to agree with the views expressed as to the effect of the present policy on munitions production. He hoped shortly to bring before the Cabinet an agreed recommendation from his Department as a whole.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

Invited the Secretary of State for Air to consider the matter further, in consultation with the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, and to report to the War Cabinet.

Action taken by the Dominions.

(Previous Reference: &quot;W.M. (89), 2nd Conclusions, Minute 4.)

16. The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (G.) (39) 5) covering a statement showing the principal action which had been taken by the Dominions, Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia, in regard to defence measures immediately preceding and since the outbreak of war up to the 4th September, 1939.

Conclusions, The Secretary of State thought that, until our representative

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Meetings of the 18. Some further discussion took place on this matter. It was TBTar Cabinet on pointed out that although only three Ministers would normally be on &apos;Sundays. duty each Sunday under the arrangement proposed, the remaining

Prime Minister said that the three groups of Ministers

which he proposed were as follows : 

Group I.

The Prime Minister.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

The Minister for Coordination of Defence.

Exchequer. The First Lord of the

Admiralty. The Secretary of State

for Air.

It was decided that Group III should be on duty on Sunday, the 10th September.

ANNEX.

Decypher of Telegram dated September 6, 1939, from Government of India, Defence Department, to Secretary of State for India.

(Immediate.   No. 288/6/9.)

NOW that we are at war, we are anxious to take timely steps to render further aid to His Majesty&apos;s Government to meet certain eventualities which, in our judgment, may well have to be met by India from time to time during the course of the war. As a first step in this direction, we have already arranged to increase output of our munitions factories to maximum extent possible in order not only to meet our own probable needs but, if possible, all outside demands which, judging from our recent experiences, are likely to be considered [sic] ? considerable. We now propose to take immediate action, with such material resources as we have at our disposal, to carry out the following : 

(a) to form two additional Brigade groups for external defence purposes.

The first suitable for reinforcing Burma, and second for employment for protection of Anglo-Iran oilfields or elsewhere where conditions of role are similar.

(b) to simultaneously replace such troops as are required for (a) above by form-

ing equivalent number of new units for our own needs.
