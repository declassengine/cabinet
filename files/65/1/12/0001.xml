W.M. 12 (39).

Afghanistan and 1. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum by India: Proposed the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State Agreement.       for India (W.P. (G) (39) 4).

In the course of a statement explanatory of the Memorandum, The Secretary of State for India informed the War Cabinet of the present somewhat unstable position of the Afghan Government. The Minister for War had left Kabul after quarrelling with the King of Afghanistan. Further, the Afghan frontier had recently been crossed by some 3,000 partisans of Amanulla, who had gathered together in the Afridi country. It seemed, however, that this rising was now breaking up. Nevertheless, the proposed bilateral agreement might at the present time be very acceptable to the Afghan Government.

The proposal which he and the Foreign Secretary wished to submit to the War Cabinet was that the British Minister at Kabul should be instructed on the lines summarised in the Appendix to these Minutes.

With reference to 1 (c) of Appendix I, the Secretary of State for India said that there was no possibility in present circumstances of the measures of mutual assistance referred to in that paragraph including the despatch of military forces from India. The Government of India&apos;s strategy on the North-West Frontier was now a purely defensive one. If, therefore, supporting troops had to be sent to Afghanistan, they would have to be despatched by the Home Government.

In the course of the discussion, the question was raised whether it was necessary (or even possible, in view of the requirements of the Service Departments at the present time) to make an allocation of  250,000 to Afghanistan under the Export Credits Act for purchasing goods in this country, including arms and munitions.

It was pointed out, in reply, that the amount in question was not large, and that in any event no offer of this kind would be made unless the Afghan Government themselves raised the question of financial assistance.

On the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the following amendments were agreed to in the text of paragraph 10 of the Memorandum  

(1) the word &apos;&apos; preliminary &apos;&apos; and the words &apos;&apos; at least regard-

less of commercial considerations &apos;&apos; should be deleted :

(2) after the words &apos;&apos; arms and munitions &apos;&apos; the phrase &apos;&apos; pro-

vided, of course, that they are available &quot; should be added.

The relevant part of the Summary of Conclusions (paragraph 11 (4)) would, of course, have to be amended to bring it into line with the revised paragraph 10.

Some discussion also took place regarding paragraph 3 of the telegram from the Government of India, dated 1st September, 1939, and reproduced as an Annex on pages 14-16 of W.P. (G) (39) 4.

It was suggested, on the one hand, that we should be letting slip a valuable opportunity, such as had not offered itself for many years, if we did not seize the occasion of the agreement with Afghanistan, which was now contemplated, to insist on a final clearing up of the tribal question on the North-West Frontier.

On the other hand, the view was generally held that the tribal question could not be cleared up without a first-class frontier war, and that the issue was one which was much better left alone.

The War Cabinet approved the proposals of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India, as summarised in the Appendix to these Conclusions, subject to the amendments agreed to above.

Italy. 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that there

(Previous        Was very little fresh to report in regard to the position in Italy. Eeference: Information  from a  reliable  source suggested  that the

W.M. (39), 8th. sympathies of the Italian people were with the French and the Conclusions,      British against Germany.

Minute 7.) As regards the movement of submarines, the Italian Govern-

ment had now agreed to a revival of the Nyon arrangement. They had also said that the submarine reported to have been observed at a certain point in the Mediterranean was not an Italian submarine.

Article by Mr. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also referred to an  

Lloyd George in article by Mr. Lloyd George, which had appeared the previous day the Sunday (10th September, 1939) in the Sunday Express, and which contained Express. references to the military value of the Italian army of a nature to

embarrass our position with Italy. It would be possible to take action against the Sunday Express, but he did not consider that this would be advisable. He understood that the First Lord of the Admiralty might be in a position to explain the position privately to Mr. Lloyd George, and he would gladly supply him with the necessary material for this purpose.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty agreed to this course.

The War Cabinet took note of the above.

Poland. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that he

(Previous had that afternoon seen the Polish Ambassador, who had reverted to Eeference: two of the points raised by him at his meeting with the Permanent W.M. (39), 10th Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the previous morning Conclusions. (10th September, 1939) summarised in the record of the meeting of Minute 5.)        the War Cabinet referred to in the margin.

In reply to the inquiry by the Polish Ambassador as to our plans in the West, the Secretary of State, while appreciating the difficulties of Poland, had expressed the view that it would be most foolish to take action in the West on lines other than those dictated by strategy. As regards the report received by Count Raczynski from the Polish Ambassador in Paris, about the cancellation of certain air operations, the Secretary of State had endeavoured to explain the position without going into too great detail.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey. 4   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

(Previous War Cabinet that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, had reported

Eeferences: that the promised comprehensive proposals bad now been received

W.M. (39), 9th from the Turkish Government.   The Ambassador did not believe

Conclusions, that the Turkish Government were trying to avoid making a treaty.

Minute 7; They were, he thought, merely trying to drive a hard bargain. In

8th Conclusions, the circumstances, he (the Secretary of State) would not be unduly

Minute 6; and disturbed if a few more days were to elapse before final agreement

5th Conclusions, on the treaty was secured with the Turkish Government.

In the course of a short discussion, reference was made to a telegram (No. 340) despatched the previous evening to our Ambassador which contained proposals which might involve His Majesty&apos;s Government placing further funds at the disposal of the Turkish Government in connection with sending arms to Poland. The view was expressed that any suggestion or this kind might have the effect of still further delaying the conclusion of the Treaty.

The War Cabinet took note of the above.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 9th Conclusions, Minute 15.)

5. The Foreign Secretary proceeded to give information from a number of sources bearing on the general international situation. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, had reported that he had just seen M. Bonnet and had gathered that he would probably remain a member of the French Cabinet after its forthcoming reconstruction.

From one source it had been reported that when the new Government was announced it would be found that M. Bonnet and M. Reynaud had exchanged Portfolios, and that it now appeared improbable that M. Heriot would be Minister for Foreign Affairs.

When Count Czaky had seen Herr von Ribbentrop in Berlin on the 8th September, the latter had proposed the cession of certain Polish territory to Hungary. Count Czaky had replied that Hungary had no territorial ambitions as against Poland. He suspected that Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s offer was a prelude to a demand being made by Germany for the grant by the Hungarian Government of transit facilities. Count Czaky had been struck while in Berlin by the evident desire of the German Government for the war to be brought to a rapid conclusion, and he anticipated that Herr Hitler might make some peace offer after the fall of Warsaw. Information had also been received from another source that very valuable results might be secured if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to make a direct appeal to the German Army on certain lines.

The Foreign Secretary also reported that he had that afternoon seen the Japanese Ambassador. The most interesting part of the conversation had been when the Ambassador had said how very significant he regarded the declaration made by His Majesty&apos;s Government on Saturday (9th September, 1939) that they were making, all their plans on the assumption that the duration of the war would be at least three years.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Air Policy. 6.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report by the

(Previous        Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on Air Policy (Paper No. W.P. (39)

Reference:

19).

W.M. (39), 9th        After discussion (a note of which is recorded on the Secretary&apos;s Conclusions,      Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions) the War Cabinet Minute 14)      approved the recommendations set out in the above Report by the Chiefs of Staff.

Casualty Lists. 7. Discussion took place as to the publication of Casualty (Previous Lists.

Reference: Th w    Cabinet agreed : 

W.M. (39), 11th 5

Conclusions, (1) that each Defence Department should publish Casualty

Minute 3.) Lists of a certain length at irregular intervals :

(2) that the lists should be in alphabetical order, and should contain no particulars as to units, or as to the place or manner in which the casualties were incurred.

Ministerial Statement.

5th

8. The Prime Minister invited the three Service Ministers and the Home Secretary to arrange for the preparation of passages, dealing with the general situation, suitable for inclusion in his speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday, the 13th September. It would be convenient if these passages could reach No. 10 Downing Street by 6 p.m. on Tuesday, the 12th September.


Visit to French Prime Minister.

(Previous Eef erenee: W.M. (39), 9th Conclusions, Minute 15.)

Attitude of the Dominions.

9. The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet that at the Meeting referred to in the margin, he had referred to the need for consultation with the French Government before the House of Commons met on Wednesday. Arrangements were now being made for him to visit Paris on the following day. He and Lord Chatfield would fly over in the morning, would have a three or four hours&apos; discussion with M. Daladier and one of his colleagues, and would return by air before dark. The fact that this meeting had been held would, he thought, when announced later, have a good effect on public opinion in both countries. The meeting would also serve to consolidate the feeling of mutual confidence between the two Governments. He had laid down no agenda for the meeting, but he anticipated that the discussions might include : 

(a) the attitude of the Allies towards Italy;

(b) the plans believed to be entertained by General Weygand

for action in the Balkans; and

(c) the possibility that, after the fall of Warsaw, or the collapse

of Poland, some species of so-called peace plan would be put forward by Herr Hitler with a view to sowing discord between the Allies.

Continuing, the Prime Minister said that no doubt the French Government would wish to issue an agreed Communique&quot; after his (the Prime Minister&apos;s) return to London; and the Foreign Office were at present engaged on preparing a preliminary draft. He was most anxious that the communique should be worded in general terms and that it should avoid reference to any specific war aims, since any such reference might later prove highly embarrassing, in view of the impossibility of predicting at the present time how the general political situation would develop. He did not propose to agree to the insertion in the Communique&quot; of any direct reference to the attitude of the Allies towards any peace plan that Herr Hitler might put forward. On the other hand, M. Daladier might be insistent that it was essential from the point of view of the French Government that some reference should be made to this subject. What he (the Prime Minister) had in mind was to insert in the Communique^ in that event, a statement that it would be impossible for the Allies to discuss terms of peace or to consider any offer of peace made to them by any Government of Germany whicn had not previously given to the Allies convincing proof that they accepted the basic principles of the policy laid down on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government by Lord Halifax in his Chatham House speech, namely, (i) respect for international obligations and (ii) the renouncing of force as an instrument of policy.

In discussion, it was mentioned that Mr. Bruce had stated that he was anxious for a public reaffirmation of our position, before Herr Hitler had time to make a specious and illusory peace offer.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported that the High Commissioners for the Dominions, at a Meeting that afternoon, had been unanimous in the view that their Governments were anxious that some further declaration of policy in regard to the War should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. They had asked him to represent this view to the War Cabinet.

The War Cabinet approved the line which the Prime Minister proposed to take in his discussions with M. Daladier, as set out in the discussion above.

APPENDIX.

Proposed Instructions to British Minister in Kabul.

TO approach the Afghan Government immediately with the offer of a bilateral agreement containing 

(a) a preamble stressing the friendly relations between His Majesty&apos;s

Government and the Afghan Government and their common interest in mutual security;

(b) a non-aggression clause;

(c) a clause, or clauses, providing for mutual consultation and for concerting

measures of mutual assistance, in the event of any international dispute or threat of aggression likely to involve the interests of either party;

(d) a clause providing for continuous co-operation (not only in an emergency,

but also in normal times) in matters of mutual concern such as Indo-Afghan frontier questions.

(2) To explain orally to the Afghan Government that the measures of mutual assistance provided for in (1) (c) above would have to be worked out according to circumstances and would not necessarily involve plans for supporting the Afghan Government with our own military forces.

(3) To give the Afghan Government oral assurances of our immediate willingness to give them advice and assistance in such forms as 

(a) the despatch of a military mission to Kabul to advise them on their

plans;

(b) the training of officers of their Army and Air Force; and

(c) the loan of technical advisers.

The details of such forms of advice and assistance would be worked out in consultation with the Government of India.

(4) To inform the Afghan Government, if they raise the question of financial assistance, but not otherwise, that a preliminary allocation of  250,000 to Afghanistan has been made under the new Export Credit Act, and that they could have credit, to this amount at least, for purchasing goods in this country including arms and munitions.
