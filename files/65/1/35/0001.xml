Tne Af* 1.   The Secretary of State for Air gave the War Cabinet some

Situation. further details about the propaganda raid which had been carried

(Previous out over Berlin on the night of the 1st October. Four Whitleys had

Reference: taken part, of which three had reached Berlin. They had W.M. (39) 34th encountered considerable, but ineffective, anti-aircraft fire over Conclusions, Berlin, but had met no fighters. The fourth machine had Minute l.) experienced engine trouble off Denmark, and was last heard of 120 miles off the English coast. It was feared that this machine had come down in the sea.

A new Balloon Section had gone into action on the Western Front the previous night, in co-operation with the French. It consisted of some 50 to 60 small balloons, each 8 feet in diameter, carrying a 10-lb. load of leaflets. They were fitted with time fuzes which released their loads after six hours&apos; flight and then destroyed the balloon. The previous night the balloons had carried 123,000 pamphlets about foreign investments of the Nazi Leaders and 59,000 copies of the Prime Minister&apos;s speech about Herr Hitler&apos;s broken pledges. It was hoped that the pamphlets would have been dropped over the Ruhr.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War

Situation. Cabinet that it seemed possible that the enemy raider, thought to

(Previous        have been the A dmiral Scheer, was, in fact, the Hipper, a modern Reference:        8-inch cruiser.  If this were true, the Naval dispositions which we W.M. (39) 34th had taken up would still be appropriate.   As, however, the Conclusions, Hipper&apos;&apos;s armament was a good deal lighter than that of the Minute 3.)       Admiral Scheer, a larger number of hunting units might be formed from the same number of ships.   It was hoped that we might receive some information, even if only of a negative character, as to the Hipper&apos;s whereabouts as a result of steps which the Americans were taking to send their ships into the Caribbean.

No further British ships had been sunk by submarine, thus bringing the period of immunity up to 9 days. Meanwhile, 9 more attacks had been carried out against German submarines, in some of which there was reason to believe that good contact had been established.

The First Lord gave an account of the experiences of the crew of the Spearfish, whose Commander he had seen the previous afternoon. The first depth charge had been heard at 7 a.m., and she had at once gone to the bottom and lain there motionless throughout the day, during which she had been subjected to some 50 more depth charges. At about 8 p.m., while still motionless, a wire hawser had been drawn over her, followed by more depth charges at closer quarters. Darkness had fallen shortly after, and they decided to come to the surface for air. This they did at full speed, with torpedoes ready to attack the enemy destroyers which they expected to find waiting for them. Instead, they found that they were alone. At this point, and not before, three of the crew had become unconscious. A message had been sent asking for a rendezvous, and the submarine had then crept along the Danish coast until morning, when they had laid up for the day between a||!j| two sandbanks, only 200 yards off the Danish coast. Aircraft had flown over them, but without spotting them. That evening they received an answer to their request for a rendezvous, and were duly met and escorted home. On the return voyage they witnessed the attack on the Aurora and Sheffield, which the Commander of the Spearfish had described as &quot; terrific.&quot;

The First Lord suggested that special recognition should be accorded to the crew of the Sp&gt;earfish for their very gallant exploit. The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 34th r Conclusions, Minute 5.)

3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff told the War Cabinet that a German light Division had been located just South of the Rhine, opposite Holland, and one additional reserve Division opposite the Saar. The Germans had formed two fresh Corps Headquarters in the latter region.

The first British Corps had now gone into the line on its allotted sector, and portions of the second Corps would follow in two days&apos; time. Otherwise, there was nothing to report.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Situation on the 4. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence gave an account Western Front, of the meeting, which had taken place the evening, before, of the (Previous Committee set up by the War Cabinet to consider the situation Reference: on the Western Front in the light of M. Daladier&apos;s recent letter W.M. (39) 34th to the Prime Minister.

Conclusions, The Chiefs of Staff had expressed their anxiety at what seemed

Minute 6.) to be frequent changes in General Gamelin&apos;s idea of the German plan. The first idea, after the collapse of Poland, had been that the Germans would advance through the Low Countries. This had been succeeded by the hypothesis that they would overrun the French right flank through Switzerland. Now it appeared that a direct attack on the Maginot Line was considered likely. The Chiefs of Staff felt that they were not in sufficiently close touch with French Headquarters.

The Committee had come to the conclusion that the Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should go over and have a frank exchange of views with General Gamelin. At such a meeting they would be able to ascertain fully the information on which the French based their Appreciation, and would be able to co-ordinate plans for meeting whichever attack might take place. They would be able to discuss what forces the Germans might employ, and the time which they would require to stage an attack, either on the Maginot Line or through the Low Countries.

The Committee felt strongly that the danger of air attack on this country, either as a preliminary to, or concurrently with, a great attack on the Continent, was one which could not be disregarded, and should be impressed upon the French.

As a result of their discussion, the Committee had drafted a letter for the Prime Minister to send in reply to M. Daladier, asking for the meeting to be arranged, and explaining the points on which we required further information.

In discussion it was urged that General Georges and General Vuillemin should be present at the discussions with General Gamelin, and it was decided that a tactful request to secure this should be inserted in the letter.

The Lord Privy Seal hoped that the Chiefs of Staff would take the opportunity to perfect the liaison arrangements, which appeared to be not entirely satisfactory.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that the Committee had fully discussed this aspect, and had asked the Chiefs of Staff to raise it with the French.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that the Prime Minister should send a reply to M. Daladier on the lines indicated in the discussion;

(&amp;) that the Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should meet General Gamelin and his advisers at an early date for a discussion on the lines suggested by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.

W.M. 33 (89).

Soale ot 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the

Reserves In the Chiefs of Staff on the present scale of reserves held for the forces Middle East.     in the Middle East (Paper W.P. (39) 61).

The Chief of the Air Staff explained that the Memorandum was designed to inform the War Cabinet of the present position and to obtain their authority for the policy which the Chiefs of Staff recommended to improve matters.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To approve the Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.

Turkey.

Turco-Soviet Conversations and the Anglo-Turkish Treaty. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 34th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that M. Sarajoglu, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, was still in Moscow, and that no official information had yet been received regarding either the progress of his discussions with M. Molotov or the date of his return to Ankara. The Turkish Government (vide telegram No. 545 from Ankara) were extremely anxious that no statement regarding the Anglo-Turkish Treaty should be made in Parliament until the 5th October, by which time it was thought that the position of the negotiations in Moscow might be clearer. He (the Secretary of State) had accordingly sent a telegram (No. 467) to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen saying that no statement would be made in Parliament on the 3rd October, but that he hoped that the Turkish Government would agree to a short statement being made in the course of the next few days.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Italy.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 34th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 991, dated the 1st October, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, in which Sir Percy Loraine repeated the view expressed by him in recent telegrams that German propaganda had recently made headway in Italy, and submitted certain suggestions as to the importance of ensuring that the reply made to any German peace proposals should be drafted in such a way as to give full weight to the fears and anxieties felt in neutral countries.

In the course of discussion the following considerations were stressed: 

(i) Notwithstanding the effect of German propaganda in Italy,

it remained true that the King, the Army and the people were still opposed to Italy&apos;s embarking in war against France and ourselves :

(ii) A Press telegram, published in The Times that day (the

3rd October, 1939), suggested that the Vatican might be preparing to take sides with the Italian Government in supporting the forthcoming German peace proposals. Any such development would constitute an unfavourable factor, but doubt was expressed whether, in fact, the Vatican would take such action in view of what had happened in Poland.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.


284

The Prime 8.  At the conclusion of the discussion recorded in Minute 7

Minister&apos;s        above reference was made to the forthcoming German peace Statement in    proposals and the method by which these could best be dealt with. Parliament. There was a general agreement that it would be undesirable

for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make any pronouncement as to the terms of peace which they would regard as acceptable. On the other hand, the more the German Government could be forced to make public the extent to which they would be prepared to go to secure peace, the better this would suit us, since any public declaration by the German Government would be regarded as a confession of weakness and might give added strength to forces in Germany hostile to the present regime.

In the course of this discussion, the Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the terms of a statement on the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government which he proposed to make in the House of Commons that afternoon.

Three minor amendments were made, two of them to meet the suggestion made by the High Commissioners for the Dominions, to whom copies had been shown that morning.

There was general agreement that the line proposed to be taken by the Prime Minister was exactly that required at the present juncture.

The War Cabinet approved the lines of the statement which the Prime Minister proposed to make in Parliament.

Ministry of Information.

Arrangements for distribution of news and for censorship. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 34th Conclusions, Minute 18.)

9. The Prime Minister invited the attention of his colleagues to the revised draft (Paper W.P. (39) 68) of the statement which he proposed to make in the House of Commons on the subject of the changes in the Ministry of Information.

The Prime Minister stated that Sir Ronald Lindsay had not been willing to act as Director of Censorship. As stated in the concluding paragraph of the Memorandum, Sir Walter Monckton had been appointed Controller of Censorship; he would at the same time supervise the arrangements for the central communication of news to the Press.

The War Cabinet took note with approval of the revised draft statement contained in Paper No. W.P. (39) 68.

Proposals by 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the

the President of Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (Paper W.P. (39) 51) regard-the Royal ing certain proposals which had been made by Sir William Bragg, Society for the the President of the Royal Society, in July and September, 1939, for Use of Scientific bringing the services of scientists into closer contact with the needs Knowledge.       of the Government.

In the course of an explanatory statement, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence informed his colleagues that, whereas the Service Departments had had no scientific staffs of their own in the last war, the three Service Departments and many of the Civil Departments now had large scientific staffs, including members of the Royal Society, while other scientists of distinction had placed their services at the disposal of the Defence Departments as members of various committees.

Sir William Bragg&apos;s proposal of the previous July had not found great favour with the Ministers in charge of the Service Departments. They had been afraid that it might involve interference with the existing satisfactory arrangements, or at any rate waste of valuable time in acquainting outside scientists with devices and plans with which they would be unfamiliar.

Many of these were matters of the highest secrecy, and it was undesirable to widen unnecessarily the circle of those who had access to them.


285

W.M. 35 (39).

Sir William Bragg&apos;s modified proposal of the 8th September was that the two Secretaries of the Royal Society should be attached to the establishment of the War Cabinet, which would then have at its disposal a convenient direct channel between the Government and the scientific community. The Service Ministers and the Minister of Supply had been consulted on this proposal. With the exception of the First Lord of the Admiralty, their view, broadly speaking, had been that if the Royal Society were anxious (as they evidently were) to offer their collaboration, it would be impossible for the Government to refuse that offer. The First Lord of the Admiralty, on the other hand, had thought that the offer ought not to be accepted.

The Minister went on to say that he himself had somewhat revised the views which he had expressed in paragraph 5 of his Memorandum. He would not now go further than to say that Sir William Bragg&apos;s proposals had very useful possibilities.

He had come to the conclusion that the Royal Society&apos;s offer should be accepted in principle, but not in the actual form in which it had been made. It would be preferable if there were an understanding with the Royal Society that if any Department (Defence or Civil) was confronted with a new problem, which its existing staff had not the time to investigate, it should call in the help of outside scientists. The method of calling in that help might be to refer the problem to one or other of a number of Advisory Committees or Panels which the Royal Society might be asked to set up. There might be Committees or Panels dealing with Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Food, and Medicine.

As regards Sir William Bragg&apos;s offer of the services of the Royal Society&apos;s two Secretaries, it seemed hardly necessary to attach them to the establishment of the War Cabinet. They should, however, be available to act as a channel of liaison between the Office of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Advisory Committees or Panels.

The Minister added that he had discussed the matter with Sir Frank Smith, who had been in favour of accepting the Royal Society&apos;s offer in the modified form just described.

The following points, among others, emerged in the course of discussion : 

(a) There was a danger of dissipating, through faulty organi-

sation, the efforts of the scientific staffs available to the Government, both inside and outside Departments.

(b) Generally speaking, it was desirable to wait until a problem

had arisen before creating a panel or committee to investigate it. If the panel or committee were created first, it would demand to be fed with problems for investigation.

(c) Great difficulty was likely to be experienced with the

medical profession if the Royal Society were brought into consultation on medical questions. The War Cabinet were reminded of the valuable work which was being done by the Medical Research Council.

(d) The War Cabinet were reminded of the valuable assistance

which the Royal Society were in a position to offer in organising research work in the teaching institutions of the country.

(e) The War Cabinet were informed of a proposal which was

blow under investigation for improving the liaison between United Kingdom and Dominion scientists.

The Prime Minister suggested that the reply to Sir William Bragg might be in rather general terms. The Royal Society might be informed that the Government were grateful for their offer, and were glad to learn that it would be possible for them to draw, from time to time, on the knowledge of the highest scientific authorities


286

in the various fields. The Government would certainly take advantage of this offer. The Royal Society, however, would recognise the importance of avoiding any overlapping with existing machinery. They might be given a full statement showing the wealth of scientific assistance already at the disposal of the Government in the existing technical staffs of the various Departments and the various existing Advisory Committees or Panels.

It did not seem desirable that the Secretaries of the Royal Society should become part of the establishment of the War Cabinet.

The War Cabinet agreed 

That a reply should be sent to the President of- the Royal Society on the lines proposed by the Prime Minister.

Chartering of 11.   The President of the Board of Trade informed the War

Merchant Cabinet of the present position of the negotiations with the

Shipping from   Norwegian Delegation now in London.

Abroad. The Delegation had asked us to safeguard the present position

Negotiations for of Norwegian imports, and to pledge ourselves to carry out in full the Chartering our Trade Agreement with Norway in other words, to surrender of Norwegian all the economic weapons which could, if necessary, be used against Tanker Tonnage, their country. They proposed to give us nothing in return except (Previous a declaration that the Norwegian Government would look with a Eeference: benevolent eye on our negotiations with individual Norwegian W.M. (39) 20th owners of tanker tonnage. There was every prospect that the owners Conclusions, would only consent to charter their ships to us at a blackmail price. Minute 9.) The Delegation had stated that they had no authority to enter

into any binding commitment on behalf of their Government. If we insisted that they should do so, they would have to return to Norway for consultation. This was particularly disappointing, as we had suggested to the Norwegian Government, before the Delegation came, that they should be given full powers to conclude a chartering agreement.

The President explained that the alternative courses open to us were: 

(i) To take a stiff line with the Delegation, in the hope of

bringing them to heel. Thus, we might point out that, if they could not do more to meet our requirements, they must expect their trade to experience the full rigour of the Royal Navy&apos;s contraband control.

(ii) To negotiate direct with individual Norwegian owners of

tanker tonnage, and to pay the heavy price which they would exact.

The War Cabinet were informed that the United Kingdom and France would require to charter between 100 and 150 tankers out of the total of about 240 tankers owned in Norway.

In the course of discussion it became clear that the War Cabinet favoured alternative (i), despite the fact that this might involve the negotiations being prolonged. Owing to the success in meeting the submarine menace, we could, however, afford to contemplate some delay.

The War Cabinet: 

(1) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to confirm that

his advisers were prepared to accept the risk involved in some further delay in negotiations with the Norwegian Government, and to communicate the result to the President of the Board of Trade.

(2) Subject to (1), authorised the President of the Board of

Trade to take a stiff line with the Norwegian Delegation.
