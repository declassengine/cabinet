W.M. 61 (39).

The AIr 1.   The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet

Situation. that three flying-boats had attacked a submarine some 100 miles

(Previous to the westward of Gibraltar.   This was probably the submarine

Minute l) 1 he War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty confirmed the report that

Situation. a German submarine had been stranded on the Goodwin Sands.

(Previous Rough weather had so far prevented the submarine from being

Eeference: boarded, but every effort was being made to do so before the W.M. (39) 59th submarine sank into the sand.

Conclusions, Several other attacks had been carried out on submarines with

Minute 2.) hopeful results, including attacks by a destroyer and by French aircraft on the submarine Westward of Gibraltar, referred to in the previous minute.

It had been announced in the Press that we had lost five merchant ships with an aggregate of 15,000 tons during the previous twenty-four hours. Against this we had captured five German ships, while a sixth had been scuttled by the crew to avoid capture. The total tonnage of the vessels captured amounted to some 30,000 . tons.

The Prime Minister thought that it would be desirable to include this information in his statement to the House of Commons the same afternoon.

Continuing, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Narvik iron-ore convoy had sailed under strong escort that morning; the large Atlantic convoy of 45 ships had arrived safely in the Western Approaches and was now being dispersed to British ports. Strong escorts were still being maintained.

The City of The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the Press

Flint. report that the German prize crew from the City of Flint had now

been released by the Russians. He was enquiring into the matter and, if it appeared that a breach of neutrality had been committed, he proposed to make a protest to the Russian Government.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Poison Gas.

German Eeport of British supply to Poland. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 6.)

3. The Secretary of State for War said that there appeared to be three more German divisions on the Western Front, out no particular significance was attached to this information.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his attention had been drawn to a pamphlet, which appeared to have been widely distributed in Great Britain through the post, alleging that a supply of gas bombs, or mines, had been found in the arsenal at Gdynia, and that these had been unloaded secretly from British ships. The pamphlet which he had been given had been posted in Stockholm.

The allegations in this pamphlet were much more specific than those previously made, and he thought they should be investigated. In particular, it should be ascertained whether any British ships had unloaded munitions shortly before the war at Gdynia.

The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for War to examine this question.

Holland and Belgium.

Measures to be taken in the event of an invasion by Germany. (Previous Bef erence: W.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 5.)

5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio on the subject of measures to be taken in Holland and Belgium in the event of an invasion by Germany (Paper W.P. (39) 95).

The Minister without Portfolio explained that his Memorandum was in the nature of a Progress Report, to show the steps which had been taken to give effect to the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff Committee in their Report (Paper W.P. (39) 90). The objects aimed at were, first, to ensure the reduction of the assets which might fall into the hands of the Germans: secondly, to try and induce the Dutch and Belgian Governments to make plans to meet the emergency : thirdly, to have our own plans ready to assist the Dutch and Belgians: and, finally, to place ourselves in a position to secure our vital interests by our own exertions. The decisions which would have to be taken if the emergency arose were set out in paragraph 31 of the Memorandum. The only decision required at the present time was whether or not the contents of the Memorandum should be communicated to the French.

The French had undertaken the responsibility for certain action in furtherance of our object. For example, they had undertaken the responsibility for the demolition of locks, oil installations, &amp;c, at Bruges and Ghent. They had also assumed responsibility for giving the executive order to complete the blocking of Zeebrugge and Ostend. It seemed right, therefore, that they should be informed of the progress which we had made in our plans.

The Minister said that the detailed preparation of plans, and the co-ordination of all arrangements, would be pressed on, and he hoped to be able to furnish His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in Holland and Belgium, and Government Departments concerned, with a statement summarising the action which would be expected of them, if the invasion were to take place.

The War Cabinet 

(a) Took note of the Memorandum by the Minister without

Portfolio.

(b) Authorised the communication of its contents, through

military channels, to the French authorities, with the proviso that no mention should be made of the arrangements concerning gold and securities, or of any of the enquiries on that subject.

Italy- 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

Proposed Pro- had been disappointed at the response given by the bulk of the test against Italian Press to the speech made by Herr von Ribbentrop at Danzig, hostile Press. He proposed to telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, instructing him to lodge a protest with Count Ciano against the anti-British tone in the Italian Press. He thought it likely that Count Ciano would not take such a protest amiss, since it would be of assistance to him in dealing with extreme pro-Nazi influences in Rome.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Italy. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in an

Possible adjust- interview the previous day, he had gathered from Sir Eric Phipps ment of claims that the French Government would not be likely to show great against France, reluctance to take up the discussion of outstanding questions between France and Italy in regard, for example, to DJibuti and Tunis. They would not be prepared to go quite so far as the Italians desired, but nevertheless it was likely that they would agree to go a long way towards meeting the Italian point of view. He

W.M. 61 (39).

(the Secretary of State) proposed, therefore, to discuss the matter with Sir Percy Loraine on his arrival in London from Rome, with a view to considering the possibility of our suggesting to the French Government that they should now resume consideration of this matter.

The Prime Minister said that at an interview the previous afternoon the new Italian Ambassador had suggested that Signor Mussolini might have it in mind to make a general declaration on the 28th of this month, the anniversary of the march on Rome. It was possible that he might address himself to the problem of the Mediterranean, for which a ready response could always be obtained in Italy. It had occurred to him (the Prime Minister) that Signor Mussolini might think the present a convenient moment to reassert his claims in- anticipation of an improvement in Italian relations with France and ourselves.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Signor Mussolini might refer also to Turkey, and it was for this reason that he (the Secretary of State) had suggested the insertion of an oblique but friendly reference to Italy in the portion relating to Turkey of the statement to be made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons that afternoon.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

War Alms. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, at

(Previous        an interview the previous afternoon, Sir Eric Phipps, the retiring Eeference:       Ambassador from Paris, had given him a general indication of W.M. (39) 58th the lines on which the French Government desired to approach the Conclusions,      problem of war aims.   It was clear that they hoped that it would Minute 7.)       be possible to secure our agreement to a definition of war aims which would ensure that, after victory had been achieved, France would not once again be exposed to the menace of invasion from Germany. After consultation with the Prime Minister, he (the Secretary of State) had arranged for the preparation in the Foreign Office of a preliminary draft of the reply to be sent to the French Government.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs inquired whether it would be possible to discuss the question of war aims with Dominion Governments before any final decision was taken.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Dominion Governments would have already seen from the papers circulated to them that the French Government had asked us to formulate our views on war aims, and it would, he thought, be helpful to obtain a general indication of the views of the Dominions, at a fairly early stage. He thought that it should be made quite clear to the Dominion Representatives by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that we felt that it was necessary to keep to quite general terms in any declaration agreed upon, and that he should inform the Dominion Representatives that this was the view of the French Government also.

The War Cabinet : 

(a) Took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs

intended to circulate for the consideration of the War Cabinet a preliminary draft of the communication to be sent to the French Government in reply to their request for a statement of our war aims.

(b) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to

consult the Dominion Representatives on the subject of war aims on the lines suggested.

The Balkans.

Plan for the formation of a neutral Balkan bloc.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 39th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to various telegrams received from our Missions at Belgrade, Sofia and Ankara, all of which suggested that events were moving in the direction of the formation of a neutral Balkan bloc. It even appeared possible that Roumania might be prepared to do a deal with Bulgaria in regard to the Southern Dobrudja. It was satisfactory also to note that relations between Jugoslavia and Italy, which had been strained by the Albanian incident, were now considerably easier. He was doing everything possible to encourage this general movement, which he had reason to know was also being urged on their respective Governments by the various Balkan Ministers in London. It was very important that a suitable place should be found for Italy in this project. Sir Percy Loraine had already been instructed to sound Count Ciano on this matter, and he (the Secretary of State) hoped to discuss the matter further with Sir Percy on his arrival in London on leave.

The Secretary of State for War referred to telegrams Nos. 656 and 660 (both dated the 24th October, 1939) from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, from which it appeared that the Turkish Government considered the moment favourable for making a move to improve relations amongst the Balkan States to build up some real consolidation between them all, including Bulgaria. He (the Secretary of State) hoped, therefore, that Turkey would be given her fair share of credit in this matter.

The Prime Minister said that it was clear from the recent Italian broadcasts in English, and also from telegram No. 1071, dated the 25th October, 1939, from His Majesty s Ambassador, Rome, that Italy regarded herself as having vital interests in the Balkans which were not, and could not be, of an economic nature only. While, therefore, full justice should be done to Turkey for her attitude in this matter, it was necessary to avoid taking any action which might prejudice our chances of securing Italian co-operation in the plan for the establishment of a neutral Balkan bloc.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Germany.

Possible development of German Policy. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 49th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

Germany.

Internal Situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 57th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the War Cabinet certain information relating to the possible development of German policy, particulars of which are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

11. The Minister without Portfolio said that in a recent interview Dr. Weizmann, who had just returned from Switzerland, had outlined the impressions which, as a result of contacts he had made in Switzerland with persons recently returned from Germany, he had formed regarding the internal situation in that country. According to his information, the German people were in a state of complete subordination jto the Nazi party and were incapable of being moved bv events, even by the victories won in Poland. The Army was well found and well fed, but the civilian population was kept short of food, more so, indeed, than was warranted by the actual situation. This appeared to be due to deliberate policy on the part of the German Government with the object of keeping the people in subjection. As regards our leaflets, Dr. Weizmann&apos;s information was that nothing that had been, or could be, written

would have any effect on the German public, but that they had been moved by the fact that it had been possible for us to distribute these leaflets from the air despite Nazi opposition.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Switzerland. 12.   The Minister without Portfolio said that in the interview

referred to in Minute 11 above, Dr. Weizmann had said that he bad been much impressed during his recent visit to Switzerland with the overwhelming pro-ally sentiment of the Swiss people. This sentiment was as strong in Zurich and other German-speaking parts of Switzerland as in the French-speaking Cantons. No trace remained of the tendency observed before the war of admiration for the Nazis. Dr. Weizmann had been much impressed also by the high state of military preparedness in Switzerland, and claimed to have definite information that 450,000 men were under arms.
