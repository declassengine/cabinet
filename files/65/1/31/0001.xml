The Air Situation.

(Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 30th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 26th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air referred to the statement in the Press that the flying boat which had been forced to alight at Iceland the previous day, and had been reported ae having been interned, had returned to this country. He gave the Cabinet details, so far as was at present known, of the circumstances in which the pilot, who stated that he had given no parole, had flown off from Iceland.  A full inquiry was being carried out that morning.

A reconnaissance had been carried out over North-West Germany the previous evening, during which leaflets had been dropped.  All the aircraft had returned safely.

A further reconnaissance of the Heligoland Bight was being carried out in force that morning. The two aircraft which had carried out the reconnaissance of roads and railways behind the Low Countries the previous day had failed to return, but no information was available as to their fate.

Bomber aircraft of the Advance Air Striking Force had carried out reconnaissances behind the German lines to a depth of 15 miles. One of these had been brought down by the enemy inside our lines, and one enemy fighter had been shot down.

In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff said that there was a special technical staff carrying out investigation into the German aircraft which had been brought down in France. He undertook to bring its conclusions before the Cabinet at an early date.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The Naval 2.   The Chief of the Naval Staff informed the War Cabinet

Situation. that there had been no sinkings of British ships during the previous

(Previous twenty-four hours.  One Swedish ship had been sunk off Stavanger.

Reference: Only vague reports had been received of enemy submarines. The W.M. (39) 30th reason might be that they were transferring their watch from the Conclusions,      Western approaches to the North Channel.

Minute 2.) The commander of the German submarine U. 27 was in a state

of nervous collapse, and was quite incapable of resuming his duties as a submarine commander. It was thought that there would be some advantage in allowing him to return to Germany.

The French had captured a German merchant ship of 5,000 tons off the Azores. Certain activity of German ships from Bahia had been reported. There had been no further report confirming the alleged concentration of German ships off Ascension Island.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Position in 3 Reference was made to Telegram No. 49 from our Minister the Baltic. at Tallinn, stating that the Estonian Government had asked whether we had any submarines in the Baltic. This enquiry arose out of the torpedoing of a Russian vessel off Narva, which the Soviet Government had been using as a lever to demand naval bases in Estonia.

The Chief of the Naval Staff explained that, of five Polish submarines, three had been interned in Sweden, the fourth (the Wilk) was at Scapa, and the fifth (the Orzel), so far as we knew, was still at large. It was possible, however, that the Russian Government knew the whereabouts of the Orzel, and attributed the sinking of the Russian vessel to the Wilk, being in ignorance of the fact that she had escaped from the Baltic. [20081] B 2


244

It was pointed out that the Estonian Government had now agreed to the Russian demands for a naval base in Estonia, and that the question of how this Russian vessel had been sunk was not of great importance.

The War Cabinet agreed 

That our Minister at Tallinn should be informed confidentially that the Polish submarine Wilk had escaped from the Baltic and bad come to this country, but that he should not be authorised to pass this information on to the Estonian Government for the present.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 30th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said there were no matters of importance to report. As a sequel to the peace offensive which appeared to be starting, General Gamelin regarded as possible an attack through Switzerland, followed by an attack through the Low Countries. We had as yet no indications of the preparation of such attacks.

In reply to an enquiry from the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, on the whole, General Gamelin&apos;s forecast of the time which might elapse before the Germans could stage an offensive in the West agreed with his own. In his last letter General Gamelin had given the 16th October as the first possible date for an offensive to begin, but had said that the danger would not be over until after the 10th November. He (the Chief of the Imperial General Staff) was inclined to think that the collection of the Divisions from Poland might take some time, and he thought we still had three weeks before an attack could be expected. Important operations could take place in November, as we had proved at Cambrai in 1917, and on this occasion the ground would not have been previously churned up. An advance through Switzerland would be a formidable undertaking.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Propaganda in 5   Arising out of the discussion on Minute 4, the Secretary

France. 0f State for Foreign Affairs said that a statement, alleged to have

been made by General Gamelin, was current in France to the effect that he would not undertake any offensive operations until one-third of the forces in France were British. His informant had suggested that more vigorous steps were required to disseminate, by means of pictures in the Press, broadcasts, and films, information about the British troops in France. Only in this way could we counteract the effect of enemy propaganda, and bring home to the French people a realisation of the magnitude of our war effort.

He thought that one way of encouraging the French might be to tell them that we were planning for an Army of 55 Divisions.

In the subsequent discussion, it was generally agreed that it would be unwise to mention any actual total of Divisions to the French, as they would take that as a definite commitment to send that number to the Western-- front. Nevertheless, it might be necessary to give the French some idea of the scale of our plans for production of war material, if enemy propaganda in France appeared to be meeting with any success. In the meanwhile, all possible steps should be taken to increase the publicity accorded to the arrival of our troops in France, by arranging for films to be distributed, and photographs to be inserted in the Press.


245

W.M. 31 (39).

In this connection, it was pointed out that more could be done in this country, where News Reel films at present contained little or no material about our own forces.

The War Cabinet agreed 

To invite the Secretary of State for War, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, to investigate the existing arrangements for making known in France the activities of the British armed forces, and particularly the Army, and to take steps to improve them.

Roumania.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 24th Conclusions, Minute 13.)

6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 491, which he had sent the previous evening (the 28th September, 1939) to His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Bucharest, informing him that the previous day M. Tilea, the Roumanian Minister in London, speaking personally and without instruction, had (at an interview with Sir Alexander Cadogan) enquired whether the British guarantee to Roumania, which he admitted, though phrased in general terms, had been designed for the protection of Roumania against German aggression, would operate also, if necessary, against the Soviet Union. He (the Secretary of State) had at the same time instructed Sir Reginald Hoare to inform the Roumanian Government, if they were to raise the question, that he must refer the matter to London for instructions. It appeared to him (the Secretary of State) that the first step should be to ascertain the views of the French Government, and, with the concurrence of the Prime Minister, he had accordingly addressed a telegram (No. 725 (Saving)) late the previous evening (the 28th September, 1939) to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, asking him to take up the matter immediately with M. Daladier. His (the Secretary of State&apos;s) view was that, if the U.S.S.R. were to invade Bessarabia, there would be no greater reason for us to declare war than there had been when they had invaded Poland, whereas there would be many disadvantages in our adopting such a course. From a short conversation which he had had with M. Corbin, he anticipated that the French Government would take the same view.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey..

Conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty. (Previous Reference : W.M. (39) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Treaty with Turkey, the Military Convention and the Special Agreement had been initialled at Ankara at 6 p.m. the previous day (Telegram No. 521 from Ankara). The Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Office had stated that the Turkish Government would be ready to sign the Treaty as soon as the Minister for Foreign Affairs returned from Moscow, or possibly even before. The Turkish Government had asked that complete secrecy should be preserved, pending M. Sarajoglu&apos;s return from Moscow.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Visit of General to telegram No. 591,&apos; dated the 28th September, 1939, from His Orbay to Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara 

London. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 28th Conclusion, Minute 10.)

[20081]

(i) stating that General Orbay had the previous day left for London, where he was due to arrive on the 1st October, 1939; (Note. Later information showed that he would arrive on the 2nd October.) (ii) expressing the opinion that it was of great importance that General Orbay should receive marked courtesy and consideration during his visit;   \.  

b 3


246

(iii) urging that, if, as no doubt would be inevitable, it would be found necessary to refuse supply of some of the items of war material for which General Orbay would ask, he should be given full and convincing proof of the reasons for such a refusal.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he understood that the provisional conclusion so far reached was that it would not be possible to supply any further armaments to Allies for many months to come, since no such supplies could be spared in view of the possibility of an early German attack on the Western Front. It would create a deplorable impression, however, if General Orbay&apos;s requests were met with a flat refusal.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that it was proposed that the discussions with General Orbay should be conducted by the British and French Permanent Military Representatives, who were in constant session in London. The British representatives would receive instructions from the Deputy Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Allied Demands Committee, and special French Officers were being sent over from Paris to London. At some stage in the discussions it might be necessary for Ministers to consider whether, on wide political grounds, it would be desirable to modify any of the conclusions reached by our military advisers.

The War Cabinet 

(a) took note 

(i) that arrangements would be made by the Admiralty for General Orbay and his Staff to be brought to this country in one of His Majesty&apos;s destroyers; (ii) that the Secretary of State for War had arranged for an Orderly Officer to be attached to General Orbay during his visit; (iii) that the discussions with General Orbay would be conducted by the British and French Permanent Military Representatives, it being understood that, if difficulties were encountered, reference was to be made to the Ministers primarily concerned;

(b) agreed 

that arrangements should be made for General Orbay during his visit to be brought into close personal contact with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, the Ministerial Heads of the Fighting Forces and with the Chiefs of Staff, in order that he might thereby be given an opportunity of realising our difficulties and appreciating why it would not be possible to meet his demands in full.

German-Soviet 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Agreement. to the terms (as reported by the news agencies) of the agreement (Previous reached between Germany and the U.S.S.R. as the result of the Reference- discussions between Herr von Ribbentrop and M. Molotov in W.M. (39) 30th Moscow.

Conclusions ^n ^ne course 01 discussion, attention was drawn to the

Minute 7.) &apos;       following points : 

(i) a line of demarcation had been laid down defining the portions of Poland to be occupied by Germany and the U.S.S.R. respectively, and this line was stated to be definitive. It appeared therefore that the two Governments did not contemplate the continued existence of any independent Polish State. In this partition Russia had lost heavily to Germany, the new line being some 150 miles to the east of the 1914 boundary between Germany and Russia;


247

W.M. 31 (39).

(ii) the Governments of Germany and the U.S.S.R. had agreed

to make an effort to bring to an end the present war between Germany, and France and Great Britain, and had agreed that, if this failed, they would consult together regarding the necessary measures to be taken. This provision appeared to imply a very early peace offensive by Germany, acting in conjunction with the U.S.S.R.;

(iii) the paragraph in the agreement regarding trade relations

between Germany and the U.S.S.R. did not apparently aim at doing more than restoring the previous volume of trade between the two countries.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Anglo-Soviet Trade

Negotiations.

(Previous Reference:&apos; W.M. (39) 19th Conclusions, Minute 14.)

10. Arising out of the discussion recorded in Minute 9 above on the reported agreement between Germany and the U.S.S.R., there was general agreement that it would be unfortunate if we were to allow our proposed trade negotiations with the U.S.S.R. to lapse, in view especially of the urgent need for obtaining (if possible) supplies of timber from the Soviet Union.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should ascertain what the position was regarding the proposed Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations, and report to the War Cabinet.

Sweden. \\    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that

he had the previous afternoon (the 28th September, 1939) had an interview with M. Boheman, the Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry of Stockholm, who was in London for the purpose of discussing the proposed War Trade Agreement. The substance of this conversation, in which M. Boheman had adopted a very stiff and unhelpful attitude, was as follows: 

Bofors guns (i) M. Boheman had admitted that the Bofors guns now

ordered by His awaiting shipment to this country had been made by

Majesty&apos;s private manufacture, but had explained that it had been

Government. the established policy of the Swedish Government for

(Previous many years, and through more than one war, to prohibit

Reference: the sale of munitions to belligerents.   The fact that no

W.M. (39) 22nd such munitions could be exported from Sweden without

Conclusions, a Government licence inevitably attached responsibility

Minute 2.) to the Swedish Government, and he held out no hope

that they would depart from the decision which they had taken up in this matter, since to do so would endanger their conception of neutrality and would, moreover, expose them to dangerous reproaches from Germany. M. Boheman, in response to a suggestion by the Secretary of State, had undertaken at once to consult his Government as to the possibility of permitting the transfer of the Bofors guns in question to the order of some neutral Government, which might subsequently be willing to transfer them to us. He (the Secretary of State) had gathered the impression that, if a workable plan on these lines could be devised, the Swedish Government would not refuse to acquiesce.


248

Swedish exports of iron ore to Germany. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 20th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

Proposed Message to Young Men in Germany from Members of Parliament serving in the Armed Forces.

(ii) It appeared that very little iron ore was being exported through Narvik. With the exception of ore from the Southern mines, very little iron ore would be exported to Germany after November until the month of May.

The First Sea Lord gave the information available to the Admiralty, as to the reason why export through Narvik had been stopped.

The War Cabinet : 

(i) invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to

consider, in consultation with the Departments concerned, whether a scheme could be devised to facilitate the export from Sweden of Bofors guns ordered by His Majesty&apos;s Government;

(ii) took note of the position in regard to export of Swedish

iron ore to Germany.

12. The War Cabinet were informed that five Members of Parliament who were also serving Officers in the Defence Forces (Lord Clydesdale, Lord Burghley, Lieut.-Commander Fletcher, Sir Hugh Seely and Mr. Henderson) had put forward a proposal that they should be allowed to issue a manifesto to the young men of Germany, in the form of a broadcast.

The Members of Parliament concerned had already communicated with the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Service Ministers. They had been informed, on behalf of the Prime Minister, that as they were serving Officers they would have to obtain leave from the Service Departments before they could carry out their intention. The substance of their proposed message had been examined by the Foreign Secretary, who thought that it was not open to objection.

In discussion, the view was expressed that, if these Officers were allowed to broadcast, or to express their views in letters addressed to the Press, it was difficult to see how similar permission could be denied to other Officers who might hold different views. It was therefore felt that it would be undesirable that permission should be accorded by the Defence Departments to serving Officers to broadcast or to write letters to the Press on matters of high policy.

On the other hand, the Officers concerned were Members of Parliament, and there was nothing to prevent them exercising their constitutional right of making their views known by speeches in Parliament.

The War Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to cause a communication to be sent to the five Members of Parliament concerned in this sense.

Despatch of Personal Messages of Condolence.

13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (W.P. (G.) (39) 19) on the subject of the despatch of personal messages of condolence to the relations of those killed in action during the war. Attached to the memorandum were :- 

(a\) two reports from an Inter-Departmental Conference; (b) an extract from a letter setting out the views of the First Lord of the Admiralty.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence explained to the War Cabinet the considerations which had led the Inter-Departmental Committee to recommend either that the message should be confined to the Fighting Services or that no message should be sent. He read to the War Cabinet a letter he had received from the First Lord of the Admiralty urging that the historic procedure


172

249 W.M. 31 &lt;39).

of a Royal Message to the relations of those killed in the Fighting Services should not be departed from, and advocating that a message should also be sent to the relations of those in the Civilian Services who were killed during the performance of their duties.

The Minister explained that, in his view, the Message of Condolence should be confined to the three Fighting Services, following the practice of the last war. He referred to the special steps taken after the end of the last war in regard to relations of members of the Mercantile Marine killed in the war. Possibly some similar action might be taken after the end of the present war in regard to members of Civil Defence Services.

The Home Secretary said that he felt some difficulty in drawing a distinction in this matter between those serving under the Crown and those engaged in civilian duties. He was satisfied, however, that it was quite impossible to differentiate between different classes of civilians.

A suggestion was made that it might be practicable to send a modified form of Royal Message in the case of civilians killed during the performance of their duties. The general view was, however, that this Message would have to take the form of some general pronouncement, and not of a Message to the relations of individual civilians.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To recommend to His Majesty that the despatch of a Personal Message of Condolence should follow the practice of the last War, and should be confined to the relations of members of the Fighting Services.

Ministry of 14.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the

Information.     Minister of Information (W.P. (G.) (39) 23) setting&quot; out new Arrangements    proposals for the distribution of news and for censorship, for distribution . &lt;.       i i-     ?           in-
