3. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that there had been a considerable increase of German Divisions identified on the Western Front. The maximum number was now put at 78. Five new bridges had been built on the Saar and two on the Rhine.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the French still held the view that a German attack would be made on the Maginot Line, followed by one through the Low Countries. He was inclined to think that the Germans might attack through Luxemburg. In any event, it appeared that an attack was in preparation.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

4. The Secretary of State for War said that a circumstantial statement had been put out by the German Government, to the effect that we had supplied the Poles with &apos;( yellow cross &apos;&apos; gas. A Swiss doctor was alleged to have examined nine casualties, and to have said that they were suffering from the effects of this gas. He was proposing to issue an official denial, which he read to the War Cabinet.

There was some discussion on the terms of the denial, and certain amendments were suggested. It was also suggested that the Press might take the point (which would not, of course, form part of the official statement) that the issue of false statements of this kind usually heralded a breach of faith by the German Government, who sought by this means to justify themselves.

The War Cabinet agreed 

To authorise the Secretary of State for War to issue a denial, in the terms agreed upon at the meeting, of the German statement that we had supplied gas to Poland.

The &quot;War Cabinet approved the draft telegram subject to the amendments proposed to paragraphs 13 and 14, and to such amendment of paragraph 10 as might be agreed by the Secretary of State for India and the Chiefs of Staff in consultation.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Herr Hitler&apos;s Speech to the Reichstag.

Third Revision of a draft Statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 44th Conclusions, Minute 17.)

7. The War Cabinet had before them a third revised draft* of the Statement to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in reply to Herr Hitler&apos;s speech to the Reichstag, together with copies of telegrams from the Governments of Canada (unnumbered). New Zealand (telegram No. 183), Australia (telegram No. 133) and South Africa (telegram No. 7).

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that at a discussion with the High Commissioners on the previous evening it appeared that agreement had been reached. At a further meeting that morning, however, all the High Commissioners had expressed general agreement with the line taken in the telegram from General Smuts, which had arrived in the interval. This telegram suggested that the Statement should include a more precise definition of our war aims, and in particular that the demarcation of fair boundaries for a restored Czechoslovakia and Poland should be left to a Conference of neutral Powers. He (the Secretary of State) had pointed out the impracticability of this particular suggestion, but the High Commissioners had pressed the point that all the four Dominions, without previous consultation, were putting forward the same criticisms of the draft Statement.

The Prime Minister said that he could not for a second time postpone making the Statement. He was very averse from any further substantial alterations of the draft. The particular suggestion for a conference of neutral Powers to draw boundaries showed a failure to appreciate the realities of the situation. In any event, it was clearly out of the question to make this suggestion, since there had been no consultation in regard to it with the neutral Powers themselves or with the French Government. ThgkHigh Commissioners could be told that it need not be assumed that this was the last opportunity that we should have for a statement of our war aims on more precise lines. The draft Statement left the door open, and if Herr Hitler was, in fact, sincere in wishing for peace, there would therefore be time for further consultation with them on these proposals.

This view was approved by the War Cabinet. The main object in the drafting of the Statement had been to put Herr Hitler in the dilemma of having to decide what steps he would take in order to show that his desire for peace was genuine. An amendment on the lines proposed by the Dominions nullified this object.

The War Cabinet considered various alternatives to meet the views of the Dominions. For example, could an addition be made to the draft on the lines of saying that, if the German Government would satisfy us that their proposals constituted a basis for discussion, we should be willing to formulate proposals in detail? &apos; , * See Annex to these Conclusions.


246

369 W.M. 45 (39).

But any addition on these lines would allow Herr Hitler to escape from the dilemma.

The view was expressed that there were points in the Statement which Herr Hitler could seize on if his real desire was peace. If, on the other hand, he took the view that the Statement was insulting to him, the real reason would be that he had no sincere desire for peace. It was also pointed out that there was a fundamental inconsistency in the suggestions put forward by the Dominions representatives. These suggestions at the same time pressed for the inclusion in the Statement of more precise definitions of our conditions for peace (definitions which would certainly be immediately refused by the German Government), and also asked us to take a line which would leave the door open for further negotiations.

There was some discussion as to how best to refer to the Dominions in the Statement, in view of their attitude. It was agreed to meet this point by stating at the beginning that the fullest consultation had taken place, but making it clear that the Statement was being made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. An amendment to this effect was made on the first page of the Statement. HHB

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that the Dominion Governments would not in any case express any open disagreement with the Statement as drafted.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposed various amendments to the draft. He suggested the addition of (1) a reference to the Polish Government as well as to the French Government (paragraph 17); (2) a specific reference to &apos;&apos; India and the rest of the British Empire &quot; as well as to the Dominions (paragraph 13); (3) the substitution of the phrase &quot; we, the British peoples, and France&quot; for &quot;we and France,&quot; in paragraph 20. These suggestions were approved.

Accordingly, the War Cabinet 

(i) approved the draft Statement in the form now submitted

to them, subject to its amendment to meet the points mentioned above:

(ii) invited the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for

Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to see the Dominion High Commissioners immediately after the Meeting in order to explain the situation again to them.

ANNEX.

Third Revised Draft of the Statement to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in reply to Herr Hitler&apos;s Speech to the Reichstag.

LAST week, in speaking of the announcement about the Russo-German Pact, I observed that it contained a suggestion that some peace proposals were likely to be put forward, and I said that, if such proved to be the case, we should examine them in consultation with the Governments of the Dominions and of the French Republic in the light of certain relevant considerations.

2. Since then the German Chancellor has made his speech, but, before I inform the House of the results of our examination of it, I must ask Hon. Members to recall for a few moments the background against which his proposals appear.

3. At the end of August His Majesty&apos;s Government were actively engaged in correspondence with the German Government on the subject of Poland. It was evident that the situation was dangerous, but we believed that it should be possible to arrive at a peaceful solution if passions were not deliberately stimulated, and we felt quite certain that the German Government could, if they desired, influence their friends in Danzig in such a way as to bring about a relaxation of tension and so create conditions favourable to calm and sober negotiation. It will be remembered that in the course of this correspondence the German Chancellor expressed his wish for improved relations between our two countries as soon, as the Polish question was settled, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government replied that they fully shared the wish, but that everything turned on the nature and method of settlement with Poland. We pointed out that a forcible solution would inevitably involve the fulfilment of our obligations to Poland, and we begged the German Chancellor to enter into direct discussions with the Polish Government, in which the latter Government had already expressed its willingness to take part.

4. As everyone knows, these efforts on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to avoid war and the use of force were in vain. In August last the President of the United States made an appeal to Herr Hitler to come to a conference in order to prevent war breaking out in Europe. At about the same time the King of the Belgians, the Queen of the Netherlands, His Holiness the Pope, and Signor Mussolini all tendered their good offices, but equally in vain. It is evident now that Herr Hitler was determined to make war on Poland, and, whatever sincerity there may have been in his wish to come to an understanding with Great Britain, it was not strong enough to induce him to postpone an attack upon his neighbour. On the 1st September Herr Hitler violated the Polish Frontier and invaded Poland, beating down by force of arms and machinery the resistance of the Polish Nation and Army. As attested by neutral observers, Polish towns and villages were bombed and shelled into rum ; and civilians were slaughtered wholesale, in contravention, at any rate in the later stages, of all the undertakings of which Herr Hitler now speaks with pride as though he had fulfilled them.

5. It is after this wanton act of aggression, which has cost so many Polish and German lives, sacrificed to satisfy his own insistence on the use of force, that the German Chancellor now puts forward his proposals.

6. If there existed any expectation that in these proposals would be included some attempt to make amends for this grievous crime against humanity, following so soon upon the violation of the rights of the Czecho-Slovak nation, it has been doomed to disappointment. The Polish State and its leaders are covered with abuse. What the fate of that part of Poland which Herr Hitler describes as the German sphere of interest is to be does not clearly emerge from his speech, but it is evident that he regards it as a matter for the consideration of Germany alone, to be settled solely in accordance with German interests. The final shaping of this territory and the question of the restoration of a Polish State are, in Herr Hitler&apos;s view, problems which cannot be settled by war in the west, but exclusively by Russia on the one side and Germany on the other.


371

7. We must take it, then, that the proposals which the German Chancellor puts forward for the establishment of what he calls &quot; the certainty of European security&apos;&apos; are to be based on recognition of his conquests and his right to do what he pleases with the conquered.

8. It would be impossible for Great Britain to accept any such basis without forfeiting her honour and abandoning her claim that international disputes should be settled by discussion and not by force.

9. The passages in the speech designed to give fresh assurances to Herr Hitler&apos;s neighbours I pass over, since they will know what value should be attached to them by reference to the similiar assurances he has given in the past.

10. But it would be easy to quote sentences from his speeches in 1935, 1936 and 1938 stating in the most definite terms his determination not to annex Austria or conclude an Anschluss with her, not to fall upon Czecho-Slovakia and not to make any further territorial claims in Europe after the Sudetenland question had been settled in September 1938.

Nor can we pass over Herr Hitler&apos;s radical departure from the long-professed principles of his policy and creed, as instanced by the inclusion in the German Reich of many millions of Poles and Czechs, despite his repeated professions to the contrary, and by the pact with the Soviet Union concluded after his repeated and violent denunciations of bolshevism.

11. This repeated disregard of his word and these sudden reversals of policy bring me to the fundamental difficulty in dealing with the wider proposals in the German Chancellor&apos;s speech. The plain truth is that, after our past experience, it is no longer possible to rely upon the unsupported word of the present German Government.

12. It is no part of our policy to exclude from her rightful place in Europe a Germany which will live in amity and confidence with other nations. On the contrary, we believe that no effective remedy can be found for the world&apos;s ills that does not take account of the just claims and needs of all countries, and whenever the time may come to draw the lines of a new peace settlement His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel that the future would hold little hope unless such a settlement could be reached through the method of negotiation and agreement.

13. It was not, therefore, with any vindictive purpose that we embarked on war. It is not alone the freedom of the small nations that is at stake: there is also in jeopardy the peaceful existence of Great Britain, the Dominions, France, and, indeed, of all freedom-loving countries. Whatever may be the issue of the present struggle, and in whatever way it may be brought to a conclusion, the world will not be the same world that we have known before. Deep changes will inevitably leave their mark on every field of men&apos;s thought and action, and if humanity is to guide aright the new forces that will be in operation all nations will have their part to play.

14. His Majesty&apos;s Government know all too well that in modern war between Great Powers victor and vanquished must alike suffer cruel loss. But surrender to wrong-doing would spell the extinction of all hope, and the annihilation of all those values of life which have through centuries been at once the mark and the inspiration of human progress.

15. We seek no material advantage for ourselves; we desire nothing from the German people which should offend their self-respect. We are not aiming only at victory, but rather looking beyond it to the laying of a foundation of a better international system, which will mean that war is not to be the inevitable lot of every succeeding generation.

16 I am certain that all the peoples of Europe, including the people of Germany, long for peace, a peace which will enable them to live their lives without fear, and to devote their energies and their gifts to the development of their culture, the pursuit of their ideals and the improvement of their material prosperity. The peace which we are determined to secure, however, must be a real and settled peace, not an uneasy truce interrupted by constant alarms and


372

repeated threats. What stands in the way of such a peace I It is the German Government, and the German Government alone, for it is they who by repeated acts of aggression have robbed all Europe of tranquillity and implanted in the hearts of all their neighbours an ever-present sense of insecurity and fear.

I I am glad to think that there is complete agreement between the vrevtfs of His Majesty&apos;s Government and those of the French Government.&quot; Hon. Members will nave read the speech which was broadcast by M. Daladier last Tuesday. &quot; We have,&quot; he said, &quot; taken up arms against aggression; we shall not lay them down until we have certain guarantees of security a security which cannot be called in question every six months.&quot;

I would sum up the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government as follows: 

18. Herr Hitler rejected all suggestions for peace until he had overwhelmed Poland, as he had previously overthrown Czecno-Slovakia. Peace conditions cannot be acceptable which begin by condoning aggression.

19. The proposals in the German Chancellor&apos;s speech are vague and uncertain and contain no suggestion for righting the wrongs done to Czecho-Slovakia and to Poland.

20. Even if Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals were more closely denned and contained suggestions to right these wrongs, it would still be necessary to ask by what practical means the German Government intend to convince the world that aggression will cease and that pledges will be kept. Past experience has shown that no reliance can be placed upon the promises of the present German Government. Accordingly, acts not words alone must be forthcoming before we and France, our gallant and trusted Ally, would be justified in ceasing to wage war to the utmost of our strength. Only when world confidence is restored will it be possible to find solutions of those vital questions of disarmament and restoration of trade which are essential to the well-being of the peoples.

21. There is thus a primary condition to be satisfied. Only the German Government can fulfil it. If they will not, there can as yet be no new or better world order of the kind for which all nations yearn.

22. The issue is therefore plain. Either the German Government must give convincing proof of the sincerity of their desire for peace by definite acts and by the provision of effective guarantees of their intention to fulfil their undertakings, or we must persevere in our duty to the end. It is for Germany to make her choice.
