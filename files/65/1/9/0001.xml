Air Operations. 2. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet (Previous that more leaflets had been dropped in Germany. Leaflet operations

Reference: would continue, but it was not proposed to publish any further W.M. (39), 8th  statements on the matter for the moment.

Conclusions, Later in the proceedings, the Secretary of State for Foreign

Minute 1.) Affairs said that he had just been informed by the Belgian Government that three of our aeroplanes had violated Belgian territory on the previous night and that there had been some fighting between our aeroplanes and a Belgian aeroplane, one of which had been shot down. He had given instructions that we should make the fullest apology and should offer to pay ample compensation, and should say i that we would repeat the rigid instructions, that had already been given to our aircraft, to respect Belgian neutrality.

The War Cabinet agreed that this episode might make necessary a further statement to the effect that leaflet operations had been carried out on the previous night.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), Conclusions, Minute 2.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that, in the previous twenty-four hours, four British ships had been sunk out of a total of seven attacked.

The average daily loss of tonnage for the first six days of the 8th war was about 9,000 tons, as compared with 18,000 tons per day in April 1917 the peak month during the last war. Attacks had so far been carried out by submarines only; it was to be expected that surface raiders would come into operation with the institution of convoys, which would present attractive targets to that form of attack.

The First Lord added that he proposed to circulate a Memorandum on the anti-submarine measures which had been and were being taken, and on the question of tonnage replacement.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Army Situation.

(Previous Reference : W.M. (39), 8th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that the concentration of the French Army was proceeding and heavy firing was in progress on the Front.

There was little change from the day before in the situation in Poland. Heavy fighting was taking place north of Warsaw. It appeared that the Polish Army might be able to stabilize a line north and south through Lublin. The Vistula bridges had been destroyed, but owing to the abnormal drought there was no difficulty in wading the Vistula.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Despatch of 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a despatch from the

Aircraft to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the British Ambassador Poland. in Paris (War Cabinet Paper No. W.P. (39) 16) and an exchange of

telegrams between the Prime Minister and M. Daladier (War Cabinet Paper No. W.P. (39) 17) on the subject of assistance to Poland in the shape of aircraft and munitions.

The Prime Minister said that he had received from M. Daladier a telegram in which he pressed the British Government to do all in their power to reinforce the Polish Air Force. The French had given the Poles 50 aircraft but, as delivery was apparently being made at Dunkirk, it did not appear likely that they could arrive in time to be of use. In his reply he had informed M. Daladier of the aircraft and munitions already on the way from this country to Constanza. He understood Roumania would not hinder the despatch of war materials.

The Chief of Air Staff said that he had later information of the action being taken by the French. Forty modern fighters were being sent via Marseilles and a further 40 or 50 were being sent to Syria for forwarding to Poland as and when opportunity offered.

The Chiefs of Staff had received that morning an oral report from Captain Davies of the British Military Mission who had just returned from Poland. The latter had emphasised the importance of immediate material assistance to Poland, particularly in the form of aircraft and machine guns, the receipt of which would have a great moral effect.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the Admiralty could let the War Office have 15 million rounds of -303 ammunition.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements, and invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to make representations in Bucharest to ensure that no delay occurred in delivery to the Poles of war material consigned through Roumania.

Land Forces. 6.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report

(Previous by the Land Forces Committee on the size of the land forces Eeference: at which we should aim in the present war, and the date W.M. (39), 6th of completion of equipment of the various contingents, as a Conclusions, basis for the production arrangements to be made by the Ministry Minute l.) of Supply (Paper No. W.P. (39) 14). The following were the main points made in a long discussion, a fuller account of which is being circulated to the Ministers immediately concerned.

The Lord Privy Seal, Chairman of the Land Forces Committee, explained that although it was not specially stated in their report, the Committee had accepted priority for our air requirements and for some part at any rate of our naval requirements.

The figure of 55 divisions for the Field Army, to be aimed at within two years, was made up as follows : 

32 divisions : British Army. 14 divisions : Dominions.

4 divisions : India.

5 divisions : 10 per cent, reserve for supply to Allies and

so forth.

The figure of at least 20 divisions by the end of the first 12 months was regarded as a practicable objective for the Ministry of Supply.

The Secretary of State for War was satisfied with the proposals of the Committee. He explained that eleven Divisions would be ready to go overseas within six months, although their equipment would be deficient in certain respects.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty felt that we must develop our land effort as quickly as possible, and hoped that it would be possible l-o accelerate the equipping of the first 20 divisions.

The Prime Minister raised a point which he considered of fundamental importance. The Report dealt with army requirements


65

W.M. 9 (39).

only. The Germans had a superiority in air armaments, and the recent fighting in Poland showed how such a superiority could be employed to the detriment of land operations. To meet this superiority, we should have to increase materially our productive capacity for aircraft, and he felt therefore that the production programmes of the three Services should be considered together as a whole, and also in relation to civil industry.

It was pointed out in discussion that the Minister of Supply required immediately an objective at which to aim, so that planning could go forward. It was suggested, therefore, that while no decision should be taken on the ultimate objective of 55 Divisions until the requirements of all three Services had been reviewed, the Minister of Supply should be empowered to start planning for that objective immediately.

Some discussion took place as to whether immediate information should be sent to the Dominions as to the extent of the land forces which we should expect them to raise.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed out that Canada, in the last War, had obtained two Army Corps by conscription : but that they were unlikely to adopt this measure in the present war, at least for some considerable time. South Africa had stated that she was not prepared to send forces outside Africa. Further, detailed communications had been sent to Canada, Australia and New Zealand in the last few days, informing them of the ways in which they could give immediate help. In the circumstances, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that he would prefer to have time to think the matter over before any further communication was sent to the Dominions on this matter.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) to authorise the Minister of Supply to make all arrange-

ments for the supply on the full British Army scale for at least 20 Divisions within the first twelve months of the war, and that he should do his utmost to increase this minimum:

(ii) to authorise the Minister of Supply to make early arrange-

ments for the despatch of a Mission to Paris to coordinate the supply demand between the French and ourselves :

(iii) to defer a decision on the size of the Land Forces which

should be our ultimate objective in the present war until the Land Forces Committee had considered the production requirements of the three Services       whole:

(iv) to invite the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of

State for Air and the Minister of Supply, in consultation with the Minister of Labour and of National Service, to prepare Memoranda on their supply requirements for the purposes of the examination by the Land Forces Committee required by (iii) above :

(v) that, pending examination of the problem by the Land

Forces Committee, the Minister of Supply should be authorised to start preliminary planning for the supply on the full British Army scale of 55 Divisions by the end of the second year of the war :

(vi) that, to assist in tiding over the early months of the war,

arrangements should be made, either by improvisation from spare resources in this country, or, if practicable, by purchase from abroad, for an increase in guns, particularly of the heavier calibres :

(vii) that, for the present, no further communications should

be made to Dominion Governments in regard to the size of the land forces which it was hoped they would make available.

Turkey. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

(Previous War Cabinet that no report had as yet been received from His Reference: Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, regarding the receipt of the W.M. (39), 8th promised comprehensive proposals of the Turkish Government, and Conclusions, in consequence it was not known whether these had in fact been sub-Minute 6.) mitted to the Ambassador by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the previous day (the 8th September, 1939), as had been promised.

It was not possible to take any further steps in regard to the proposed Anglo-Turkish political treaty until the promised comprehensive proposals had been received from the Turkish Government.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Report of Sir Nevile Henderson.

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had seen Sir Nevile Henderson on the previous day. Sir Nevile had been doubtful regarding the value of the distribution of leaflets in Germany from the air and had been of the opinion that greater value would be secured by the distribution either of straightforward news bulletins or of such declarations as the Prime Minister&apos;s speech and the King&apos;s speech.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Par East. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

Release of War Cabinet that he had received a report that Colonel Spear had Colonel Spear,    been released by the Japanese authorities.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Far East.

Japanese request for withdrawal of British gunboat^ from.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 8th Conclusions, Minute 13.)

10. The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that a report had been received the previous day from the Commander of His Majesty&apos;s Gunboat Seamew stating that he had received a request from the local Japanese Commander that the Seamew should leave Canton, and adding that he anticipated that if no reply were given within the next two or three days it was likely that the Japanese might resort to force, and that, if attacked he proposed to resist. Continuing, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that in his opinion the proper course would be to order the withdrawal of this gunboat rather than risk a serious conflict with the Japanese. It should be remembered also that both British and German gunboats had submitted to being interned by the Chinese during the Great War.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hoped that whatever action the War Cabinet might agree upon would not prejudice the final decision to be taken by us in regard to the Far Eastern situation. The previous night he had addressed communications to the French and United States Governments as agreed upon at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin.

The War Cabinet agreed :- 

(a) that immediate orders should be issued to the Commander

of His Majesty&apos;s Gunboat Seamew to leave Canton, the withdrawal to be effected with as little loss of dignity as possible and to be based on the fact that British and German gunboats had submitted to being interned by the Chinese during the Great War, and that it was convenient for us at the present time that this gunboat should be so withdrawn;

(b) that orders should be issued to the Commanders of other

British gunboats in Chinese waters directing them to withdraw in like manner if requested to do so by the Japanese authorities and if, in their opinion, there was


58

67

W.M. 9 (39).

a risk of a serious conflict if this request was not complied with;

(c) that the orders to be issued under (a) and (b) above should not be held to prejudice the final decision to be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the Far Eastern situation with regard to which communications had the previous night been addressed to the French and Japanese Governments.

Egypt. 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

(Previous        War Cabinet that an unexpected difficulty had arisen with regard Eef erence:        to the declaration by Egypt of war with Germany, a matter which, W.M. (39), 8th  as he had explained at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in Conclusions,      the margin, he had hoped had been satisfactorily settled.  He had, Minute 11.)      however, since received a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Cairo, stating that when he handed the agreed letter to the Egyptian Prime Minister the latter had stated that he had received a report from the Egyptian Ambassador, London, stating that he (the Ambassador) had been informed by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that we should regard it as satisfactory if Egypt remained neutral, since thereby we should be able to obtain United States war material through Egypt. There was no truth whatever in this statement, and he (the Secretary of State) had telegraphed to-day to the Ambassador repudiating the words attributed to Mr. Butler.   He hoped, therefore, that the matter would shortly be settled satisfactorily.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

British Sab-marines in the Caribbean Sea.

(Previous Eef erence: W.M. (39), 8th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he had received a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, reporting that he had been asked by the State Department whether it was proposed that any British Submarines should operate in the Caribbean Sea.

The First Lord of the Admiralty replied that this was not the intention of the Admiralty, since it was thought better to leave this region to the United States patrol.

The Secretary of State said that he would inform His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, accordingly.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Arab Attitude in the Middle East.

13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had been informed that as a result of a number of secret meetings in Beirut, at which the Mufti had been present, it had been decided that the Iraq, Egyptian and Saudi Arabian Monarchs should be asked to make a proposal to the Central Arab Committee in Jerusalem that a halt should be called in anti-British activities during the war and that support should be given to the democracies in their struggle against Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

14. The Chief of the Air Staff said that Captain Da vies, who Extent of h_a(j jus^ returned from Poland,, had stated that it was clear that the German Air German Air Force had not confined their attacks to purely military Aetlon in objectives in Poland.   Their attacks had been directed to Polish

Poland. industry, including in particular the aircraft industry, and also to

such objectives as power installations.    It would be necessary to


68

Duration of the

Anticipated

War.

consider the effect of this action on our own policy.   This matter would be considered by the Chiefs of Staff Committee, who would submit a Report to the War Cabinet as soon as possible. (A fuller account of the discussion on this point is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Minutes.) The War Cabinet 

(1) took note that a Report on this matter would be submitted

by the Chiefs of Staff Committee :

(2) agreed that steps should be taken to ensure that the Ministry

of Information should give publicity to the wide range of targets attacked in Poland by the German Air Force.

15. In connection with information received as to the progress of operations on the Eastern Front, discussion took place as to the anticipated duration of the War. The same point was also touched on in the discussions on Minute 6 as to the long-term plan for our land forces.

In discussion it was pointed out that the situation which had arisen was one which the Germans would do all in their power to exploit by propaganda.

Germany would now endeavour to convince the Poles that we were about to desert them and that they had better surrender. A statement to reassure the Poles was, therefore, essential, and it would be desirable that such a statement should be issued before any peace offer was made by the Germans. The effect on world opinion of forestalling any such German move would be much greater than if we waited for the announcement of a German offer.

The Prime Minister said that he had been considering the question of issuing some statement. He was unwilling to attempt to define our war aims, as this might have the effect of tying us down too rigidly and might prejudice an eventual settlement; It was clear that the essential preliminary to any settlement of European problems was the destruction of Hitlerism. While, however, any statement on our war aims was premature, it would be as well to put an end to uninformed rumours according to which our action might be influenced by the events in Poland, although it had always been foreseen that Poland would be largely over-run before we could effectively intervene. To put an end to such senseless rumours an early statement was desirable. He hoped that, after consultation with the French Government, it would be possible to issue a joint statement on the Anglo-French attitude before the House of Commons met on Wednesday.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that it was clear from conversations he had had with Mr. Bruce and other High Commissioners that the Dominion Governments would welcome the issue of a statement forestalling Herr Hitler&apos;s peace terms.

The War Cabinet agreed: 

(a) that a declaration should be issued to the Press the same

day stating in solemn form that His Majesty&apos;s Government were mobilising the entire resources of the country with a view to the successful prosecution of the war, and that to this end they were making all their plans on the assumption that the duration of the war would be at least three years:

(b) that the drafting of the declaration referred to in (a) above

should be undertaken by the Lord Privy Seal, by whom the text should be communicated to the Ministry of Information.
