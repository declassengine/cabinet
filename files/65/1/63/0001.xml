W.M. 63 (39).

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that a raid had been carried out by aircraft from aerodromes in France to drop leaflets over Munich, Stuttgart and Nuremberg.

An enemy reconnaissance aircraft had appeared off Grimsby the day before. It had been engaged by a fighter, but had made its escape. One of our own reconnaissance aircraft, however, had been shot down at the mouth of the Humber. It was thought that it must have been mistaken for the enemy raider, which was being pursued in the clouds.

A report had just been received that two Heinkel bombers had penetrated over the Clyde during the morning. One, and probably the other, had been shot down, though confirmation had not yet been received.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

345

Naval Operations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that it had now been confirmed that U-14 and U-16 had both been destroyed in the neighbourhood of the Straits of Dover.

The French had captured a German ship of 4,000 tons off the West coast of Africa, and had brought her into Dakar. On the other hand, a British ship of 5,000 tons had been torpedoed West of Land&apos;s End.  She had not sunk, and it was hoped to get her in.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Security of 3.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War

Fleet Bases. Cabinet that he had now received the report of Admiral Drax on Scapa Flow. the circumstances of the sinking of H.M.S. Royal Oak and of the (Previous condition of the defences of Scapa Flow.  It appeared that certain

Reference:        representations had been made by the local naval authorities in the W.M. (39) 52nd early part of the year as to the Scapa defences, but it had not Conclusions,      been considered necessary to take steps to improve them.  Some of Minute 5.)        the drifters which had been picketing the entrances to the Flow had been withdrawn for use at other anchorages which had been taken into use in view of the threat of air attack.  There could be no doubt that the U-boat in question had passed through one of these unguarded entrances.   It was obvious that the possibility of submarine attack had never entered into the minds of those on board the Royal Oak.   The lesson was clear that we could not take anything for granted, but must be continually on the watch and guarding against every conceivable contingency in our defences.

The wish was expressed that a copy of the report might be made available for perusal by members of the War Cabinet.

Some discussion took place as to the statement which would have to be made by the First Lord of the Admiralty to the House of Commons on the matter in the ensuing week. It would have to be admitted that the anchorage at Scapa had been unsafe against submarine attack, but it should be made clear that the necessary defences were being provided. Such a statement would not be helpful in any way to the enemy. The First Lord&apos;s statement might also include a review of gains and losses at sea during the first two months of war. The view was generally expressed that any pressure for a long and detailed enquiry into the apportionment of blame for any deficiencies at Scapa should be resisted, since this would involve a great diversion of effort in the Admiralty from other more important work.

The War Cabinet 

(1) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty would make available for the perusal of members of the War Cabinet a copy of the report of Admiral Drax.

[20215]

(2) Agreed that the statement of the First Lord of the Admiralty to the House of Commons in the following week should be on the general lines recorded above.

The Military 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that there had been

Situation. no change from the previous day in the number of German divisions

(Previous on the Western Front. There had been some movement of troops, Reference: including mechanised forces, towards Diisseldorf, but nothing which W.M. (39) 62nd would confirm the alarmist Press reports of movements in the north-Conclusions, west of Germany which had appeared on the previous day. The Minute 3.) intentions of Herr Hitler were, of course, quite incalculable, but there seemed no reason to suppose that the chance of a German offensive on the West in the near future had in any way increased.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Possibility of 5.   The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence informed the

Sea-borne and War Cabinet that he had convened a meeting the evening before of Air-borne Land the Ministerial Committee which had recently considered various Attack on Great strategical matters, in order to form an opinion on telegram No. 305 Britain. from Belgrade, and advise as to the measures which should be taken.

(Previous m1   &lt;.,,       ,         pi-

Reference- e    ar Cabinet were given a full explanation of the view

W M (39) 55th whicn the Committee had formed, and of the action which they Conclusions      recommended should be taken.  A full account of the discussion is Minute 2)       recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard  File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet 

(a) Approved the action which had been, or was about to be,

set on foot in accordance with the recommendations made by the Committee.

(b) Took note that the Minister of Home Security would confer

with the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, with a view to preparing the police to meet certain contingencies.

(c) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to furnish the War

Cabinet each morning with the weather forecast for the ensuing 24 hours.

Size of the British Expeditionary Force.

Correspondence with General Gamelin on the programme for its expansion. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 58th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War covering a letter from General Gamelin to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and a draft reply by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper W.P. (39) 100).

The Secretary of State for War explained that the draft letter from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff was only an interim reply. He recalled that at the meeting referred to in the margin it had been agreed that we should not disclose the exact measure of our intended military contribution on the Western Front. The draft, however, would clearly show to General Gamelin that we did, in fact, intend to raise more than the 32 divisions to which he had referred in his letter.

In discussion, various amendments were agreed upon, having for their object to make it clear 

(1) that the answer to General Gamelin was not intended to convey any advance on the present authorised programmes;

531

W.M. 63 (39).

(2) that, in addition to the figure of man-power in Great Britain given in the draft reply, the resources of the Empire       whole would be drawn upon.

The Secretary of State for War undertook to make the necessary amendments in the draft to cover these points.

The War Cabinet approved the terms of the draft reply to General Gamelin, subject to the incorporation of the amendments proposed in the discussion.

The Balkans.

Italy and the plan for the formation of a neutral Balkan bloc.

(Previous Beference:

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 1079, dated the 26th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, setting out in detail the reasons why he would prefer postponing an approach to Count Ciano on the question of the formation of a neutral Balkan bloc until after he had had an opportunity of discussing the issues with him (the Secretary of State) in London. There was great force in the arguments brought forward by Sir Percy Loraine, and he (the W.M. (39) 62nd Secretary of State) proposed accordingly to defer consideration of Conclusions,      this question.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey.

Russia and the Anglo-Turkish Treaty. (Previous Reference:

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 671, dated the 26th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, reporting having been informed that morning by M. Sarajoglu, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the Soviet Ambassador had called the previous day and asked a number of questions regarding the Anglo-Turkish Treaty. W.M. (39) 52nd The replies given by M. Sarajoglu were, from our point of view, Conclusions,      very satisfactory.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Far Eastern Situation.

The Tientsin question. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 5, and W.M. (39) 57th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 1421, dated the 25th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, reporting a conversation which he had had with Mr. Kato that day with regard to the Tientsin situation. In this conversation Mr. Kato had put forward suggestions for the settlement of the Tientsin question which consisted of a compromise of the kind which we had had in mind. Mr. Kato had agreed to discuss the matter as soon as possible with the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs with a view to arranging, if possible, for a proposal on the lines he had suggested being made by the Japanese Government. The prospects of reaching a settlement in regard to this matter with the Japanese Government appeared, therefore, more hopeful.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Food Rationing.       io.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the (Previous        Minister of Labour and National Service (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 59), Reference:       prepared in pursuance of the Conclusion referred to in the margin, W.M. (39) 60th summarising the results of the enquiries made by him from bodies Conclusions,      representative Of various sections of public opinion.  A statement Minute 2.)       of the views of the Chambers of Commerce, the National Chamber of Trade and of Mr. A. V. Alexander (as representing the Co-operative Societies) was handed round at the meeting for inclusion in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum. [20215] B 3


532

The Minister of Food said that the information contained in Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 59 confirmed his impression 

(i) that the public were prepared to accept rationing if it could

be shown that it was necessary; and (ii) that the public preferred some inconvenience (provided it was satisfied that there would be an equitable distribution of available supplies) to the risk of food shortage, queues, &amp;c.

In his opinion the home front would be strengthened by the institution of rationing forthwith.

The Minister of Labour thought that the views contained in his Memorandum could be expressed in a sentence, namely, that if there was any risk of a shortage in any of the named commodities, that commodity should be rationed forthwith.

The Prime Minister thought that the position was clearly expressed in the remarks attributed to Mr. Mallon on page 5 of the Memorandum: 

&quot;Mr. Mallon (Toynbee Hall) said that (a) imposition of rationing was generally expected, and (b) that it would be accepted with no demur if it were made clear that it was necessary.

Speaking particularly of the East End, he said that in the last war there were two main causes of grievance before the introduction of rationing. The first was the hardship imposed by waiting in queues, and the second, which was even greater, was the knowledge or the belief in the working classes that people who had sufficient money could obtain adequate supplies without having to wait in queues. In his opinion this state of affairs was, from the point of view of the Home Front, the danger point of the last war. In his view, if the working classes were persuaded that everybody was equally restricted and that wealth could not obtain concessions, and that supplies could be obtained in an orderly manner without inconvenience, rationing would be easily accepted.&quot;

His provisional conclusion was that the Ration Books should be issued forthwith, that we should ration at once those commodities (bacon and butter) in regard to which there was a shortage at the present time, but that it would be questionable to ration meat and sugar at present.

The First Lord of the Admiralty was not satisfied that it was necessary to ration the four commodities in question. There were signs in the Press of all political shades that public opinion was becoming increasingly critical of governmental control and interference with the liberty of the individual. It was open to doubt whether the governmental machine could operate the rationing arrangements without creating resentment and unrest more serious even than if there were no rationing and shortages had to be faced. In any event, there was no necessity at present to ration meat and sugar. If, in the case of meat, the necessity arose, it should be possible to institute a &quot; meatless day,&quot; and in that event the only machinery required would be the prohibition of sales of meat for consumption on that day. He hoped that the War Cabinet would decide to take no action at present in regard to rationing; would announce that no reason for rationing was seen; and would exhort the sugar hoarders to stop hoarding. If, however, it could be established that the rationing of bacon and butter was necessary, he would, though reluctantly, agree to the adoption of that course.

The Minister of Food said that queues would form if there was a scarcity of the particular commodities, and he could not say that there would be no such scarcity.  He agreed that rationing should


533

W.M. 63 (39).

not be introduced without very good and substantial reasons, but the situation might change for the worse at any time. For example, it was impossible to say how long the arrangements under which we were obtaining butter and bacon from Denmark would continue. The time factor had also to be borne in mind. The rationing machinery could not operate until the Ration Books had been issued, the consumers had registered with the retailer, and the retailers with the wholesalers. If some grave emergency were to develop before this process had been completed, the consequences as regards the distribution of foodstuffs might be grave.

The Prime Minister thought that much would depend on how the matter was presented to the public. At the moment the press was favourable to the idea of rationing, which public opinion was undoubtedly expecting. Some time was bound to elapse between the date when the Ration Books were issued and the date on which the rationing of particular commodities began. It could be explained that the Government did not propose to ration except in cases where there was a real scarcity and where rationing was, therefore, necessary in order to secure fair and equitable distribution among the public.

The Minister of Food urged reconsideration of the position in regard to sugar. It was clear that hoarding was taking place. There was also the price factor. If we had to buy foreign sugar, we should have to pay 7s. Qd. a cwt. more than the price we had paid for Empire sugar. This would mean an increase of Id. a pound in the retail price. Would the Chancellor of the Exchequer then be able to maintain his increased sugar tax? There would also be exchange difficulties and perhaps, most serious of all, an increase in the cost of living figure.

The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a letter from the Secretary of State for the Colonies urging that sugar should be rationed as soon as possible. The Prime Minister said that the recent increased consumption of sugar was probably mainly due to hoarding. Hoarding arose from fear of rationing, and if it was announced that sugar would not be rationed, the hoarding (which was not long-term hoarding) might be expected to cease, and the hoarders might use up their stocks. We had some 9 or 10 months&apos; supply of sugar in our ownership at home and abroad, and, in all the circumstances, it seemed justifiable to take the risk of not rationing it.

The Minister of Food felt bound to warn the War Cabinet of the financial and other important considerations at stake; if regard was had to these considerations, to the generous ration proposed and to matters such as freedom of rationing in restaurants, &amp;c, he could not avoid the conclusion that, weighty as no doubt the arguments were against rationing, it would be prudent and wise to ration sugar forthwith.

In further discussion it became clear that the War Cabinet generally did not favour the rationing of sugar forthwith. The Prime Minister said that it would, of course, be open to the Minister of Food to invite the Cabinet to reconsider the matter later, if he felt it necessary to do so.

After discusssion the War Cabinet agreed: 

(1) that the rationing of bacon and butter should be put into

operation at an early date:

(2) that the rationing of meat and sugar should not be put

operation at present:

(3) that the recommendations contained in paragraph 24 of

the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Home Policy Committee on Rationing (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 52)


534

should be approved, subject to any modifications which might be necessary as a result of the decision not to institute rationing for meat and sugar. In particular, the Minister of Food should be authorised to instruct the Food Control Committees to begin issuing the Ration Books forthwith, with a view to completing the issue as soon as possible.

Chartering of 11.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding

Neutral Minute (Minute 10) the Minister of Shipping said that he was

Shipping.        circulating to the War Cabinet a Memorandum on the progress of (Previous        the Shipping negotiations (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 60). Reference: Some progress had been made in the discussions with the

W.M. (39) 54th Swedes, who had now returned to Sweden, and would not be back Conclusions, again for about a week. The Norwegian Delegation had arrived Minute 11.) in England and discussions with them had taken place, but the Delegation had no power to make a settlement, even if their demands were met in full. The Delegation was returning to Norway and it might be another week before the discussions could be resumed. The Norwegian demands were fairly high. Some comparatively unimportant bargains had been made with individual Greek shipowners, but, in general, Greek shipping was tending to go to the East on trade of its own. On the whole, the Shipping negotiations with neutral countries had not made the rapid progress that he had hoped, and while a settlement would no doubt ultimately be reached, some time would elapse. His principal anxieties related to the position at the moment and in the immediate future.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Football Pools. 12.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Home

Policy Committee (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 58) on the present position in regard to the resumption of Football Pools as set out in a Memorandum by the Postmaster-General (Paper H.P.C. (39) 61).

The recommendations of the Home Policy Committee were as follows: 

(i) that, in the circumstances explained in Paper H.P.C.

(39) 61, the only way in which Football Pools could be legally forbidden would be by the enactment of ad hoc legislation, and that in the view of the Committee it would be unwise to attempt to pass any such legislation :

(ii) that the question whether coupons should be accepted by

the Football Pool Promoters&apos; Association under their new scheme from Naval, Military or Air Force addresses was a matter to be determined by the Association and was not one calling in any way for Government intervention.

The War Cabinet approved these recommendations.

Imposition of 13.   The First Lord of the Admiralty called attention to a

Curfew. statement in the Press that the curfew was shortly to be introduced,

and reference was made to a Motion on the Order Paper for Tuesday, the 31st October, to the effect that the Defence Regulation on this subject should be annulled.


535

W.M. 63 (39).

The Home Secretary explained that provision for the application of the curfew was included in the second batch of Defence Regulations* issued just before the beginning of the War. It was therefore not a new proposal, and he had no immediate intention of applying the Regulation. The curfew might be required in the event of serious disturbances.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(i) That the Home Secretary should consider making a state-

ment in Parliament to^explain the origin and purpose of the Defence Regulation giving power to impose the Curfew:

(ii) that the Home Secretary should further consider whether

it was desirable that the Regulation should be annulled.
