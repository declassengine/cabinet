The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

German

Merchant Ships in the Atlantic

(Reference: Paper W.P. (39) 46, paragraph 15.)

3. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence enquired as to the significance of certain German vessels, i.e., the General A rtigas (11,254 tons) and the Windhuk (16,662), which were referred to in paragraph 15 in the Chiefs of Staff weekly summary as being at large in the South Atlantic.

The Chief of Naval Staff said that these German ships had been in Brazilian and Argentine ports when war broke out. The necessary dispositions bad been made to meet any threat from these ships.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military 4.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War

General Gamelin&apos;s view had been that they would require to keep

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military 5.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that only one

Situation in active German division had been identified near the Belgian and France. Dutch Frontiers, all the others being Reserve or Landwehr

There were some slight signs of movement from the Eastern Front to the West, but no indications yet of any mechanised forces.

Future Course 6.   Arising out of the statement recorded in Minute 5, some

of the War.      discussion took place as to the possible course of the war.

Eeference- ^he ^rst L rd of the Admiralty very much doubted whether a

WM (39) 2lst land offensive in the West would be mounted this winter. The Conclusions Eastern Front had more or less closed down owing to the Russian Minute 9)&apos; action, and he suggested that Germany&apos;s most likely move would be an attack on our air force and aircraft industry in the near future. If this did not eventuate, it would be either because Hitler&apos;s nerve had failed, or because his advisers restrained him from embarking on a course which would lead to a desperate struggle, the consequence of which they feared.

The Prime Minister thought that there was a considerable danger of a &quot;peace offensive,&quot; in which Germany would hope, during a period of stalemate, to play on neutral opinion and sow dissension between ourselves and the French.

It was pointed out that a period of inactivity by the German forces might cause serious dissatisfaction inside Germany, but that, on the other hand, the Germans might hope that they would achieve their object before this took place.

The Minister without Portfolio said that the possibility of an offensive in the West this Autumn should not be under-rated. The French regarded such an offensive as probable. The Germans would never get a better chance in the future than they had now, since by the Spring our defences would be stronger and we should have more troops available in France. They might attempt to repeat their Polish tactics and employ a great weight of mechanised forces and air forces in the hope of completely disorganizing the back areas.

Immediate Measures for Increasing the Strength of the British

Expeditionary Force.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 5.) (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 20th Conclusions, Minute 6.)

7. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet of certain measures which were now in train for an early increase in the strength of the British Expeditionary Force. These included the despatch to France of three additional battalions, which had previously been intended for Egypt (see Conclusion noted in the margin), and the raising of four machine gun battalions.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Press Reports of       8.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that His British Troop    Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris had suggested that journalists Movements.      repiesenting important French newspapers, e.g., the Paris-Soir, should be permitted to visit British troops in France.   This might have an excellent effect on French public opinion.

Sir Eric Phipps had also suggested that some public statement should be made to the effect that the transportation of the British Expeditionary Force to France represented a record achievement for transportation of an army overseas and particularly of a mechanised army.

After a discusssion, it was thought preferable to postpone a statement on the above lines, until the disembarkation of the first


189   W.M. 24 (39).

contingent of the British Expeditionary Force was nearing completion.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that Sir Eric Phipps had also reported that he had been approached by Reuter and asked if their representative could visit ports where the British Expeditionary Force was being disembarked in France. Reuter&apos;s representative had mentioned the actual ports by name, on the telephone.

The Prime Minister said that the Evening Standard representative in Paris had also asked for similar permission and had given the names of ports of disembarkation which had been communicated to him from the London Office.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) that there was no objection to representatives of reputable

French newspapers visiting our troops in France;

(2) that no statement regarding the efficiency and despatch with

which the first contingent of the British Field Force had been transported to the Continent, should be authorised at present;

(3) to invite the Lord Privy Seal to consult with the Minister

of Information, with a view to strong representations being made to Reuter, and to the Evening Standard, as to the action of members of their staff in mentioning the ports of disembarkation on the telephone.

Offer of Service by Mr. Kermlt Roosevelt.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 20th Conclusions, Minute 14.)

9. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that it was proposed to commission Mr. Kermit Roosevelt as a Second Lieutenant in the Army with immediate promotion to the Acting Rank of Major. The necessary gazette notice was being submitted to His Majesty the King.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Air Operations in the Event of a German Invasion of the Low Countries. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 20th Conclusions, Minutes 7 and 8.)

11. The War Cabinet discussed a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee, dealing with Air Operations in the event of a German invasion of the Low Countries (W.P. (39) 43).

The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Report had been prepared in order that the War Cabinet might be made fully aware of the implication of a sudden German invasion of the Low Countries, and of the steps which would be necessary to counter this from the military point of view. Reliance could not be placed on demolitions to arrest the German advance, and the opportunity might be so fleeting as to necessitate the immediate launching of heavy air attacks. In the confusion of such an invasion, these attacks would inevitably result in the killing of Belgian and Dutch civilians. In order that there should be no misunderstanding, the Chiefs of Staff accordingly sought the authority of the War Cabinet to give their Commanders the necessary discretion to order these air attacks at once, without the delay which reference to the War Cabinet would involve.

The Secretary of State, for Foreign Affairs raised the question whether it was necessary to give the Belgian Government some indication of our intentions in the matter. It was agreed, however, that, in view of the terms of Telegram No. 80 to Brussels, it was unnecessary.

Reluctance was expressed to sanction a course which might involve heavy civilian casualties in Belgium (and possibly Holland). Various expedients were suggested to avoid this risk. Thus, it was suggested that the German columns might be bombed in their concentration areas before the advance began. The French military view, with which the Chiefs of Staff agreed, was that the most effective way of arresting this advance (on the assumption that demolitions would do no more than delay it) would be to bomb the advancing columns when they were congested and canalised on their way through the Low Countries.

Again, it was suggested that the discretion to be given to our Commanders might be confined to day bombing, but it was pointed out that the conditions of the sudden attack visualised woald be so chaotic as to afford no certainty of distinguishing between enemy troops and other bodies in the roads, even by day.

Air attack on military objectives, such as German factories behind the war zone, would not produce the immediate effect desired of stopping the German advance through the Low Countries.

The view was also expressed that it was essential to establish contacts with the Belgian Authorities as early as possible in order to make arrangements to deny to the Germans possession of the armament industry, aircraft, other valuable war stores, and oil, ships, &amp;c, in Belgium.

This led to the conclusion that the right course was to concentrate on further efforts to persuade the Belgian Government to enter into Staff Conversations. Various suggestions were made as to possible channels of communication.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) that the Foreign Secretary should be invited to renew his

representations to the Belgian Government as to the need for initiating Staff Conversations forthwith, in the most emphatic manner, and that no possible room for doubt should be left in Belgian minds as to the reason why, in our view, such conversations were essential:

(2) to defer a decision on the recommendations made by the

Chiefs of Staff in their Report until after the receipt of the Belgian reply to (1) above, and until fuller information was obtained as to the Belgian plans.

Roumania. 12.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

Murder of the    War Cabinet that, so far as he was aware, the murder of Roumanian       M. Calinescu had not as yet led to any important reactions. Prime Minister.        It was possible that the German plans as regards Roumania had been upset by the Russian occupation of South-Eastern Poland.

The Foreign Secretary informed his colleagues that he had arranged to see the Soviet Ambassador that afternoon. He had not previously seen M. Maisky since the early part of August.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Roumania.

Attitude of the Roumanian Government to the Members of the Polish Government now in Roumania. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 8.)

Turkey.

Negotiations for Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 15.)

13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had no further news as to the attitude which the Roumanian Government intended to adopt towards the members of the Polish Government who had taken refuge in Roumania.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

14. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed his colleagues that after their last discussion on the Turkish Treaty negotiations (on the occasion referred to in the margin) news had been received that the Turkish Government were insisting on the inclusion of a suspense clause in the Treaty. He had been informed that without such a clause there was no prospect of the Treaty being signed until the Turkish requirements in war material had been met. In these circumstances, after consultation with the Prime Minister, he (the Foreign Secretary) had informed Sir Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen that we should be prepared to contemplate the inclusion of a suspense clause.

A discussion followed on the present position of the negotiations with Turkey, as disclosed in telegrams No. 495, 496 and 497, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Ankara. The purport of these telegrams was not very satisfactory. They showed in the first place that General Orbay was coming to this country for the purpose of negotiating for the supply of war material to Turkey. As regards the actual negotiations in Ankara, it appeared that the Turkish Government were only willing to sign the Treaty if it (or the financial agreement, which was to be signed simultaneously) included a suspense clause providing that Turkey would not be obliged to take action under the Treaty (i.e., to go to war) until she had been adequately supplied with war material.

On the other hand, the Turkish Government were now pressing hard for a gold bullion loan of  15 million pounds.

It was clear that the financial and economic agreement could not be ready for signature for several days. There were outstanding points on practically every clause.

In the course of discussion it was pointed out that the Turkish Government were making a most unreasonable demand in pressing us for  15 million in gold, without offering any immediate quid fro quo except a Treaty which might be rendered completely nugatory by a suspense clause. The Turks appeared to contemplate that we should hand over the bullion to them practically unconditionally. After this we should be requested to supply them with war material in large quantities, despite the fact that it was urgently required by our own troops.


192

There was also the fact that the Turkish Foreign Minister was now on his way to Moscow. It was possible that the situation on his return might be found to have once more altered to our disadvantage.

The need for obtaining an assurance of Turkish co-operation did not appear to be as urgent now as it had been, say, a fortnight before. The Russian occupation of South-Eastern Poland had made it much less likely that there would be an immediate invasion of Roumania by the Germans. The Russian move ought probably to be interpreted as meaning &quot; Hands off the Balkans.&quot; It was argued for the above reasons that we should not hand over our gold bullion until it was clear that we should obtain an adequate return.

On the other hand, the view was taken that the dangers of the European situation made it imperative that we should sign an agreement with Turkey at once, even if that agreement was largely rendered inoperative by the suspense clause. Even if the agreement did not hold out a certain prospect of Turkish co-operation, it would at least insure us against the possibility of Turkey being found fighting on the side of Germany.  15 million in gold was a heavy price, but it was not too heavy a price to pay for Turkish neutrality.

In following the course suggested we should admittedly be taking big risks, but they would be risks which were justifiable in the present international situation. The signature of an Agreement with Turkey would be a diplomatic success for this country, such as we badly needed at the moment. If on the contrary we failed to secure an agreement with Turkey, we should suffer a severe diplomatic defeat.

After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed: 

that it was unnecessary to reach a definite decision in regard to the outstanding points on the Financial and Economic Agreement including the demand for a gold bullion loan of  15 million until the revised draft had been prepared in Ankara and telegraphed to this country.

Italian Garrison 15. The War Cabinet were informed that there was no in tne confirmation of the.reports, which had appeared in the newspapers,

Dodecanese.      that the Italians were reducing their garrison in the Dodecanese.

On the contrary, the latest information indicated that this garrison

was being increased.

Yisit of United        16.   The War Cabinet welcomed the information, which the

States Cruisers Foreign Secretary had received from the American Ambassador,

to Penang and that a visit was about to be paid by a number of United States

Singapore. cruisers to Penang and Singapore.

The Far Eastern 17. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Situation Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (39) 45) raising, in

(Previous connection with the question of improving Anglo-Japanese relations, Reference: the subject of the evacuation of British garrisons from China and W.M. (39) 22nd the problems connected with Tientsin.

Conclusions, The main point discussed was the proposed evacuation of the

Minute 13.)      British garrison at Tientsin.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that he favoured the voluntary withdrawal of the garrison at an appropriate moment probably after a settlement of the Tientsin incident on the ground that, so long as the garrison remained there, there was the risk that we might have to withdraw it in humiliating circumstances.

British Gunboats in China. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 9th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

Tientsin Silver question.

Tientsin currency question.

On tactics, his suggestion was that Sir Robert Craigie, without actually offering to evacuate the garrison, should be given discretion to indicate to the Tokyo authorities, when tabling our proposals for a settlement of the Tientsin incident, that, if we could obtain a settlement on the other issues, it was quite possible that we might wish to withdraw our garrison in the course of a few weeks.

It was urged, however, that there were distinct signs that the Japanese were relaxing their pressure for the withdrawal of British troops, and that we should inevitably suffer some loss of prestige if the garrison was withdrawn. On the other hand, the main preoccupation of the British community at Tientsin appeared to be a desire for a settlement of the local incident in the near future.

It was agreed that the determining factor should be whether or not the withdrawal of our troops from Tientsin did or did not constitute an essential factor in obtaining a settlement of the Tientsin incident.

The War Cabinet agreed as follows: 

(i) that Sir Robert Craigie should be given discretion to

indicate that it was possible that we might wish to withdraw our garrison from Tientsin in the course of a few weeks, if he was satisfied that this course was essential to a satisfactory settlement of the Tientsin incident;

(ii) that no action should be taken for the present on a proposal

by the Admiralty to withdraw five Gunboats from China, over and above the action already authorised at the Meeting of the War Cabinet referred to in the margin;

(iii) (a) that if possible, the Tientsin settlement should include a provision for the silver to be sealed in a neutral bank; (V) that failing that, the silver should be sold and the proceeds used for the relief of flood victims in North China, in which event it would be desirable that we should have a hand in the administration of the funds;

(c) that failing both the above solutions, the possibility should not be excluded that we might agree to the silver being handed over to the Yokohama Specie Bank or the Federal Reserve Bank, (iv) that Sir Robert Craigie should be instructed to seek a solution of the problem on the lines suggested in paragraph 11 of W.P. (39) 45, namely, that the Japanese might agree to withdraw their demand that we should prohibit the use of Chinese national currency in the Concession, on condition that we put no obstacle in the way of the circulation of Federal Reserve Bank notes.

Restriction of 18. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Imports from Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (G.) (39) 18), setting the United out the views of the Canadian Government on the proposed restric-States and tions on the import of apples and tobacco from Canada. He asked Canada. that no action should be taken on the decision to restrict these (Previous imports, until the matter could be further considered in relation Reference: to the negotiations with the Canadian Government on wider W.M. (39) 2lst financial issues. It was clear that the Canadian Government con-Conclusions, templated giving considerable credits for our war purchases and Minute 19.) it was, therefore, specially important not to lose their goodwill.


194

Mr. Osborne was leaving for Canada that very day (23rd September), to initiate general financial negotiations with the Dominion Government, and it was hoped that he might reach Ottawa in about a week.

The President of the Board of Trade agreed that it would be advisable to wait until the broad financial issues could be settled, but thought that in that case it would probably be necessary also to postpone taking action vis-a-vis the United States Government in regard to the imposition of similar restrictions on imports from that country. It would, in any case, be difficult to satisfy the Americans that we were justified in differentiating between the United States and Canada, and we should be in a far stronger position if we could say definitely that the Canadian Government was arranging for credit facilities. It was generally agreed that it was very important not to upset American opinion, and that it would on this ground be advisable to hold up discussions with the United States Government until the Canadian question had been settled.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the War Cabinet that he had been previously instructed to raise the matter with the American Ambassador in London, and said that he was anxious not to postpone this longer than was necessary. He felt that the arguments advanced by the Canadian Government did not make sufficient allowance for the great advantages which Canada would derive from our orders for war supplies.

The President of the Board of Trade explained that the important time for the imports of apples from the United States would be round about the New Year, but that the intervening months would be of more importance for Canadian supplies. Imports of tobacco from America were already being restricted and apples were therefore the only important item still at issue.

In the circumstances, it was agreed that the disadvantages of some further delay were outweighed by the advantages of affording an opportunity for direct negotiations with the Canadian Government on the wider issues, before reaching a decision.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) that no further action should be taken to give effect to the

decisions reached at the 21st Meeting of the War Cabinet for the restriction of imports from the United States and Canada, until the question of imports from Canada could be considered in connection with the negotiations on wider financial issues which were shortly to begin in Ottawa;

(2) to invite the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to

send a telegram to Ottawa in order to enable the negotiations to be started as soon as possible after Mr. Osborne&apos;s arrival.
