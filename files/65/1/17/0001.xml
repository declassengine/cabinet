Air Situation. t; Secretary of State for Air said that no special air

(Previous operations had taken place in the previous 24 hours.    The air

Reference: reconnaissance would be carried out during the day, to test the

W.M. (39) 16th reported concentration of aircraft in the Island of Sylt. Conclusions,

Minute l.) The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Report of R.A.F. 2. The Secretary of State for Air said that the statement in Raid on German the account issued from the Ministry of Information, to which refer-Naval Base on ence had been made the previous day, that the German account had the 4th over-stated our losses, had referred to a later claim by the Germans

September. that they had brought down 12 of our aircraft. Unfortunately, (Previous some of the newspapers had overlooked this later claim, and had Reference: referred to the earlier German claim to have brought down 5 of our W.M. (39) 16th aircraft. The matter had now been explained privately to the Conclusions, representatives of the Press, and he thought that no further action Minute 2.)       need be taken in the matter.

The Lord Privy Seal said that there appeared to have been a gap in liaison between the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Information.

The Secretary of State for Air said that steps had been taken to rectify the position.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference:

3. The Chief of Naval Staff reported that one merchant vessel and a tanker had been sunk during the previous 24 hours. A Belgian ship had also been sunk, either by mine or torpedo, in the Channel.    Investigations were being carried out to determine, if

Conclusions, Minute 3.

W.M. (39) 16th possible, the nature of the attack.    There had been a number of attacks on enemy submarines.

In connection with the sinking of the tanker, enquiry was made whether any special steps were being taken to build up our tanker tonnage. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence informed the War Cabinet that seven German-built tankers owned by Lord Inverforth, and which it had at one time been feared would be sold to Japan, had now been acquired.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements.

The Military Situation in Poland.

(Previous Reference:

4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Poles were endeavouring to hold the line in the South-east corner of Poland which he had indicated the previous day. It seemed doubtful whether many Polish Divisions would be able to retire behind this line. There were, however, a large number of Polish forma-W.M. (39) 16th tions holding out elsewhere, particularly round Warsaw. The Conclusions, situation was very confused, and it would probably take Germany at least a week before the position was cleared up.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Weekly Reports.       5.   The Cabinet took note of :

Armament 6.   The War Cabinet considered a Report by the Deputy Chiefs

Supplies to of Staff Sub-Committee (W.P. (39) 31) on the subject of the supply

Poland. of armaments to Poland.

(Previous 77       ,   7 7 .  ,   , .   , .

Eeference- Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the Steam-

&quot;WM (39&apos;) 16th S^*P R our VIII, in not being due to sail before Wednesday, the rt&apos;. \    20th September, at the earliest, was in a different category from the

Minute 6) Steamship Lassell, which had already sailed, and the Steamship Clan Menzies, which was due to sail the following day. He therefore suggested that the Chiefs of Staff should consider, when the time came, the question whether it was advisable that the Robur VIII should be allowed to sail at all.

Discussion ensued as to the order of priority of countries to which consignments destined for Poland should be sent, if it should be decided not to send them to that country. The political desirability of sending armament supplies to Roumania was urged by the Foreign Secretary. It was pointed out that the order of priority given in the report represented only the tentative suggestions of the Deputy Chiefs of Staff and would be subject to review by the Chiefs of Staff, as and when the latter considered each case on its merits.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) to approve the Chiefs of Staff&apos;s recommendation that a

decision should be taken ad hoc in each case on its merits, in the light of the situation in Poland, subject to the qualification that the question whether the Steamship Robur VIII should sail from this country should be considered by the Chiefs of Staff before the 20th September :

(ii) The Chiefs of Staff should report to the Cabinet on Monday,

18th September, what action they proposed should be taken as regards the consignment of stores in the Steamship Lassell.

Employment of 7. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the question of Polish Airmen, employing Polish pilots, referred to in a telegram recently received (Previous from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Poland, was being examined. Eeference: A small number of Polish pilots were already in this country, and W.M. (39) 15th were being taught to fly Battle aircraft. They, in turn, would be Conclusions, able to instruct further Polish pilots when they reached this country. Minute 13.)      This plan had been adopted with a view to enabling twenty Battle

aircraft to be flown from France to Poland by Polish airmen.

(See paragraph 7 of W.P. (39) 31.) /

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Dominion 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the

Collaboration.    Ministerial Committee on Dominion Collaboration (Paper No.

(Previous W.P. (G) (39) 10).

!Rcf crsncc * t

WM (391 15th ma*n features of the Report were explained by The

Con iusions Minister without Portfolio, and general agreement was expressed M nutTl06.) therewith.

In discussion, The Secretary of State for Air hoped that the strengthening of the Service liaison arrangements would take place gradually, as the war effort of the Dominions grew, rather than that fully-fledged Missions from the Dominions should be appointed at once.


131 W.M. 17 (39).

In view of the heavy pressure on members of the War Cabinet, the hope was also expressed that meetings between the High Commissioners and members of the War Cabinet would not take place very frequently.

The War Cabinet approved the recommendations in the Report by the Ministerial Committee on Dominion Collaboration.

Efficacy of Leaflets Dropped In Germany.

(Previous Bef erence: W.M. (39) 11th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

9. In pursuance of their conclusion mentioned in the margin the War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Information (Paper W.P. (G) (39) 9) on the efficacy of the present propaganda campaign undertaken in Germany through the agency of the Royal Air Force.

The Minister of Information summarised the main considerations in his Memorandum and, in particular, stressed the annoyance of the German Government at our dropping propaganda leaflets (from this itmightbe assumed that the propaganda was effective); the desire of the German public for genuine news (British news was real news in Germany); the doubtful value of the leaflets consisting merely of slogans; and the importance, in view of the contemplated regional distribution in Germany of special leaflets, of maintaining in being the present arrangements for distributing leaflets by air. He saw no objection to the proposal that leaflets actually distributed in Germany should be published in this country.

The Foreign Secretary thought that the question whether the propaganda campaign should be continued on present lines was a very difficult one. He had favoured the initial efforts, but thought it would be unwise to underrate the volume of adverse neutral opinion, which might be expected to understand German mentality better than we did. If, as was suggested, we continued the campaign, but concentrated on the distributing of leaflets containing news, the criticism that we were doing nothing more to defeat the enemy might be intensified. He also doubted whether any leaflet circulation would counteract the Nazi propaganda in Germany based on the successes of the German arms in Poland. Was it possible to attain our objective by some form of surreptitious broadcasting ?

The War Cabinet were reminded of the measures taken in Germany to prevent the reception there of British broadcasts. The neutral opinion mentioned by the Foreign Secretary might be due to German inspiration. Propaganda, like advertising, thrived on repetition.

The Prime Minister thought that we ought to disregard the criticism that our contribution to the war was a leaflet campaign. In his opinion this form of propaganda was good, useful and should be continued, not necessarily at regular intervals, but as and when it was thought fit. The fact that the German Government was annoyed showed that the propaganda was bearing fruit. He hoped that more leaflets devoted to news and facts would be distributed in Germany. It would be difficult for even the German Government to establish that the reading of this news was treasonable and later on we might mix argument with the news. He agreed that propaganda depended for its effectiveness on repetition, and he also agreed that we need not make much of the fact either that more leaflets had been dropped or that they were going to be dropped, though the Press might be told in general terms that the campaign was being continued. In the course of discussion it was pointed out that this leaflet distribution was now the only means of informing German public opinion of the truth. The leaflets might give information as to the blockade measures, sinking of submarines, &amp;c.

[20005]


132

The Chief of the Air Staff mentioned a device for circulating, within limits, leaflets by balloon, and so avoiding the use of aeroplanes.

The War Cabinet agreed :  (i) that the propaganda campaign should be continued on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in the course of the discussion as summarised at &quot; A &quot; above :

(ii) that the necessary arrangements to give effect to (i) above

should be made by the Secretary of State for Air in consultation, as required, with the Minister of Information :

(iii) that the Minister of Information should be authorised to

publish any leaflets which had already been distributed in Germany by the Royal Air Force and also, in future, to publish any further leaflets after they had been so distributed.

Press 10.   The Minister of Information informed the War Cabinet

Censorship.      that the press correspondents in London as a whole, both British (Previous        and foreign, were in a state of revolt.   Their first complaint was Eeference:       that, whereas they received ample information, much of it reliable, W.M. (39) loth from German sources, here they could obtain very little indeed of Conclusions,      any news value.  In particular, correspondents of American papers Minute 6.)       had made very strong representations.  He hoped that it would be found possible to give out far more information of a non-military character than hitherto.   Could not the Service Departments, for instance, allow parties of press correspondents to visit His Majesty&apos;s ships, training camps, munition factories and the like?

The second complaint concerned censorship arrangements. About one hundred people were engaged on censorship and the question whether some item of news was passed often turned on whether the particular official took a strict or lenient view of the matter.

A further complaint related to instructions prohibiting the sending from this country of news on certain matters. Thus, a representative of the Knickerbocker Press Agency of New York had handed in a telegram containing a passage about the possibility of Italy making a peace move. The telegram was friendly to us, but this passage had been deleted, because the Foreign Office had put a ban on messages dealing with Italian policy. In the Minister&apos;s view it was wrong to prevent foreign correspondents from sending information to their own countries about matters of this kind. He hoped that, while maintaining a strict attitude as to information about military dispositions, we should allow foreign press correspondents a wide latitude in regard to other matters.

In discussion, stress was laid on the desirability of providing the newspapers with information which would enable them to write up the vastness of our war effort in the production of all kinds of munitions and supplies, e.g., they should be supplied with photographs to illustrate the huge preparations that were being made to sustain a three years war. Reference might also be made to the immense reservoir of ability of every kind in this country, which was solidly behind the Government. The view was expressed that the more good relations with the Press could be fostered, the greater would be the help which we should obtain from the Press, both at home and abroad.

The Foreign Secretary agreed that, from the point of view of the Foreign Office, the present position of the Minister of Information was an impossible one, and that it must be changed. He thought that the Minister of Information or the Lord Privy Seal should interview the Press correspondents, point out our particular

133 W.M. 17 (39).

difficulties at the present time, and appeal to them to have regard to those difficulties, at the same time undertaking that apart from military matters, and this expression must, of course, be interpreted to cover civil defence and similar services, we should be prepared to give them a much freer hand than had hitherto been the practice. In short, he would maintain a strict censorship on military matters, but instruct the censors to adopt a liberal attitude in regard to other kinds of information, and he would combine this procedure with constant interviews with the Press correspondents.

After further discussion the War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) that, subject to the maintenance of the arrangements in

force for maintaining secrecy in regard to military matters, and other information which might be of use to the enemy, every effort should be made, particularly by the Service Departments, to facilitate the work of the Press correspondents, by arranging tours of inspection of His Majesty&apos;s Ships, training camps, shipyards, munition factories, and the like, and that, speaking generally, the Minister of Information should be authorised to inform the Press correspondents that in future they would be allowed much greater latitude in regard to information of a character not likely to be of use to the enemy:

(2) to invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to

represent the views of the War Cabinet on this matter to the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was not present at the discussion :

(3) that, as regards the censorship of news for abroad, a strict

censorship should be retained in regard to military  matters and other matters likely to be of use to the enemy, including civil defence, evacuation plans, &amp;o, but that, subject thereto, and in particular as regards information relating to foreign countries, the censorship should adopt a liberal attitude towards American and other foreign correspondents in London :

(4) that the arrangements in (1) and (3) above should be supple-

mented from time to time by meetings between the Minister of Information and the Press correspondents, at which general guidance should be given to the Press.

Home Front H-   I*1 the course of the discussion summarised in the preced-

Propaganda. ing Minute, the suggestion was made that as, in present circumstances, it was not possible to hold public Meetings at which the policy of the Government could be explained and justified, it might be desirable to arrange that Ministers and other responsible persons should broadcast at regular intervals, say, once a week or once a fortnight, for half an hour at a time, summarising, for the benefit of the public, the position at the time. It was essential that there should be sustained propaganda on the Home Front, and that the Minister of Information should have regard to this consideration and to the importance of maintaining the public morale.

The Minister of Information thought that the position in regard to broadcasting was now satisfactory. The difficulties were concerned rather with the Press, which was very jealous of the privileges enjoyed by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It might be advantageous if arrangements could be made under which the Press obtained their information somewhat in advance of the British Broadcasting Corporation.

While it was true that statements as to the general position were made in Parliament at regular intervals, those statements were necessarily of a generalised character, while what the public demanded were details, often of a very trivial and unimportant kind.


134

The Prime Minister thought that the discussion had served a useful purpose, and suggested that the position might be reviewed on some convenient opportunity in the near future.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Italy. 12.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to

(Previous telegram No. 399 from Athens, in which our Minister stated that Eeference: he had been informed that the Italian troops were being withdrawn W.M. (39) 16th from the Albanian frontier. A suggestion had been put forward by Conclusions, the Italian Minister at Athens that a new agreement should be con-Minute 12.)      eluded between the Greek and Italian Governments in place of the

1929 Treaty, and that this might include provisions as regards

non-aggression.

The Foreign Secretary added that the Greek Minister in London had also approached him on this subject. He had replied to the effect that a rapprochement between Greece and Italy was all to the good, provided that the Greek Government&apos;s attitude to this country was not modified.

The Foreign Secretary stated that the Italian Government had just requested agrement to the appointment of Signor Bastanini as Italian Ambassador in London. This appointment was regarded as a compliment to this country.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Turkey.

Treaty Negotiations. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 16th Conclusions, Minute 14.) Economic Situation in Turkey.

13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 369 despatched to His&apos; Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, at 1-15 a.m. that day, setting out the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the treaty negotiations with Turkey, as agreed upon at the meeting of the War Cabinet held the previous day.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also drew attention to telegram No. 452, dated the 15th September, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, stating that the Turkish Ministry of Economy urged His Majesty&apos;s Government to effect purchases immediately as the economic situation in Turkey was deteriorating rapidly. The Ambassador felt that it was of vital importance that we should at once help Turkey in the economic sphere since there was a serious danger of the present Turkish Government and its policy becoming extremely unpopular. The Foreign Office had immediately invited the Ministry of Economic Warfare to consider how best to deal with the Turkish Government&apos;s request in this matter.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Balkans. 14.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

(Previous        to telegram No. 186, dated the 15th September, 1939, received from Eeference:       His Majesty&apos;s Minister,  Sofia,  stating that if Bulgaria was W.M. (39) 16th summoned to declare herself at this moment and was threatened Conclusions,      with attack by Turkey if she did not join the war on our side, every Minute 9.)       friend of Great Britain in Bulgaria would, without exception, turn against us and war would be inevitable.   There were two reasons why in his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) opinion the War Cabinet should adhere to the previous decision and should do nothing to restrain the initiative proposed to be taken by Prince Paul of Yugoslavia.   First, there was no reason to anticipate any precipitate action by Prince Paul.    Second, if the Turkish Government were prepared to join with the Prince in an initiative on our side, it would be a great mistake to discourage them from so doing.


135

W.M. 17 (39).

The Secretary of State added that, while he fully appreciated the military and other objections to encouraging a general conflagration in the Balkans, he hoped that the Chiefs of Staff Committee would give consideration to the arguments on the other side, e.g., the advantage of drawing in Turkey and the military risks to which Germany might expose herself through an excessive dispersal of her forces, if she occupied vast territories in the Balkans.

The Chief of the Air Staff undertook that this aspect should be considered by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.

The War Cabinet approved the policy outlined by the Foreign Secretary.

U.S.S.R. 15.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that the

(Previous        Foreign Office had received a report that a leading Turkish deputy Reference:       (whose identity was known to them) had stated on the 12th Sep-W.M. (39) 13th tember, 1939: (a) that a Turko-Soviet pact would shortly be Conclusions,      signed,   but  that  its  provisions  would  be  in  no  way in-Minute 7.)      consistent with the proposed Turkish treaty with the United Kingdom ; and (b) that there existed a secret clause in the German-Soviet pact, inserted at the insistence of the Government of the U.S.S.R., to the effect that if Germany attacked Roumania the pact would become void.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Roumanian Oil 16. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated, with reference Supplies. to the discussion in regard to the Roumanian oil supplies at the

(Previous meeting of the War Cabinet held the previous day, that satisfactory Reference: arrangements had now been made to ensure not only the hiring of all W.M. (39) 16th available barges and oil tank cars in Roumania, but also the pur-Conclusions, chase of all available oil supplies in that country. This purchase Minute 10.)     would be effected by the Shell Company who, for the present at least,

were not asking for any guarantee against loss through making this

purchase.

The Shell Company, who were under contract to export oil from Roumania to Germany, were still engaged in this trade, though they were limiting their sales as far as possible. It was certainly anomalous that a Company controlled from London should be engaged in any trade with the enemy, but no useful purpose would be served by objecting to the Shell Company continuing to export oil to Germany, since, if they were to refuse to make any further sales to Germany, the Roumanian Government, through fear of Germany, would certainly intervene to compel the Company to carry out their obligations towards Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Roumania. 17.   A short discussion took place on the question of the atti-

Attitude to tude which the Roumanian Government would be likely to take up Polish Refugees, if (a) large numbers of routed Polish troops were to attempt to cross

the frontier into Roumania, and (b) if the Polish Government itself

were to enter Roumania.


136

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated :

(i) That he had made certain enquiries as regards the likely attitude of the Roumanian Government in the event of the arrival in Roumania of the Polish Government. He understood that, while they would be admitted into Roumanian territory, the Roumanian Government, through fear of Germany, would urge them to proceed to some other country, if they desired to continue to function Government.    A telegram was being

despatched to the effect that in that event we or the French Government would be willing to find a home for the Polish Government, (ii) That he understood that it was the intention of the Roumanian Government to intern any Polish troops which might cross the frontier.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
