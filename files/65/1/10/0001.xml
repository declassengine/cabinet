W.M. 10 (39).

Air Operations. 1. The Chief of the A ir Staff informed the War Cabinet that (Previous no aircraft had been sent over Germany the previous night owing

Reference:        to bad weather.  In a flight over the Channel in co-operation with W.M. (39), 9th  the Navy certain aircraft had been lost but the occupants had Conclusions,      probably been saved. A reconnaissance over the Ruhr was proposed Minute 2.)        for to-day. No serious attacks had been made on high flying aircraft operating over Germany up to date.   It was proposed to continue pamphlet dropping operations from time to time, in accordance with the previous Conclusions of the War Cabinet.

The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to consider the possibility of sending high flying aircraft over Germany in daylight with a view to upsetting German industry by causing air raid alarms.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 9th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

2. The Chief of the Naval Staff reported that in the previous 24 hours there had been four attacks by submarines on our merchant shipping but that, with the possible exception of one, they had been unsuccessful. One merchant ship (nationality not yet known) had been blown up by a mine off Flamborough Head. A number of attacks had been carried out on enemy submarines. The attack previously reported as carried out by Polish destroyers had probably been successful. Particulars were given of the areas in which Submarine Forces were operating and of the steps taken to counter their activities.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Land 3.   The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported

Operations. that the Poles intended to withdraw to a line which would cover the (Previous Galician Oil Fields and keep open communications to Poland from

Reference: the South-West. The fate of the Divisions in the Posen Salient W.M. (39), 9th was not yet known. The importance of these Oil Fields was referred Conclusions, to, and the War Office were instructed to take certain action in Minute 4.)        this connection.

As to the Western Front, very little information had been received, except that the French were continuing their methodical advance through the &quot; No Man&apos;s Land &quot; between the Maginot and Siegfried Lines. There had been no German troop movements from the Polish Front to the West.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Observance of 4.   A general discussion took place in regard to the extent to

Rules of War. which the recognised rules of war were being recognised by the German Government. The view was expressed that it was very desirable that a careful record should be kept, for use at a later date, of any breaches committed by the Germans.

Mention was made of reports received regarding alleged breaches of the rules of war in Poland and the view was expressed that it would be very valuable if impartial testimony from neutral sources could be obtained.

The attention of the War Cabinet was also drawn to the fact that, two nights previously, it had been stated in one of the B.B.C. News Bulletins that orders for indiscriminate submarine warfare had been issued to German submarine Commanders. This statement, which so far as the Admiralty knew was untrue, and might conceivably have harmful effects, had not been referred to the Admiralty before being released by the B.B.C. [19990] b 2


72

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) to request the Chiefs of Staff Committee to prepare a report

on the position up to date as regards the German observance or otherwise of the International Law relating to war at sea, on land, and in the air;

(b) that the attention of the Minister of Information should

be drawn to the recent announcement in a B.B.C. News Bulletin that orders for indiscriminate submarine warfare had been issued to German submarine Commanders; that he should be informed that this statement had been made by the B.B.C. without prior consultation with the Admiralty and asked to arrange that such announcements should not in future be made without prior reference to the Department concerned;

(c) to ask the Foreign Office to consider as a matter of urgency

the question of obtaining neutral testimony as to promiscuous bombing by the German Air Force of non-military targets in Poland.

Poland. 5.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to two

(Previous telegrams which had been received by the Foreign Office from the

Reference: Polish Foreign Minister late the previous evening (9th September,

W.M. (39), 8th 1939) and to a message which had been received by the Polish

Conclusions, Ambassador in London from the Polish Ambassador in Paris which

Minute 14.) had reached the Foreign Office early that morning.  These messages were to the following effect: 

(i) From M. Beck asking for the immediate denial of the news

of the collapse of the Polish army;

(ii) From M. Beck asking for an immediate declaration of the

British Government&apos;s war aims;

(iii) Report from the Polish Ambassador in Paris that it was

at the British request that the intention of the French Air Force to enter into action on the 6th September was abandoned.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) to take note that action was being taken to give effect to

the request contained in the telegram summarised in (i) above;

(b) that the request at (ii) was met by the declaration approved

by the War Cabinet at their meeting held on the previous day (W.M. (39) 9th conclusions, Minute 15);

(c) that immediate steps should be taken to contradict the

statement attributed to M. Daladier in the report received from the Polish Ambassador in Paris (as indicated in (iii) above) and that for this purpose the Chief of the Air Staff should at once furnish material to enable the Foreign Office to address: 

(i) a communication to the Polish Ambassador in

London;

(ii) a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, for

transmission to M. Daladier,

setting out the exact position.

Censorship. 6.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to certain

instances in which, during the last few days, there had been a danger of the French censorship passing for publication information regarding movements of British Naval Units, the publication of


73

W.M. 10 (39).

which in the United Kingdom would certainly have been prohibited by the British censorship.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

that adequate arrangements should be made to ensure that the French Censorship Office did not pass for publication information relating to British Naval, Army or Air Force matters, the publication of which would not be permitted in the United Kingdom, and that, as a first step, enquiries should be made on the question whether a British Officer had been attached to the French Censorship Office.
