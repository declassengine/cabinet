India and the War.

(Previous Eeference: Minute 8.) W.M. (39) 59th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

1. The War Cabinet resumed consideration of the Memoranda by the Secretary of State for India (Papers W.P. (G.) (39) 53 and 54).

The Prime Minister said that it might be helpful if he ffave a provisional indication of his views. The present situation in India must be considered in relation to the war. Looking at the two demands put forward by Congress from this point of view, he concluded that nothing had happened to justify their demand for freedom to devise their own Constitution without external interference at the end of the war. The other claim, for an immediate and effective share in the Central Government, stood on a different footing. The Indian people now found themselves engaged in war, though they had had no share in the decision to enter it, and it was only natural that there should be a general feeling that they ought at least to have a share in framing the policy now to be followed in regard to it. If we took no steps to meet this attitude, a bitter conflict would result. Even if conflict were confined to the political sphere, it would add very seriously to our anxieties. It might perhaps be suggested that any offers which we were able to make would be regarded as inadequate; but he thought that there were already some signs of weakening on the part, of Congress and some reluctance to go to extremes.

He therefore approved in principle the Viceroy&apos;s suggestion that he should see leaders of the principal parties and suggest that they should put forward agreed proposals for the association of Indian representatives with the Central Government for the war period. The representatives of the Indian parties might not agree among themselves; they might agree on something which we regarded as reasonable; or again they might agree to put forward proposals which we could only regard as unreasonable. He therefore thought it desirable that the Viceroy should lay down in advance certain limitations in order to avoid the last of these results, and that the Viceroy should at the same time make it quite clear that we were not able to promise that India should be free to devise her own Constitution at the end of the war. He would agree that, in considering what proposals to accept, the Viceroy might take as a general guide the proposals of Zafrullah Khan, but he would not agree to the suggestion that we should go further and agree to the appointment of an Indian as Minister of Defence. He would also be inclined to retain the Commander-in-Chief as a member of the Executive Council, but would be less emphatic on the need for this precise method of keeping him at the head of military affairs.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was now inclined to agree that the adverse effect on British opinion of appointing an Indian as Defence Minister outweighed any advantages from the Indian point of view. He suggested that Indians should be associated with responsibility for matters of defence in some less debatable way. Public opinion would accept this more readily in time of war.

The Lord Privy Seal suggested that it was not important to retain the Commander-in-Chief actually as a member of the Council, and mentioned that there were obvious disadvantages in his holding a position in which he could be heckled in the Assembly. On the wider issues, he suggested, as the best limitation to be laid down in advance by the Viceroy, that there should be no legislation in the British Parliament in war time about the Constitutional issue. The Viceroy should not put any proposals forward himself, but should wait for agreed proposals to be submitted.

The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that Congress would not for long remain satisfied with any proposals which we [20211] b 2


502

could accept for the appointment of further Indians to the Executive Council. They would want to have the complete say as to the appointment, and any concession made would be regarded only as a step to further demands, as soon as they saw that the Viceroy still retained the real power.

The S&amp;cretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thought it would make a great difference to the attitude even of the Left Wing of Congress, if it were made clear that they were going to be consulted, not only on matters directly concerned with the conduct of the war, but also on questions affecting the economic and organic life of India, in which they were deeply interested. They were by no means entirely preoccupied with issues of defence. The suggestion for widening the membership of the Executive Council might well be put as one for the establishment of an Indian National War Cabinet.

The Secretary of State for A ir said he would not object to taking a step forward, for fear that it might lead to further demands. We should be in a far stronger position to resist such demands, if we had made a step forward in the first place to meet the more reasonable demands which had been submitted.

There was general agreement that it was desirable to take a step forward on the lines envisaged by the Prime Minister, and that any such proposal would most suitably take the form of the appointment of additional Indians to the Executive Council.

The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that the present proposals should be subjected to the following tests. Was it clear : 

(i) that the Viceroy&apos;s supreme power under the existing

Constitution would remain intact;

(ii) that there would be no impairment of British control over

security and the Armed Forces, and the right to move these forces either inside or outside India;

(iii) that there would be no legislation in Parliament during

the War to amend the Constitution, and no promises given now that would tie the hands of Parliament after the war?

It was agreed that the proposals complied with these conditions, and that these points should be included in any communication sent to the Viceroy for his guidance.

In the course of discussion the Lord Privy Seal suggested that it might be well for the Viceroy to consult not only the Congress Party and the Moslems, but also other important Parties such as the Depressed Classes, and possibly also the Liberals. It must not be forgotten that the Moslems might refuse to reach any agreement with the Hindus and that there might, therefore, be no practical proposal for us to consider.

The Secretary of State for India pointed out that the Constitutional position would remain as at present, namely, that the Executive Council would remain responsible to the British Parliament through the Secretary of State.

In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for India said that it was proposed to invite the representatives of the Indian leaders to come to some working arrangement in respect of the Provincial field because, until they had done so, there was little hope that they could come to an agreement in respect of a workable scheme for the Centre.

Discussion ensued as to what line the Lord Privy Seal should take in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons. It was generally agreed that it would now be open to him to say that the Viceroy was hoping to hold further consultation with leaders of Indian opinion and that, subject to the over-riding consideration


329

503

W.M. 60 (39).

that there could be no legislation on the Constitutional issue at Westminster during the War, no &quot;doors would be closed to prevent us considering any proposals that might be put forward. He should not give any hint that the Government were considering the possibility of additional appointments to the Executive Council, but if this were raised by the Opposition (as it very well might be), he should allude briefly to the difficulties of such a course. If it were suggested that there should be an early General Election in India, he should emphasise the difficulties in war time.

The War Cabinet agreed : -

I. To invite the Secretary of State for India to inform the

Viceroy as follows : 

(i) that he could invite the Leaders of the Congress

Party and the Moslem League and, if he thought fit, other Parties to consult with him further on the lines proposed in his telegram 2385-S; and to submit to him, if they could, agreed proposals for associating the Indian people more closely with the Central Government in respect of the war period :

(ii) that if, in his judgment, as a result of these discus-

sions there seemed to be some chance of agreement on proposals of this nature, he could entertain proposals for tlhe appointment of additional Indian Members to the Executive Council, so long as these proposals did not go beyond what had been suggested by Zafrullah Khan and subject to the proviso that the Commander-in-Chief should continue to be the Member of Council responsible for defence:

(iii) that he should make it clear to the Indian represen-

tatives that there could be no legislation to amend the Constitution during the War :

(iv) that he should inform the Indian Representatives

that the British Government could not pledge themselves now that India should have freedom after the War to devise their own Constitution without external interference, beyond the promise already given that the Constitutional position should be considered at the end of the war : (v) that, if his attempts at conciliation failed, he would have the full support of the Government in taking any measures that might be necessary for the maintenance of law and order.

II. To invite the Secretary of State for India to communicate

to the Viceroy the main points raised in discussion, and in particular the three tests referred to at &quot; A.&quot;

Pood ^ Rationing.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 11.)

2. With reference to the Conclusion mentioned in the margin the War Cabinet had before them the Report of the Rationing Sub-Committee of the Home Policy Committee (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 52) and a Memorandum on Meat and Sugar rationing by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 51).

The Minister of Food, as Chairman of the Rationing Sub-Committee, stated that the Report had been considered that morning by the Home Policy Committee, but on certain important points the Committee had not been able to submit a recommendation to the War Cabinet. It was necessary that decisions should be reached as soon as practicable, in order that he might be in a position to


Sugar.

504

instruct his officers throughout the country to start establishing the rationing machinery. In any event some time must elapse before actual rationing could start.

The War Cabinet then reviewed the proposals set out in the summary of Conclusions in paragraph 24 of the Report, a copy of which is for convenience of reference annexed as an Appendix to these Conclusions. In the course of this review the following points were made: 

Services (paragraph 24, sub-paragraphs 1-5).

This section represented the contribution to be made by the Army and Air Force, if a general rationing scheme were to be instituted; if no such scheme were introduced, there would be no need to proceed with the changes in the Service rations suggested in the section.

Particular attention was directed to sub-paragraph 5, the adoption of which it was hoped would result in substantial savings.

Civilians (paragraph 24, sub-paragraphs 6-8).

The distribution of the Ration Books would take from 7 to 10 days. It was desirable to start the distribution without further delay. The Ration Books would be required, if it were decided to ration any commodities.

Supplementary rations (paragraph 24, sub-paragraphs 8 and 9).

Both organised labour and expert medical opinion agreed that heavy workers and adolescents need not be given supplementary rations. It was therefore proposed only to issue rationing documents in two categories (i) to persons over the age of 6, and (ii) to children under that age, the meat ration of the latter being 50 per cent, of that of the former, but the other commodity rations being identical.

Cooking fats and margarine (paragraph 24, sub-paragraphs 10 and 11).

At the outset these would not be rationed, but the question might have to be reviewed later in the light of any shortage of butter.

Sugar, butter and bacon (paragraph 24, sub-paragraphs 12 14).

As regards sugar, the War Cabinet&apos;s attention was directed to the considerations set out in paragraph 16 of Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 52. Opinion in the Home Policy Committee as to the desirability of the immediate rationing of sugar had been about equally divided.

It was represented that the heavy consumption of sugar during the last two months was due to hoarding, partly by older persons who remembered the experiences of the Great War. If rationing could be introduced forthwith, the ration would be the generous one of 1-lb. per head per week, but if rationing were postponed for, say, 3 months, the ration might have to be a much smaller one. In any event, purchase of foreign sugars would be necessary, as home plus Empire supplies would not suffice to provide for home consumption, and essential exports for more than 9 months&apos; normal consumption. The foreigners would take advantage of the position to raise the price (foreign sugar was already 7s. Qd, a cwt. more than our Empire contract price), and this would antagonise Empire producers and increase the cost of sugar throughout the war.

On the other hand, it was argued that hoarding was due to the fear of rationing, and that, if it could be said that sugar would not in any event be rationed for some months, hoarding would cease, particularly if the public was exhorted not to hoard. It was desirable on general grounds to restrict controls to the essential


3

505 W.M. 60 (39).

minima, especially if the next four months were to be comparatively quiet. It had been found necessary to reverse the original decisions on the rationing of gas and electricity, and the same thing might occur in regard to sugar. If indiscriminate bombing started, it would be easy enough to inaugurate rationing.

In favour of immediate rationing, it was urged that the failure to ration sugar was already giving rise to unrest and criticism in the industrial areas; that the poor, with some justification, thought that the better-to-do were hoarding; and that, so far from being satisfied, public opinion would be vexed and disappointed if sugar was not rationed.

As against this it was pointed out that a decision not to ration would be regarded, both at home and abroad, as a notable triumph, and that, on the other hand, the Germans would claim that we had had to resort to rationing because of their submarine and other naval activities.

In the course of discussion the suggestion was made that it would be advisable to ascertain from bodies representative of different sections of public opinion what view they took of the desirability or otherwise of the immediate rationing of sugar. This suggestion met with considerable support. Butter and The view was expressed that the policy should be to limit

Bacon. rationing to what was absolutely necessary.   The position as

regards bacon supplies from overseas was at the moment uncertain, but there were very large potential supplies in the U.S.A. and Canada, where prices during the summer had been low.

On the other hand, it was pointed out that at the start of the war supplies of bacon from Denmark had been cut off, and this might well happen again if Germany so decided. Other important sources of supply raised exchange difficulties. The proposed ration for bacon (4 ounces per week) was double the ration originally intended, and, if the supply position improved, the ration might be still further increased.

If butter were the only commodity which, on grounds of present shortage, needed to be rationed, it would be a mistake to institute all the elaborate rationing machinery for the sole purpose of rationing butter, and it would be preferable to explain the position frankly to the people and to appeal to them to ration themselves voluntarily.

It was pointed out that such appeals had invariably failed in the past and that in present circumstances this would mean in effect that butter would become a privilege of the well-to-do. In the Great War the most potent cause of industrial unrest had been the maldistribution of foodstuffs, which had given rise to food queues. Public opinion would know that these injustices and inequalities could be avoided by the introduction of rationing. We now had sufficient experience of rationing to know what could be achieved by that means. At present we were placing upon the shopkeeper the invidious task of rationing his customers, and this was alienating the goodwill of the traders.

The Minister of Shipping warned the War Cabinet of the difficulties which he was experiencing in satisfying, the many demands made upon him for tonnage. He was anxious about the present and prospective positions. We had not yet concluded any arrangements with neutral countries, none of which had up to the present shown any inclination to close rapidly with us. It was clear that we could secure neutral tonnage in substantial volume only by paying an increased price.

. In his view, public opinion was in no way hostile in principle to rationing. He favoured issuing the Ration Books and giving people time to make themselves familiar with the whole subject. If no such action were taken, and if in a grave emergency we had hurriedly to ration, the results might be very serious. He favoured the early rationing of sugar and bacon on snipping grounds, since,


506

unless the neutral tonnage could be secured, we could not be certain of having sufficient for our needs. Tanker tonnage was obtainable, but it was a mistake to think that it was simple and easy to secure the other kinds of neutral tonnage.

The attention of the War Cabinet was directed to the considerations regarding meat set out in paragraph 19 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report. It was explained that under the arrangements proposed home and foreign meat would be retailed at the same prices, and that accordingly the latter would lose its customary price advantage. This was necessary in order to ensure proper distribution of the home and foreign supplies, which came on to the market at different times of the year.

In the course of discussion the War Cabinet were informed that we were proceeding on the basis of the following estimates for the period the 1st November, 1939, to the 31st January, 1940 : 

Estimated Supplies. Estimated Utilization.

Tons. Tons..

Anticipated    United                   British Army and Navy   ...      ... 60,000

Kingdom arrivals...     240,000   French Army        ...      ...      ...  

Home production  ...    290,000 | Allocated to Reserve ...... 30,000

Allocated to Manufacturers ... 25,000 Loss in cutting (5 per cent, of the

Civilian allocation) ...... 20,000

135,000

Balance for Civilians ...... 395,000

530,000 530,000

It would be observed that no allowance had been made in these estimates for losses due to enemy action.

It had been possible to provide a meat ration of the value of 2s. in place of the ration of Is. previously contemplated. This 2s. should, on the average, purchase from 24 to 32 ozs. of meat, according to quality.

The figure 290,000 tons for home production represented the normal annual output, and was based on the best figures obtainable. It would be very little affected by changes in price unless the changes were substantial.

The view was expressed that it would be far preferable to ration than to have food queues. If we could be certain of avoiding the latter throughout the winter, there was much to be said for not introducing rationing now; but rather than have food queues this winter, rationing should be introduced forthwith.

It was pointed out that difficulties were already being experienced in allocating supplies of frozen meat to certain districts. Complaints from Members of Parliament were being received and were growing in frequency and people in the localities concerned were getting restive. It&apos; was possible that in the absence of rationing we might see food queues by Christmas. The problem as regards meat was not only one of maldistribution, since there was an actual shortage of supplies of imported meat at the present time.

The Prime Minister drew attention to the time-table in paragraph 22 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report, from which it appeared that, if the War Cabinet approved the arrangements proposed that day, rationing could not well be made operative for any commodity before Monday, the 20th November. He thought it was clear that the Cabinet should postpone a decision as to which commodities should be rationed until it had been ascertained by enquiries from bodies representative of public opinion what the probable reactions of that opinion would be to the institution of rationing in the cases of sugar, bacon, butter and meat respectively.

In these circumstances, it was thought that it would be desirable to postpone the issue of rationing books until a decision


507

W.M. 60 (39).

had been reached as to which commodities should be rationed. This would enable the public to be carefully prepared in advance for the issue of the books. While it was recognised that a short further delay in issuing the books would postpone the whole rationing scheme for a corresponding period, it was thought desirable to defer the issue so as to enable the enquiries to be made and the explanatory statement prepared. The requisite propaganda should be got ready even though it might not be found necessary to use the whole of it.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) To take no decision on the specific recommendations

contained in paragraph 24 of Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 52.

(2) To invite the Minister of Labour, in association with the

Minister of Food and other Ministers concerned, to ascertain by enquiries from bodies representative of various sections of public opinion, the probable reactions of that opinion to the institution forthwith of rationing in the case of sugar, bacon, butter and meat respectively, e.g., is there a desire on the part of the public generally that these commodities should be rationed, and would the public regard their rationing as a relief or a burden ? The Minister of Labour should be asked to treat the matter as one of great urgency and to report the results of his enquiries to the War Cabinet as soon as practicable.

(3) To postpone, pending the results of the enquiries contem-

plated under (2) above, the authorisation of the issue of the ration books and the determination of which, if     any, of the above-named commodities should be rationed.

(4) To request the Minister of Food in consultation with the

Minister of Information to prepare an explanatory statement for publication when the ration books are issued, and generally to prepare propaganda in regard to rationing.

APPENDIX.

Food Rationing.

Report of the Sub-Committee of the Home Policy Committee on Rationing (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 52).

Summary of Conclusions.

24. The Sub-Committee recommend that the War Cabinet should be asked to approve the following proposals : :

Services.

1. That the meat ration for the Army and Air Force troops at home be reduced from 12 to 10 oz. of meat per day and from 2 oz. to If oz. of bacon per day.

2. That the Army and Air Force troops should be entitled to draw up to 3 oz. a day of sugar. (The present standard ration is 1^. oz. per day, but this is increased to 3 or 4 oz.)

3. That attention be drawn to the War Office estimate that, fully to compensate for the reduction in the meat and bacon ration recommended under 1 above, would require a net increase of 2d. a day in the cash portion of the ration.

4. That no alteration be made in the rations for the Navy or the Army and Air Force on active service overseas.

5. That all commanding officers be asked not to draw full rations, if their men are not requiring and, in fact, not consuming the full authorised ration; and that arrangements should be made to ensure that any savings thus effected are made available for civilian consumption.

Civilians.

6. That rationing of some commodities should be put into operation at an early date.

7. That with this object the Food Control Committees should be instructed to begin issuing Rationing Books forthwith with a view to completing the issue as soon as practicable.

There was no reason why the posting of the Ration Books should not commence on the 26th October.

8. That, in view of the fact that the meat ration, when it is imposed, will, under the proposals set out in this Report, be considerably larger than any meat ration in force in the Great War, it is not necessary to contemplate at present supplementary rations being given to heavy workers and adolescents.

9. The rationing Documents to be issued are, therefore, to be restricted at the outset to : j

(1) Persons over 6 years of age;

(2) Children under 6 years of age;

the rations of the latter being 50 per cent, of the meat ration for persons&apos; over 6 years of age, but identical as regards the other commodities.

10. That it is unnecessary at the outset to ration either cooking fats or margarine.

11. That whether it hereafter becomes necessary to ration these commodities should depend on whether the demand for them increases considerably consequent on the shortage of butter.


509

12. That the Minister of Food should be authorised to impose the rationing of: 

Sugar,* Butter, and Bacon,

either separately or all at one date whenever the administrative arrangements are ready.

13. The Minister of Food should make every effort practicable to ensure that the quantity of the ration at the outset should not be less than : 

Sugar : 1 lb. per head per week. Butter : 4 oz. per head per week. Bacon : 4 oz. per head per week.

14. That sugar consumed in hotels, restaurants and catering establishments should be free from rationing.

15. That as regards meat, the Minister of Food should be authorised, in view of the necessarily complicated nature of the distributive arrangements, to invite the public to carry out a trial rationing scheme on a voluntary basis for, say, a fortnight before the ration is imposed, that is 

(a) consumers would be asked to register with the butcher to whom they would be &quot; tied&quot; when rationing begins, and to restrict their purchases of rationed meat to their registered butcher; and

(6) consumers would also be asked to limit their purchases of rationed meat to 2s. per head per week.

16. That steps should be taken at once to prepare the public for developments along the lines above indicated.

October 23, 1939.

* The recommendation in the case of sugar is not unanimous.
