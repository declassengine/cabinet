W.M. 32 (39).

Air Situation. 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that a reconnaissance

(Previous of the Heligoland Bight had been carried out in force on the

Reference: previous day, with the object of engaging any enemy warships W.M. (39) 81st which might be sighted. The reconnaissance force had consisted Conclusions, of two formations, each of six Hampden bombers. One of these Minute 1.)       formations had attacked two German destroyers.   Seven 500-lb.

bombs had been dropped close to one of the destroyers, but no actual hits had been observed. All the aircraft of this formation had returned safely. One aircraft of the other formation had returned to base owing to some defect shortly after taking off, but the other five had failed to return. A German statement had been issued to the effect that a formation of six of our aircraft had attacked their Fleet, but without result; that these aircraft had been subsequently engaged by German fighters, and that five of them had been brought down in the sea. It was to be feared that the German claim to have brought down five of our bombers was probably accurate, but the statement that no damage had been caused to the German ships was not necessarily true.

In discussion, the question was raised whether it would not be more profitable to carry out air attacks on military objectives, such as German troop concentrations. In this connection the Secretary of State for War referred to the information that the Germans were building four pontoon bridges over the Rhine, which would be suitable objectives for air attack.

It was pointed out that the carrying out of attacks on German warships was strictly in accordance with the policy which we had agreed with the French. Nevertheless, it was a matter for consideration whether the continuance of attacks on German warships, close to their bases, constituted the best use of our resources.

The Prime Minister said that the Air Ministry would no doubt take into account the experience gained in bombing attacks already carried out when deciding on future operations.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement on the Air Situation.

Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War

Operations. Cabinet that, if nothing untoward happened before 1 p.m., six days (Previous would have elapsed since the last attack on British shipping. This Reference: was not due to the return of the submarines to Germany, as neutral W.M. (39) 81st ships were still being sunk, and there had been three attacks on Conclusions, enemy submarines by our forces in the previous 24 hours. Minute 2.) Convoys were sailing according to plan, and certain neutral

ships had taken advantage of the opportunity to join them. If our convoys continued to move in safety, it might be worth inviting neutral shipping to join them, and to insure them against loss on the voyage.

The A quitania had arrived safely from America. She was too fast to move in convoy, and he proposed to enquire of the owners whether the value of her voyages was sufficient to counterbalance the danger of the loss of such a fine ship.

The cruisers which had been searching the South Atlantic, where certain German merchant vessels had been alleged to have a rendezvous, had found nothing and were returning to their stations.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Military 3   The Secretary of State for War said that information had

Situation. Deen received from the French that the Germans were building four

(Previous pontoon bridges over the Rhine, 60 miles behind the front. This

Eeference: might be an indication of preparations for an attack. One more W.M. (39) 31st Landwehr Division had been identified on the Western front.

Conclusions, Minute 4.)

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval, Military and Air Situation.

Weekly Report by Chiefs of Staff. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 24th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

4. The War Cabinet had before them the Weekly Report (No. 4) by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (39) 60).

The Minister without Portfolio enquired whether the reference in paragraph 30 to the Divisions &quot; within easy distance of the Belgian and Dutch frontiers&quot; should be understood as the beginnings of a concentration of troops for an attack.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said the available information went to show that these Divisions were not those with which we should expect an attack to be carried out. General Gamelin now expected the first attack further south.

Reference was made to telegram No. 132 from Brussels, in which M. Spaak was reported as having said that renewed assurances bad been given by the German authorities to the Dutch and Belgian Military Attache&apos;s in Berlin that Germany did not contemplate any attack on the Low Countries.

The War Cabinet took note of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 26th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

The British 5.   Reference was made to telegram No. 719 from Paris, in

Army in France, which Sir Eric Phipps said that M. Daladier had told him that, at the second meeting of the Supreme War Council, he had pressed that British troops should take their place as early as possible in the Maginot Line and that he still considered this essential to counteract German propaganda.

The Ministers present at the meeting of the Supreme War Council had no recollection of any such request on the part of M. Daladier. The forward movement of the Field Force, which had been discussed, had always been understood to relate to the occupation of its allotted sector, which was not in the Maginot Line.

The Secretary of State for War suggested that there had been a misunderstanding on the part of the British Ambassador. The phrase which had been used by General Gamelin in the discussions which he had attended, had been that the French and British troops should be &quot; side by side,&quot; which, in fact, they were in the sector they were occupying. He thought it unlikely that the French Commander-in-Chief would desire the presence of isolated British units in the Maginot Line.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to instruct the British Ambassador in Paris to clear up the misunderstanding which appeared to have occurred.


255

W.M. 32 (39).

Propaganda In 6.   The Secretary of State for War said that he had taken

France. steps to improve the publicity accorded to the British Army,

(Previous particularly in France.  A large number of photographs had now

Eeference: been released, and a News Reel of the movement of the Field Force

W.M. (39) 3lst to France would be shown in London on Monday. Photographs and

Conclusions, films were also being flown to Paris, for distribution in France, and

Minute 5.) were being distributed by the Ministry of Information in neutral countries.                        :.&apos;

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Air Strengths. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a most secret document

(Previous (which was withdrawn at the conclusion of the discussion) prepared

Eeference: by the Air Ministry in pursuance of the conclusion noted in the

W.M. (39) 15th margin, giving the present air strengths of this country and France

Conclusions, in relation to the estimated air strength of Germany.

The Secretary of State for Air made a general explanatory statement with a view to qualifying and amplifying the figures shown in the Air Ministry Paper.

The record of this statement and of the subsequent discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet 

(i) took note of the statement showing the present air

strength of this country and France in relation to the estimated air strength of Germany:

(ii) took note that the Air Ministry were preparing a further

statement showing the production figures of Great Britain, France and Germany up to (a) the 31st December, 1939, and (b) the 31st March, 1940, showing the estimated rate of production of aircraft of all types, assuming that factories are not hampered by air attack :

(iii) invited the Air Ministry to submit a further Paper

showing 

(a) the increase which would accrue in the period

covered by this review in the number of first-line Squadrons (shown separately as to types), and in the numbers of aircraft allocated to reserves and to training :

(b) a forecast of the Air personnel situation over the

same period :

(iv) invited the Air Ministry to submit a separate Paper as to

German types, in comparison with our own, their dependence on octane fuel, and like matters.

Purchase of 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

Chilean had considered the suggestion made by the First Lord of the

Destroyers. Admiralty that we should invite the Chilean Government to sell us

(Previous certain destroyers.   In view of the efforts which we were making

Eeference: to induce the Governments of the South American Republics to

W.M. (39) 26th maintain an attitude of strict neutrality in regard to submarine

Conclusions, bases, it would be impossible for us to make this suggestion to the

Minute 10.) Chilean Government.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

[20082]


256

Treatment of 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

Enemy Aliens had now made inquiries regarding the newspaper report to which found on attention had been drawn by the First Lord of the Admiralty that

Neutral Ships,   seven British seamen had been removed by a German destroyer (Previous        from a neutral merchant ship.   The merchant ship had been a Eeference:       Swedish vessel, and the British seamen were men who had been W.M. (39) 30th rescued from a ship which had been torpedoed.   The Admiralty Conclusions,      had authorised a statement in this connection that the Commander Minute 4.)       of the German destroyer had acted within his rights under International Law.   This line was consistent with the policy approved by the War Cabinet that we should, ourselves, remove enemy aliens of certain types [e.g., technicians of military age) from neutral ships, provided that we could do so without causing unnecessary difficulties with the United States or with Italy.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he proposed to pursue his suggestion that we should collect from neutral ships Germans of military age to two or three times the number of British seamen taken from such vessels by German Commanders.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Position of British Subjects in Germany.

(Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 29th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, as arranged at the Meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin, he had made inquiries regarding the position of British subjects now in Germany. There were between 200 and 300 such persons, of whom between 100 and 200, it was believed, were being interned by the German Government. He had asked the United States Government to let us know how these people were being treated by the German Government.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Staff Conversa- 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

tions with to telegram No. 132 dated the 29th September, 1939, from His

Belgium. Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Brussels.   There was no change of attitude

(Previous on the part of the Belgian Government regarding the possibility

Reference:  f initiating Staff Conversations, and he was exploring the personal

W.M. (39) 29th suggestion thrown out by M. Van Zeeland that a discreet civil

Conclusions, intermediary might represent the views of our staff to a similar

Minute 5.) individual in Belgium, who would in turn pass these views on to the Belgian Staff.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Germany.

Internal Situation.

Efficacy of leaflet campaign.

12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read out a report to the effect that the authorities in Berlin had found that the formation of long queues of persons waiting to buy food provided too free an opportunity for people to exchange ideas. All queues had, therefore, now been prohibited, and people were required to hand their food tickets to the Air Warden of their house by whom the food was purchased.

According to the same report, the leaflet campaign had not as yet proved particularly successful, though it was thought that its effect might be insidious, and prove of greater value later on. Germans picking up leaflets surrendered them to the police, but no doubt in most cases not before they had read them.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.


177

257

W.M. 32 (39).

Turkey. 13.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Leakage of to the publication in that morning&apos;s Press of reports that we had

information reached an Agreement with Turkey. The Turkish Government had

regarding the particularly asked that the utmost secrecy should be observed in

conclusion of this matter until after the return from Moscow of M. Sarajoglu,

the Anglo- the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs.   From enquiries made,

Turkish Treaty, however, he was satisfied that the leakage had occurred at the

(Previous Turkish end.   In view of this leakage, some public statement as

Eeference: to the Treaty would have to be made, and he had accordingly

W.M. (39) 31st telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, to say that we

Conclusions, were anxious to agree with the Turkish Government the terms of

Minute 7.) the necessary communique.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey.

Visit of General Orbay to London. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 31st Conclusions, Minute 8.)

14. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that General Orbay would arrive in London on the 2nd October. The Deputy Chiefs of Staff Committee had prepared an aide-memoire for use by the British Permanent Military Representatives in their discussions with the General, but it was highly desirable that they should be given full instructions before the discussions started. He therefore thought that a Conference of Ministers should be held on Monday morning.

After hearing an account of the position from the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, the War Cabinet agreed 

(i) that a Meeting should be held on Monday, the 2nd October, 1939, at the Central War Room, at 10-45 a.m., to be attended by 

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, The First Lord of the Admiralty, The Secretary of State for War, The Secretary of State for Air, and The three Chiefs of Staff;

(ii) that this Conference should settle the instructions to be

given to the British Military Representatives as to the line to be taken in their conversations with General Orbay, subject to reference, if need be, to the War Cabinet;

(iii) to take note that, prior to the Meeting referred to in

(i) above, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence would circulate a Note comparing, under each head, the demands received from the Turkish Government and the extent to which we could meet them;

(iv) that in no circumstances should a situation of real

difficulty be allowed to arise in the conversations with General Orbay until after the Anglo-Turkish Treaty had been actually signed.

Anglo-SoYlet 15.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Trade to telegram No. 340, dated the 29th September, 1939, received from

Negotiations. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, expressing grave fears that.

(Previous if Anglo-Soviet relations deteriorated further, the considerable

Eeference: number of British ships (about 19) now in Archangel and

W.M. (39) 3l8t Murmansk might be seized by the Soviet Government together with

Conclusions their crews.   If this fear was well founded, it was all the more

Minute 10) important to reach a decision on the question of Anglo-Soviet Trade.

Exchange of The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that since the last

rubber and tin Cabinet he had ascertained that the Ministry of Supply considered

for Soviet that our need for Soviet timber was so urgent that we should be

timber. justified in releasing rubber and tin (the commodities asked for by


258

the Soviet Government) iri order to obtain it. If an agreement was to be reached on these lines, the utmost despatch must be shown, since in a few weeks the White Sea ports would be frozen up for the winter.

Exchange of The President of the Board of Trade said that he had the

machine tools previous day received a visit from the Soviet Trade Commissioner, and copper for who had suggested a further deal by which we should receive Soviet cereals,   cereals from the U.S.S.R. in return for machine tools and copper.

In view of the announcement that morning of the German-Soviet Agreement, he (the President of the Board of Trade) had informed the Soviet Trade Commissioner that he must consult his colleagues before he could discuss this suggestion.

The Minister of Supply said that he strongly favoured the conclusion of the first transaction in view of our urgent need for timber. The second transaction presented further difficulties, since a large proportion of the machine tools formerly available had been taken up by the Service Departments. Moreover, it was doubtful whether we were in a position to spare any copper for export.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in reaching a decision, it must be borne in mind that in existing circumstances exports to the U.S.S.R. were probably tantamount to exports to Germany.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(a) that the Minister of Supply, in consultation with the

Departments concerned, should be authorised to negotiate as rapidly as possible an agreement with the U.S.S.R. by which the Soviet Union should furnish us with timber in return for rubber and tin (the commodities asked for by the U.S.S.R.), on the understanding that in these negotiations he should secure if possible the insertion of a provision guaranteeing that neither the British vessels now in Archangel and Murmansk nor their crews should be interfered with;

(b) that the President of the Board of Trade should inform the

Soviet Trade Commissioner that, after consultation with his colleagues, he was now in a position to state that he was prepared, in consultation with the Departments concerned, to open negotiations for the purchase of Soviet cereals in exchange for machine tools and copper, in so far as the latter were available for export.

Slno-Japanese Conflict.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 30th Conclusions, Minute 8.) (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 28th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

16. The War Cabinet had before them a note on the stage reached in the Sino-Japanese conflict (War Cabinet Paper W.P. (39) 56) prepared by the Chiefs of Staff Committee in amplification of the oral statement made to the War Cabinet by the Chief of the Air Staff at their meeting held on Tuesday, the 26th September, 1939.

In the course of the discussion the following considerations were stressed: 

(i) While no one questioned the conclusion reached by the Chiefs of Staff Committee that from the military point of view the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese conflict was to our advantage, it was necessary also to take into consideration the political considerations involved, such as the risk that, if our relations with the Japanese Government further deteriorated, they might stage a series of incidents such as that at Tientsin, to which we should either have to react violently or to be subject

 to damaging repercussions, for example, in Siam and in India.


259

W.M. 32 (39).

(ii) Doubt was expressed on the question whether, notwith-

standing the last telegram (No. 963 dated the 27th September, 1939), despatched by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Shanghai, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr fully realised that it was not our wish that he should do all in his power to promote a settlement of the Sino-Japanese conflict, but rather that we wished him to sound General Chiang Kai-shek as to his reactions to the suggestion made by the Japanese Government forwarded by Sir Robert Craigie.

Note. In this connection the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr would not arrive in Chungking until the 7th October, 1939, and that there was therefore plenty of time to send him a further telegram making the position perfectly clear. This would be done.

(iii) The view was expressed that there was no need for a final

decision to be taken at the present time on the question whether the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese conflict was or was not on balance to the interests of this country. If General Chiang Kai-shek was unwilling to enter into discussion with the Japanese Government, no further action on our part would be required. If on the other hand the General favoured such discussions, the matter would in any case need to be further considered by the War Cabinet. The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Transport of 17.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that he was anxious to

certain Gas obtain authority to despatch to France a stock of gas bombs and Equipment to also certain Offensive Gas Apparatus, so that, if the Germans Franoe. employed gas, we should be in a position to retaliate, if we decided

to do so.   The bombs and apparatus were quite useless so long

as they were in this country.

The War Cabinet agreed 

To authorise the despatch to France, as a precautionary measure, of the gas stores and equipment referred to by the Chief of the Air Staff.

German-Soviet Agreement.

Information for Dominion High Commissioners. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 31st Conclusions, Minute 9.)

The Calling Up of Men for the Armed Forces.

18. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed the War Cabinet that the Dominion High Commissioners .were apprehensive lest the latest agreement reached between Germany and the U.S.S.R. should develop into a military alliance.

It was agreed that there would be no objection to the High Commissioners being told that the possibilities in this direction were under examination by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

19. The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (G.) (39) 22) on the subject of the further steps which were being taken with regard to the calling up of men for the Armed Forces.
