W.M. 44 (39).

Air Operations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 1.) Naval Operations. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 4.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said there was nothing fresh to report.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinet details of the engagement which had taken place in the North Sea between British cruisers and destroyers and enemy aircraft.

The attack had apparently been made by three waves, each of six aircraft, and had continued for a considerable time. A large number of bombs had been dropped, from heights ranging between 10,000 and 18,000 feet. Over 88 had been counted from one cruiser. No hits had been made, and the bombs had fallen at an average distance of 600 yards from the ships. There had been no dive-bombing. Five enemy aircraft were believed to have failed to return home.

There seemed to be some reason to believe that the Germans had a system enabling aircraft to &quot;home&quot; on a reconnaissance aircraft shadowing the Fleet.

The Chief of the A ir Staff thought this unlikely, and suggested that the method employed was direction-finding from shore stations  a system we employed.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Cap Norte, the German ship of 13,000 tons which had been reported, at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin, as having been captured near Iceland, had German reservists on board from South America and was now being safely brought in. In the last 16 days we had lost, by enemy action, 5,800 tons of shipping, and in the same period we had captured 13,000 tons. He did not think the absence of sinkings could be attributed to deliberate holding back on the part of German submarines.

These figures showed a satisfactory conclusion to the first phase of the war at sea. He thought we should now look for a second phase, which might take the form of heavy air attack on ports and convoys.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

3. Arising out of the discussion in Minute 2, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that heavy air attack on East coast ports and convoys, such as had been suggested by the First Lord of the Admiralty, would inevitably throw a heavy strain on Western ports. He had accordingly invited the Minister of Transport to submit a report giving the War Cabinet information as to the progress made since the outbreak of war in improving the ability of Western ports to deal with increased traffic.

The First Sea Lord described the measures which were being taken to provide as high a degree as possible of anti-aircraft protection for convoys passing up and down the East .coast. Escorting vessels, well armed with anti-aircraft guns, would accompany each convoy over the most dangerous part of the route. Each merchant ship would be armed with anti-aircraft machine guns; and experiments were being made to ascertain the possibility of flying kites when wind conditions were favourable, to act as a barrage against low-flying attack.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that certain Fighter Squadrons had been placed at advanced landing grounds near the East coast, so as to be ready to engage enemy aircraft attacking convoys. The chief difficulty would be lack of warning, particularly if the enemy came over at a very low height. If the enemy made a determined [20137] b 2

Protection and Diversion of East Coast Shipping.


358

attack in strength on the convoys, they would probably do considerable damage, and it was impossible to guarantee interception before their attack was made.

The War Cabinet took note : 

(a) of the measures which were being taken to protect convoys on the East coast;

(6) that the Minister of Transport would shortly submit a Report on the progress of measures for improving our ability to divert traffic from East to West coast ports.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 5.)

Weekly Reports.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 36th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing new to report.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

5.   The War Cabinet took note of the following Reports : 

(a) Weekly Report No. 5 by the Secretary of State for War

(Paper W.P. (39) 80).

(b) Weekly Report No. 5 by the Secretary of State for Air

(Paper W.P. (39) 78)&quot;

Turkey. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that at

(Previous present he had nothing further to report regarding the discussions

Reference: proceeding in Moscow between M. Stalin and M. Sarajoglu, the

W.M. (39) 43rd Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the subject of the proposed

Conclusions, Turco-Soviet pact, or in regard to the reaction of those discussions

Minute 8.) on the Anglo-Turkish Treaty.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Italy. 7.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to Telegram

(Previous No.  1016, dated the 9th October,  1939,  from His Majesty&apos;s

Reference: Ambassador, Rome, setting out a number of questions relating to W.M. (39) 43rd naval and military matters on which he had suggested (in Telegram Conclusions, No. 1015 of the same date) that it would be helpful if he could Minute 11.) furnish information confidentially to Count Ciano with a view to impressing him with the magnitude of the British war effort.

In the course of discussion, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs furnished the War Cabinet with certain information received from a highly secret source which might be thought to throw some light on the probable attitude of Italy. Particulars of this information are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that, whilst it was undesirable to furnish replies to the very detailed questions asked, a telegram should be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, containing such particulars of a general nature regarding our naval and military strength as might be thought suitable for communication confidentially to Count Ciano in order to counteract recent German propaganda in Italy;

(6) that the terms of the telegram referred to in (a) above should be settled by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in consultation with the tnree Service Ministers.


359

W.M. 44 (39).

Germany. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

(Previous        to Telegram No. 139 (R), dated the 10th October, 1939, from His Eeference:       Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Brussels, reporting that, in conversation W.M. (39) 43rd that morning, the Secretary-General of the Ministry for Foreign Conclusions,      Affairs had stated that important German industrialists who had Minute 12.)      arrived in Belgium during the past few days were under the impression that the war was over and that it only remained to arrange a peace conference.  This was of interest as indicating the state of opinion in Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Position of British Snbjeets in Germany.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 10.)

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had received a Note from the United States Ambassador in London in reply to our request that he should make inquiry respecting the treatment accorded by the German Authorities to certain British sailors, lascars and others, in Bremen and Hamburg. Mr. Kennedy stated that the matter was being kept under review, and he hoped that the position would shortly be improved.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Belgium. 10.   Certain information received from a very confidential

(Previous source was communicated to the War Cabinet on the subject of the

Reference: attitude of Belgium to her neutrality in supplement to that

W.M. (39) 43rd communicated to the War Cabinet at their meeting noted in the

Conclusions, margin.   Details of the information so furnished are recorded in

Minute 10.) the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the information communicated in the discussion referred to above.

The Problem of 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in

Polish Refugees, accordance with the decision reached by the War Cabinet at the (Previous meeting noted in the margin, he had been considering how best to Reference: establish an organisation for dealing with the Polish refugees, W.M. (39) 36th which would be acceptable both to the Polish and to the French Conclusions, Governments. A certain amount of progress had been made, and, Minute 9.)       after consultation with the Prime Minister, he had arranged that

afternoon to see Sir Francis Humphrys, whom he proposed to invite

to take charge of the scheme.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Need for Issue 12.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that at their meeting that

of Warnings morning the Chiefs of Staff Committee had had under consideration against the large amount of loose and dangerous talk on Service matters to

Discussion of    be heard in Clubs, particularly Service Clubs.  The Chiefs of Staff Confidential      Committee recommended that a warning notice signed by an appro-Matters in        priate authority should be displayed in all clubs in the United Public Places.    Kingdom, and also that the Minister of Information should be asked to arrange for the display on hoardings and elsewhere of notices warning the public against discussing confidential matters in public places.

The War Cabinet agreed to appoint a Committee consisting of the three Service Ministers, the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and the Permanent [20137] b 3


360

Secretary of the Treasury (representing the Prime Minister): 

(i) to consider the form of the orders to be issued to the three Fighting Services and to the Civil Service, enjoining on all ranks in those Services the need for taking the utmost care to avoid mentioning in public any matters of a confidential character; (ii) to consider the advisability of the issue to the general public by the Ministry of Information of warnings of a similar character and of the display on hoardings and elsewhere of similar notices.

Control of 13.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-

Prices, randum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 30)

Prices of Goods  reporting the recommendations of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy on the draft Prices of Goods Bill.

{Previous r

-i.   The  Chancellor of the Exchequer,  as  Chairman of the

riiP.TPT&apos;P.Tl P.P. * . . , * J. 3

w M (391 21st Ministerial Committee, made a statement explanatory of the Con iusio 8 Committee&apos;s recommendations. The Chancellor said that a Minute 20)&apos; difference of view between his Department and the Board of Trade had now been resolved in the manner shown in the Memorandum, namely, the substitution of a new text for Clause 4 of the Bill as printed, and the inclusion in the First Schedule of an additional &quot; matter to be regarded in fixing the permitted increase.&quot;

The Ministerial Committee were unanimous in considering that, with these modifications, the Bill was a fair and workable measure.  Lord Stamp was of the same opinion.

The President of the Board of Trade said that it was proposed to take the Second Reading in the latter part of the following week.

His Department hoped that they would not, at any rate at first, find it necessary to make Orders regulating the prices of many commodities. The first few Orders ought to have a deterrent effect on the vendors of other commodities, whose prices were not as yet regulated.

The President said that he would wish in due course to consult the War Cabinet again on the question of the selection of a Chairman for the Central Price-Regulation Committee.

The War Cabinets 

(i) approved the recommendations of the Ministerial Com-

mittee on Economic Policy regarding the introduction of the Prices of Goods Bill;

(ii) took note that the President of the Board of Trade would

consult them regarding the Chairmanship of the Central Price-Regulation Committee.

Compensation 14.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed his colleagues

for War Damage that he had received a Report from an authoritative Conference to Fixed under the chairmanship of Lord Weir, which had been investi-

Property. gating the practicability of providing a Government war risks

insurance scheme in respect of buildings and other fixed property, comparable with that already provided in respect of goods in trade. As the War Cabinet would be aware, this was a matter regarding which many complaints had been heard.

Lord Weir&apos;s Report, which was an able document, took the view that the Government&apos;s decision not to institute a Government scheme in respect of fixed property had been right. The Report also included recommendations on one or two minor points, which there would be no difficulty in accepting.


 41

361 W.M. 44 (39).

Members of the House of Commons had already been asking to see the Report, and there could be no doubt but that it must be laid before Parliament in the near future. There would also have to be a White Paper containing the Government&apos;s observations on the Report.

The First Lord of the Admiralty expressed doubts about the recommendations which he understood the Report to contain. His recollection of the manner in which this problem had been dealt with during the last war was that the owners of fixed property had received less than justice.

The W ar Cabinet deferred a decision pending the circulation to them of the Weir Report and of the draft White Paper.

Dropping of Leaflets.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 3.)

15. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper W.P. (39) 82) on the effect of the dropping of leaflets in Germany.

The view generally expressed was that no certain conclusion could be based on the conflicting evidence available. It was pointed out, however, that the unfavourable comments in neutral countries might well be tinged by German propaganda.

It was generally agreed that, while it would be premature to pass a final judgment on the policy of dropping leaflets, there was no reason to abandon the practice, and that the proper course was to continue to drop them, not regularly, but as occasion offered. At the same time, every endeavour should be made to improve the size and lay-out of the leaflets. It was generally felt that the later leaflets had been more successful than the earlier ones. There were, moreover, particular occasions when a leaflet might have a very telling effect; for example, leaflets might be dropped in Germany summarising the statement to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the following day. This leaflet might perhaps take the form of an enquiry: &apos;&apos; Had the German people seen the full text of the Prime Minister&apos;s reply? If not, why had they not been allowed to see it ? &quot;

Reference was made to the wording of paragraphs which had appeared in the British Press, which reproduced the German Communique regarding the capture of one of our leaflet-dropping balloons. These paragraphs were so drafted as to imply that the Germans were putting about a malicious suggestion that our leaflets were dropped from balloons and not from aircraft.

At a later stage in the proceedings the Minister of Information drew attention to the considerations urged in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum, to the effect that there was an anomaly in giving publicity in this country to leaflets prepared by a secret Department for dropping in Germany. Much sympathy was expressed with this view, and it was pointed out that when the leaflets had been published in foreign newspapers it was impossible to refuse to allow them to be published in this country. It was agreed, however, that it would be most undesirable to allow publication here of leaflets that were given circulation in Germany by secret methods.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(i) that leaflets should continue to be dropped, not at regular

intervals, but as occasion offered; (ii) to invite the attention of the Secretary of State for Air to paragraphs which had appeared in the British Press following the capture of one of our leaflet-dropping balloons.

The Scope and Organisation of the Ministry of Information.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 35th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

Vote for Chief Censor.

Propaganda by means of advertisements in newspapers.

16. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Information (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 34) relating to the future position and functions of the Ministry of Information.

The Minister of Information stated that there were two points to which he had given attention : The first was whether the general structure of the Ministry was right- in particular, whether there were too many higher administrative posts. He had given careful consideration to this question, and, although it might be possible to cut down a few of these posts, he thought that, if the Ministry was to do its work efficiently, the number was not excessive. The second point, a more difficult point, was the personnel filling these posts. The personnel had been invited to join the Ministry, and, although some of them were not perhaps quite fitted for the tasks upon which they were engaged and some of their work had been found unnecessary, this was not their fault, and in any rearrangements made the staff must be treated with courtesy. He hoped to make a reduction of some 10 per cent., and he thought that somfe&apos; rearrangement of personnel was necessary. The Minister added that he thought the stage of being apologetic for the Ministry had now passed, and the time had now come to emphasise that, if it was to carry on the work of propaganda efficiently, the Ministry must have an adequate staff. Propaganda was an essential weapon for carrying on the war.

Some discussion then took place on the criticisms that were likely to be made on the Ministry in the debate which was to take place that afternoon in the House of Commons. It was felt that there might be pressure for further reductions, but that it would not be possible to say more than that a careful enquiry was being carried out.

The Lord Privy Seal asked which Department would carry the vote for the Chief Censor.

The Home Secretary stated that it had been suggested that his Department should carry this vote, but, before assenting, he would like to know what responsibilities it entailed, particularly in regard to answering complaints if things went wrong.

A decision on this matter was deferred. It was generally agreed, however, that questions relating to censorship should be addressed to the Department affected.

The Prime Minister asked the Minister for Information, now that his Department dealt only with propaganda, to what extent he proposed to rely on advertising as an instrument.

The Minister of Information said that the programme for advertising set out on page 8 of his Memorandum, which would cost some  120,000, was perhaps a little too ambitious, and he did not think the whole of it should be embarked upon.

Considerable doubts were expressed as to the efficacy of propaganda by means of advertising in newspapers. The view was generally expressed that such a medium was not of very great value, but that this criticism did not apply to propaganda by means of posters, the effectiveness of which was recognised.

The War Cabinet 

(i) Gave general approval to the proposals of the Minister of Information, set out in his Memorandum, for the maintenance of the Ministry, (ii) Invited the Minister to reconsider the suggestions contained in his Memorandum relating to the use of advertisements in newspapers as a means of propaganda, in the light of the above discussion.

W.M. 44 (39).

Herr Hitler&apos;s 17.   The War Cabinet had before them a further revised draft

Speech to the of the statement to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government Reichstag.        in reply to Herr Hitler&apos;s speech to the Reichstag (Paper W.P. (39)

Further revised 81).

i^eh^Tir* ?he Secretary  f State for dominion Affairs reported that the on eia o is j)ominjon Governments were very grateful for the further time G^68 t allowed them for consideration of the statement. The reply received from the Canadian Government, apparently sent before (Previous ^ne iagj. revige had been received, suggested the inclusion of a more

Reference: ^     definite statement of our war aims.   The message from New w.M. (39) 43rd Zealand, which apparently referred to the last revise, considered it Conclusions,      satisfactory, but suggested fuller development of the theme that we Minute 13.)      were at war in order to oppose aggression and that, once given conditions of security, we were ready to co-operate with all other nations in Europe and elsewhere.   The message from Australia, apparently sent before the receipt of the last revise, urged that the statement should bring out that the countries of the British Commonwealth with all other free countries were in danger from German aggression, and that we were fighting for the principle of the rule of law, not merely to restore the status quo of the conditions of the Versailles Treaty.

It was the general opinion that the last revise would go some way to meet these suggestions, and that, while they were not inconsistent with the proposed Statement, it was not possible at this stage to redraft the Statement once again so as to incorporate these suggestions. The Dominion Governments might be informed that some of the points suggested by them would be covered in other statements to be made from time to time.

It was also generally agreed, more particularly in view of the references to Great Britain in M. Daladier&apos;s broadcast on the previous day, that somewhat fuller references should be made in the statement to the position of the French nation as our allies in a common undertaking.

Accordingly, the War Cabinet-Approved the draft Statement contained in Paper W.P. (39) 81, subject to its amendment by the Foreign Secretary so as to incorporate a fuller reference to the French nation.
