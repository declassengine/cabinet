Statement by the Prime Minister on the Meeting of the Supreme War Council.

1. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he and Lord Chatfield were completely satisfied with the results of their conversations of the previous day with M. Daladier and General Gamelin. These conversations, which had covered a fairly wide field in regard to questions both of policy and strategy, had shown that there wa&apos;s a remarkable identity of views between the two Governments, even more so than he (the Prime Minister) had expected.

The Prime Minister then indicated broadly the lines which the discussion had followed. Among the points of more general interest were the following : 

Public Opinion in Great Britain and France.

German efforts to divide the Allies.

Great Britain&apos;s preparations for a long war.

Mobilisation of industry.

Internal feeling in Germany.

Military Situation.

General European Situation.

Attitude of Spain.

(i) The Prime Minister had assured M. Daladier of the complete unanimity of opinion in this country in regard to the war, and the latter had been emphatic that the French people had accepted the war not with enthusiasm, but with a complete determination to put an end to Hitlerism.

(ii) Reference was made to the efforts already made by the Germans to divide the Allies. M. Daladier thought that these efforts would be intensified, but was convinced that they would meet with no success.

(iii) The Prime Minister had explained to M. Daladier that

the British announcement did not necessarily mean that they thought the war would last three years, but was intended to show the scale on which preparations were being made.

(iv) The Prime Minister had explained our plans for the

mobilisation of industry and had expressed our desire to keep in close contact with the French as to the best use to be made of our collective resources. M. Daladier explained that the French Government were mobilising their own resources, and were proposing to establish a Ministry of Munitions. He had referred also to the purchase of supplies from the United States, and had expressed a hope that the British and French should not make the mistake made in the last war of competing against one another in that market.

(v) M. Daladier had stated that German prisoners taken on

the Western front were not aware that Germany was at war with France, and had said that they had received strict orders not to fire on the French lines unless they were fired at.

(vi) Discussion had taken place on the military situation, which M. Daladier had stated was developing in the way anticipated by the French General Staff. M. Daladier had confirmed that there was agreement between the British and French Staffs as to military policy and objectives. The position in regard to Poland had been reviewed, and reference had been made to the importance of passing material through Roumania into Poland.

(vii) Discussion had taken place as to the general European situation. This discussion had revealed complete identity of views in regard to the attitude of the Allies towards Italy, the policy to be adopted in the Balkans, and the attitude of Bulgaria and Yugo-Slavia. It had been agreed that it would be unfortunate if any steps were taken which gave Italy the impression that we were forming a Balkan bloc against her.

viii) M. Daladier was satisfied with the present attitude of Spain, and was particularly pleased by a recent anti-German speech by the Cardinal Primate. [19998] b 2


102

The British Field Force.

Arrangements for Franco-British Liaison.

(ix) General Gamelin stated that the arrival in France of the

British Field Force was proceeding exactly according to plan, and that no hitch of any kind had occurred.

(x) General Gamelin stated that he was perfectly satisfied

with the present arrangements for Franco-British liaison, which had served to secure decisions in the shortest possible time. M. Daladier had concurred emphatically in this view.

The War Cabinet : 

Expressed their great satisfaction on the successful outcome of. the Prime Minister&apos;s discussions with M. Daladier.

The Balkans.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 8th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

2. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the latest telegrams from Athens appeared to indicate that General Weygand was acting somewhat in advance of instructions received from his Government, or was not aware of his Government&apos;s instructions. He asked whether steps would be taken to ensure that General Weygand acted in conformity with his Government&apos;s policy.

It was pointed out that the meeting between the Prime Minister and M. Daladier on the previous day had shown complete identity of views in regard to Balkan policy.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook, however, to bear this point in mind.

four hours.

The Air 3.   The Secretary of State for Air said that there was no

Situation.        change to report in the air situation during the preceding twenty-

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 13th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

The Naval 4.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty reported that no merchant

Situation. vessels had been sunk during the previous 45 hours. Attacks on (Previous enemy submarines continued. The Vanquisher and Walker, which Reference: had been in collision the previous day, were now proceeding to W.M. (39), 13th Plymouth, the Vanquisher in tow and the Walker under her own Conclusions, steam. In view of the attitude of Italy (as shown by the fact that Minute 2.) &apos;      orders had been given to Italian merchant vessels to put to sea

again) it had been decided to re-open the Mediterranean to merchant

ships in convoy.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 13th Conclusions, Minute 3.) Poland.

Belgium.

5. The Secretary of State for War said that the disembarkation of the Field Force was proceeding according to plan.

The Chief of the Imperial General Stajf said that the Poles were fighting better; the 8 Divisions which were in danger of being cut off to the north-west of Warsaw were now fighting their way back to the Vistula.

The situation on the Western Front was unchanged.

The position in regard to Belgium was again referred to, and the importance was stressed of making adequate arrangements


103 W.M. u (39).

beforehand so as to avoid our troops being placed in a situation similar to that which had occurred in 1914.

It was explained that, as the result of the discussion in the War Cabinet the previous day, the Foreign Secretary had sent a telegram to Brussels (Telegram No. 60) with a view to arranging conversations with the Belgians. If this endeavour to establish the essential liaison with the Belgians was unsuccessful, it would be necessary to consider the matter further.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Obscuration of 6.   The Secretary of State for Air said that, after consulta-

Lighting. tion with the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and discussion

(Previous with the Commander-in-Chief, Fighter Command, it had been Eeference: decided to adopt two measures to assist movement at night, namely, W.M. (39), nth (#) some relaxation of restrictions on car lights, and (b) authorisa-Conclusions, tion of the use of torches by pedestrians. These two measures could Minute 8.)       be announced in the House of Commons that afternoon.

A scheme was also under consideration which would involve

modifications to restrictions on street lighting.   He would report

further on this scheme at a later date.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

German 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefs

Observance of of Staff Committee on German Observance of International Law International     (Paper No. W.P. (39) 23).

The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff&apos;s main (Previous conclusion was that, apart from the sinking of the A thenia without Reference: warning, and the attack on Poland without a declaration of war, W.M. (39), loth we were not warranted in saying that the German Armed Forces Conclusions, not 0bserVed the principles and rules of warfare at sea, on land,

Minute 4.)       or ^n      air.   There had, of course, been mistakes, and casualties among the civil population due to inaccurate bombing.

In discussion, it was explained that this report had been rendered in response to a request by the War Cabinet, and that there was, of course, no question of our making any public statement in the sense of the above conclusion reached by the Chiefs of Staff. In this connection, the First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that, although, in their submarine campaign, the Germans had, so far, shown a desire to provide for the safety of the crews of sunken ships, as soon as guns were mounted in our merchant ships, it was all too probable that our ships would be torpedoed without   warning.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the joint declaration which we and the French had published on the 3rd September had been expressed in somewhat general terms. The instructions which we had given to our Commanders were at once more precise and more restrictive, but these had not been communicated to Germany. He thought that it might be desirable that the terms of these instructions should be communicated to Germany. Unless this were done, we could not object to any action which the Germans took, unless that action fell outside the scope of the declaration which we and the French had published.

In discussion it was explained that, as a result of certain requests for information made to us and to the French by the Swedish Government, this question was to be further examined that afternoon by the Deputy Chiefs of Staff. It was agreed that a representative of the Foreign Office should be invited to attend this


104

Meeting, and that a Report should be made to the War Cabinet on the ensuing day.

The War Cabinet 

(i) took note of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff on German

observance of international law: (ii) deferred any further decision on this matter, pending the

submission of a Report from the Deputy Chiefs of Staff.

Staff Conversa- 8. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefs tlons with of Staff Committee on Staff Conversations with Turkey (Paper Turkey. No. W.P. (39) 24).

The War Cabinet agreed : 

that the Service Departments should authorise our local Commanders in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, or their representatives, to discuss with the Turkish authorities the points referred to in Paper No. W.P. (39) 24 and any other points which might arise.

Turkey. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that there

(Previous was now a good prospect of concluding the political side of the Reference: Franco-Anglo-Turkish Treaty negotiations. The Turks were no W.M. (39), 13th longer pressing for the amendment to Article 1 which might have Conclusions,      caused trouble with Italy.

Minute 9.) As regards Turkey&apos;s claims in the commercial and financial

sphere, no report had yet been received from our Ambassador in Ankara as to his conversation the previous day. He had been asked to submit an early report.

In discussion the view was expressed that our relations with Turkey would improve as soon as the ships containing munitions for Turkey, which were now in the Mediterranean, reached their destination. All possible steps should be taken to ensure the early arrival of the ships, and the date of arrival should be notified at once to our Ambassador. A Naval escort to the ships would probably have a good political effect.

In reply to a question, the Secretary of State undertook to enquire whether a similar consignment of munitions was on its way to Turkey from France.

The Foreign Secretary said that our Ambassador had again been asked whether he would welcome the arrival in Turkey of a political and military Mission from this country, but had replied that this would have too much of the appearance of running after the Turks. The Foreign Secretary said that he was disposed to&quot; accept the Ambassador&apos;s view, at any rate until the Anglo-Turkish Treaty had been safely signed. After the signature of the Treaty the position would be different, and the proposal to send a Mission could once more be examined on its merits.

The view was expressed that the Turks would be greatly flattered if Field-Marshal Lord Birdwood were the leader of a Mission of the kind proposed. They had already received a visit from General Weygand.

The War Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 11th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the latest telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome (No. 860) indicated that Signor Mussolini would hold the scales between war and peace as long as he could and dared. The Ambassador was now slightly less optimistic than before as to the outcome; he thought that German propaganda was probably gaining ground in Italy.

On the other hand, the Turkish Ambassador in London was of opinion that the Hungarian Government&apos;s refusal to allow German troops to pass through Ruthenia was a favourable indication as to the trend of Italian policy. Hungary would not have given such a reply except on Signor Mussolini&apos;s advice.

As regards the discussion of economic problems with Italy, the Secretary of State said that he had sent off the previous evening the telegrams to Sir Percy Loraine (Nos. 480 and 481), the despatch of which had been approved by the War Cabinet at the meeting noted in the margin.
