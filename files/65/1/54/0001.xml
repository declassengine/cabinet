W.M. 54 (39).

Air Operations.        1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that, apart from

(Previous intensive patrolling by units of the Coastal Command, there were

Reference: no air operations to report. W.M. (39) 52nd

Conclusions The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Minute 1.)

Visit of the 2.   The Secretary of State for Air said that he had found

Secretary of everyone in good spirits in the course of his visit to the Royal Air State for Air to Force in France. He had seen the French Minister for Air, who France. had given him particulars of their production of aircraft. Some

decline might be expected in October as a result of the withdrawal of men for the forces, and the hampering effect of blackout restrictions. The French were receiving aircraft from America, and had experienced no difficulty in coming to an arrangement with Italy for the supply of aircraft.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Naval Operations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that no events worthy of report had occurred in the previous 24 hours, though he had just received news that a British merchantman was being shelled by a submarine.

He had nothing to add, for the present, to his account of the sinking of the Royal Oak, as the enquiry was not yet concluded.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Military 4.   The Secretary of State for War said that one more German

Operations. Division had been identified in the Basle area. The French (Previous estimated the total number of German Divisions now as 130, and

Reference:        thought that this would rise to 160 by March.   The additional W.M. (39) 52nd 30 Divisions to be created could not be properly officered or Conclusions,      equipped by then, but the French were using the probable increase Minute 3.)        in strength of the German Army as an argument to press us to hasten the despatch of our forces to the theatre of war.  It would be undesirable to send Divisions overseas until they were properly equipped.   Nevertheless, we were keeping up a flow of units to France, and were ahead of the programme which we had communicated to the French before the war.

The First Lord of the Admiralty thought we should make every effort to get as large a force as possible into the line by the Spring, when decisive operations might be expected to start. It would be better to send troops over with a lower scale of equipment, than to leave the French with insufficient forces to withstand the weight of the whole German Army.

The Secretary of State for War said he was proposing to place before the War Cabinet, at an early date, a programme showing the dates on which the various contingents of the Army would be ready to take the field. He was awaiting further information from the Ministry of Supply.

There was some discussion whether a German offensive through the Low Countries was imminent.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff doubted whether such an offensive could be started so late in the year, but said that [20182] b 2


452

General Gamelin had consistently held the view that it might start up till the 10th November. Conditions on the front were already extremely bad, and cross-country movement would be much hampered.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Proposed Trade Agreement with Russia.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 9.)

5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in view of the successful negotiation of the Turkish Treaty and of our requirements for timber, he had been considering whether we could improve our relations with Russia by a Trade Agreement. He had consulted the Departments concerned, who thought that a barter deal might be arranged. He intended to circulate a paper to the War Cabinet forthwith.

If, after preliminary discussion, the prospects seemed promising, he suggested that the President of the Board of Trade should go to Moscow to sign the Agreement. Such an Agreement might arouse a good deal of criticism in this country, but would have considerable political value, more especially as we should be negotiating from strength and not from weakness.

One difficulty was the possibility that Russia might bring pressure to bear on Finland during the commercial negotiations. If this happened, we could, however, always close down the the negotiations.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that the Treasury should be brought into consultation at an early stage.

The Lord Privy Seal supported the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion, and stressed the importance of negotiating from strength. To this end, he favoured a show of force in the Middle East. If action was to be taken on the lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary, it should be done quickly.

The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.

Military 6.   In connection with Minute 5, discussion ensued as to

Assistance to whether the time was not ripe for a display of force in the Middle Turkey. East.

The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that our Naval strength in the Mediterranean might be used as a bargaining counter. Now that the Turkish Treaty was signed our ships would always be available to assist in Turkey&apos;s defence. For example, if Russia should make an assault on Turkey, &apos;we should be in a position to make any maritime aggression by the Soviet out of the question. On the invitation of the Turkish Government, our ships could advance into the Black Sea in force superior to that of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

If the Montreux Convention was found to stand in the way of Naval operations in the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmora would be a very practicable half-way house. There our ships could strike either into the Mediterranean or into the Black Sea. Failing this, Smyrna might become a British Naval Base.

Plans such as these could be mentioned to the Turkish Government in any further assurance of military support which we might desire to extend to them.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to considerations which indicated that any further military assurance

453

W.M. 54 (39).

(Previous Eeference: w.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 4.)

to Turkey on the lines suggested by the First Lord was premature: 

(i) Turkey&apos;s position to-day was that of a neutral. She was anxious to preserve that neutrality as long as she remained free from attack. She could not, as a neutral, invite our ships of war to enter the Black Sea, or to base themselves on the Sea of Marmora or on any of the ports of Asia Minor, (ii) We should naturally afford Turkey all the support in our power if she were attacked by the U.S.S.R. At present, however, there was no reason to suppose that such an attack was imminent. In spite of the break at Moscow, the Soviet authorities were loud in their protestations of friendship for Turkey.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence reminded the War Cabinet of the secret Military Convention which had been signed simultaneously with the Turkish Treaty. That Convention operated to limit our liabilities to Turkey to such action as was strictly within our power. So long as Italy was reckoned as potentially hostile, we could not give effective assistance to Turkey by land or by air. This position would naturally be altered if the suggested Mediterranean detente became an accomplished fact.

The Prime Minister thought that it was true to say that, so far as could be seen at present, Turkey had more to fear from Germany than from Russia. There was, of course, the possibility that these two countries might combine against her. However, it seemed unlikely that Germany in her present situation would initiate another Eastern campaign.

The Minister without Portfolio drew attention to the sinister character of the reports contained in certain recent telegrams from the British Minister in Bulgaria.

The War Cabinet: 

(a) Invited the Committee, consisting of 

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,

The Three Service Ministers,

The Minister without Portfolio and

The Three Chiefs of Staff,

(which had been appointed at the Meeting referred to in the margin) to consider the best methods by which this country could afford naval, military or air assistance to Turkey against aggression by Germany and/or the U.S.S.R., on the assumption that Italy is an assured neutral.

(b\ Authorised the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, as Chairman of the above Committee, to arrange at his discretion for a preliminary technical examination of the problem by the Chiefs of Staff.

Roumanian Oil 7. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a Supplies. paragraph in that day&apos;s Daily Telegraph dealing with the presence

(Previous in London of a Roumanian oil expert.

w m&quot;6?^) 22nd       -^-n accoun^  f the discussion of this matter has been placed on C nciusions      tbe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions. Minute 6.)

[20182]


Passage of Non- 8. The Prime Minister drew attention to a telegram of the German previous day (telegram No. 317 to Moscow) in which it was stated

Submarines that, according to reports which there was some reason to regard as through the Kiel reliable, 14 Soviet submarines had passed through the Kiel Canal Canal. to the North Sea on the night of the 12th October.

The War Cabinet were informed that certain Danish naval officers had been stated to have identified the submarines as Russian.

It was possible that these submarines might be on the way to Murmansk; in that event, however, the Kiel Canal would not be the shortest route. If the submarines were not going to North Russia, their entry into the North Sea might constitute a serious addition to our anxieties.

The War Cabinet took note of the above report.

Release from the Armed Forces of Key Men.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 37th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

9. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence covering a Report by the Chairman of the Man-Power Committee on the question of the release from the Armed Forces of key men in industry (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 20).

After the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had explained the Report, the main discussion centred On the one question in the Report on which the Committee had been unable to make an agreed recommendation, namely, the maximum period of suspension for Army Reservists.

The Secretary of State for Air expressed his concern as to aircraft production on account of the shortage of tradesmen already experienced. In the case of the Bristol Company, out of over 1,300 men who had been called up, only 50 had been returned to them from the comb-out. They might expect to lose many more men in due course.

The view generally taken, however, was that, having regard to the small size of our Regular Army, Regular Reservists were in a different position to tradesmen in the Territorial Army or in the Militia. The importance of reaching finality was emphasised, since otherwise the firms would not take steps to train substitutes.

The Prime Minister thought that the period of suspension for Army Reservists should not be more than three months, but that, in the case of men who by reason of their exceptional skill would be a serious loss to industry, there should be a right of appeal to the War Office.

In the course of discussion, the following other points were touched upon : 

(1) The Minister of Supply said that neither a period of

suspension of three months nor one of six months was of any value to his Ministry. He wished, however, to enter a caveat to the words &apos;&apos; final offer&apos;&apos; in Conclusion (v) of the Report. It might well be that key men in industry would be found in the Army, and he desired to reserve the right to bring to the notice of the War Cabinet cases where he considered that firms should receive special consideration.

(2) The Minister of Supply referred to a particular firm

engaged on munitions production, the whole of whose labour force consisted of young men specially trained and liable to be called up for military service. Such a firm would be crippled unless special treatment was accorded to it.


455

W.M. 54 (39).

The War Cabinet 

(i) Approved  the  Report  submitted  by the Man-Power

Committee.

(ii) Agreed that the period of suspension for Army Reservists

should be three months and this should be regarded as a maximum, subject to the proviso that there should be a right of appeal to the War Office in regard to men who by reason of their special skill would be a serious loss to industry.

Restriction of Imports from the United States of America and Canada. (Previous References: W.M. (39) 21st Conclusions, Minute 19, and W.M. (39) 24th Conclusions, Minute 18.)

10. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer dealing with various matters connected with the difficulty of obtaining both United States and Canadian dollar exchange (W.P. (G.) (39) 45).

The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained the position in regard to: 

(a) the repayment by Canada of her largest outstanding sterling loan in this country;

(b) the extent of our unfavourable balance with Canada in the first year of war;

(c) proposals made to Canada that we should pay for our purchases by putting sterling to the credit of the Bank of Canada in London;

(d) the position in regard to placing orders for wheat with

Canada.

No decision was required from the War Cabinet on these matters.

A decision was, however, urgently required in regard to imports of apples.   The Chancellor proposed : 

(i) that we should invite the Canadian Government&apos;s acceptance of a reduction by (say) 50 per cent, of the imports of apples and pears from Canada during the remainder of the present season, in comparison with the same period of the preceding season; (ii) that we should entirely prohibit the import of apples from the United States of America during the remainder of the present season.

Attached to the Chancellor&apos;s Memorandum was a draft aide-memoire, which it was proposed should be handed to the American Ambassador by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade. This aide-memoire explained the action proposed as regards United States apples, pears and tobacco, but not as regards Canadian apples.

The following points were made in discussion of the above proposals : 

(1) During the forthcoming visit of a Canadian Minister to

London, the interests of the Canadian prairie provinces would be brought prominently before our notice.

(2) It would be very difficult to conceal from the American

Government the line which we proposed to take as regards Canadian apples. At a recent discussion between the American Ambassador, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade on the subject of the admission of American films, the Ambassador had shown that he could be very unbending on commercial matters.


456

(3) The Minister of Food reported his recent difficulties in

dealing with the United States lard exporters. The latter had arbitrarily raised their price from 6 cents to 8 cents a lb. Owing to our refusal to buy at this price, they had been compelled to come down to 7 cents a lb. But he had no large programme of purchases in the United States.

(4) Considerable ill-feeling against the British Government on

the part of those sections of the United States community interested in apples, tobacco, lard and films appeared to be inevitable. Pressure might be expected for the denouncement of the Anglo-American Trade Agreement.

(5) It would be most unfortunate if ill-feeling should be aroused

before President Roosevelt had secured the modification of the United States neutrality legislation. This seemed to point to some delay being desirable before further action on our part. On the other hand, if we delayed much longer, the normal annual importation of United, States apples into this country would have been completed.

(6) It was suggested that a preliminary approach to the

American Ambassador was required before any document of the character of the draft annexed to W.P. (G.) (39) 45 was handed to him. The preliminary approach might consist of ah aide-memoire explaining our difficulties in the matter of foreign exchange, and inquiring whether the Washington Government could suggest any methods of getting round those difficulties.

The Cabinet agreed : 

(a) to leave to the discretion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer

the method to be adopted in intimating to the United States Government that we proposed to prohibit the entry of their apples and pears during the remainder of the present season :

(b) that no intimation should be sent to Canada regarding the

proposed restriction of the imports of Canadian apples and pears, until a decision had been reached concerning the imports of United States apples and pears :

(c) to invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer to bear in mind,

in relation to all proposals for the restriction of United States imports into this country, the great importance of not prejudicing the passing of the legislation to amend the United States Neutrality Act.

The Urgent H.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by

Freight Require- the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the need for chartering neutral mentsofthe     tonnage (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 48).

and*thT fF00&lt;* ^he Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that as a result Chartering of  ^ discussion with the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Nentral Ministers of Food and Shipping the data for coming to a decision

Tonnage *n regard to the freight requirements for cereals for the Ministry

(Previous  ^ Food were clearer.

Reference- ^n normal circumstances 500,000 tons of wheat, and 300,000

WM (39) 52nd *ons  ^  ^ner cereals were imported monthly, giving a freightage Conclusions requirement at the rate of 800,000 tons a month. Taking into Minute 10.) account arrivals since the outbreak of war and freightage already secured, the deficiency to be provided against between the present date and the 30th November was roughly 400,000 tons, and including December the total shortage was about 850,000 tons. These figures did not allow for sinkings en route or losses due to air attack. It


457

W.M. 54 (39).

seemed better to take the figures as they stood, bearing in mind the possibility of such losses. Clearly we must look to neutral tonnage to supply this deficiency.

As far as the existing negotiations were concerned, unless a prompt bargain were made with the Norwegians, freight rates might rise further. On the other hand &quot; panic &quot; prices might set a standard which would endure for the war. The Foreign Office had already instructed the British Minister in Athens to bring pressure on the Greek Government to accelerate our negotiations with them.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he regarded the situation with great concern, that it was clear that at least one million tons of freight would be required before the end of the year, and that strong pressure should be brought on the Norwegians and particularly on the Greeks, who were under obligations to us.

The Minister of Shipping said that it was not possible to give close figures, but on a rough estimation the Norwegians had (apart from one-and-a-half million tons of tanker tonnage) one million tons of ordinary tonnage. The Greek ordinary tonnage was probably not much less than the Norwegian. The Norwegian negotiators were due to arrive on the 24th instant. The question of cereals did not stand by itself, and he was anxious that other Departments with urgent needs for freight, e.g., of ore, should inform the Ministry as soon as possible. Up to the 18th October, 48 ships had been sent to the St. Lawrence, mostly for grain, but some for timber, and up to the same date 69 ships had been sent to the River Plate for grain. It might turn out that the situation would be relieved when the cargoes from these ships began to arrive. Further, there had been 103 ships in Contraband Bases for eight days, as well as an unspecified number in ports. Some of these represented neutral tonnage which we required, and it constituted a source of complaint to the neutrals, which we wanted to avoid if we were to drive a favourable bargain. It appeared that Contraband Bases required further staff. He called attention to the possible danger of being rushed into charters with a small number of vessels at a high price, as this might affect prices generally.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that, in view of the urgent necessity of importing by the

end of December at least 850,000 tons of cereals (over and above cereals for which freightage has been arranged), it was essential that the present negotiations for the chartering of neutral tonnage should be strongly pressed :

(b) that, although it was important not to arrange charters

at prices which might set too high a standard for future charters throughout the war, the Minister of Shipping should endeavour to conclude an arrangement with the Norwegians as soon as possible after their arrival next week, even at some increase in the price already contemplated:

(c) to invite the Minister of Shipping to confer with the

Minister of Economic Warfare as to what measures could be taken to expedite the examination of vessels at Contraband Bases, and to report the action taken to* the War Cabinet:

(d) that Departments requiring imports in the near future

should communicate particulars at an early date to the Ministry of Shipping, so as to enable the general requirements for freight to be co-ordinated.


458

Visit of Dominion Ministers to London.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 17th Conclusions, Minute 8.)

12. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 41) setting out the arrangements proposed for the forthcoming visit of Dominion Ministers to London.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs explained that it was not proposed that these visits of Dominion Ministers should be converted into a formal conference. At the same time, it was desirable to give them a picture of our war effort and to discuss the co-ordination of the Dominion programmes with our own plans. Arrangements were being made for them to visit special fields of activity in this country. It was also proposed that they should visit General Gort.

The Minister without Portfolio suggested that arrangements might be made for the Dominion Ministers to be received by M. Daladier and General Gamelin.

The War Cabinet 

(a) Approved the proposed arrangements for the forthcoming

visit of Dominion Ministers to London.

(b) Requested the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to

make enquiries regarding the possibility of the Dominion Ministers being received by M. Daladier and General Gamelin during their visit to France.

South Afrloa. 13.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by

High the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (G.) (39) 43) on

Commission the question of the transfer of the High Commission Territories in Territories. South Africa to the Government of the Union, to which were annexed telegrams Nos. 123 and 124 from the High Commissioner for the Territories, setting out recent approaches on the matter by the Union Government, and telegram No. 144 sent by the Secretary of State in reply on the 18th October. It was necessary to bring the question before the War Cabinet because Colonel Reitz, Minister for Native Affairs in the Union Government, would shortly be visiting London and would wish to discuss the matter.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had very much hoped that General Smuts would not find it necessary to raise this question at the present moment, but as it had been raised he had thought it necessary to take the rather stiff line indicated in his telegram No. 144.

The War Cabinet agreed 

That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, in discussing with Colonel Reitz the question of the transfer of the High Commission Territories to the Government of the Union of South Africa, should follow the general line indicated in telegram No. 144 to the High Commissioner.
