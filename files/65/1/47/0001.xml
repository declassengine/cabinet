(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 46th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that, apart from a reconnaissance which had been carried out by aircraft from France over the Ruhr, there were no particular operations to report.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet that H.M.S. Royal Oak, a battleship of the &quot; R &quot; class, had been sunk between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. that morning. She was moored in Scapa Flow at the time, and it was believed that she had been attacked by a submarine which, by some unknown means, had penetrated the defences. There was a report that two men in the gateship of the anti-submarine boom had heard a propeller the night before. They had reported the fact, but investigation had not revealed anything to arouse suspicions.

The first sign of attack Avas an explosion forward, which at first was thought to have been the result of some internal cause. About 20 minutes later there were other explosions, and the ship sank. Admiral Blagrove, and about 800 officers and men were believed to have been drowned.

All ships in the Flow had immediately been ordered to raise steam, and put to sea. This operation had been safely executed, and search was now being made for the submarine which it was thought might have been unable to make its way out of the Flow.

The loss of this ship, though an extremely regrettable disaster, did not materially affect the general naval position.

The enemy&apos;s submarine campaign against our shipping had been intensified, and two British merchant ships and one French had been torpedoed. In addition, the Stonepool had sustained a running fight for five hours with a submarine, and, though damaged, had made a successful escape. Most of these attacks had taken place just after the dispersal of convoys, and orders had now been issued for convoys to remain together for 48 hours longer.

Our attacks on U-boats had met with three successes. As reported the previous day, one submarine had struck a mine in the Dover barrage. A second had been sunk by H.M.S. A fridi, off Beachy Head. A third had been sunk by H.M.S. Imogen, while she was escorting the Stonepool, and the Officer Commanding and 16 survivors had been picked up. Of these submarines, two were of the very latest type. It was hoped to send divers down to the one off Beachy Head, which lay in only 14 fathoms.

The Polish submarine Orzel had succeeded in escaping from the Baltic, and had arrived in the Forth.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

3. The Secretary of State for War said that the centre of gravity of the enemy&apos;s concentration appeared to be in the Trier  Saarbriicken area. Thirteen bridges had now been built over the Saar. The number of Divisions identified on the Western front remained at 80.

During the move of the 1st contingent of the Field Force from ports of disembarkation to their forward concentration areas, a distance of 500 miles, only 37 first-line vehicles had broken down, and of these 16 were motor-bicycles. This indicated a very satisfactory standard of maintenance in the Army.

In reply to an enquiry by the Prime Minister, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that an attack appeared to be imminent. It might even start as early as the following day.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

4. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, in accordance with the War Cabinet Conclusion referred to the margin, a Meeting had been held to consider the employment of our Air Force in the event of certain courses of action being taken by Germany.

A note of the discussion and of the decisions reached is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

Belgium. 5.   The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet particulars

(Previous regarding a conversation which he had had the previous day with

Reference: the Belgian Ambassador regarding the attitude of the Belgian W.M. (39) 46th Government on the question of their neutrality. Details of the Conclusions, information so furnished are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard Minute 6.)       File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

W.M. (39) 46th With reference to the discussion of the War Cabinet at the Conclusions, Meeting noted in the margin, the Prime Minister said that he had Minute 7. explained to the Belgian Ambassador the action which we proposed to take with our Air Force in the event of a German invasion of Belgium, and of the consequences which might arise from it. This information came as no surprise to the Belgian Ambassador, and he had raised no objection to it on the grounds of possible casualties among the civil population.

The War Cabinet took note of the information communicated in the discussion referred to above.

Diversion of Shipping from Bast Coast Ports.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 44th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Transport (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 35) in which an account was given of the manner in which his Department had carried out, since the 1st September, the policy for the diversion of shipping from East Coast to West Coast ports agreed upon by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their meetings on the 20th April (C.I.D. 353rd Meeting) and the 29th May (C.I.D. 363rd Meeting).

In the course of a statement explanatory of his Memorandum, the Minister of Transport drew attention to the following aspects of the situation : 

(i) The average daily number of ships in foreign trade arriving at

East Coast and West Coast ports respectively in normat times.

East Coast, 65 ships (62,000 tons net).

West Coast, 78 ships (98,000 tons net).

Owing, however, to the number of big ships arriving at London, the East Coast accounted for slightly more than half of the 90 million tons of merchandise imported annually.

(ii) A rrivals of ships in the first month of war.

For a number of reasons, e.g.. the closing of the Mediterranean and the preliminary delays in forming convoys, there had been, during September 1939, a falling away in the number of arrivals on the East Coast and to a lesser extent on the West Coast. The following comparison with September 1938 illustrated what had resulted from diversion and the drop in arrivals :

W.M. 47 (39)

While no serious difficulty had been experienced in accommodating diverted ships in West Coast ports, the scheme had not really been tested.

(iii) Expenditure on port improvements under the Civil Defence

This was in respect of measures to secure due functioning of ports and the provision of additional facilities. Major port improvements would take so long to complete that they could not be taken into account for present purposes.

(iv) Dock Labour.

One of the most satisfactory features of the situation was that the Minister of Labour had been able to make full arrangements for dock labour to be transferred from East to West on a large scale, if this should be required.

The Minister stated that the Admiralty had the previous day given instructions for full diversion to the West Coast. This meant that, of the larger British vessels coming in, only a few refrigerated ships bound for London would be allowed to put in on the East Coast. We had no power to order diversion in the case of neutral shipping. In consequence, it was now expected that the West Coast ports would be filled up with normal arrivals and diverted ships before the end of October.

The Minister said that the conclusion which he drew from the first month&apos;s experience of war conditions was that, while considerable diversion had been built up as an ad hoc measure, no continuous diversion of a large portion of East Coast shipping was practicable over a long period without serious congestion and dislocation of trade and industry. We should be under the necessity of reverting to the use of the East Coast ports as soon as it became possible to do so.

The following points were made in the course of discussion : 

(1) The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Staff were

most anxious that the process of diversion to the West Coast should be carried further as soon as possible.

(2) The Prime Minister raised the question whether there were

not facilities in the port of Liverpool which had not been fully utilised in recent years owing to the diversion of trade to Southampton, which could again be brought into service.

(3) Emphasis was laid on the various devices which might be

adopted for unloading large ships at West Coast ports, e.g., by an increased use of lighterage, or by floating jetties or other similar devices.

(4) It was explained that it was difficult to divert the chilled

and frozen meat trade from London to the West Coast       owing to the shortage of refrigerated trains.

The War Cabinet 

(i) took note of the Minister of Transport&apos;s Memorandum; (ii) invited the Departments concerned to investigate the possibilities of increasing the facilities for unloading ships at West Coast ports by an increased use of lighterage or similar devices.

Negotiations with the Turkish Mission under General Orbay.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 5.)

7. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence made a report to the War Cabinet on the negotiations with General Orbay&apos;s Mission, the chief points of which were as follows : 

The later stages of the negotiations had been conducted with marked cordiality due to the tact shown by General Marshall-Cornwall, the help afforded by the three Fighting Services, and, finally, to the deep impression made on General Orbay at his being received by His Majesty the King. General Orbay had expressed himself as much impressed by our action in actually giving Turkey certain arms before the Treaty had been signed. He was deeply touched by this gesture, by which we had treated Turkey as an ally in advance of the Treaty. It had been possible to supply a large quantity of material selected from the general list submitted by General Orbay, though at a certain sacrifice to ourselves. There were, however, three important items asked for with which neither the French nor ourselves had been able to give assistance : -

Anti-tank guns,

Bofors guns,

An oil tanker.

The Turks felt also that the rate of delivery of 3-7-inch A.A. guns proposed was very slow.

As regards anti-tank guns, the possibility of Turkey obtaining her requirements from Spain was being examined.

The position as regards Bofors guns was not altogether clear, but it would seem that, of the 250 which we had originally ordered from Bofors, 162 were to be manufactured in Sweden, and, of these, between 40 and 50 were now ready for delivery; the Swedish Government had refused to permit the export of these guns to us and had , proposed that they should be sold to Finland. General Orbay had raised the question whether it would be possible for

HSweden to permit some of these guns to be diverted to Turkey, and he had arranged that day to see M. Prytz, the Swedish Minister in London, to ascertain whether the Swedish Government would agree to the Turkish Government taking over our contract. He was also telegraphing to Ankara for instructions from his Government. He (the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence) had suggested that, if an arrangement on these lines were made, the Swedish Government should receive payment for these guns (about  650,000) from the  15 millions gold loan which we had promised to make to Turkey. General Orbay . had doubted whether his Government would agree to this course, but had undertaken to put the question to them.

If the Turkish Government, while wanting the guns, refused nevertheless to finance their purchase in this Way, it might be a matter for consideration whether we should ourselves find the sum involved, provided that the Swedish Government allowed the export of these guns to our ally Turkey. If the guns had been in this country already, and we had been willing to supply them to Turkey, they would have been financed from our export credit to Turkey.

The Minister without Portfolio enquired whether it would be possible for an arrangement to be made whereby the guns were supplied by Sweden to Turkey on a private understanding with the latter that some of these guns would then be lent to us. Again, even if the Turkish Government were not prepared to defray the whole cost from our gold loan, they might be willing to defray part.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it might be unwise at a later stage to refuse altogether to consider the possibility of providing the additional sum of  650,000, if General Orbay were to renew his request, but this would need to be judged


389

W.M. 47 (39).

in the light of the progress of the Turco-Soviet negotiations. A telegram No. 596 dated the 13th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, on the subject of Turkish trade, which was now being examined by the Ministry of Economic Warfare in conjunction with other Government Departments concerned, suggested that it might be desirable for us to devise some barter scheme on the German model.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would not object to the purchase by Turkey of the Bofors guns being financed from the gold loan, although under the Treaty as it stood that loan would, under the Suspense Clause, not strictly be available until the Treaty came into full operation. He would, however, feel a very great reluctance to part with the sum of  650,000 in gold or the equivalent in addition to the gold loan. He would arrange for the possibility of a barter scheme to be examined in the Treasury.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that he would make a further report to the War Cabinet on the 16th or 17th October, 1939, by which time General Orbay should be in possession of instructions from his Government.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

Turkey.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 46th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was still without news as to the progress of the discussions in regard to the proposed Turco-Soviet pact between MM. Stalin and Molotov and M. Sarajoglu, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. This was not surprising, since these discussions were only resumed at a meeting held the previous day and would probably not be completed at a single session. The following day was the earliest time when a report might be expected.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Germany. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was

(Previous        not in a position to make any definite report to the War Cabinet Reference:       regarding the reception in Germany of the Prime Minister&apos;s speech. W.M. (39) 46th        A discussion then took place regarding the probable next move Conclusions,      of the German Government.   The general feeling was that at the Minute 3.)       present time the German Government were probably considering what statement themselves to issue to the German people. Herr Hitler was confronted with the dilemma that, if he were not to take the offensive in the West, he ran the risk of severe loss of morale, while if he were to attack the Maginot Line, he would be takinsr a gamble which might lead to his destruction.

Denmark. 10.   The Minister without Portfolio drew attention to a Press

Landing of report that the four German airmen whose aircraft had been shot

German airmen down over the North Sea at the beginning of the week had now been

shot down at landed at Rudkoebing on the Danish island of Langeland; and

sea. that, in view of the fact that they had been picked up outside terri-

(Previous torial waters, they hoped that they would be permitted to return to

Reference: Germany instead of being interned.    He suggested that our

W.M. (39) 41st Minister in Copenhagen should be asked to ascertain the facts from

Conclusions, the Danish Government, since it was to our interests that these men

Minute l.) should be interned.


390

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that these German airmen would have been picked up by the destroyers which had been sent out for the purpose, if it had not been necessary to divert these vessels to take part in the action in the North Sea which followed immediately afterwards.

The War Cabinet agreed 

that, unless the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs were advised that there was substance in the claim that these airmen should not be interned in view of the fact that they had been picked up outside Danish territorial waters, he should send a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Copenhagen, asking him to inform the Danish Government that we should regard the grant of permission to these men to return to Germany as inconsistent with Danish^ neutrality.

Norway.

Chartering of tonnage. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 38th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to Telegram No. 231, dated the 13th October, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Oslo, which gave good ground for hoping that a satisfactory agreement would shortly be reached for the chartering of Norwegian tonnage. The firm language which he had used at his recent interview with M. Colban, the Norwegian Minister, seemed to have had a good effect.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

India and the War.

Proposed Statement by the Viceroy. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 34th Conclusions, Minute 16.)

12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 32), to which was annexed a telegram from the Viceroy, conveying the text of a draft statement to be made by him as to the intentions and aims of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to India.

The Secretary of State for India said that the statement involved only two commitments, both of them previously authorised by the War Cabinet, namely, that a consultative body should be set up for consultation by the Government of India on issues concerned with the war, and that the British Government would be ready to consider changes in the Federal provisions of the Act of 1935 at the end of the war, if at that time there was sufficient agreement in India to justify this course of action. In the Viceroy&apos;s opinion the statement would not satisfy the Left Wing of the Congress, and the Right Wing would probably, out of fear of the Left, be unwilling to agree to co-operate with the Government. Itvwould, however, be welcomed by considerable political sections in- India. In this country, the Secretary of State had been approached by several members of the Opposition Parties. They had suggested that we should go further to meet the views of Congress, but they did not appear to appreciate the practical difficulties of this course. He could only conclude that the proposed statement would be attacked by the Labour Opposition and by some of the Liberals. We had also to face the possibility of a critical propaganda campaign in the United States and elsewhere, but this could not be avoided.

In discussion it was generally agreed that there was no reason to question the offers made in the proposed statement, and that it was desirable to take an encouraging view of the possibilities of constitutional progress after the war, provided always that this was justified by conditions at the time. On the other hand, the view was generally expressed that the statement was colourless and in places somewhat confused, and that it contained a number of rather general phrases. It was suggested that, since we should undoubtedly


391

W.M. 47 (39).

have to give further consideration to the Federal provisions of the Act after the war, we might as well say so now. While it was agreed that the drafting must be left to the Viceroy, the Secretary of State for India was asked to convey to him certain criticisms, and to invite him to modify the statement accordingly.

It was suggested that he should in particular be asked to give more consideration to the fact that the statement would be widely read, not only in India, but also in the world at large; and also to bear in mind the special risk that Indian readers might seize on loosely worded offers to form the basis of precise claims hereafter.

Special attention was drawn to the following points : 

Page 2, last sentence. India could not properly be described as &quot;a great nation with a long and independent tradition of its own &quot; and some other phrase which would appeal to Indian sentiment might be substituted.

Pages 3 and 4. These passages might be further considered in the light of the Prime Minister&apos;s statements of British policy, more particularly his statement in the House of Commons on the 12th October. It was undesirable to attempt to restate our policy in different terms. Was it necessary to say that it was difficult to define the objectives before His Majesty&apos;s Government? (Page 3, line 22.) Again, the passage in the middle of page 4 (starting &quot; We are fighting to safeguard ....&quot;) by its very elaboration obscured the real point, namely, that Great Britain was fighting to defend herself and the smaller countries of Europe and at the same time other countries (including India) against aggression.

Page 9, line 19. Reference should be made to &quot; India&apos;s due place amongst the Dominions&quot; the phrase which had been used in the past in this connection.

Page 12, end of the first paragraph. The last three lines, including the reference to the Committee of Imperial Defence, should be omitted as liable to lead to wrong inferences and claims.

Page 12, last line but two. The suggestion of selection &quot;by rotation or otherwise&quot; had better be omitted from the statement.

The War Cabinet accordingly agreed :  (i) to ask the Secretary of State for India to convey to the

Viceroy the points raised in the course of the discussion,

and to invite him to modify the draft accordingly; (ii) subject to these modifications, to authorise the Secretary

of State for India to inform the Viceroy that he was free

to issue the statement as proposed in the Memorandum

(W.P. (G.) (39)32); (iii) to approve the issue of the statement, as modified, as a

White Paper on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 17th

October, 1939.

Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1, October 14, 1939.
