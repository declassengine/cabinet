(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 39th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet that a day reconnaissance over North-West Germany had been undertaken the previous day, but that, owing to cloud, the results had been negative. Anti-aircraft fire of considerable accuracy had been encountered. A reconnaissance in the same area had been carried out the previous night but the results were not yet known. All the aircraft concerned had returned safely. Coastal command aircraft had been carrying out the usual patrols and other duties. The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Meeting between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the Chief of the Air Staff and General Gamelin. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 35th Conclusions, Minute: 4.) ;

2. The First Lord of the A dmiralty informed the War Cabinet that His Majesty the King had visited the Fleet on the previous day.

Seven armoured merchant cruisers had arrived at Scapa and would be of the greatest assistance in the maintenance of the patrol from the North of Scotland to Iceland. More of these vessels were being prepared and it was hoped to have another fifty by the end of October.

The steamship Lochgoil had struck a mine in the Bristol Channel. The mine-field had been previously discovered, but owing to some error the routeing of the ship had not been changed. The vessel was in tow, making for harbour. There was some reason to believe that the mines used were magnetic. The steps being taken to counter this type of mine, and also to develop it for our own use, were described.

It was now practically certain that the raider which had attacked the steamship Clement was the A dmiral Scheer. Several days had elapsed without news of further losses in this area, but it was just possible that the raider was preventing ships from using their wireless, taking the crews into captivity, and thus preventing any news of action coming through. Ships had been warned to send out an S.O.S. immediately on the approach of any aircraft. Rumours from South America of the movements of the Admiral Scheer were so far unconfirmed. The First Lord described the dispositions made by ourselves and the French to deal with this threat to the Atlantic trade routes.

A request had been received from the Air Ministry that in view of the danger of air attack on the East Coast convoys, traffic should be diverted as far as possible to the West Coast ports. The Admiralty would see what could be done to meet this request. The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

3. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet that one more German division had been identified on the Western Front. The General Staff estimated the total number now on that front to be between 53 and 64.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

4. The Chief of the Air Staff^ gave to the War Cabinet a full description of the discussion which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and himself had held with General Gamelin on the previous day. Details of this are contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

 The War Cabinet:  (i) Authorised, the Chief of the Air Staff to despatch two fighter squadrons from the Fighter Command to France if the situation demanded, at his discretion, without further reference to the Cabinet, (ii) Agreed that the French Authorities should be informed of this decision; ::&lt;

6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Committee (Paper W.P. (39) 72) making recommendations as to the action to be taken by various Departments to ensure that valuable resources in Holland and Belgium should not fall into the hands of the enemy.

A copy of the record of the discussion and of the Conclusions, reached is included in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

Herr Hitler&apos;s Speech to the Reichstag, 6th October, 1939. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 39th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to the statement which had been broadcast on the previous evening and had appeared in the morning&apos;s newspapers, and which had been described as &quot; Issued on the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; This statement had gone rather further than the general guidance authorised by the War Cabinet, but the Minister of Information had persuaded him that something on these lines was necessary.

The Foreign Secretary thought that there could be no two opinions as to the unsatisfactory nature of the speech itself. Nevertheless, time was required for consideration of the form of the reply, as stated in the Government communique. It would also be necessary to consult with the Dominions and the French Government. He thought it would also be desirable to consult with the United States Government.

The Foreign Secretary then outlined his own provisional views as to the line which the reply should take.

At the outset he would like (provided that this did not create an impression that we were making an appearance of entering into negotiations) to mention some of the obscurities, contradictions and difficulties in the speech. In this opening section he would also refer to Poland, Czecho-Slovakia and disarmament. It was for the German Government, not for us, to elucidate these obscurities.

Next, he would point out that the real difficulty lay not in these obscurities, but in the fact that no reliance could be placed on the word of the present German Government.

The Foreign Secretary said that in his own mind he was coming more and more to the view that his chief war aim was the elimination of Herr Hitler. It was not, however, politic to say so, since a statement of that kind would have the effect of uniting the German people behind Herr Hitler. We should therefore take the view that it was for the German Government to say how this difficulty could be overcome.

He would like to end up on the note indicated in the Prime. Minister&apos;s speech on the 3rd September, that we desired no vindictive peace. He would like to add. as proof of our intentions, that when peace came we should wish to see associated with the peace negotiations any Great Power Which remained neutral.

The following points were made in the course of discussion :--

(i) There was no doubt that a public reply would have to be delivered to Herr Hitler, after due consultation with


331

W.M. 40 (39).

the Dominions and with France. This was a matter in which we must take the lead, (ii) It would be most undesirable that the French Government should publish any reply to Herr Hitler before we had made our statement, &apos;iii) The statement must be worthy of the occasion. It should be rather full, and should contain the necessary historical background. It would require careful drafting, and could not be delivered before Wednesday, the 11th October, at the earliest.

(iv) It was contemplated that the statement would be made by

the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, and that it should be followed the same evening by a broadcast address to the country by the Prime Minister.

(v) What was required was a statement ending on a note of

enquiry rather than on a direct rejection. Herr Hitler should be left with the choice between answering our questions or starting war in earnest in the West.

(vi) There was evidence in letters which had been received by

the Prime Minister and other Ministers that a small section of opinion in this country held pacifist views. It might have been expected that this section of opinion would have been attracted by some of Herr Hitler&apos;s more specious proposals, but so far there was no sign of this. Herr Hitler&apos;s speech had had &quot; a bad Press &quot; not only here, but also in neutral countries.

(vii) Attention was called to the passage in Herr Hitler&apos;s speech

which seemed to contemplate that his proposed European I settlement would be accompanied by an international guarantee. This was, perhaps, some recognition on Herr Hitler&apos;s part of the fact that his own word was no longer believed.

The War Cabinet agreed: 

(a) that a considered reply to Herr Hitler&apos;s speech should be

delivered by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, probably on Wednesday, the 11th October, 1939, to be followed later in the same evening by a broadcast address by the Prime Minister:

(b) to invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to

prepare the first draft of the statement, which should be circulated for consideration at the Meeting of the War Cabinet to be held on Monday, the 9th October, at 11-30 a.m. :

(c) to authorise the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to

convey forthwith to the Dominion Governments an appreciation on broad lines of the preliminary view taken by the War Cabinet of Herr Hitler&apos;s speech:

(d) that after the Meeting of the War Cabinet on the 9th

October the Dominion Governments and the French Government should be consulted as to the terms of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement:

(e) to invite the Foreign Secretary to take steps to ensure that

the French Government did not issue a reply to Herr Hitler&apos;s speech without first communicating with us : (/) that, pending the Prime Minister&apos;s statement, the Ministry of Information should add nothing of substance to the communique already issued. During the next few days the Press might devote as much space as possible to reporting neutral comments on Herr Hitler&apos;s speech.
