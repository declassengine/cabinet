Minute 5.)

(i) invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to arrange

for the immediate return to this country of our Ambassador in Brussels, in order that he should be acquainted with the strategical reasons which, in our view, made it essential that there should be immediate Staff Conversations between this country and Belgium;

Appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff. (Previous Eef erences: W.M. (39) 15th Conclusions, Minute 16, and 16th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

General agreement with the conclusions reached therein was expressed.

Some discussion took place on the possibility of the allies taking the offensive against Germany, a summary of which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Minutes.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) to approve the Appreciation :

(2) to authorise the Dominions Office and India Office to send

copies of the Paper to Dominion Premiers (excluding Eire) and the Viceroy of India respectively, for their personal information.

Chartering of 9.   The President of the Board of Trade informed the War

Merchant Cabinet that he had concentrated on the two countries of major

Shipping from importance in this matter, namely, Norway and Greece. It was Abroad. essential to obtain tonnage on a large scale from both these countries.

An agent of the Norwegian Government was on his way, and would be in London in the next day or two. We had suggested to the Norwegian Government that they should give this agent full powers to conclude a chartering agreement.

It was known that an emissary from the German Government had visited Norway last week, but it was believed that he had made little impression on the Norwegian Government.

The President said that he was attempting a general settlement to deal with Greek shipping as a whole. If a settlement of this kind could not be reached, he would attempt to enter into agreements in London with three of the leading men in the Greek shipping trade.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

W.M. 20 (39).

 Construction of 10. The President of the Board of Trade informed the War New Merchant Cabinet that the Treasury had authorised a scheme for the construc-Shipplng. tion of 100,000 tons of merchant shipping.   The orders were now

being placed.

He proposed to bring before the War Cabinet on the following day a scheme for the construction of a further 200,000 tons of merchant shipping.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

German Imports n. The First Lord of the A dmiralty drew the attention of the  of Iron Ore from War Cabinet to the large imports of iron ore which Germany Sweden. imported from Sweden and which were vital for the German

munitions industry. In the summer the imports could reach Germany by way of the Gulf of Bothnia. In winter the Gulf was closed by ice, and the trade went from Narvik along the whole length of the Norwegian coast, from north to south. The ships protected themselves against interference from the British Navy by keeping within the three-mile limit.

Our policy must be to stop this trade going to Germany, and at the same time to provide it with an alternative market. The First Lord warned the War Cabinet that, if the desired result could not be attained by pressure on the Norwegian Government, he would be compelled to propose the remedy which had been adopted in the last war, namely, the laying of mines inside Norwegian territorial waters, which had driven the ore-carrying vessels outside the three-mile limit. This measure, however, had not been adopted until after the United States had come into the war.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey. 12.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to tele-

(Previous        gram Na 468 dated the 18th September, 1939, received from His Reference:       Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador,  Ankara,   reporting  that  the Turkish W.M. (39) 19th Minister for Foreign Affairs was proceeding to Moscow, and asking  Conclusions,      for our views on the situation created by the Soviet invasion of Mmute 13.)      Poland.   He (the Secretary of State) had approved the despatch of a reply asking the Ambassador to inform the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that we hoped that Turkey would sign her treaty with Great Britain before he left for Moscow, since this, we thought, would strengthen his hand in his discussions with the Soviet Government.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Italy.

General Attitude.

&apos;Commercial  Contacts. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 14th Conclusions, Minute 10.)

13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the War Cabinet a most secret personal letter which he had received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, reporting an interview with Count Ciano. The general impression gained by Sir Percy Loraine in this interview was definitely encouraging, but in his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) opinion it would be wrong to exclude the possibility that Italy was doing everything to deceive us as to her attitude.

The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegram No. 905 dated the 17th September, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, on the subject of the proposed establishment of commercial contacts with Italy. From this it appeared that the Italian Government would not welcome the despatch of a special mission to Rome, but saw no objection to experts from this country being attached to the British Embassy in Rome for this purpose. In the same statement the Ambassador had raised certain questions relating to the proposed rationing of Italian trade, which had since been referred by the Foreign Office to the Ministry of Economic Warfare for consideration.

Reference was made to the large scale movement by Italy of troops to Libya. This might mean that Italy was preparing an attack against Egypt or Tunisia. On the other hand, it might merely be a precautionary measure, since Italy was unable to foresee the future. The latter explanation was supported to some extent by the fact that there appeared to be no military activity in Italy herself.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he was considering whether it would be wise to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, to raise this question with Count Ciano.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Italian

Military Preparations in Libya.

Attitude of the 14. The Prime Minister said that he had had an interview United States of the previous day with Mr. Kennedy, the American Ambassador, America. who, in general, had taken a most gloomy view of the situation. In

particular, he had said that he did not believe that Congress would agree to modify the neutrality legislation (although the President took the opposite view). The Ambassador thought the action of the U.S.S.R. would throw public opinion in the United States into the arms of the isolationists. The Prime Minister had not accepted any of the arguments put forward by Mr. Kennedy, and had, on the contrary, explained that nothing had happened which we had not anticipated, and had stressed the great resources and many advantages which we possessed against Germany. He had told the Ambassador that any peace offer of the kind Germany was likely to put forward would be immediately rejected.

The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that on the previous day he had seen Mr. Kermit Roosevelt, son of the former President, Theodore Roosevelt, who had asked for a Commission in the Machine-gun Corps, being willing, if necessary, to give up his United States nationality in order to be able to fight against Germany. He (the First Lord) thought that this offer of service was one which should be accepted, and he understood from the Secretary of State for War that the necessary arrangements had been made.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The Responsi- 15   The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum

bility for the by the Minister of Information (W.P. (G.) (39) 12). Supply of News jn the course of a short preliminary discussion the view was to the Public, expressed that the fundamental cause of the present dissatisfaction (Previous lav [n the fact that we were not ourselves as yet taking part in Reference: warlike operations of the first importance, and that there was, there-W.M. (39) 17th fore, little information which the Defence Departments could give Conclusions,      to the public.

Minute 10.) The War Cabinet were also reminded that we were in serious

danger of losing the sympathy of the press in neutral countries, and that the whole of the British Press was extremely critical of the Ministry of Information.

The War Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to deal with this matter personally, in consultation with the Minister of Information, the Lord Privy Seal, and the Service Ministers, with a view to arriving at an agreed solution.
