Air Operations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 47th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet that normal activities by Coastal Command had been continued in spite of bad weather. One attack had been made on a German submarine some 150 miles west of Norway, but no success was claimed for it.

The weather had been too bad to permit nights for the dropping of pamphlets containing the Prime Minister&apos;s statement, but it was intended that these should be carried out as soon as conditions permitted.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Naval 2.   The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff gave certain further

Operations.       particulars as to the sinking of the Royal Oak. (Previous There had been a continuance of enemy submarine activity.

Reference:       Three merchant ships had been attacked, just after the dispersal W.M. (39) 47th 0  an incoming convoy.   The Karamea had been shelled, but was Conclusions,      believed to have escaped; the Bretagne* a French ship, had been Mmute 2.)       sunk; the third, the Loch Avon* had been torpedoed and abandoned, but had not sunk.  An attack had been carried out against one of the U-boats which had probably caused these losses, and was thought to have been successful.   The steamship Louth had been attacked off the Mull of Galloway, but had escaped.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Eire.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 28th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

3. In connection with the preceding Minute the Chief of the Naval Staff said that, now that enemy submarines were operating far out on the Western Approaches, the lack of Berehaven as a base for our anti-submarine forces was a serious hindrance. Even if it was not possible to use the base for air reconnaissance and anti-submarine craft, it would be a great help if the Government of Eire would permit our salvage tugs to be stationed at Berehaven. This might prove to be the thin end of the wedge.

The War Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consult on this matter with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.

The Military 4.   The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that

Situation. reports of German military movements on the Western Front (Previous indicated a slow but steady drift from Dusseldorf towards the

Reference: Moselle. The presence of thirteen new bridges between Trier and W.M. (39) 47th the Saar had been confirmed, which pointed to an attack down the Conclusions, Moselle in the direction of Metz. The latest messages from General Minute 3.) Gamelin were full of confidence. The French defences in this area were very strong. Even if the Germans were to succeed in making a dent in the Maginot Line, it was improbable that they would penetrate to any depth, and they would undoubtedly suffer very heavy losses at the hands of the French, who had prepared additional defences behind the main Maginot Line. The new dispositions all seemed to indicate that the original German plan of an invasion through Belgium had been abandoned. It seemed impossible that Germany could now hope to carry out an attack through Belgium before the date which General Gamelin had given as the latest date by which a big attack could be launched. It might be that the impending attack across the Saar was intended only to recover German territory now occupied by the enemy, and perhaps to occupy French territory up to the Maginot Line; but if so, the

&quot;&quot;These two ships are included among those mentioned at the War Cabinet meeting of the previous day as having -been torpedoed (W.M. (39) 47th Conclusions,. Minute 2).

Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff considered that they would be using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut.

The Prime Minister said that the explanation might be found in the fact that the Germans had not so far dealt with the Western problem on military lines. Had they done so, they would, for example, have taken military measures to prevent the arrival of the British Expeditionary Force in France, and to stop the concentration of the French Army.

Continuing, the Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that German attacks had been restricted so far to the engagement of outposts. There was a report that Hitler had taken supreme command on the Western Front with Goring as his second-in-command.

(Previous General Gamelin had reported that the whole of his forces

Eeference: opposite the Saar had now been equipped with gas-masks proof W.M. (39) 46th against arsenical gas. The similar proofing of our own gas-masks Conclusions,      would be completed within the next ten days.

Minute 10.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

German Report 5.   The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff drew the attention of

of British the War Cabinet to the constant and repeated allusions in German

supply of Gas broadcasts to the false reports that the Polish Army had used

to Poland. gas, which had been supplied by the British.  These suggested the

(Previous German technique of preparing the ground to justify their own

Reference: use of gas in the forthcoming operations on the Western Front.

W.M. (39) 45th The denial, which had been issued to our Press, had received little

Conclusions, publicity, and he suggested that stronger steps should be taken

Minute 4.) to give the lie to these German reports, and that the B.B.C. should broadcast an emphatic denial.

The Prime Minister agreed. He suggested that the denial should bring out two points, first, that the German report was a lie; second, that the dissemination of such a lie was the usual prelude to the use by Germany of some prohibited weapon of war, under the guise of retaliation.

The War Cabinet agreed :  

That the War Office, in consultation with the Ministry of Information, should take immediate steps to issue a strongly worded denial of the German report that we had supplied Poland with gas, which should be broadcast by the B.B.C. and published in the Press.

Reports of 6.   The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence drew attention

Broadcasts.      to the fact that the resumes of broadcasts, which were supplied to

the War Cabinet, covered foreign countries only, and did not include

a summary of British broadcasts.

The War Cabinet agreed:  

That the daily resumes drawn up by the Ministry of Information should in future cover British as well as foreign broadcasts.

Turkey. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was
