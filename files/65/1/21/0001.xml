kit Operations. 1.   The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet

(Previous that the usual routine work had been carried out during, the previous

Kef erence: twenty-four hours. There were certain indications, which remained

W.M. (39) 20th to be confirmed, that some German air units were on their way

Conclusions, back from Poland to their Home Stations.   The reconnaissance of

Minute 1.) the railways in North-west Germany, carried out the previous day, had produced no definite evidence of military movements.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that three merchant

Situation. ships had been attacked during the previous twenty-four hours, but (Previous &amp;i\ had escaped. A trawler had been stopped and the skipper taken Eeference: 0fj jt was not yet known whether he had been allowed to return W.M. (39) 20th to his ship.

Conclusions, At least eight attacks had been made on enemy submarines,

Minute 2.) good contact being obtained in many cases. These attacks included the sinking of the &quot; U. 27 &quot; by Fortune 85 miles west of Butt of Lewis.   The Captain and full crew had been captured.

The skipper of a trawler had reported that, when passing two destroyers near Flamborough Head, he had passed over and struck what he believed to be a submerged submarine. An eruption of black oil had been observed.

A Polish submarine had escaped out of the Baltic, and had asked for a rendez-vous in the North Sea.

The War Cabinet : 

(1) Took note of the above statements.

(2) Agreed that the Prime Minister should include in his

statement to the House of Commons that afternoon an account of our successes against German submarines, and should emphasise that, in contrast with the last war, we were now conducting a vigorous anti-U-boat campaign, which would increase in intensity as we developed our resources.

The Military 3.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that in North-

Situation in east Poland the Russians had cleaned up the Vilna area. Near Poland. Bialystok the Germans were withdrawing as the Russians advanced.

(Previous        jn South-east Poland the Russians were advancing their line and Eeference:       appeared to have cut off the Roumanian-Polish frontier. The Poles W.M. (39) 20th were still holding out in the Pripet Marshes, and also in the area Conclusions,      between Warsaw and Radom, where there were probably about Minute 4.)       100,000 Polish troops.  The German attack on Warsaw was coming from the North and not from the West, in which direction there seemed to be few German troops.   There was no news of any movement of German Divisions to the West from Poland.

The position as regards the oil wells in Galicia was that the Western group of wells was in the hands of the Germans, and the Eastern group in the hands of the Russians. A dispute appeared to be going on between the Russians and the Germans as to the possession of the middle group of wells near Lemberg. So far as was known, all, or practically all, the refineries had been destroyed, but not the wells themselves.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that ttoe movement of the British Field Force was proceeding satisfactorily. Another anti-aircraft regiment of 48 3-7-inch guns was being despatched for the defence of the base area, since it was doubtful whether the French would continue to lend any of their resources

Provision of 5   in connection with the preceding item, discussion took place

Heavy Artillery as to the provision of heavy artillery for the British Field Force, for the Army. Reference was made to the large war stocks of heavy howitzers, and it was suggested that immediate steps should be taken to modernise these stocks so as to increase their range, on the same lines as the French had adopted. If heavy guns were required for counter-battery work, the Admiralty could make some available.

The War Cabinet 

(1) invited the War Office and Ministry of Supply to consider

what immediate steps could be taken for the modernisation of existing stocks of heavy artillery;

(2) took note that the Admiralty could, if necessary, provide

a certain quantity of long-range guns and ammunition for the use of the Army.

Land Forces.

Second Report of Committee. (Previous Reference : W.M. (39) 9th Conclusions, Minute 6.)

6. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the fact that the Second Report of the Land Forces Committee (W.P. (39) 37) had only just been circulated, he proposed that the discussion should be of a preliminary character only, a decision being deferred until Friday, the 22nd September, 1939, when, in addition, those members of the War Cabinet who were not present, would have returned.

At the conclusion of the discussion, a record of which is being circulated separately, the War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) to defer a decision on the questions raised in the Second

Report by the Land Forces Committee (W.P. (39) 37) until the meeting of the War Cabinet to be held on Friday, the 22nd September, 1939;

(b) that, before the meeting of the War Cabinet referred to

in (a) above, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should circulate a paper (i) comparing our present monthly expenditure with that at the end of the last war (exclusive of expenditure then financed from American loans); (ii) discussing the dollar expenditure involved in the proposals of the Land Forces Committee in relation to our total dollar resources;

(c) to take note that the Prime Minister contemplated making

a statement regarding the scale on which we proposed to carry on the war on the lines of recommendation (a) as summarised in paragraph 4 of the Second Report of the Land Forces Committee;

(d) that the Secretary of State for Air, in consultation with

the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, should continue to make provisional plans for the despatch at a very early date of an Air Mission to Canada for the purpose of making arrangements with the Canadian Government for the training of personnel and for the expansion of the aircraft-production industry in that Dominion.

Corbin to pass Minute 12.) this request on to the Chiefs of Staff Committee for immediate consideration.

In the course of the subsequent discussion the following points emerged :

The War Cabinet agreed : j

(a) that the Chiefs of Staff Committee, taking as their basis their Appreciation of the possible future course of the war (W.P. (39) 33) discussed by the War Cabinet at the meeting noted in the margin, should initiate the examination by the British and French Permanent Military Representatives on the Supreme War Council of the broad military strategy to be adopted in the Near East, including in particular the Balkans;

The opportunity could be used to obtain the views of the French General Staff on Allied Strategy in the Balkans, with particular reference to Marshal Weygand&apos;s activities.  (See Minute 8.)

The War Cabinet agreed :

Interview with 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that at

Dr. Benes. a meeting the previous day Dr. Benes had stated that he was very sanguine regarding the present anti-German efforts of the Czechs in Czecho-Slovakia. He (the Secretary of State) had exhorted Dr. Benes to encourage his followers to maintain a campaign of sabotage and to avoid a rising in open rebellion. In the course of the conversation, Dr. Benes had raised the following questions : 

(i) Was the restoration of Czecho-Slovakia one of the British

war aims ?

(ii) Would it be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to

accord a juridical basis to the Czech Government of which Dr. Benes was the head ? (iii) Would it be possible to arrange in this country for the enrolment of Czech units?

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs summarised his views in regard to these questions as follows : 

(a) He had informed Dr. Benes, as regards his first question,

that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided, for the present at least, to take no decision as regards war aims, except the securing, by every possible means, of the defeat of Germany.

He had, accordingly, addressed a telegram, the previous evening (19th September, 1939), to Sir Reginald Hoare requesting him to take all possible action to assist the departure from Roumania of the Polish Government, and authorising him, if necessary, to make arrangements himself for the Polish Ministers to leave Roumania by air.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, and his French colleague, had arranged to discuss that day with the State Department the question of the reply to be given to the Japanese suggestion for the withdrawal of garrisons and warships from China by belligerent countries. The situation would be clearer when a report had been received from Lord Lothian, but at present he (the Secretary of State) felt that we should not pursue further the question of withdrawing our garrisons either from Tientsin or from Shanghai. There was a possibility that the Japanese Government did not intend to press this suggestion.

The Secretary of State was very anxious to effect a settlement of the Tientsin question, and he hoped that it might be possible to do this by making an arrangement with the Japanese Government in regard to the disposal of the silver now held in the Concession. A decision by the War Cabinet on this difficult question would be needed in the course of the next few days.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The matter had been considered in consultation with the French

Government, who were prepared to extend summer time to

18th November and were anxious to make their announcement that

day.

Inquiries which had been made showed that feeling in England and Wales was almost unanimous as to the necessity for an extension of summer time, but that opinion in Scotland was opposed to the change.

The War Cabinet approved the action proposed by the Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security.

At the outbreak of war there was on order a total of 730,000 tons and he had immediately given orders to increase this amount by 100,000 tons. He now asked for authority to place orders for another 200,000&apos;tons and invited the War Cabinet to approve the principle of maintaining an annual output of not less than 1,100,000 tons.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) to approve the proposal of the President of the Board of

Trade that he should place orders for a further 200,000 tons of shipbuilding:

notice, apart from the possibility of some small purchases in Canada, should it be apparent that their tobacco growers were being more harshly dealt with than the United States tobacco growers :

(b) that our purchases of apples, pears and canned fruits from

the United States and Canada should be restricted to our own minimum requirements, with possibly a slightly less drastic restriction on Canadian than on United States apples :

(c) that the President should be authorised, in consultation with

the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to make the best possible bargain with the American film interests for reducing the sums accruing to them for royalties, &amp;c. :

(d) that the whole position should be explained fully to the

United States and Canadian Governments at the earliest possible opportunity.

The War Cabinet gave a general approval in principle to the above proposals, subject:

of proposal (a), further purchases of tobacco not being allowed except where the contractual arrangements made it impossible to stop the conclusion of the transactions :

no sympathy with the small section of traders who were using the emergency as an occasion for profiteering, and that they were about to introduce measures aimed at the prevention of profiteering.

The War Cabinet were informed that the measures contemplated would probably take the form of regulations rather than legislation.
