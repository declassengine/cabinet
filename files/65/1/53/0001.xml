India and Burma Reports.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 34th Conclusions, Minute 16.)

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 47th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

1. The War Cabinet had before them the Second and Third Fortnightly Reports submitted by the Secretary of State for India (Papers W.P. (R.) (39) 32 and 48), and the Second and Third Fortnightly Reports submitted by the Secretary of State for Burma (Papers W.P. (R.) (39) 33 and 49). These Reports covered the period the 12th September-14th October, 1939.

The Secretary of State for India said that the Viceroy&apos;s statement had now been made, and the first reactions in India were discouraging. The Congress Party made it clear that they did not regard the statement as in any way meeting their point of view, and Mr. Gandhi&apos;s attitude was also unfavourable. The Congress Working Committee would not be meeting until the end of the week, and the Moslem League was to meet on Sunday, so it was too early to judge the considered opinion of the Indian parties on the statement.

Everything appeared to be quiet in Burma.

The War Cabinet took note of the Fortnightly Reports on India and Burma, and of the statement by the Secretary of State for India thereon.

Dominions 2.   The War Cabinet had before them the Second Monthly

Report. Report submitted by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs

(Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 50).

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs drew attention to the fact that all four Dominions were preparing land forces, and Canada, Australia and New Zealand were doing so on the basis of possible service overseas. At our request, Australia and New Zealand were retaining their forces at home until we could judge more exactly the attitude of Japan. There had been general acceptance of the air training scheme. Good progress was being made in Canada in the field of supply, and the Canadian Government had set up a War Supply Board, which would be of assistance to us as well as to themselves.

A discussion ensued on the size of the land contribution which &apos; Canada and Australia were planning.

(Previous The  First  Lord of  the Admiralty strongly urged that

Reference:        contingents from these Dominions should take their places in the W-M. (39) 43rd line in France by the opening of the Spring campaign.  He drew Conclusions,      attention to the great effort which the Dominions had made in the Minute 2.)       last war and the speed with which they had hastened to the support of France and ourselves.  This time it appeared that Canada was contemplating only one division at the outset, with the possibility of a second, and Australia appeared to be forming only one division, and even that was remaining at home for the present.  He thought we should press them strongly to do more.

The Secretary of State for War agreed that, taking the long view, a much greater contribution would be required from the Dominions on land than they appeared to contemplate. It must be remembered, however, that their divisions must all be equipped by us. In the discussions on the Land Forces Committee, it had been recognised that we should include in the twenty divisions which we could equip in the first year of war such divisions from the Dominions as could be made ready. The problem, therefore, was to draw up, in consultation with the Dominions, a programme showing the dates on which each of their formations would be ready. We could then fit these formations into our equipment programme, at the cost of some postponement of the equipment of part of our own forces.

[20175]


442

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reminded the War Cabinet that the Dominions had accepted a scheme covering 20,000 pilots and 30,000 aircraft crews. This must, to some extent, affect the size of their contribution on land. The Dominion Ministers, who were arriving shortly, were bringing with them military advisers specifically for the purpose of discussing matters of this kind. It would be advantageous if we could make up our minds as to the programme to which we should ask the Dominions to work, and the dates at which we could provide equipment, before the discussions opened.

The War Cabinet 

(a) Took note of the Second Report on action taken by the Dominions.

(6) Invited the Secretary of State for War, in consultation with the Minister of Supply, to submit to the War Cabinet a statement of the programme of equipment of Divisions in the first year of war, showing the places in. this programme which should be occupied by Divisions from the Dominions, to serve as a basis for discussion during the forthcoming visit of Dominion Ministers.

Colonial Empire Reports.

Palestine.

(Previous Reference: ,WR W.M. (39) 36th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

3. The War Cabinet had before them the first and second Monthly Reports on the Colonial Empire, submitted by the Secretary of State for the Colonies covering the period to the 31st September (Papers W.P. (R.) (39) 7 and 31).

The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the state of affairs in Palestine was for the time being as satisfactory as could be expected. The Jews had given their support unconditionally, and violence on their part had ceased. The flow of illegal immigration had also stopped, though it might begin again. The Arabs were, generally speaking, with us. It was too early yet to judge the effect of the escape from Syria of the Mufti, thougb no doubt his presence in Iraq would be embarrassing for the Government of that country.

The First Lord of the Admiralty raised two points in connection with Palestine.

First, that it would be desirable to make use of the man-power available in Palestine, so as to free for use elsewhere the greater part of the Regular battalions now held there for internal security purposes. He thought that, by balancing the Arabs against the Jews in the units which might be formed, not only would an outlet be provided for the more adventurous spirits in those peoples, but each community would be enabled to keep watch upon the other. The British battalions now in Palestine could not at present be regarded as a satisfactory reserve for the Middle East, as they could not be released for fear of disorders.

Secondly, steps should be taken to manufacture munitions in Palestine.

There was some discussion on this latter proposal, and the War Cabinet were informed that suggestions made by the Anglo-Palestine Corporation were under examination by the Ministry of Supply.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that great care would have to be exercised, both in raising forces in Palestine and in creating munition factories. It was essential that the Arabs should not gain the impression that the Jews were training and arming themselves for anti-Arab action in the country. He agreed as to the desirability of establishing ammunition factories, and was in consultation with the High Commissioner on both points.

Some discussion took place on the proposal made by the Governor of Uganda for the isolation of Africa as a neutral area (paragraph 10 of Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 7).  It was pointed out that

Colonial

Man-Power

Resources.

Precautions against Italy.

this suggestion was a personal one, made at the outbreak of war, with particular reference to Italy, and did not merit further attention.

The Prime Minister said the important point to consider in connection with the Colonial Empire was the effect in Africa of our present watchful attitude towards Italy (paragraph 1 of Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 31). If we could be assured of Italian neutrality, we could close down the preparations now on foot in our African Colonies for operations against Italian East Africa and could consider the most profitable method of utilising the resources of the African Colonies in our struggle against Germany.

The First Lord of the Admiralty supported this proposal. He thought immediate steps should be taken to see what could be made available from the African Colonies for use elsewhere. African soldiers might be used in various parts of the Empire to relieve regulars for service in France. Similar considerations applied in the West Indies, where we should take advantage of the enthusiasm displayed to raise units for service in tropical parts of the Empire.

The Secretary of State for War said that the principle of making use of local forces to free regulars for more active employment was already being carried out throughout the Empire. Units were being raised in Malta, Cyprus and other places, and the garrisons of Hong Kong, Singapore and Aden were already partly composed of Indian troops.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed that the maximum use should be made of our Colonial resources, though he doubted the desirability of employing African troops outside Africa. It would be of great advantage to the African Colonies if the position vis-a-vis Italy could be cleared up, and he thought that the War Office and the Colonial Office could consider what steps they should take in Africa if the Italian menace were removed.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence reminded the War Cabinet that considerable discussions had taken place with the French with the object of concerting fully our action in Africa and the Middle East generally against Italy. We could hardly take any decision to relax our precautions without first fully consulting the French.

It was generally agreed that the first step should be consultation with the French. It was pointed out that it had been taken as a basis of South Africa&apos;s effort that it was to be a Military and Air Force for resisting an Italian invasion from North Africa. If Italy were no longer to be regarded as a potential enemy, the South African Government might be less willing to continue with their military preparations. At the same time, this consideration did not outweigh the beneficial results which would accrue from reaching an agreement with Italy which would justify a mutual withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia and Italian troops from Libya. .

The War Cabinet c&lt; 

(a) Took note of the First and Second Monthly Reports by

the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

(b) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the

Secretary of State for War to explore the possibility of raising Palestinian forces, with a view to enabling the regular garrison of Palestine to be reduced.

(c) Took note that the possibility of manufacturing munitions

in Palestine was under discussion between the Minister of Supply and the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

(d) Agreed that, before any step was taken to relax prepara-

tions for operations against the Italians in Africa, we should consult with the French Government; and noted

that this matter was closely related to the questions which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was shortly to discuss with Sir Percy Loraine (W.M. (39) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 7). (e) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in consultation with the Secretary of State for War, to examine and report on the best use which we could make of the man-power resources of the Colonial Empire.

Home Security 4 The War Cabinet had before them the Fourth Weekly Report. Report relating to Home Security, covering the period to the

(Previous        l8t October, 1939 (Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 36).

Reference: . .

W.M. (39) 37th The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security reminded Conclusions the War Cabinet that, at their Meeting referred to in the margin, Minute 6.)       ^ nad been agreed that future Reports in this series should be

furnished fortnightly instead of weekly.   The present document

was the last of the Weekly Reports. &quot;

As regards paragraph 2 of the Report under discussion, the

War Cabinet were informed that a Report would shortly be

circulated to them from the Committee on Lighting Restrictions.

The War Cabinet took note of the above Report.

Home Front 5.   The War Cabinet had before them the First Report of the

Report. Home Front, covering the period from the outbreak of war to the

14th October, 1939 (Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 44).

The Lord Privy Seal made a statement in explanation of the above Report.

In the course of discussion, attention was drawn to paragraph 14 of the Report, in which it was stated that, following a decision by the Home Policy Committee, the Football Pool Promoters had been requested not to resume the operation of the Pools. The Promoters had agreed not to resume their operations in their original form, but they had since submitted certain alternative proposals, which were being examined.

It was generally agreed that the question of football pools was a matter which would have to come before the War Cabinet for separate consideration. It was noted, on the one hand, that those who were concerned on behalf of the Treasury with encouraging the small investor to make his contribution towards the national war effort were alarmed lest their work should be interfered with by a revival of the pools. On the other hand, there would be a strong feeling in other quarters that the public could not be deprived for an indefinite period of this form of relaxation.

The War Cabinet : 

(a) Took note of the First Report relating to the Home Front.

(b) Agreed that future Reports in this series should be

submitted at intervals of two months.

Shipping 6.   The War Cabinet had before them the Fifth and Sixth

Reports. Weekly Reports on Shipping covering the period the lst-2nd-

  (Previous-        15th-16th October, 1939 (Papers W.P. (R.) (39)40 and, 46). Reference: In the course of the survey of the above documents, the

W;.M. (39) 37th following questions were discussed : 

Minute 1 W        Frencn Mercantile Marine were understood to have

had a number of serious losses, which were not mentioned in the Reports before the War Cabinet. It was not known whether they had had any counterbalancing gains.   The suggestion was made that in


445 W.M.53 (39).

future Reports French losses and gains might be shown, if possible, as a percentage of their total tonnage.

(ii) The War Cabinet were informed that the position of the

British coastal trade was now showing some improvement.

(iii) Attention was drawn to the statement on page 2 of Paper

W.P. (R.) (39) 51 (further referred to under Minute 8) to the effect that the export of British coal was being held up owing to the shortage of tonnage.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that, according to his information, certain refrigerated tonnage, which was capable of being used for the export of coal, was being sent away from British ports empty. The Chancellor undertook to provide the Minister of Shipping with detailed particulars.

The War Cabinet took note of the above Reports.

Oil Reports. 7.   The War Cabinet had before them the Fifth and Sixth

(Previous Weekly Reports on the Oil Situation, covering the period up to

Reference: midnight on the 15th October. 1939 (Papers W.P. (R.) (39) 42 w.M. (39) 37th and 47).

Minute 2 ) &apos; ^e Secretary for Mines said that for the first time in the last

few weeks the returns showed a slight increase in the stocks of motor spirit held by the main importing installations,

The First Lord of the Admiralty gave particulars of the consumption of oil by the Navy since the outbreak of war. The position of Admiralty stocks, which was very satisfactory, would improve in the near future, as some big convoys were coming in which included tankers.

The War Cabinet took note of the above Reports.

Coal Report.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 37th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

(Previous Reference : W.M. (39) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 9.)

8. The War Cabinet had before them the third fortnightly Report submitted by the Secretary for Mines covering the period the 1st to 14th October, 1939 (Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 51).

The Secretary for Mines submitted the following further information to supplement that given in the Report mentioned above : 

(1) At a conference that afternoon between the Mining

Association and the Mineworkers&apos; Federation it had been agreed that the workers should receive a wage increase of Sd. per shift for adult workers and 4c?. per shift for younger workers. In the announcement of the terms agreed the increase would not be related in any way to the rise in the cost of living.

(2) There had been a slight fall in production in the last week,

the decline being entirely in the north-eastern district, where exports had been held up by shipping difficulties resulting from the convoy system and from bad weather.

The War Cabinet took note of the above Report and of the

statement by the Secretary for Mines.

Economic War- 9.   The War Cabinet had before them the following periodical

fare Reports. Reports relating to Economic Warfare : 

(Prevwus Second Monthly Report covering period to the 30th

w r6nCe: September, 1939 (Paper W.P. (R.) (39) 30):

w.M (39) 37th Fourth and Fifth Weekly Reports covering period to the

Conclusions, 15th 0ctober, 1939 (Papers W.P. (R.) (39) 38 and 45).


446

In the course of the survey of the above documents, the following questions were discussed : 

(i) The negotiations with Sweden for a War Trade A greement.

It was noted that on every subject except iron-ore, on which the Swedish Government had been subjected to considerable pressure from Germany, good progress was being made.

(ii) Food rationing in Germany.

A report was mentioned, which had appeared in the Press, to the effect that the German food ration might shortly be somewhat increased. The view was expressed that this report was not inherently improbable. The present shortage of foodstuffs in Germany might well be due to the recent large-scale troop movements, which had monopolised most of the available transport.

(iii) Suggested purchase of oil seeds and animal fats from the

Balkans.

The Minister for Economic Warfare said that no preparations had been made before the outbreak of war for effecting purchases of this kind. As a result, considerable difficulty had been experienced in making any effective progress. The Minister feared that, so far as this year was concerned, Germany had succeeded in making large purchases of oil seeds and animal fats, of which we should have liked to deprive her. He had recently submitted certain proposals to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in this connection.

The War Cabinet took note of the above Reports.

10. The War Cabinet had before them the first two Reports submitted by the Minister of Labour and National Service, covering the period from the 3rd to the 30th September, 1939 (Papers W.P. (R.) (39) 3 and 37).

The Minister of Labour submitted the following further information supplementing that given in the Reports : 

(1) Subject to formal consultation with the Trades Unions

Congress, arrangements had been made to set up a Joint Advisory Council on labour questions.

(2) The latest figure for unemployment given in the Reports

was for the 25th September. Later figures showed that unemployment had increased since that date, and the latest available figure showed nearly 300,000 more unemployed than at the beginning of the War, the increase being divided more or less equally between men and women. The numbers were not now growing so rapidly. The increased unemployment was specially heavy in London, being due not only to evacuation, but also to the effects of lighting restrictions on the distributive and other trades.

(3) There was no doubt that unemployment was peculiarly

heavy among the black-coated workers, and that many unemployed in this category were not recorded in the official statistics. In order to help these workers, employers of workers of this type were being encouraged to use the Employment Exchanges to a greater extent than had been their custom. The War Cabinet took note of the above Reports and of the further information submitted by the Minister of Labour.

447 W.M. 53 (39).

11.   The Secretary of State for War informed the War Go-operation     Cabinet that he hoped shortly to bring before them for decision Requirements    certain urgent matters concerning the requirements of the Army by of the Army.     way of air co-operation. The Secretary of State for Air and he had prepared memoranda on this subject.   They had thought it convenient, in the first place, to circulate the memoranda to the Land Forces Committee.   He asked the War Cabinet to give formal approval to the examination of these papers by the Land Forces Committee.

The War Cabinet agreed 

That this matter should be examined by the Land Forces Committee.
