W.M. 25 (39).

The Ate 1.   The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that there was

Situation. nothing of importance to report.   The usual reconnaissances had

(Previous been carried out.   So far as was known, there had been no

Reference: appreciable transfer of air forces from Poland to the Western W.M. (39) 24th Front.

Conclusions, The ^ar Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Minute 1.)

The Naval 2.   The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that no enemy-

Situation, submarine attacks had been made or submarines sighted in the

(Previous western approaches during the previous twenty-four hours. The

Reference: incoming convoys, however, had not yet reached the area in which W.M. (39) 24th the submarines had been operating.

Conclusions, The whole of our anti-submarine vessels were at present

Minute 2.) employed on escorting convoys and the expeditionary force, and none could be spared to hunt for submarines. By the middle of October the number of anti-submarine vessels in Home Waters, which was increasing continuously, would be doubled.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military 3.   The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported

Situation in that Polish forces were still holding out in Warsaw and in the Poland. Pripet Marshes.   General Carton de Wiart had reached England

(Previous and had reported that the arrival of the Russian forces had Reference: prevented the destruction of the Galician oil wells, which were now W.M. (39) 24th all in Russian hands; the refineries, however, had been destroyed. Conclusions, The General had also reported that at the time of the Russian

Minute 3.) invasion of Poland there had been scattered over Poland large Galician numbers of German tanks which had run out of petrol.

Oil Pield Reports of railway activity through Vienna from West to East

tended to confirm that an important railway bridge had been destroyed in the recent Czech disturbances.

General von Fritsch, who was reported killed in action in Poland, had been the most likely rallying point for an army movement against the Nazi regime. It seemed unlikely that he would have been killed in action and he might therefore have been &quot; liquidated.&quot;

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to Telegram No. 536 of the 23rd September from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington. The reports received by the State Department indicated that the Russian movement into Poland had taken place sooner than was expected or desired by the German Government.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military Situation in France.

(Previous Reference: &apos;W.M. (39) 24th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

4. The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the movement of the Field Force to France was proceeding without incident. The movement of our troops to the forward area had started; they would proceed thence to their front line positions as soon as possible.

Staff Conversations with Belgium.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 24th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had seen the Belgian Ambassador on the previous evening, and had put to him, as clearly and as fully as possible, the arguments in favour of the holding of Staff Conversations between ourselves and the Belgians.

The Belgian Ambassador, while appreciating our point of view, made it quite clear that it would be out of the question for the Belgian Government to agree to our suggestion. They were satisfied that Germany did not intend to violate their neutrality, but feared that the news of Staff Conversations, which would be sure to reach German ears, would precipitate an attack.

The Belgian Ambassador had thought it possible that his Government might reconsider their attitude if the Germans concentrated strong forces on their frontier. He was most unwilling, however, to approach his Government on the subject at the present time. The results of the interview had therefore been entirely negative.

The Belgian Government&apos;s attitude was likely to be hardened as a result of Dr. Goebbels&apos;s statement (see Telegram No. 112, Saving, from Brussels), that Germany had no intention of violating the neutrality of Belgium or Holland.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Attitude of g   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had

Soviet Russia.   seen the Soviet Ambassador the previous day, and had asked him if (Previous        he could throw any light on the policy of his Government. Reference: M. Maisky had replied that he thought this policy had been

W.M. (39) 2lst clearly explained by M. Molotov in his recent speech.   He (the Conclusions,      Foreign Secretary) had enquired how we were to interpret their Minute 7.)       attitude of neutrality towards us, and what were to be our future relations  in  political  and  commercial  matters.    The Soviet Ambassador had said he would forward these questions to his Government, but the result of the interview had been inconclusive.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Far Eastern Situation.

British Gunboats in China.

(Previous &apos;Reference: W.M. (39) 24th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to an intelligence report that the Japanese were obstructing the movement of stores to our river gunboats on the Yangtse. He understood that three of the vessels had stores for three months and the remaining two for one month only. From the purely political point of view, it was desirable that the gunboats should remain on the Yangtse at the moment. If, however, the Admiralty foresaw any danger of a serious incident, the Foreign Office would take the view that it would be better to withdraw the gunboats.

The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, had been told on the previous day that it was politically undesirable to withdraw the gunboats at the moment. The Admiralty were satisfied, however, that the Commander-in-Chief would feel at liberty, in the light of the orders already given to him, to withdraw any of the gunboats if he considered that the situation demanded it.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Turkey. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to Tele-

Negotiations for gram No. 500 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Ankara. This Anglo-Franco- telegram, which had crossed the latest instructions to our Turkish Treaty. Ambassador, showed that negotiations were still proceeding on a (Previous number of points of detail and that no immediate action was called Reference: for.

W.M. (39) 24th The chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the statement Conclusions, -m paragraph 5; as to the initialling and signature of the Treaty, was distinctly more hopeful. As regards the points still unsettled, the important question was not whether the rate of interest should be 3 or 4 per cent., but whether we should undertake to provide Turkey with gold in London, or to hand over bullion at Istanbul. He much preferred the former course, since we could then exercise some control over the way in which Turkey used the gold. In this connection the Chancellor enquired what the position was in regard to the Polish bullion which was now in transit to Marseilles via Beirut.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements.

Propaganda In Germany.

Export of  capital by  certain Nazi Leaders.

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to a telegram received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Copenhagen, urging tJhat frequent reference should be made in our German broadcasts to the large investments placed abroad by certain Nazi Leaders.

The Prime Minister thought that, owing to restrictions on receiving sets in Germany, our propaganda on this matter should be done by leaflets. It had long been notorious in Germany that these leaders had lived in luxury, and enjoyed privileges and immunities denied to the ordinary citizen. When it became generally known in Germany that these leaders had also broken their own very drastic laws against the export of capital, there would be a very strong revulsion of feeling, from which they might never recover. It was to the credit of Herr Hitler that his name had never been associated with these scandals.

Reference was made to a report that certain bags of coffee, consigned to Herr Hitler, had been seized and were now before the Prize Court. Discussion ensued as to whether, if the hearing of this case could be expedited, valuable propaganda material could not be obtained from it, in view of the scarcity of coffee in Germany. Varying views were expressed on this point.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

that the attention of the Minister of Information should be drawn to the telegram from Copenhagen referred to above, and also to the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion that propaganda on this matter should be carried out by leaflets.
