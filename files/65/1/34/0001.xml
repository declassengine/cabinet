W.M. M (39).

The Air 1.   The Secretary: of State for Air reported that a reconnais-

Situation. sance to ascertain the strength and location of the German Air (Previous Force in north-west Germany had been carried out the previous Eeferenoe: morning by three aircraft. Of these, one had been unable to W.M. (39) 33rd complete its reconnaissance owing to fighter opposition, one had Conclusions, carried out its reconnaissance successfully, and the third was Minute l.) missing.

A successful propaganda raid had been carried out by four aircraft over Berlin the previous night. Intense anti-aircraft fire had been encountered in the Berlin area. One of the aircraft had failed to return, and was believed to be down in the North Sea.

Our Air Attach^ in Brussels had reported that a Belgian Air Staff Officer had told him that German aircraft had been concentrating near Aix-la-Chapelle during the previous five days. At present, however, there was no independent confirmation of this report.

R.A.F. Losses. Some discussion ensued as to whether the casualties which the

R.A.F. were at present suffering should be accepted as normal. (A fuller note of this discussion is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s File of War Cabinet Conclusions.)

The Secretary of State for Air thought that the results so far attained were by no means discouraging. He thought that, while we should learn valuable lessons from these early encounters, no alteration of our general policy was called for. The reasons were explained why &quot;Battle&quot; aircraft were used for reconnaissance.

Attention was drawn to the fact that the B.B.C. the previous night had given out the British version of casualties sustained in air fighting, followed by the German version, which was considerably less favourable, without any explanation of the difference. It was explained that it would be a mistake for us to admit or deny the truth of every statement as to our losses made in the German communiques, which were often extremely misleading. It was also pointed out that the official British statement that the crews of certain of our aircraft which had been shot down had made their escape by parachute had given the impression that these aircraft had all been brought down over enemy territory.   This was not the case, and it was suggested that steps should be taken to correct this false impression.

The War Cabinet 

(i) Took note of the above statement.

(ii) Agreed that we should not allow ourselves to be drawn into

a policy of rebutting every misrepresentation of our losses made in the German communique&apos;s.

Dropping of 2.   The Secretary of State for A ir said that certain telegrams

Leaflets in       which he had recently seen led him to ask whether we should Germany.        continue the policy of dropping leaflets.  In favour of this policy, (Previous        it, could be said that it brought home to the Germans that our air-Reference:       craft could penetrate Germany with impunity.   The objections W.M. (39) 30th which these propaganda raids had provoked from Goering and Conclusions,      Goebbels pointed to their dislike of them, which was further con-Mmute 1.)       firmed by the penalties attaching to people who picked up the leaflets.   The recent activities of the R.A.F. disposed of the argument that our aircraft ought to be employed in less passive operations.

The Foreign Secretary confessed that he had been sceptical about the wisdom of dropping leaflets when the subject was last discussed by the War Cabinet, and his doubts had been reinforced by the telegrams from neutral countries. [20097] b 2


270

The Prime Minister was inclined not to set too much store by reports from neutrals, which might well be instigated by Germany  the fact being, that these reports were inconsistent with the disfavour with which these leaflets were viewed by the authorities in Germany. His misgivings were more on the score of whether the policy might not cost too much in pilots and aircraft.

The Minister without Portfolio reminded the Cabinet that the decision was that we should continue to- drop leaflets, but more intermittently.

The Chief of the Air Staff explained that our increased activities in the last few days had been due to the advantage afforded by a full moon.

The War Cabinet: 

(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit a Memorandum

collating the information received as to the effect of dropping leaflets.

(2) Agreed that in the meantime, the policy of dropping leaflets

intermittently should continue.

Naval Operations.

(Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

Eeport of Operations in Western Atlantic by German Surface Ship.

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a whole week had now passed without the sinking by submarine of a single British merchant ship. An unsuccessful attack had been made on a ship in a convoy on the previous day. There were indications of an increased number of submarines m the Channel.

A report had been received that a British ship had been sunk off Pernambuco on the 30th September. According to the survivors, the ship had been stopped by a sea-plane and then sunk by gunfire by the Admiral Scheer, one of Germany&apos;s pocket battleships.

The Admiralty were making appropriate dispositions to deal with the situation, a record of which is included in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

Shipping had already been warned to be on the look-out for a German raider, and the facts of the case would be made public as soon as they had been substantiated.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Visit of His 4.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that His Majesty

Majesty The     The King desired to visit the Fleet.   The arrangements proposed King to the      by the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, in connection with the Home Fleet.      visit are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet approved the proposals in connection with the forthcoming visit of His Majesty The King to the Home Fleet.

The Military 5.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that increased

Situation. train movements across Germany from East to West had been

(Previous reported. There were now thought to be 42 German Divisions Reference: on the Western Front, 30 of which were Reserve Divisions. There W.M. (39) 33rd appeared to have been some movement of troops from the North, Conclusions, opposite Holland, to positions opposite the Maginot Line. General Minute 3.) Gamelin appeared to think that the Germans might launch an attack on the Maginot Line in the middle of October. He (the Chief of the Imperial General Staff) thought, personally, that no attack


271 W.M. 34 (39).

would come before the end of October. General Gamelin intended to fight on the Maginot Line on which he would welcome a frontal attack by the Germans.

The Prime Minister observed that General Gamelin had expressed the view that an attack might be expected any time after the 8th October, but not later than the 16th October.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

British Air 6.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he

Strength in had received a letter from M. Daladier, in which he not only

France. repeated the former French request for anti-aircraft guns and

(Previous fighters, but also asked that new British Fighter and Bomber

Reference: Squadrons should be sent at an early date to occupy the bases which

W.M. (39) 33rd had been prepared for them in France.

Conclusions, Minute 4.)

The Chief of the Air Staff called attention to the discussion at the Meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin and reiterated that the French authorities were not all speaking with the same voice. General Gamelin had definitely agreed that the second contingent of the Air Striking Force should remain in England.

The Lord Privy Seal suggested that steps should be taken to tighten up our arrangements for liaison with the French in such manner as to ensure that military requests of the character of M. Daladier&apos;s should reach us through the proper military channels.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that the Chiefs of Staff had approached him that morning to say that, in their view, the situation in France called for an early meeting of the Supreme War Council which the Chiefs of Staff should attend, in order to clear up a number of points.

The Secretary of State for Air thought that it would be preferable that the War Cabinet should first decide what our policy should be.

After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed:  

(1) That  a   Committee,   consisting  of  the   Minister for

Co-ordination of Defence, the three Service Ministers and the Minister without Portfolio, should meet to re-examine the present situation on the Western Front in the light of the latest information and of the representations received from the French, and to report to the War Cabinet as soon as possible; in particular, they should deal with any points in regard to Anglo-French co-operation which required clearing up.

(2) To take note that the Prime Minister would send an interim

reply to M. Daladier, after consultation with the Secretary of State for Air.

Anglo-Soviet Trade

Negotiations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 9.) Proposed exchange of rubber and tin for Soviet timber.

7. The Minister of Supply informed the War Cabinet of the stage reached in the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations, which was as follows: j

(a) after a preliminary consultation with the departments concerned, he had had an interview on Saturday, the 30th September, 1939, with M. Filin, the Soviet Trade Commissioner, and his assistant, M. Feonoff. Considerable progress had been made as soon as the Soviet Representatives realised that it was as a result of a suggestion made by M. Stepanov to His Majesty&apos;s Commercial Secretary, Moscow, that the present negotiations for the purchase of Soviet timber in return for rubber and tin had been initiated;


272

(b) he (the Minister of Supply) had at 4 p.m. on Sunday, the

2nd October, 1939, despatched a letter to M. Filin indicating that we were prepared to purchase Soviet timber to the value of  1 million, in exchange for rubber and tin, it being part of the proposed bargain that the British vessels now in North Russian ports, together with any neutral vessels which might now be available, should be loaded with timber before the ports became ice-bound, and should sail for the United Kingdom as soon as possible; . -

(c) from enquiries made, it appeared that there were, in all,

58 vessels (42 neutral and 16 British) in Russian ports between the Kara Sea and Murmansk, either loading timber or taking temporary refuge. All these vessels were under charter to the Government of the U.S.S.R.;

(d) the whole of the timber supplies in North Russian ports

had already been sold c.i.f. to British buyers. In addition, there were approximately 25,000 standards of timber at Leningrad. In view of the good rail and canal communications between Leningrad and Murmansk, it was clear, therefore, that, if there was goodwill on the Soviet side, it should be possible for us to obtain through Murmansk (which froze up later in the year than the other ports) considerable quantities of timber, in addition to those already waiting shipment in North Russian ports;

(e) at the interview held on the 30th September, 1939, he (the

Minister of Supply) had informed the Soviet Representatives that there were other commodities (e.g., lead and cocoa) of which we had surpluses which we should be prepared to let the U.S.S.R. have in return for further timber supplies. The limiting factor was not the amount of money involved, but the amount of timber which could be exported before the ports froze up; (/) he (the Minister of Supply) was now waiting for the Soviet Trade Commissioner to suggest a time for a further meeting. He did not anticipate that any but minor questions remained to be discussed.

In the course of discussion, the following considerations were stressed: 

(i) there was a danger that the Government of the U.S.S.R-

might be acting in bad faith, and might therefore agree to the export of the timber to us, but at the same time make sure that the vessels carrying the timber were attacked by German submarines on their way to this country. In that event, the Government of the U.S.S.R. would no doubt claim the rubber and tin due to them under the contract;

(ii) the danger anticipated under (i) above would be greatly

increased if the timber was bought f .o.b, and every effort should therefore be made to ensure that it was bought c.i.f.;

(iii) arrangements had already been made by the Admiralty to convoy vessels as far as Narvik in Norway; and the First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to examine the possibility of providing convoys for vessels proceeding east of that port.

Proposed The President of the Board of Trade said that, as regards the

exchange of proposed purchase of Soviet cereals in exchange for machine-tools machine-tools and copper, he had, on Saturday, the 30th September, 1939, and copper for addressed a letter to the Soviet Trade Commissioner, stating that he Soviet cereals,   understood that he was already in touch with the Ministry of Supply


273

W.M. 34 (39).

in regard to the proposed timber transaction and that he would therefore no doubt also discuss the proposed cereal transaction with that Department.

The War Cabinet: 

(a) took note of the stage reached in the Anglo-Soviet trade

negotiations;

(b) agreed to consider the matter further as soon as the

Minister of Supply was in a position to submit a further report.

Turkey. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had

Turco-Soviet no information to report regarding the progress of the discussions

Conversations, in Moscow between M. Molotov and M. Sarajoglu, the Turkish

(Previous Minister for Foreign Affairs.   Nor did he know when the latter

W.M. (39) 3rd ment had lodged a protest at this further violation of their

Conclusions, neutrality.   There was no doubt that such incidents harmed our

Minute 1.) relations with the Netherlands and other neutral countries.

The Chief of the A ir Staff said that on receiving a report on this incident, he had given further orders designed to prevent any repetition.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Italy- 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs drew attention

of German propaganda in Italy, recently expressed by the Belgian Ambassador in Rome; (ii) Telegram No. 988, dated the 30th September, 1939, reporting that the German-Soviet Treaty might precipitate a descent from the fence by Signor Mussolini on one side or the other, and that a very early announcement was to be expected, perhaps in conjunction with the impending German peace offensive.

The Secretary of State added that the Foreign Office doubted whether the German-Soviet Treaty would have the effect anticipated in telegram No. 988 referred to above, since the powerful influences in Italy against a war with France and ourselves were as strong as ever.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Sino-Japanese 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

The War Cabinet agreed :

m

275

W.M. 34 (39).

The Russian 15.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the

Threat to India. Secretary of State for India, on the question of the Russian threat to India (Paper W.P. (39) 55) and a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on the same subject (W.P. (39) 59).

The Secretary of State for India said that he had examined the question of the possible threat from Russia to the North-West frontier of India, in view of recent developments in the international situation, and he had asked the Chiefs of Staff for their views.

In the meanwhile, he had received a telegram from the Government of India, which showed that their views were in harmony with those of the Chiefs of Staff. They fully realised the importance of a good intelligence system in Central Asia, but they did not favour the reopening of the Intelligence Bureau at Meshed, as they hoped to achieve what they required by establishing posts in Afghanistan with the goodwill of the Afghan Prime Minister.

He was proposing to take advantage of the offer made by His Highness the Aga Khan, to place his followers at the disposal of the Indian Government. There were a number of these living in Gilgit and on the Russian border, from whom valuable information might be obtained. Prince Ali Khan was coming to see him shortly, and he intended to attach him to the Central Intelligence Bureau in India.

The War Cabinet : 

(a) Took note of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State

for India.

(b) Approved the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff

Committee, and the line of action proposed by the Secretary of State for India.

India and the War.

(Previous Reference: W.M.&apos; (39) 29th Conclusions, Minute 12.)

Relations with Congress.

Proposal for an All-Parties Conference.

16. The Secretary of State for India drew the attention of the War Cabinet to the exchange of telegrams with the Viceroy annexed to his Memorandum W.P. (G.) (39) 24. It would be seen that the Viceroy was fully seized of the views of the War Cabinet, and would not commit them to any embarrassing statement. The Viceroy was anxious to avoid a break with Congress if it was at all possible. Since the matter was last considered by the War Cabinet, he had received a report of a three-hour discussion which the Viceroy had had with Gandhi. The impression left with the Viceroy had been that it would be very difficult to avoid a break with Congress. The Secretary of State for India had, however, subsequently heard that Gandhi had regarded the talk as satisfactory. The Viceroy was seeing Nehru and Rajenda Prasad to-morrow, and he expected the position might develop quickly.

He asked the approval of the War Cabinet for the Viceroy to issue a statement on the general lines indicated in Memorandum W.P. (G.) (39) 24, and in particular, contingent approval, in the event of a break with Congress, for the Viceroy to call an All-Parties Conference, in order to put us right with public opinion in India, and also with opinion in neutral countries, particularly in the United States. Such a Conference should show the hollow-ness of the claim of Congress to speak for India and would be likely to secure the support of the Muslims and the Princes.

In answer to questions he stated that he regarded as negligible the risk of a united front between the parties which might present demands which would be impossible to concede.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he thought there were strong advantages in the plan of working the proposed consultative committee on the lines of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which would enable the Viceroy to associate people from all sides of Indian life with the Government.

[20097]


276

The question whether any confidential information could be given with safety to members of such committees, was discussed. The Secretary of State for India said that it was not the intention to give military news of a confidential character, but information of a general character; and he recalled Lord Chatfield&apos;s view, with which he was in agreement, that the public and leaders in India were extremely ignorant on questions of defence.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that Indian politicians would probably be immensely impressed with generalities.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) to authorise the Viceroy, in the event of a break with

Congress, to call an All-Parties Conference: (ii) that, whether or not there were a break with Congress, the Viceroy should be authorised to issue a statement as to the intentions and aims of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to India, on the general lines proposed in Memorandum W.P. (G.) (39) 24 :

(iii) that the nature of the statement would necessarily depend

on the attitude of Congress, namely, whether there was some hope of co-operation, or whether a break with them became inevitable :

(iv) that the Viceroy should communicate the draft terms of

the statement for consideration by the War Cabinet.

India and Burma at the Outbreak of War.

17.   The War Cabinet took note of the following Reports : 

Fortnightly Report (No. 1) by the Secretary of State for

India (W.P. (R.) (39) 5): Fortnightly Report (No. 1) by the Secretary of State for

Burma (W.P. (R.) (39) 6).

Ministry of Information.

Arrangements for distribution of news and censorship. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 31st Conclusions, Minute 14.)

18. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of a statement (Paper W.P. (39) 62) to be made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, setting out new arrangements proposed for part of the work hitherto carried out by the Ministry of Information. Under these proposals the various Departments would in future, themselves be responsible for furnishing their own official communications to the press, and the press representatives would have direct contact with each of them. The work of censorship would continue to be housed in the building occupied by the Ministry of Information, but the responsibility for censorship would in future rest with the Department concerned with the subject matter of any particular item of news.

The Minister of Information said that, while the press generally welcomed the proposed return to the peace-time practice whereby press representatives would have direct contact with the various Government Departments, there was a strong desire, especially on the part of the Foreign and Overseas press, and the less important Home papers, for the continuation of the facilities for the distribution of news which had been set up under the roof of the Ministry of Information. He would like to see the draft statement amended so as to emphasise rather more strongly that these facilities would be continued.

It was emphasised that the Government communications which it was proposed should continue to be issued from the Ministry of Information would be official statements for verbatim reproduction.
