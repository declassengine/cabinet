W.M. 50 (39).

Ate Operations. 1. The Secretary of State for Air gave to the War Cabinet (Previous        details of the air raid which had been made on Rosyth the previous

Reference: day.

W.M. (39) 49th A reconnaissance had first been carried out in the morning by Conclusions, an enemy aircraft, which had been intercepted and attacked, but Minute 1.) had escaped in the clouds. The raid began at 2-15 p.m., and fighter patrols were already in the air. Owing to a defect which had developed in the R.D.F. station, Headquarters Fighter Command received the first intimation of the raid from the Admiralty. As the raid was already in progress, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief had decided not to issue an air raid warning.

The raid was carried out with Heinkel 111 and Dornier 215 aircraft, the latter being the latest type of German bomber. They were engaged by three Auxiliary Air Force squadrons, two armed with Spitfires, and one with Gladiators. The enemy, who numbered about 10 or 12, approached singly or in pairs. Four were known to have been shot down, though it was probable that more had been accounted for. The enemy&apos;s speed varied from 230 to 260 m.p.h. which was much less than the speed of our fighters. The result reflected great credit on the Auxiliary Squadrons concerned.

The Secretary of Stats for Air said that units of the 3rd Antiaircraft Division were engaged, and fired 104 rounds in all. One aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire.

There was some discussion whether, if an attack developed before an air raid warning had been issued, it was nevertheless desirable to issue a warning. It was generally agreed that it was desirable to do so. Failure to do so in this instance had in fact resulted in a number of people being exposed to unnecessary risk.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Nayal 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had news

Operations. of an air raid in progress at Scapa Flow, and warnings had been (Previous given at Rosyth and the Humber, though these were probably on

Reference:       account of reconnaissance aircraft.

W.M. (39) 49th The Iron Duke, which had been demilitarised under the Naval Conclusions, Treaty, and was now in use as a depot ship in Scapa, had been hit. Minute 3.)       She was not armoured, and after the hit, had developed a list but

had been beached.   There were no casualties, but one of the enemy

aircraft had been shot down.

Some discussion ensued as to the best operational base for battle

cruisers, and as to the progress made in the Scapa A.A. defences.

The First Lord reported that a detached squadron of warships carrying bullion had arrived safely at Halifax. No British merchant ships had been sunk in the previous twenty-four hours, but one Danish and one Greek ship had been sunk.

There was still no sign of the submarine which was assumed to have sunk the Royal Oak in Scapa Flow.

A number of German submarines had been attacked, some with hopeful results.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Eire. 3.   Arising out of the discussion in Minute 2, the First Lord

Use of Ports as of the A dmiralty said that the incidents of the last 24 hours had

naval bases. brought to a head the question, which had been discussed already

(Previous in the War Cabinet, of the use of Lough Swilly and Berehaven.

Reference: The Fleet must be provided with alternative harbours. Lough

W.M. (39) 48th Swilly was 100 miles further off from Germany, and to get to it

Conclusions, aircraft must fly right across Great Britain.  Berehaven would be

Minute 3.) valuable as an alternative anchorage for the Fleet, and would also

[20171] b 2


412

greatly facilitate the work of our anti-submarine forces. Now that German submarines were operating further out into the Atlantic, the journey backwards and forwards from Milford Haven was a strain on our anti-submarine vessels, which would be much relieved if they could put in at Berehaven, which was 140 miles nearer the scene of their operations.  Flying boats could also be based there.

The time had come to make it clear to the Irish Government that we must have the use of these harbours, and intended in any case to use them.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he saw no reason to think that the Eire Government would willingly agree to the use of ports in Southern Ireland by the British Fleet.

A discussion ensued as to the best method of handling the matter. It was suggested that the Prime Minister might have an interview with Mr. de Valera. On the other hand, it was thought to be unwise to suggest discussions in London, since this would make it easy for Mr. de Valera to say that he had been subjected to undue pressure. We might well secure better terms from discussion in Dublin. While recognising the importance of obtaining our requirements in this matter, it was felt that the Dominions Secretary should be given an opportunity of advising on the best means of approaching the Eire Government.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(a) that, from the naval point of view, it was of the utmost

importance to secure the use of Lough Swilly and Berehaven for the British Fleet;

(b) to invite the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to

advise as to the best method of approaching the Government of Eire on the subject;

(c) to invite the First Lord of the Admiralty to formulate the

reasons for (a), together with such arguments derived from German attacks on merchant shipping as would be likely to appeal to Mr. de Valera.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 49th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said that the .Germans had attacked on the previous day East of the Luxemburg border with a strength of about one division. The attack appeared to have the limited objective of gaining some high ground, probably as a preliminary to later attacks on a larger scale. It was understood that the French had withdrawn from the position without loss, but a detailed official account of the operations had not yet been received.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Turco-Soviet to the following telegrams dated the 16th October, 1939, received Conversations from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, in regard to the and the Anglo- discussions in Moscow between M. Stalin and M. Sarajoglu, the Franco-Turkish Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, concerning the proposed Treaty. Turco-Soviet Pact and Anglo-Turkish Treaty :  .

(Previous Telegram No. 399, reporting that it had been arranged for

Eeference: M. Sarajoglu to be received by M. Stalin at 4 p.m. that day

W.M. (39) 49th (16th October, 1939); this interview would presumably show Conclusions, whether the Government of the U.S.S.R. intended to make

Minute 9.) further proposals or whether they were prepared to accept the

draft put forward by the Turkish Government;

Telegram No. 402, reporting a conversation between Sir William Seeds and M. Sarajoglu at which the latter had read out the proposed amendments of the text of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty.


413

W.M. 50 (39).

The Secretary of State added that the position was still not altogether clear. The draft under discussion was that prepared by M. Sarajoglu, which appeared to be satisfactory. It was proposed that Article 2 should provide for consultation in the event of aggression against the Balkans of a kind which might be regarded as threatening Turkey or the U.S.S.R. This appeared to mean that in the event of a Balkan State suffering aggression from a non-Balkan Power (as opposed to a war between two or more Balkan Powers) we should consult with the Turkish Government, who in turn would consult with the Government of the U.S.S.R., a procedure which would be tantamount almost to consultation between ourselves and the U.S.S.R. As regards the Mediterranean, the position under the new draft was the same as under the previous one. The substance of the provisions contained in Article 3 of the previous draft was now, it appeared, to be transferred to a Protocol. There had not been time yet to receive a report of the upshot of the discussions the previous day (16th October, 1939) between M. Stalin and M. Sarajoglu.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Far Eastern Situation.

(Previous Eeferenee: W.M. (39) 46th Conclusions, Minute 8.) Policy, of the United States Government.

6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to the following telegrams dated the 16th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, regarding a probable change in the policy of the United States Government towards Japan : 

Telegram No. 1383. Mr. Grew, the United States Ambassador at Tokyo, on his return to Japan from the United States, had informed Sir Robert Craigie that public opinion in the United States was steadily hardening against Japan, not only in official circles, but in almost every section of opinion. He (Mr. Grew) believed personally that, if Japan failed to show greater regard to United States interests in China between now and the end of the year, an embargo of essential Japanese imports from the United States would be imposed on the expiration of the commercial treaty. The Administration did not appear to be deterred by the warning that he had given that no such steps should be taken unless in the last resort the United States were prepared to go to war.

Telegram No. 1384. Mr. Grew had appeared to Sir Robert Craigie somewhat depressed by the strength of anti-Japanese feeling in the United States, but he (Sir Robert) had expressed the firm opinion that, once the Japanese were convinced that the United States meant business, they would find ways and means of meeting American wishes without allowing matters to come to a climax. In the same telegram, Sir Robert expressed the view that it would be most undesirable for us to lay ourselves open to the accusation of seeking accommodation with Japan at a moment when the United States Government were really contemplating stronger measures, though on the other hand we must be careful not to drive Japan into alliance either, with Germany or the U.S.S.R. He (Sir Robert) accordingly recommended that no further initiative should be taken by us in regard to the resumption of the Tientsin negotiations, and that any plan which might exist for the withdrawal from China of troops or ships should be, for the time being, held in abeyance.

The Tientsin The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was

Garrison. vital that we should not give the United States Government an

opportunity of accusing us of having weakened in our attitude towards Japan, just when they were proposing to take stronger action, and he accordingly proposed that day to send a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, setting out generally [20171] b 3


414

the conclusions which we had reached regarding the policy to be adopted in China in relation to the Japanese, and asking him to communicate this information confidentially to the United States Government. Our general object should be to try to persuade the United States Government to accept our decision with a good will. Pending the receipt of a reply from Lord Lothian, he hoped that action in regard to the proposed withdrawal of our garrison from Tientsin might be postponed.

The Secretary of State for War said that he hoped that the delay involved would not be long, since, on military grounds, he would be glad to see the withdrawal from Tientsin carried out as soon as, possible. He agreed, however, that it was essential that nothing should be done which would seriously antagonise the United States Government.

The War Cabinet 

(a) took note that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposed at once to inform the United States Government, through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, of the general policy proposed to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in China in relation to the Japanese Government;

(6) agreed that, pending the receipt of the observations of the United States Government, the decision to withdraw the British garrison from Tientsin should be held in abeyance.

Germany. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, while

(Previous the most varied rumours were abroad, he had received no official

Reference: indication as to the reaction by the German Government to the

W.M. (39) 47th statement made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons

Conclusions, defining the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards a peace

Minute 9.) settlement.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Germany. 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the

Stocks and       Chiefs of Staff covering the Report of a Sub-Committee on German supplies of       Stocks and Supplies of Petroleum Products (Paper W.P. (39) 90). petroleum The Secretary for Mines said that the Report had been

products. prepared by a Committee under his Chairmanship, in pursuance

of a request by the Chief of the Air Staff. He understood that the Air Staff had based certain plans on an earlier report on the German oil position. Recently, however, somewhat conflicting information on the subject had been brought to their notice. The Committee had therefore been set up to examine all available information, in order to determine Germany&apos;s oil position as closely as possible.

A full discussion of the Report ensued. The points which called for particular comment were as follows : 

Paragraph 2.

The Secretary for Mines emphasised that it had been necessary to base results of the investigations, to some extent, on reasonable assumption. The position was continually changing and should, he suggested, be kept under constant review. s^Sfih

Total Stocks, paragraph 3.

The total of 3,000,000 tons was based on stocks being 75 per cent, of estimated tankage. This was a very high figure, even for oil in Government tankage not subject to a turnover.


415

W.M. 50 (39).

Synthetic Production, paragraph 6.

The First Lord of the Admiralty emphasised the large output of individual synthetic plants.

Possible Russian Exports, paragraph 7.

The Lord Privy Seal suggested that an attempt might be made to purchase Russian oil.

The Minister for Economic Warfare did not think that it would be possible for us to obtain oil, except in exchange for such commodities as tin, which we did not wish to let Russia have.

It was pointed out that Russia no longer exported any appreciable quantities of oil.

Contraband Control Measures, paragraph 11.

The Minister for Economic Warfare said that undoubtedly a certain amount of oil was reaching Germany as a result of evasion of our contraband control measures. Italy was the danger-spot. He thought that our contraband control measures would have to be considerably strengthened to prove really effective. Some delay was. he thought, inevitable before we could stop oil reaching Germany through Italy.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that the Italian Government would be unwilling to interfere with existing contracts. He understood, however, that their contracts for the supply of oil to Germany ended on the 31st December. It seemed clear from the Report that the oil question was a vital one for Germany, and he asked whether the Ministry of Economic Warfare were satisfied that they had all the machinery that they required to deal with what was perhaps the most important aspect of our blockade.

The Minister for Economic Warfare thought that some expansion of his organisation would be necessary to deal effectively with the matter. It was of supreme importance to get the fullest possible information. At present, he obtained his information from both consular and secret sources, but proper co-ordination was lacking. He suggested that a Committee, under a War Cabinet Minister, should review the whole matter.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the Ministry would require some strengthening in their Intelligence Section at home, and further means for obtaining information from abroad.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that there was a strong case for buying up oil wherever we could obtain it.

The Prime Minister suggested that the Minister without Portfolio and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should keep the matter under constant review and inform the Cabinet as necessary.

The War Cabinet 

(a) Took note of the Report (Paper W.P. (39) 90).

(b) Invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the

Minister without Portfolio to keep under constant review, in consultation with the Departments concerned, the action being taken to prevent oil supplies from reaching Germany and the organisation required for this purpose; and to keep the War Cabinet informed of the position.


416

The Chartering of Neutral Tonnage.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) Conclusions, Minute 11.)

47th

9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on the urgency of chartering neutral tonnage (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 37) setting out the advantages of obtaining control of the bulk of neutral tonnage, both in the interests of our own import trade, and also in order to control German imports and exports with the minimum of search and friction.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was no dispute as to the urgency of chartering such neutral tonnage as we could secure. The difficulty was to decide as to the best method of doing so.

The First Lord of the Admiralty stressed the importance of making contracts for as long a period as possible, in case rates should be raised further against us.

The Minister of Shipping mentioned that the Swiss in their chartering of Greek ships were themselves carrying the war risks. It was agreed that we should not in the first stages of our negotiations make any similar offer, but should keep this in reserve as a concession to be made later if necessary.

In regard to the negotiations with Norway, the President of the Board of Trade reported that our use of the &apos;&apos; big stick &apos;&apos; seemed to have been effective. There was no doubt that the delegation which was leaving Norway on the 21st October meant business, though there was equally no doubt that they would ask for higher rates than we had offered. He hoped that the delegation would arrive on the 23rd October and that it would be possible to reach agreement fairly quickly.

The Minister of Shipping said that in connection with these negotiations it would be helpful to him to know when our convoys for the Norwegian trade would start again.

The First Lord of the Admiralty could not give any definite date, but said that it was hoped to resume these convoys soon.

In reply to a question by the Minister without Portfolio, the President of the Board of Trade said that it had proved quite impossible to charter any Dutch tonnage, not even small vessels for carrying cargoes up the French rivers.

The Minister of Shipping outlined the position in regard to the negotiations for Greek tonnage. We had threatened to deny the Greeks bunkerage and other shipping facilities if they had not accepted our offer by that very day (the 17th October). There was some risk that, if we did not put our threat into operation, they would not believe any threats which we might make in future. On the other hand, we could fairly say that in our earlier negotiations we had not allowed the Greek Government sufficient time to consider the matter. He therefore proposed to see the Greek Minister and to tell him that, in order to allow more time for consultation between the Greek Government and their shipping owners, we were prepared to postpone our punitive action, for a few days. When negotiations were resumed, we might have to offer a higher figure than had previously been suggested. We should make it quite clear that any such offer was final and that, if it were not accepted by the Greeks, we should deny them all shipping facilities so far as we were able to do so.  This course was approved.

The Minister for Economic Warfare reported that Danish exports to England were being started again from Esbjerg. This was because it was in Germany&apos;s interests to allow this trade to continue, in order to secure her own imports of food-stuffs from Denmark.


417

W.M. 30 (39).

The War Cabinet 

(a) Took note of the position reached in the negotiations for chartering Norwegian tonnage.

(6) As regards the negotiations for Creek tonnage, invited the Minister of Shipping to see the Greek Minister and to offer to postpone for a few days our denial of bunkerage and shipping facilities, and to indicate that we might be prepared to consider a counter-offer if it were made at an early date.
