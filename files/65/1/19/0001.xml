W.M. 19 (39).

Air Operations. 1. The Secretary of State for Air said there were no (Previous particular matters to report. Reconnaissance of Sylt had given Eeference: negative information. The reports of an enemy concentration at W.M. (39) 18th Glucksburg were unlikely to be true, as there was only a small land-Conclusions, ing ground there.

The Minister for Home Security said that considerable damage had been caused at Barking power station, as a result of short circuits caused by the break-away of some of the balloons of the London barrage. He enquired whether any steps could be taken to prevent balloons from breaking away when there were electrical disturbances.

The Secretary of State for Air undertook to investigate the matter.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War

Situation. Cabinet that His Majesty&apos;s Aircraft-carrier Courageous had been

(Previous torpedoed 330 miles West of Land&apos;s End, at 8 p.m. the night before,

Reference: and had sunk. The vessel was accompanied by an escort of four W.M. (39) 18th destroyers, two of which had gone off to assist a merchantman that Conclusion!,, had been attacked. It was believed that the other two destroyers Minute 2.)       had sunk the submarine which had attacked the Courageous.

No details were yet available of the loss of life, but it was probably considerable. The ship carried two squadrons of aircraft, and the loss was particularly serious in view of the large number of specialist personnel included in the complement of that type of vessel. The Admiralty proposed to publish the loss, as it could not be kept entirely secret.

The Courageous had been employed on trade protection in the Western Approaches. The A rk Royal was also at sea for the same purpose, and the Hermes was at present back in port.

A discussion then took place as to whether the operations of aircraft-carriers in the protection of trade were of sufficient value to outweigh the risk of their loss. It was pointed out that the Ark Royal, which had already been unsuccessfully attacked, was the only modern aircraft-carrier in the world. She was equipped with every modern device, and carried a complement of highly trained personnel. Although it was true that aircraft from the carriers had carried out a number of attacks on submarines, it should be remembered that the number of unaccompanied ships passing through the dangerous areas was falling every day, as the convoy system was gradually being put into operation.

It was generally agreed that, although it was undesirable to interfere with the discretion of the Commander-in-Chief, a message should be sent to him indicating that the view was held that in present circumstances it would be desirable to withdraw the Ark Royal from trade protection.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that this occurrence had drawn attention once more to the shortage of destroyers from which we were suffering. As soon as the United States Neutrality Act had been repealed, he thought we should do everything in our power to purchase destroyers from the United States. They had a large number in their Navy, and even if we could only secure 20 of their old vessels, they would be of the greatest assistance to us.

Another method by which we could obtain some relief would be if we could use Berehaven, from which port we could operate long-range flying-boats and destroyers. The French were not in a position to turn over any destroyers to us.

[20020] b 2


148

There had been three sinkings of merchant vessels in the previous 24 hours, and three attacks on enemy submarines, the results of which were uncertain.

He had paid a visit to the Fleet over the week-end, and had found the Commander-in-Chief confident, and a cheerful spirit prevailing.

The War Cabinet: 

(a) took note of the above statement;

(b) invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to send a signal to

the Commander-in-Chief in the sense indicated in the discussion as to the employment of the Ark Royal on trade protection duties.

The Military 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that no definite

Situation in report of the fall of Warsaw had yet been received. Fighting was Poland. still going on at a number of places in Poland.

(Previous The Russian advance into Poland seemed to have cut the line

Eeference: of retreat of the main body of the Polish army into Roum&apos;ania. The W.M. (39) 18th Polish Government were believed to have escaped into Roumania. Conclusions, Further reference was made to the Galician oilfields. A

Minute 3.)       Summary of the discussion is recorded on the Secretary&apos;s standard file of Conclusions.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff emphasised the serious military implications of the action taken by Russia. In this connection the Secretary of State for War expressed the view that the Empire was faced with a situation of grave peril, and he thought that the country should be stirred to make far greater efforts and submit to far greater sacrifices than were at present contemplated. Greater efforts were called for in the field of production, more particularly of land armaments.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The Military Situation in France.

(Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 18th Conclusions, Minute 4.)

4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there was nothing special to report regarding the military situation in France.

Some discussion took place in connection with the report that the Germans were constructing two batteries of 24-inch Howitzers for the bombardment of the Maginot Line. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he would investigate this report and discuss the matter with the French Military Authorities.

The War Cabinet took note of this Statement.

Staff Conversations with Belgium.

(Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 16th Conclusions, Minute 13.)

5. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on Staff Conversations with Belgium (W.P. (39) 32).

The Chief of the Air Staff and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained to the War Cabinet the military implications of a German advance through the Low Countries and of the action which we should need to take in order to make co-operation between ourselves and the Belgian Army effective. (A fuller account of the discussion on this point is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of Conclusions.)

The Foreign Secretary said that he had considered further the question that a special emissary should go to Brussels, and had reached the conclusion that such an emissary would be unlikely to


149

W.M. 19 (39).

109

make any progress. On the other hand, he thought that, if discussions on this matter were to be initiated by Sir Robert Clive, it was essential that he should first return to London to receive instructions. The Foreign Secretary also explained the stage which had been reached in our approach to the Belgian Government. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Brussels had taken some tentative soundings which had not been unfavourably received. In these circumstances, the letter which it had previously been intended should be sent from The King to King Leopold had been held up in the hopes that our Ambassador might be successful in inducing the Belgians to start conversations at an early date.

In the ensuing discussion it was agreed that the time factor was all-important.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) to approve the report by the Chiefs of Staff on Staff

Conversations with Belgium (W.P. (39) 32);

(b) to take note that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels

had made a preliminary contact with the Belgian Government, and that, consequently, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had decided to hold up the despatch of a letter from The King to King Leopold;

(c) that Sir Robert Clive should return to London to receive

guidance as to the strategical reasons which, in our view, made it essential that there should be Staff Conversations between this country and Belgium.

Armament 6.   The,Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet that

Supplies to the steamship Laselle was due at Istanbul on the 19th September Poland. with a shipment of aircraft and armaments for Poland.   In view

(Previous of the collapse of Polish resistance and the unlikelihood of the

Reference:        arms being put to good use by the Roumanians, the Chiefs of Staff W.M. (39) 17th took the view that it would be best to hand them over to the Turks Conclusions,      as a bargaining counter in the negotiations for the Treaty. The Minute 6 (ii).)   steamship Clan Menzies and the steamship Robur VIII with further consignments of arms for Poland were due to sail on the 19th and 20th September respectively, and the Chiefs of Staff recommended that these ships should be allowed to sail, but that they should call at Gibraltar and Malta for orders.

A discussion ensued as to whether the armaments in the Laselle should be handed over unconditionally to the Turks, or whether they should be used        bargaining counter.

The Prime Minister took the view that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Ankara should be given discretion in this matter and be instructed to exploit the arrival of the Laselle at Istanbul to the best advantage possible.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Ankara should be given details of the consignment of aircraft and armaments due to arrive at Istanbul in steamship Laselle on the 19th September (this information should be supplied to the Foreign Office by the Air Ministry); (ii) that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should be given discretion as to how to deal with this consignment of arms, and should be at liberty, if he thought fit, to hand the arms over without waiting for the conclusion of the Treaty with Turkey;

[20020] B 3


150

(iii) that it should be suggested to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador

that he might indicate that these arms had originally been allocated to Poland, but were not now to be forwarded to Poland; that there was a.possibility that they might be sent to Roumania; that further consignments were on the way; but that, if it was clear that the Turkish Government meant business, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad that the Turkish Government should have this consignment of arms;

(iv) that a decision as to the destination of the further arma-

ments supplies originally destined for Poland in steamships Robur V III and Clan Menzies should be deferred, but that these ships should sail according to schedule, calling for instructions at Gibraltar and Malta.

Neutrality of : 7.   The -War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the

Eire. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (39) 34), to which

(Previous        was annexed a statement by the High Commissioner of Eire pur-Eeference:       porting to set out the rules* which the Government of Eire intended W.M. (39) 16th to apply in relation to belligerent ships and aircraft in order to Conclusions,      maintain their neutral status.  The question at issue was whether Minute 4.)       we should make any immediate requests to the Government of Eire for a more ;helpful attitude, or whether we should acquiesce in the position which that Government desired to take up under its neutrality proposals.

In the course of discussion, The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the position was profoundly unsatisfactory from their point of view. In particular, they were anxious that the facilities of Berehaven should be available to the Navy.

On the other hand, it was generally agreed that it would be very undesirable that there should be an open difference between this country and Eire at the present moment. Mr. de Valera was always harking back to the subject of partition, but it was out of the question to make any concession, even by way of form, to him on this matter. The most likely way of securing his more active co-operation would be to leave it to the course of events to show that this was demanded by the interests of Eire.

It was stated that, if the Government of Eire were to continue their present policy, anti-Irish feeling in this country might well become very difficult to control.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should continue his negotiations on the basis of the third course set out in his Memorandum, viz., acquiescence for the time being in the Government of Eire&apos;s proposals,^pn certain,conditions,;, (ii) that, in the further message which Sir John Maffey should take to Eire fjrom the.Prime,Minister and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, it should be made clear that the-present situation might rapidly become a very grave one, in which the questions at issue.would be not matters of politics, but of vital concern to this country.

Soviet Invasion of Poland.

Position under Anglo-Polish Pact. . (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 18th Conclusions,, Minute 8.)

, 8,. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs confirmed the statement made to the War Cabinet on his behalf at the previous meeting, that the provisions of the Anglo-Polish Agreement would not come into operation as a result of the aggression of the Soviet Government against Poland.

The Agreement provided for action to be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government if Poland suffered aggression &quot; from a European Power &quot;; but


151

W.M. 19 (39).

110

X

Question of a Protest to be made in Moscow.

there existed a Secret Protocol by which the British and Polish Governments recognised that the European Power referred to in the Agreement was Germany. There was, therefore, no obligation on Great Britain to become involved in war with the U.S.S.R. as a result of the Soviet invasion of Poland.

The Prime Minister said that he thought it desirable that a statement should be issued to-day declaring that His Majesty&apos;s Government had learned with indignation and horror of the action taken by the Government of the U.S.S.R. in invading Polish territory, that this action neither altered in any way the position in this country in relation to Poland nor weakened the obligations which we had solemnly undertaken towards Poland. Although the Soviet aggression had added a further tragedy to the history of Poland, His Majesty&apos;s Government still retained complete confidence that, on the conclusion of the war, Poland would be restored.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Polish Ambassador had informed him that the Polish Government hoped that we should instruct our Ambassador in Moscow to protest to the Government of the U.S.S.R. against the action which they had taken. The general feeling of the War Cabinet was against this course, the view being taken that the declaration suggested by the Prime Minister should be regarded as embodying our condemnation of the action of the Soviet Government.

Later in the meeting, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that he had just been informed that the French Government were extremely anxious that a formal protest should be made to Moscow, and desired that we should concert with them as to the wording to be employed.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) to take note, that under the Anglo-Polish Agreement, Great

Britain was not bound by the Treaty to become involved in war with the U.S.S.R. as a result of their aggression against Poland, the British and Polish Governments having agreed that that Agreement was directed exclusively against Germany:

(b) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should

arrange for the issue this afternoon, of a declaration condemning the action of the Soviet Government, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in the course of the discussion as summarised at X above, it being understood that, nothwithstanding (c) below, no reference should be included in the statement to the formal protest proposed to be made in Moscow:

(c) that, if the French Government pressed their request that a

formal protest should be made in Moscow, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to concert with them the terms of the protest, on the following lines : 

(i) that His Majesty&apos;s Government took note of the com-

munication made by the Government of the U.S.S.R. with regard to their decision to move troops into Poland, but that they must formulate the fullest possible reserves in regard to this action, which was in plain violation of the treaties solemnly entered into by the Soviet Government I

(ii) that   His   Majesty&apos;s   Government energetically

repudiated the statement in the note handed by the Soviet Government to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, that the Polish Government had ceased to exist, and that on the contrary, His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised the Polish Government as the Government of Poland :


152

(iii) that His Majesty&apos;s Government took note of the declaration of the Soviet Government that they proposed to pursue a policy of neutrality towards the Governments with which they had diplomatic relations.

The Position of 9. The Chief of the Air Staff asked that arrangements might the British De made to secure diplomatic protection for the members of the Military Mission British Military Mission to Poland, so as to prevent them being to Poland.        interned in Roumania.    Some of the officers concerned have been

definitely attached to the staff of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,

Warsaw, but others have not.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook at once to look into this matter and to take such action as was possible.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Japanese-Soviet 10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Relations. Japanese Ambassador had called at the Foreign Office on the previous Saturday (16th September, 1939) and had given a most solemn assurance that the agreement reached between the Japanese and the Soviet Governments was strictly limited to a settlement of the local problems on the Mongolian-Manchukuo frontier, and was not to be taken as indicating any fresh orientation of Japanese policy. The Ambassador had undertaken to deliver to the Foreign Office to-day a detailed memorandum on this subject. The Secretary of .State added that, while it was impossible to speak with certainty, he and his advisers were inclined to believe in the genuineness of the Ambassador&apos;s assurances.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Far Eastern       11-   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he Situation.        was anxious to reach an agreement with the Japanese Government (Previous        *n regard to the position in Tientsin, and that the settlement of this Reference-       question now turned upon the possibility of reaching agreement as WM (39) 16th to the disposal of the Chinese silver now held in Tientsin. A Conclusions      suggestion had been made that it might be possible to hand over this Minute 12)      silver to the Japanese, provided that they agreed to employ it exclusively for the relief of Chinese distress in the flooded provinces of China, and were prepared to give adequate guarantees to this end. This suggestion had been put to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, who had replied welcoming this proposal, which he thought would be acceptable to the Japanese Government.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to reach an agreement with the Japanese Government on the lines indicated in his statement as summarised above, provided that he was satisfied as to the nature of the guarantees to be afforded by the Japanese Government.

The Balkans. 12.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a

153

W.M. 19 (39).

13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 465, dated the 17th September, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, stating that he believed that it would be possible to secure the agreement of the Turkish Government to the proposed treaty, if we increased by  11 millions the credit which we proposed to give for the purchase of war material.

In the discussion which ensued, the following considerations were brought forward : 

(i) on the one hand, it appeared from telegram No. 467, dated

the 17th September, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, that the Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Office had stated emphatically to the French Ambassador that the Turkish Government hoped to sign a treaty with us in the next few days, and that in any case nothing would be signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Moscow unless the Turkish Government had already signed their treaty with us, or did so simultaneously. This suggested that the Turkish Government were genuinely anxious to reach agreement with us;

(ii) on the other hand, the statement at the end of paragraph 4

of telegram No. 465, referred to above, appeared to imply that, while the Turkish Government were now prepared to sign the treaty, they were only willing to do so if the financial agreement, to be signed simultaneously, provided that Turkey would not be obliged to take action under the treaty (i.e., to go to war) until she had been adequately supplied with war material. It was essential, therefore, if the treaty were now to be signed, to make sure what were the immediate obligations which Turkey was agreeing&quot; to incur;

(iii) that, in view of the length of time covered by the present

negotiations, the danger that, if they were not brought to a head, we might lose the alliance with Turkey, and even that Turkey might sign a pact with the U.S.S.R,, inconsistent with their alliance with us, it was essential that every possible step should be taken at once to bring the negotiations to a successful issue, even if this course of action involved some risk.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should address a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, stating 

(a) that, while, as indicated in (ii) of the summary of the

discussion given above, His Majesty&apos;s Government entertained certain apprehensions as to the extent to which the Turkish Government regarded themselves as bound to take immediate action following the signing of the proposed treaty, they attached the greatest importance, on general grounds, to securing the definite acceptance of the treaty by the Turkish Government at the earliest possible moment;

(b) that the Ambassador was accordingly authorised, as

recommended in paragraph 4 of his telegram No. 465, to increase the British share of the proposed credit for raw material from  10 millions to  21 millions (the total credit for war material, including the  4 millions offered by the French, will thus be  25 millions);


154

(c) that, in the circumstances indicated above, His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly hoped that it would now be possible for him to secure forthwith definite acceptance of the treaty by the Turkish Government.

Trade Relations with U.S.S.R.

The Consignment of Timber from, and Machine Tools to, Russia. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 16th Conclusions, Minute 15.)

14. The War Cabinet had before them a statement by the Minister of Supply (W.P. (G) (39) 13) setting out the very urgent need for timber on the one liana, and, on the other, the importance to the armaments industry of the machine tools and plant.

The altered situation in regard to the Soviet Union was discussed. It was pointed out that it appeared that information from Moscow indicated that the Soviet Government was putting no embargo on exports, but that it would be necessary to pay for any exports in advance by dollars in a neutral bank (see telegram No. 285 from Moscow). I1 he Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to consider this latter suggestion.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) that it was essential that no tools which could be used in * the   machine-tool   industry   (paragraph   (2)   1 of W.P. (G) (39) 13) should be allowed to leave this country;

(ii) that it was desirable to re-examine the tools referred to

in paragraph (2) 2 of W.P. (G) (39) 13, and to retain any considered to be really essential ;

(iii) that any tools special to Russian requirements, referred

to in paragraph (2) 3 of W.P. (G) (39) 13, should be released, together with any under (ii) above, considered to be non-essential;

(iv) that any plant or machinery suitable for Admiralty

purposes should be retained;

(v) that it was essential to endeavour to obtain supplies of

softwood in view of the acute shortage, and that Russia appeared to be the only practicable source for an immediate supply of any considerable quantity;

(vi) that an approach should therefore be made to the Govern-

ment of the Soviet Union to see whether they would be prepared to ship timber in consideration of : 

(a) release of any machinery or plant which was not

covered by the requirements set out in (i), (ii) and (iv) above; and

(b) payment for the timber by dollars in advance in a

neutral bank (this last point to be subject to further consideration by the Treasury);

(vii) that a draft telegram giving instructions to Sir William

Seeds should be prepared by the Treasury, Board of Trade, Ministry of Supply and Ministry of Economic Warfare, in consultation with the Foreign Office, to implement the above recommendation in (vi).

Ministerial Statement.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) Conclusions. Minute 8.)

15. The Prime Minister invited the three Service Ministers and the Home Secretary to arrange for the preparation of passages dealing with the general situation, suitable for inclusion in his speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday, 20th September. 12th It would be convenient if these passages could reacb No. 10, Downing Street, by 6 p.m. on Tuesday, 19th September.
