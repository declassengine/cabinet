Minute 1.)

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War

Situation. Cabinet that news had just reached him that a whaler had been (Previous torpedoed east of the Shetlands. This was the first British ship Reference:       sunk by submarine for 14 days.

W.M. (39) 36th        The report that the crew of the Greek ship (the Diamantis) Conclusions,      sunk in the Channel two days previously had taken to their boats, Minute 2.)       had since been shown to be unfounded.   The crew had been&apos; taken on board the German submarine responsible for the sinking, which had landed them at Dingle Bay.   This news had been telephoned by Sir John Maffey within an hour and a half of its happening.

Two British mines had been driven ashore at Dover by rough seas, causing considerable explosions, but no casualties.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Salvage of 3.   The Prime Minister asked what progress had been made

H.M.S. Thetis,   with the salvage of the Thetis and whether anything had been discovered which might help Mr. Justice Bucknill&apos;s inquiry.

The First Lord of the Admiralty and The Chief of Naval Staff explained that it had not yet been possible to beach the Thetis. Work was being done on her from stern to bow and it was thought that the most important evidence regarding the cause of the accident would be found after examination of the torpedo compartment in the bow, which had not yet been reached. The effect of the acid on the interior of the Thetis Was such as to make it impossible to use the vessel as a warship.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

4. The Secretary of State for War said that the transfer of the Second Corps to France had now been completed. The troops which we had undertaken to send to France had now all been transported, and within the stipulated period, but there were certain additional units still to be transported. He took the opportunity to express the thanks of the War Office to the Admiralty for the protection which they had offered, and which had resulted in the passage of these Divisions being carried out without a single casualty, or a hitch of any kind. The Secretary of State for Air associated himself with this expression of thanks.

It was agreed that the First Lord of the Admiralty should send a private message of appreciation to the responsible Flotilla Leaders.

The Secretary of State for War read extracts from a personal letter from Lord Gort describing the general situation of our Army in France. Lord Gort was definitely of the opinion that the Germans, in their attack on the Western Front, would make full use of their Air Force against our troops. He therefore advocated that we should at once send the anti-aircraft batteries and fighters for which the French were asking, the more so as there was evidence that the French would expect us to increase our land effort.

A discussion ensued as to whether publicity should now be given to the activities of the Army.  The Secretary of State for Air was to make a statement in the House the following Tuesday, and [20106] b 2


312

it was agreed that the Secretary of State for War should make a statement two days later. Meanwhile, arrangements had been made to advance the date of the departure of foreign Press correspondents, some 25 to 30 of whom would consequently be leaving for France on the following Monday.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that the present dispositions of the German Army were 55 Divisions in the East, 17 Divisions in the centre, and 52 in the West, making a total of 124 Divisions in all. The evidence therefore was that, as yet, no considerable movement had been started from East to West.

It was generally agreed that this could be interpreted as implying lack of confidence in the Russians on Germany&apos;s part.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Italy. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

(Previous        to telegram No. 995, dated the 4th October, 1939, from His Reference:       Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, stating that a further telegram W.M.

It appeared that Count Ciano had spoken with great frankness regarding his recent interview with Herr von Ribbentrop in Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Conclusions, Telegram No. 359, dated the 4th October, 1939, from His

Minute 7.) Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, reporting that he had been

only able to have a short conversation with M. Sarajoglu, who had been unable to give him a summary of the proposed Turco-Soviet Pact on the ground that there was nothing in writing beyond the mutual proposals previously exchanged at Ankara. From the same telegram it appeared that M. Sarajoglu had sought to argue, with reference to the proposed change in Article 3 of our Treaty, that, if Greece became involved in hostilities, Turkish intervention would follow automatically, a view which was not sustained by the actual agreement reached, which contained this provision only if Greece were attacked by Italy, and did not apply if she were attacked by another country, e.g., Bulgaria;

Telegram No. 361, dated the 4th October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, reporting that the French Charge d&apos;Affaires had that evening had a long interview with

the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, but had not been able to obtain any further precise information, M. Sarajoglu, when pressed, saying that decisions rested entirely on Ankara.

The Secretary of State said that he had subsequently sent a telegram (No. 483), informing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, that the French Government had, on their own initiative, instructed his French colleague to protest against M. Stalin&apos;s revised text being substituted for the Protocol exempting Turkey from hostilities with the U.S.S.R. Sir William Seeds had been unable to find an opportunity of informing M. Sarajoglu that, if Turkey&apos;s undertakings were to be limited, it would be necessary for us to consider whether we could continue to pledge our help to Turkey unconditionally, under Article 1 of the Treaty and the exchange of Notes, without any adequate return; and he (the Secretaryx^f State) had accordingly instructed Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to make a communication in this sense to the Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Office.

No decision could usefully be taken by the War Cabinet until further elucidations had been obtained from the Turkish Government in regard to their attitude.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the War Cabinet certain additional information regarding possible developments of German policy received in part from the same source as that which he had communicated to the War Cabinet at the meeting noted in the margin. Details of the information in question are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

the

9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper W.P. (39) 57).

The President of the Board of Trade stated that, as he had already informed the Foreign Secretary, the Norwegian Delegation had late the previous night received instructions from their Government to return home to report.

The time had now arrived at which it was necessary to speak plainly to the Norwegian Government, and to let them know that if they took a difficult line over shipping, we should have no option but to take a difficult line over imports of coal to Norway from the United Kingdom. He hoped that the Foreign Secretary would see his way to speak in this sense to the Norwegian Minister.

The Foreign Secretary agreed to do so.

The War Cabinet took note that no action on our part would be necessary unless supplies from Narvik to Germany started moving once more. In that event the Royal Navy would take drastic action.

Relations with The President of the Board of Trade stated that Sweden had

(Previous was much less than in the case of Norway. Our chartering negotia-Reference: tions with the Swedes were proceeding favourably, and agreement W.M. (39) 37th appeared to be within sight.

Conclusions, In reply to a question, the President said that it was possible

Minute 4.)       that we mignt be able to charter from Holland a few ships suitable for special purposes, e.g., ships for exporting coal to France. The greater part of the Dutch mercantile marine was, however, engaged in the trade with the Dutch East Indies. Proposal for the       Paragraph 4 of the First Lord&apos;s Memorandum outlined a chartering and   wider proposal, namely, that we should secure the control, by charter insurance of all or otherwise, of all the free neutral shipping we could obtain and available neutral thus secure to ourselves power to regulate the greater part of the tonnage. sea transport of the world and to recharter it, profitably, to those

who acted in accordance with our wishes; and further, that we might extend to neutral shipping not under our direct control the benefit of our convoy system.

It was believed at the Admiralty that this large undertaking would not be beyond our strength. Had some such scheme for the chartering and insurance of neutral shipping been in force from the early days of the last war, there could be little doubt that it would have proved a highly profitable speculation. In the present war it might prove to be the foundation of a League of Free Maritime Nations.

A preliminary discussion made it clear that the War Cabinet were attracted by this new proposal. They felt, however, that they would not be in a position to take decisions upon it until plans had been worked out by the Departments concerned in considerable detail. Among other matters the question would arise whether the Navy, at its existing strength, was in a position to undertake the additional convoy duties which &quot;-would be involved.

The War Cabinet were informed that cases had already occurred in which neutral ships had requested permission to join our convoys. The Navy had put no obstacles in the way of their doing so.

The War Cabinet 

(1) Took note of the Memorandum by the First Lord of the

Admiralty.

(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to communicate with the

Norwegian Minister in the sense indicated.

(3) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to arrange for

examination of the suggested policy of securing the control of all available neutral tonnage by the interested Departments, viz., the Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and to report the result of This examination to the War Cabinet.

Anglo-Soviet 10.   The Minister of Supply made a statement regarding the

Trade present position of the negotiations for the purchase of Soviet

(Previous It had been part of the proposed bargain that the British vessels

Exchange of Considerable progress had now been made. In the latest discus-rubber and tin sions both sides had been much concerned at the risk of their ships for Soviet and cargoes being sunk by submarine action, and there had been timber. considerable debate as to whether the sales were to be f.o.b. or c.i.f.

The Russians had now come forward with a proposal that both

W.M. 38 (39).

parties should buy their goods f.o.b, and that a rendezvous should be appointed at which the physical exchange of the goods would take place. The procedure would be that each side would send a convoy to the rendezvous, the names of the vessels composing the convoy having been previously notified to the other party. The vessels would arrive from British ports on the one hand and from Archangel on the other. Two places had been suggested for the rendezvous, namely, the port of Narvik and the limit of the Soviet territorial waters outside Murmansk.

The Soviet Authorities appeared to be willing to conclude a mutually advantageous bargain on the above lines. It was not proposed that the whole of the goods covered by the negotiations should be exchanged on one occasion. This would be impracticable as there were as many as 58 vessels (42 neutral and 16 British) either loading timber or taking refuge in North Russian ports.

The Minister explained that the Soviet Trade Commissioner was expecting to hear from him at 2 o&apos;clock that afternoon.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the Admiralty saw no objection to the proposed method of exchanging goods at a rendezvous. Our Naval escorts would be prepared to undertake convoy duty as far as the rendezvous. The Admiralty might, indeed, sometimes think it desirable to extend our patrols somewhat beyond the rendezvous, in the direction of the White Sea ports. As regards the place to be appointed as the rendezvous, the Admiralty would prefer Narvik, but were prepared, if necessary, to agree to the limit of territorial waters outside Murmansk.

The War Cabinet took note of the stage reached in the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations; and authorised the Minister of Supply to proceed with the proposal outlined ,for an exchange of ships and cargoes at a rendezvous.

11. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinet of certain communications which he had had in regard to this matter. He read out a message which, on the advice of the Naval Staff, he proposed to communicate informally to the United States Government.

Fuller details in regard to this matter are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement made by the First Lord of the Admiralty.

Armistice Day. 12.   The Home Secretary raised the question of the observance

this year of Armistice Day. He had been in touch with the Archbishop of Canterbury and all interested Departments. As a result, it had been agreed that no general celebration could take place in present circumstances. No obstacle would, however, be placed in the way of local observance of the day, if desired by small communities. It was proposed that the usual Poppy Day collection, under the auspices of the British Legion, should take place on the 11th November, and that Sunday, the 12th November, should be observed as a Day of Dedication. If the War Cabinet approved this suggestion, the Archbishop of Canterbury would get in touch with the heads of other Churches and concert the necessary plans; and simultaneous announcements would then be made by the Government and the Archbishop. The Home Secretary added that the King had already been pleased to signify his agreement.

The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals outlined above for the observance of Armistice Day this year, and authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for the necessary communications and announcements.
