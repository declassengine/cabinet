The Air Situation.

(Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 38th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet that bad weather the previous day had again prevented our air activities on the Western Front. The normal patrols and reconnaissances had been carried out by Coastal Command.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War

Situation. Cabinet that the whaler, the sinking of which he had reported the

(Previous previous day, was a ship of 876 tons.   She had been torpedoed off

Eeference: the Orkneys, but all the crew had been picked up and saved. W.M. (39) 38th The steamship Marwarri (8,000 tons) had been either mined or Conclusions, torpedoed off Swansea, but she had been successfully beached on the Minute 2.) Mumbles. This vessel was carrying Army stores, including 12 antiaircraft guns, which were being shipped from Northern Ireland to France.

Another attack had been carried out on an enemy submarine. Two of our  troopships had collided  in convoy  in the Mediterranean, but both were able to proceed.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Admiral Raeder&apos;s Statement.

3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had been rung up on the telephone the previous night by President Roosevelt on the subject of a warning given by Admiral Raeder that tne United States ship Iroquois would be sunk in circumstances similar to those attending the loss of the Athenia the implication being that this would be the work of the British Navy. The First Lord had advised the President to give this warning full publicity.

The First Lord suggested that the fact that Admiral Raeder had made this warning refer so specifically to a particular ship pointed to the possibility that the Germans had secreted in the Iroquois a bomb timed to explode when she was in mid-Atlantic. (This might have been done either at Liverpool, where she had been loaded, or at Queenstown, where she had called.) In this event the Germans no doubt hoped to claim credit for the friendly gesture of having warned the Americans and so enabled them to save the crew.

The First Lord suggested that this occasion gave the Admiralty a further opportunity to rebut the German falsehoods as to responsibility for sinking the Athenia. He read out a draft statement for issue to the Press.

The War Cabinet 

Approved the issue to the Press of a statement on the lines suggested.

Staff Conversations with the Belgians.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 38th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

4. The War Cabinet were given some further information bearing on this matter, a record of which is included in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet agreed-

That the French Permanent Military Representatives on the Supreme War Council should be invited to prepare a Paper setting out, in the form of questions, the points on which information would be required in the event of contact being established with the Belgian Staffs.

The Military 5.   The Secretary of State for War said that there appeared

Situation.        to be a substantial movement of German troops towards the West. (Previous        It was now very difficult to obtain information from Eastern Eeference:       Germany, but it appeared that there might be some 50 to 60 W.M. (39) 38th divisions in the West and in the neighbourhood of 40 in the East. Conclusions, _,    _ ,~        ,     _     .       .     .            3? ,    .,_ .

Minute 4) ^he Secretary of State for boreign Affairs found it difficult

to reconcile the possibility of a mass attack on the Maginot Line with the strenuous efforts being made by German propaganda to convince the French that there was no cause for a quarrel between France and Germany and that England was the real enemy. He felt that an intensive air attack on our ports, docks and convoys, and possibly on our factories, was much more likely.

In reply to a question, the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that no general movement of bombers towards the West was anticipated, as they were capable of carrying out operations against this country from their present bases. On the other hand, there was&quot; a considerable concentration of reconnaissance, army co-operation and fighter aircraft west of the Rhine. This was in conformity with the general military movement, and would also provide additional cover for the Ruhr.

The War Cabinet took note of these statements.

Export of 6.   The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence reminded his

Bofors Guns colleagues that he had been invited to consider, in consultation with from Sweden, the Departments concerned, whether a scheme could be devised to (Previous facilitate the export from Sweden of the Bofors guns ordered by

References: His Majesty&apos;s Government. At a Meeting of Ministers held on the W.M. (39) 37th 2nd October it had been decided to invite the Minister for Economic Conclusions, Warfare to endeavour to secure these guns for ourselves by means Minute 10: 31st of transfer to a neutral Government, e.g., Belgium, Norway or Conclusions, Portugal, which would subsequently transfer them to us. Failing Minute ll.)      this, an endeavour should be made to secure the guns for Turkey.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that the Minister of Economic Warfare had now informed him that the Swedish Government had stated quite definitely that they would not supply arms to belligerents. They had refused repeated requests from Germany to establish arms factories in Sweden, and had bought out all foreign interests in their munition factories. The Swedish authorities now proposed to sell the guns to Finland. The Minister of Economic Warfare had pointed out that it was equally, if not more, important to us to be able? to purchase iron ore, charcoal, steel and ferrous alloys from Sweden, since any such purchases would be at the expense of Germany, for whom adequate supplies of these raw materials was a vital matter. The Minister of Economic Warfare advocated that we should devote our powers of persuasion with Sweden to obtaining these raw materials and not the Bofors guns.

The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that he had also discussed this matter with M. Boheman, and was satisfied that, failing some further means of exerting pressure, we should not obtain the release of the guns.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the newly appointed Swedish Naval Attache&quot; (who had made no secret of Sweden&apos;s sympathies) had emphasised Sweden&apos;s strong desire to obtain four motor torpedo-boats from us. He had suggested that the Bofors guns might be sold to a South American State and then intercepted by us on the high seas. The First Lord hoped that, unless we obtained the Bofors guns, we would not transfer the motor torpedo-boats, but would retain them as a bargaining counter for other possible negotiations.


321 W.M. 30 (39).

The Minister without Portfolio suggested that it might be possible to persuade Finland to pass on the guns to us. The threat to their security might well be greatly reduced as a result of their negotiations with Russia.

After some further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) to request the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to

investigate the possibility of persuading Finland to transfer the Bofors guns to us, should they be sold to Finland by Sweden :

(2) that the sale to Sweden of the four motor torpedo-boats

should be used as a counter in our general negotiations with Sweden.

Military Strategy to be adopted in the Near East, including the Balkans. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 36th Conclusions, Minute 5.)

20107

7. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the British and French Permanent Military Representatives on the Military Strategy to be Adopted in the Near East, including the Balkans (Paper W.P. (39) 70).

The Chief of Naval Staff summarised the contents of the Report. One of our main objects in our discussions with the French, in the course of the preparation of the Report, had been to convince them of the unsoundness of their project of an expedition to Salonika. In this we had been successful. The French were in full agreement with the Report, from which it would be seen that only in the case of a German attack on South-East Europe with Italy neutral. (case B); was it proposed that a limited Allied defensive force should be landed at Salonika, and then only if Greece asked for it and Italy agreed. The military risks attending the despatch of a force to Salonika were emphasised in paragraph 21 of the Report.

The Prime Minister thought that on the whole the situation was more favourable, from our point of view, owing to developments in Eastern Poland than at the time when the Report was actually prepared. In the event of Germany not attacking in South-Eastern Europe, Italy remaining neutral (case A), Germany would only obtain neutral resources from the Balkans, to the extent which those countries were prepared to co-operate; and it appeared that Germany would have to maintain a considerable number of divisions on her Eastern Frontier, owing to mistrust of Russia.

The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, in General Gamelin&apos;s view, Germany would have to retain at least 30 divisions of good troops in the East. They were unlikely to use Landwehr Troops for this purpose owing to fears of their becoming &quot; Bolshevised.&quot;

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that the situation appeared more favourable than it had a month previously and that the possibility of a hostile Italy had receded. He felt, however, that we must not delude ourselves as to the effect on small States of diplomatic action or the token delivery of supplies. Although Germany could now only attack the Balkans through Hungary, she could not be prevented from crushing Roumania in a very short space of time. He entirely agreed with the view expressed in the Report that Turkey was the key to the situation. He suggested, however, that the Chiefs of Staff might examine, as a corollary to the Report, the possibilities of Russian action in the Balkans, acting either alone or together with Germany.

The Lord Privy Seal asked whether there were any plans for stirring up disaffection in Albania in the event of a hostile Italy. J b 3


322

The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it would be left to the Turks to stir up trouble through the Mohammedan population in Albania.

The War Cabinet : 

(1) Approved the Report.

(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff, as a corollary to their Report,

to examine the possibilities of action by Russia in the Balkans, acting either alone, or in concert with Germany.

Italy. 8.   In the course of the discussion recorded in the preceding

(Previous        Minute, reference was made to the position of Italy.

WM* ^39) 38th Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointed out that

  n j   the Italian problem dominated strategy.   So long as Italy was

Minut *6)&apos; neutral, large forces were immobilised in the Mediterranean. He suggested that it might now be possible to approach the Italians with a view to mutual withdrawal of troops from North Africa, and the establishment of a detente in the Mediterranean.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his mind had been moving in the same direction. He thought that it might be possible to approach Italy in one of two ways: first, to suggest that they should associate themselves with us in the constructive task of forming a Balkan neutrality bloc; secondly, to persuade them to co-operate with the French and ourselves in keeping the Mediterranean free from war. The latter suggestion had been put to him by the First Lord of the Admiralty.

The Minister without Portfolio thought that it might be a useful move to suggest to Signor Mussolini that he should put forward proposals for the mutual withdrawal of troops on his own initiative.

The War Cabinet: 

Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to communicate to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome the suggestions made in the discussion, and to instruct him to s make such use of these suggestions as he thought fit in

discussion with Count Ciano.

Germany. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the War

(Previous Cabinet certain additional information regarding the possible

Reference: development of German policy received from the second of the two

W.M. (39) 38th sources referred to at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the

Conclusions, margin. Details of the information in question are recorded in the

Minute 8.) Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Roumania. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that

(Previous        at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin he had Reference:       reported that the previous day (the 28th September, 1939) M. Tilea, W.M. (39) 3lst the Roumanian Minister in London, speaking personally and Conclusions,      without instructions, had enquired whether the British guarantee Minute 6.)       to Roumania, which he admitted, though phrased in general terms, had been designed for the protection of Roumania against German aggression, would operate also, if necessary, against the Soviet Union.   Since that date he (the Secretary of State) had consulted the French Government, who were strongly of opinion that their guarantee to Roumania applied only in the event of that country being invaded by Germany, and were strongly opposed to an


323

W.M. 39 (39).

extension of their guarantee to cover the case of Roumania being invaded by the U.S.S.R. He (the Secretary of State) proposed to inform His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, that, so far as our guarantee to Roumania was concerned, we were in agreement with the views of the French Government, and to instruct him to discuss with the French Government the method to be adopted in conveying this information to the Roumanian Government.

The War Cabinet authorised the Foreign Secretary to act on the lines proposed.

Turkey.   11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a

Tureo-Soviet     statement regarding the position reached in the Turkish-Soviet Conversations    conversations now proceeding in Moscow in relation to the attitude and the Anglo-   to be taken up by us in regard to the Anglo-Turkish Treaty, which Turkish Treaty,  had been initialled at Ankara but not yet signed. (Previous Very strong pressure was being exerted by MM. Stalin and

Eeference:       Molotov on M. Sarajoglu, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, W.M. (39) 38th the Government of the U.S.S.R. having demanded the modification Conclusions,      of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty in the following respects :  Minute 7.) (a) Article 3 (whereby at present Turkey undertakes to support

Great Britain and France in the execution of their guarantees towards Greece and Roumania) should be amended in such a way as to substitute consultation for the duty of rendering active support in the circumstances contemplated; (b) The Protocol exempting Turkey from hostilities with the U.S.S.R. should be widened so as to provide that, in the event of the U.S.S.R. becoming engaged in war with Great Britain or France, the entire Treaty should be suspended (&quot; restera sans action &quot;) for the duration of the war.

If these amendments were accepted, we should lose the promise of Turkish help if we had to fulfil our guarantees to Greece and Roumania. We should also lose the promise of Turkish help if both Italy and Roumania came into the war against us. This position was far from satisfactory.

The Foreign Secretary outlined the courses of action open to us : 

(i) The Turkish Government could be informed (and this seemed to be the course favoured by the French Government, but not by the French Ambassador at Ankara) that we must insist upon the maintenance of the Treaty in the terms in which it had been initialled. The Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Office had assured His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, that, in that event, the Turkish Government would stand by their bond and would break off their negotiations with the Soviet Government. The possibility, however, could not be excluded that at the last moment the Turkish Government might go back on their word in this matter. If, however, they acted up to their undertakings, the result of action on our part on these lines would be to throw a severe strain upon Turco-Soviet relations, and also to some extent on Anglo-Turkish relations, (ii) A second course would be to abandon altogether the Treaty which had been initialled, and to seek to replace it by a short Treaty on the lines of the Declaration of May last, by which the Treaty would be confined to the Mediterranean area only and would provide for no more than consultation. It was by no means certain, however, that the Soviet Government would offer no objection to a Treaty on such lines.


324

(iii) A third course would be to assist the Turkish Government

to meet the demands of the Government, of the U.S.S.R. while insisting upon the retention of those parts of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty already initialled which we regarded as essential. For example, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, might be instructed to settle on the best terms possible with the Turkish Government, and for this purpose might be authorised, as a last ^resort, to give way on Article 3, and if necessary to indicate our willingness to go to the assistance of Turkey (as we had agreed to do in the existing Treaty) in the event of an enemy reaching the southern frontier of Bulgaria. The Ambassador might also be authorised to meet the request made in regard to the Second Protocol, provided that words were inserted to make it clear that Turkey would not be relieved of her obligations so far as the Mediterranean area was concernedv It was doubtful, however, whether such a limitation would be acceptable to the Government of the U.S.S.R.

(iv) Finally, it would be possible to accept the whole of the

amendments desired by the Government of the U.S.S.R. on condition 

(a) that the Turkish Government furnished us with the texts of the proposed Turco-Soviet Pact, and of all associated documents; and

(6) that, after examination of those documents, we were satisfied that nothing therein precluded Turkey from coming to our aid, if circumstances were to develop in such a way that in her own interests she wished to do so.

The Foreign Secretary thought that we must be guided by two considerations. First, we did not wish to lose the Treaty altogether, or to see the Treaty emptied of its substance. Secondly, we must not be responsible for worsening relations between Turkey and Russia.

The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet his provisional views. Taking the realities of the situation, one assumption was that Germany would attack Roumania. In this case our guarantee came into operation, and under the Treaty, in its present form, Turkey came to our assistance. But the likelihood of a German attack on Roumania was much diminished by Russian action in recent weeks. Further, the alterations in the Treaty now proposed would not exclude Turkey&apos;s help in this contingency.

The second assumption was that Russia was a belligerent, in which event she wished the whole Treaty to be suspended. The result would be that if we and Italy were at war and Russia joined in against us, Turkey would not be obliged to come in on our side. As against this, however, firstly, it now seemed less likely that Italy would join Germany; secondly, his personal view was that Russia was unlikely to join herself so tightly to Germany as to expose herself to attack from us, since she could get what she wanted without war; thirdly, the one event which would be most likely to tempt Turkey to join in the war would be if Italy were on the other side.

The present might be one of the important psychological moments of the war, since there was evidence that Germany and perhaps other countries were wavering in their attitude. It might, therefore, be of great advantage to us that by accepting the Soviet demands we should secure not only the signature of our Treaty with Turkey with the concurrence of the U.S.S.R., but also the signature of a Turco-Soviet Pact. The world would thus see Great Britain, France, Turkey and the U.S.S.R. entering into agreements either with one another or with one another&apos;s concurrence, and would thus be enabled to judge the hollowness of Germany&apos;s boast of an alliance with the U.S.S.R.


325

W.M. 39 (39).

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that for five years the Chiefs of Staff had been anxious to make friends with Turkey because of our Mediterranean position. Roumania had come into the picture much later. Since we could not do much to help Roumania in any event, and then only if Turkey were on our side, he did not attach very much importance to this aspect of the matter. The question of Greece was more important, since this affected the Mediterranean situation. He thought that, if Greece was invaded, this would endanger Turkey and she would come in on our side in her own interests. For this reason he did not object to the Treaty being altered to provide for consultation only.

In further discussion, it was agreed that it was essential to ensure that there was nothing in the Turco-Soviet Treaty which was inconsistent with Turkey coming to our help in the circumstances envisaged in the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty.

The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed generally with the Prime Minister. He thought that events in the past month had made the changes in the Treaty now proposed of less importance than before.

The Minister without Portfolio referred to the fact that the Treaty was for fifteen years.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the main point was to secure the position in the present war, which it was reasonable to hope would be followed by a long period of peace.

There was general agreement with the view that it was of the utmost importance at the present moment to secure the signature of the Treaty, thereby showing that Turkey was brought within our orbit.

The War Cabinet =

Authorised the Foreign Secretary to communicate in the following sense to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Ankara, after making the necessary communication to the French Government: 

His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accept both the amendments to the Anglo-Turkish Treaty desired by the Government of the U.S.S.R. on condition  (i) that the Turkish Government furnish His Majesty&apos;s Government with the texts of the proposed Soviet-Turkish Pact and of all associated documents; and (ii) that, after the examination of these documents, His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that nothing therein precludes Turkey from coming to the support of Great Britain in the circumstances envisaged in the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty, if Turkey desires to do so in her own interests.

Herr Hitler&apos;s 12.   The Lord Privy Seal informed the War Cabinet that the

Speech to the Home Policy Committee, at their Meeting earlier that morning, had Reichstag, been concerned to find that no particular plans had been made by 6th October, the Ministry of Information as to the manner in which 4939. Herr Hitler&apos;s speech should be presented to the British public. The

latter might well be bewildered if any specious offer which Herr Hitler included in his speech were allowed to appear in. a favourable light, while nothing was published simultaneously by way of semi-official British comment.   In discussion, the view was generally expressed that, until the

War Cabinet had had an opportunity of giving careful consideration to the speech, nothing should appear by way of commentary which purported to give His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s views. Silence might well prove to be the most effective reply.


326

At the same time, while nothing could be said on questions of policy, the Ministry of Information should not be left without guidance as to the proper method of dealing with the speech. For example, reference might be made to the Prime&quot; Minister s statement in Parliament in regard to it.

The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to give the Minister of Information general guidance on the lines indicated.

Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1, October 6, 1939.
