The Air Situation.

(Previous Eef erenee: W.M. (39) 28th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet that a large flying boat, which had been sent on a reconnaissance flight, had been forced to alight on the water off the coast of Iceland, and had been interned.

The 12 Hampdens, which had carried out a reconnaissance over the Bight the day before, had returned without having found a suitable target. A number of day and night reconnaissances had been carried out over various parts of North-West Germany, but the results had been largely negative. Anti-aircraft fire had been encountered up to 23,000 feet. Two German float planes had been brought down in the North Sea.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the submarine

Operations.       H.M.S. Spearfish, which had been damaged by depth charges, was (Previous        making its way home.   It had been met by four destroyers and Eeference:       two cruisers.  One of the cruisers had reported a heavy air attack W.M (39) 28th by German aircraft, but had sustained no hits. Conclusions The crew of a German aircraft, which had come down in the

Minute 3.) &apos; North Sea, had been captured; and H.M.S. Dunedin was returning with prisoners believed to have been taken off the Minden, a German merchant ship which had been scuttled by her crew when intercepted.

There had been no sinkings in the last twenty-four hours, but four attacks on submarines were reported. The first inward convoy of fast ships from Halifax had been met, and was coming in under escort.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military 3.   The Secretary of State for War said that units of the

Situation In 2nd Corps were starting to land in France.   The Belgian Military

France. Attache in Paris had informed the French that he had had news

(Previous  f a large German concentration near Aachen, and that he believed

Reference: ^ was oriry a question of hours before Belgium would be invaded.

W.M. (39) 28th The General Staff did not attach much credence to this report,

Conclusions Dut    indicated a state of mind in the Belgian Staff which might

Minute 5.)&apos; De  ^ use m our discussions with the Belgian Government.

Reference was made to reports in the Press to the effect that large German forces had arrived on the Western front from Poland. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that correspondents were, no doubt, misled by the arrival of Divisions which had previously been in reserve in Germany. The number of German divisions in the West had been steadily growing, and now amounted to 42.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Weekly Reports.

4.   The War Cabinet took note of the following Reports: 

(a) Weekly Report (No. 2) by the Secretary of State for War

(W.P. (39) 53).

(b) Weekly Report (No. 3) by the Secretary of State for Air

(W.P. (39) 50).

Staff 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he

Conversations had had a conversation with M. Van Zeeland on the previous day

with Belgium, and had put the case for staff conversations as strongly and frankly

(Previous as possible.  M. Van Zeeland had expressed the view that in order

Reference: to preserve unity, if and when Germany invaded Belgium, it was

W.M. (39) 28th essential that the Belgian Government should be able to maintain

Conclusions, that the attack was completely unprovoked.   If it became known.

Minute 6.) as was all too probable, that staff conversations with us had taken

[20067]

b 2

place, this would be exploited by Germany and a difficult and dangerous internal situation would arise. M. Van Zeeland had put forward the personal suggestion that it might be possible for our staffs to use a discreet civil intermediary to represent their views to a similar individual in Belgium who would, in turn, pass these views on to the Belgian staff.

Discussion (which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions) ensued as to the probable course of events if Germany invaded Belgium.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should pursue

the suggestion that discussion with the Belgians on Staff matters should take place through a civil intermediary;

(ii) that the action to be taken by the Allied Armies in support

of Belgium in the event of a German invasion of Belgium was amilitary matter which should be discussed between the British and French military authorities.

British 6.   The Chief of the Air Staff referred to the examination

Strength in by the War Office and Air Ministry of the French Government&apos;s

Fighters and request for the despatch to France of further A.A. guns and Fighter

A.A. Guns in aircraft, which had been mentioned at the Meeting of the War

France. Cabinet referred to in the margin.   He gave particulars of the

(Previous number of A.A. guns and Fighter aircraft asked for by the French,

Beference: and of our proposed reply.   Full details are recorded in the

W.M. (39) 26th Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions. Conclusions, The War Cabinet : 

Minute 4.)

approved the line of action recommended by the Chiefs of Staff, and agreed that a communication on the lines proposed should be sent from the British to the French Staff.

Policy of 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that

Soviet Russia. M. Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador, had asked to come and see

{Previous him that afternoon.   He also referred to the fact that Herr von

Reference: Ribbentrop would be in Moscow at the same time as M. Sarajoglu,

W.M. (39) 28th the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs.   This was somewhat

Conclusions, disturbing and he had sent a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,

Minute 8.) Moscow, asking him to keep in the closest touch with M. Sarajoglu during the latter&apos;s visit to Moscow.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Turkey. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Negotiations to Telegram No. 426, which, after consultation with the Chancellor

for Anglo- of the Exchequer, he had despatched at 1-45 a.m. that morning

Franco-Turkish (27th September, 1939) to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara,

The Balkans. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention

Premature to telegram No. 704 (Saving), dated the 25th September, 1939, from&quot; disclosure to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris. This telegram reported an Italy of plans interview between our Ambassador and his Italian colleague who in regard to had told Sir Eric Phipps that he had recently been informed by Rouman ia. M. Daladier that the French Government were gravely concerned (Previous about Roumania, and feared a German attack upon her, and that Reference: in order to counter &quot;any such action they were preparing a French W.M. (39) 23rd Army in Syria. If this statement had been made by M. Daladier Conclusions,

prior to the last meeting of the Supreme War Council Minute 1.) (22nd September, 1939), it was disingenuous of him not to have mentioned it at that meeting. If, on the other hand, M. Daladier had made this statement since the 22nd September, he had departed from the agreed arrangement (a) that no communication on this subject should be made to Italy until after the return from Moscow of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, and (b) that, when this communication was made, it should be made by us and not by the French. He was accordingly instructing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, to see M. Daladier for the purpose of clearing up this matter.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Setting Up 10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that of a Polish during the previous twenty-four hours there had been two Government. developments in the matter of the setting up of a Polish (Previous        Government: 

Reference: ^ ^he Polish Ambassador had informed him (the Secretary

W.M. (39) 28th of State) the previous aay (26th September, 1939) that

Conclusions, President Moscicki had taken the necessary action in

Mmute 9.) Roumania to initiate the setting up of a new Polish

Government by resigning his office of President and nominating in his place General Wieniawa-Dlugoszow-ski, the present Polish Ambassador in Rome. Count Raczynski was satisfied, therefore, that everything was going forward smoothly, (ii) While Count Raczynski was still at the Foreign Office, he (the Secretary of State) had received a report that a similar communication had been made to the French Government by the Polish Ambassador in Paris the previous evening, and that the French Government had refused to accord recognition to the General. Count Raczynski was naturally much distressed on receiving this information.

The General was a former A.D.C. to Marshal Pilsudski, and had been one of his trusted confidential agents. He (the Secretary of State) had immediately asked for an explanation from the French Government, who had replied that the character and private life of the General unfitted him to hold any position of responsibility, and that it was for this reason that they had refused to recognise his appointment, and had so informed the French Minister in Bucharest. He (the Secretary of State) had instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, to see M. Daladier at once and to ask on what grounds the French Government claimed the right to decide who was a suitable Polish representative, and to ascertain why they had not consulted us before reaching a decision in this matter.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Treatment of &quot;Enemy Aliens found on board Neutral Ships.

11. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the treatment of enemy aliens found on board neutral ships (Paper No. W.P. (39) 4Q). There were annexed to the Memorandum the report of an Inter-Departmental meeting under the Chairmanship of the Attorney-General and also copies of two telegrams from Lord Lothian at Washington (Nos. 456 and 525) and of one from Sir Percy Loraine at Rome (No. 925).

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew particular attention to the recommendation in the second paragraph of Lord Lothian&apos;s telegram No. 525 (Annex II to the Memorandum), to the effect that for the time being the only classes of enemy aliens to be removed from United States ships should be officers or N.C.O&apos;s on the active list or reservists, known enemy agents, or technicians whose activities could be reasonably shown to be of importance to the enemy war effort.

The A ttorney-General said that, if we were to be in a position to reply to possible criticism by neutrals, our actions should be such as could be justified by existing recognised principles and we should not deal more strictly with enemy aliens found on neutral ships than with those whom we found in this country. We had not, in fact, at the outbreak of war detained enemy aliens who were in this country, even of military age, except those known to be dangerous.

There was some discussion as to the wisdom of this policy, which was different from that adopted in 1914. It was pointed out, however, that on this occasion we had full information as to Germans likely to be dangerous, and that all but a very few of the Germans of military age in this country, apart from refugees, had returned to Germany before the war began. The possibility of air attack was also a new factor making it undesirable that we should be burdened with having to intern large numbers.

In reply to a question from the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to ascertain how the Germans were dealing with British subjects of military age who were in Germany on the outbreak of war. It was agreed that, while, on receipt of this information, it might be necessary to consider further the policy adopted in this country, the paramount consideration as regards enemy aliens found on neutral ships was the need for avoiding friction with neutral countries, particularly the United States and, to a less extent, Italy.

The War Cabinet therefore agreed : 

(1) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to

submit information as to the action taken by the German Government in dealing with British subjects &quot;in Germany;

(2) That in regard to enemy aliens on neutral ships 

(a) our policy should, for the present, be based on the

need for not offending neutral opinion, particularly in the United States of America and Italy;

(b) as a general guide, we should not remove from

neutral ships enemy aliens other than those recommended by Lord Lothian in his telegram quoted above;

(c) in the first instance, our action should be confined to

vessels inward bound to European ports except in the case of particular persons of whose noxious characters we had reasonable evidence;


m

227 W.M. 29 (39),

{d) we should, as far as possible, avoid removing enemy

aliens from neutral ships on the high seas; (e) we should not make any public statement of our

intentions.

India and the 12.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the

War. Secretary of State for India (W.P. (G.) (39) 21) entitled : &quot; India

Statement by and the War.&quot; It was explained in the Memorandum that, the Working although there was little doubt that the general trend of public Committee of opinion in India was in full sympathy with the Allied aims, the the Indian Working Committee of the Indian National Congress had issued National on the 15th September a statement demanding from His Majesty&apos;s

Congress. Government a statement of their war aims in their application to

India, with the implication that, unless this produced a satisfactory response, Indian co-operation in the war would be withheld.

The view of the Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy was that a reply would have to be given to the Congress manifesto. They proposed that, after seeing Mr. Gandhi and other Congress leaders, and also the leader of the Moslem League and representatives of the Princes, the Viceroy should issue a statement incorporating a formula which was annexed to the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum as Annexure B, and should also indicate his intention of inviting a body of non-official persons, as small as possible consistently with being sufficiently representative, to be associated in a consultative capacity with the Central Government of India with a view to receiving information and tendering advice as to the conduct of affairs in India in relation to the war.

Failing a satisfactory understanding with the Congress Party, it seemed that a difficult situation would arise. Eight of the eleven Provincial Governments were composed of adherents of the Congress Party and might lay down office, leaving the Provincial, Governors to face grave problems connected with the maintenance of law and order.

Considerable discussion followed regarding the composition and functions of the proposed body of non-official persons, the language of the formula to be incorporated in the Viceroy&apos;s reply, and the present defence situation in India.

The following points emerged in discusssion : 

Proposed (i) The view was expressed that the language at the end of

consultative the first paragraph of page 3 of the Secretary of State&apos;s

body of Memorandum (&quot; with a view to receiving information

unofficial and tendering advice as to the conduct of affairs in India

persons. in relation to the war &quot;) opened up dangerous possibili-

ties. It was explained that the words &quot; tendering advice &quot; were not intended to have any constitutional significance. The intention was rather that the non-official persons should be encouraged to express opinions, on which the Indian Government might or might not act.

(ii) The new body should not be allowed to detract from the constitutional position of the Government of India. Thus it should not take votes or make pronouncements on questions of policy. The authority of the Viceroy&apos;s Government must be maintained unimpaired.

(iii) In this connection, it would be fatal to allow the Congress

Party (of which the Left Wing was already organising a campaign against recruiting, &amp;c.) to have a majority on the new body. There were already signs that claims of this kind were being formulated.

(iv) What position would the new body occupy vis-a-vis the

Indian Legislature? It had always been contemplated, in recent years, that the Government of India would


228

take the Legislature more and more into its confidence on Defence questions. This process was now going on. The appointment of a body of non-official persons might well be used by Congress to side-track the Legislature in this important field. On the other hand, the life of the present Indian Legislature had already been prolonged beyond the normal limit and it did not speak with any high degree of authority.

(v) These considerations led to the view which was generally

expressed that there would be great advantage in keeping the new body as flexible as possible. (The constitution of the Committee of Imperial Defence was cited as an example.) Thus the arrangement adopted might be to set up a number of panels of advisers, all of whom would not necessarily be called into consultation on the same occasion On the other hand, the Secretary of State for India took the view that consultations with individuals, however valuable those consultations might prove, would not produce the desired psychological effect on Indian public opinion.

(vi) In continuation of this line of thought, it was suggested

that it was not necessary that all the panels of advisers should be composed of politicians. There might, for example, be a panel of Indian industrialists. There would be other interests also whose representatives ought to be within call. It was important to get the new arrangement on to the broadest possible lines. There might also be panels composed on a provincial or geographical basis, e.g., a Punjab panel. Such an arrangement would have the advantage of preventing too much attention from being directed to questions of Defence, which was, and would continue to be, a reserved subject.

The formula to be incorporated in the Viceroy&apos;s reply to the Working Committee.

The following points emerged during the discussion of the language of the above formula : 

(i) It was certain that the present war, like the last war, would

see great changes in India, but it was undesirable at the present early stage for His Majesty&apos;s Government to enter into commitments regarding such changes. Yet tlhe concluding sentence of the formula almost ampimted to a pledge to lay new proposals before Parliament,. Jjt was pointed out, however, that it seemed unlikely that for many years there would be any diminution of the feud between Hindus and Moslems. This, of itself, would be enough to prevent &quot; a sufficient basis of agreement&quot; on particular points existing in India.

(ii) Another view expressed was that the language of the

formula, while it was so worded as to avoid dangerous commitments, was so vague that it would give no satisfaction.

(iii) It was therefore suggested that the formula might be

stiffened up with a blunt statement that, without help on an extended scale from the United Kingdom, India was at the present moment defenceless against external aggression. Failure on our part to supply that extended measure of assistance would not result in India achieving her independence. On the contrary, it would result in India becoming subject to a harsher rule than she had known for centuries. Such a statement might either form part of the reply to the Working Committee of Congress, or might be issued later in a more public form.


160

229

W.M. 29 (39).

(iv) In reply to this argument it was stated that Indian opinion was well aware of the dangers of external aggression. In the case of many Indian politicians this awareness had resulted in a disinclination to see their country become a belligerent, (v) Some doubts were felt as to the passage in the formula dealing with future constitutional development and the attainment of Dominion Status. On the one hand, the view was expressed that it would be desirable to avoid any mention of Dominion Status, since this might merely serve to encourage demands that that Status should be conferred on India here and now. On the other hand, it was argued that the formula might make it clear that the War would provide India with the opportunity of taking another step towards the goal of Dominion Status  on the assumption that India gave a full measure of support to the Allied cause.

Present In the course of discussion it was pointed out that India&apos;s

Defence defence position could not be said to be satisfactory.   India had

Situation. already parted with troops which, under the proposals of the Expert

Committee on the Defence of India (the Chatfield Committee), were not to be sent overseas until the processes of modernisation and mechanisation were complete.

In this connection the War Cabinet were reminded of their (Previous discussion, at the Meeting referred to in the margin, regarding the Reference: possibility of the Regular British troops now in India being relieved W.M. (39) 15th by Territorials. Highly trained troops would be very valuable on Conclusions, the Western Front, while less highly trained troops would be Minute 15.)      adequate for internal security duties in India.

The War Cabinet: 

invited the Secretary of State for India to give further consideration to the proposals in his Memorandum (W.P (G) (39) 21) in consultation with the Viceroy, in the light of the above discussion, and to submit the matter again to the War Cabinet at an early date.

Obscuration of Lighting.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 15th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

13.   The War Cabinet decided 

To appoint a Committeee, composed as under, to consider and review the present lighting restrictions : 

The Lord Privy Seal (Chairman),

The Secretary of State for War,

The Secretary of State for Air,

The Minister without Portfolio,

The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security,

The President of the Board of Trade,

The Minister of Transport.
