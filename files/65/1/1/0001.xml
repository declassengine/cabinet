Procedure.

1.   THE War Cabinet decided : 

(a) That, for the present, daily Meetings should be held at 11-30 a.m.

(6) That, in accordance with the practice of the War Cabinet in the last War, the attendance at the War Cabinet of Ministers not in the War Cabinet, of the Chiefs of Staff and of Officials, should be arranged according to the matters under discussion.

(c) That the normal arrangement should be that full sets of War Cabinet Minutes should be circulated to the members of the War Cabinet, to a limited number of other Ministers, and to the three Chiefs of Staff, the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury and the Permanent Under Secretary, Foreign Office.

Air Action.

Action by the French Air Force.

Dropping of Propaganda Leaflets.

2. The War Cabinet considered the plans to be put into force under the following headings: 

(a) Action against the German Fleet.

(b) Action by the French.

(c) Dropping of propaganda leaflets.

Certain information received from air reconnaissance was given by the First Sea Lord as to the movements of the German Fleet.

The War Cabinet authorised the despatch of a bomber force to attack the German Fleet at sea.

The Chief of the Air Staff reported that a telegram had been received from General Gamelin that afternoon suggesting that action should be taken by our Air Force to-night (see Annex I). An interim reply had been sent to General Gamelin to say that we agreed in principle that we should consult as to the action to be taken by our respective Air Forces. We had already sent a reconnaissance to search for the German Fleet, and, subject to the views of the War Cabinet, it was proposed to drop propaganda leaflets in three areas in Germany that night. In our view it was important to take no action in violation of the attitude which our two Governments had taken up in regard to our bombardment policy. It was understood to be the intention of the French Air Force to carry out reconnaissance with a view to locating troop concentrations on the railways and on military aerodromes. Bombing attacks would be carried out between, but not on, railway stations and on aerodromes. The trains would not be attacked. Subsequently, at about 5   15 p.m., a message had been received that the French did not intend to take any action in the air that night.

The War Cabinet agreed that it was of great importance that any air action undertaken by the French should be within the bombardment policy which we had laid down, and that it would be desirable to take steps to restrain the French from taking precipitate action in this matter.

Consideration was given to the question whether we should drop propaganda leaflets over Germany. It was believed that these leaflets would have an important effect on German public opinion. Moreover; the Germans would realise that British aircraft were flying over their country. The dropping of leaflets might well have its maximum effect in the first few hours of war. The risk to pilots was not regarded as great. The areas which it was proposed to cover were Hamburg, Bremen and the Ruhr.

The War Cabinet agreed that this operation should be carried out during the forthcoming night.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(a) to authorise the immediate despatch of a bomber force to

attack the German fleet reported to have sailed from Wilhelmshaven that afternoon;

(b) to authorise the dropping by aircraft of propaganda leaflets

on Germany on the night of the 3rd-4th September;

(c) that 

(i) the Chief of the Air Staff should inform General Gamelin of the above decisions taken by the War Cabinet, and

(ii) that the French Ambassador should be similarly informed* and requested to reaffirm to the French Government the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government not to initiate air action which might involve the risk of civilian casualties.

War Production. 3. Reference was made to delays in armament production which it was anticipated would arise as the result of key personnel in industry having been called to the Colours.

The Secretary of State for War explained that, while he saw little difficulty in the release of men from the Territorial Army, it would be difficult to release Regular Reservists required for the Field Force.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That this matter should in the first instance be examined interdepartmentally by the Departments concerned, viz. 

The War Office.

The Air Ministry.

The Ministry of Supply and

The Ministry of Labour and National Service.

The Secretary of State for War also raised the question whether special steps should not be taken to expedite production of munitions with a view to accelerating the dates at which the contingents of the Field Force, other than the first contingent, could be sent overseas.

The War Cabinet agreed :  

To invite the Secretary of State for War, the Minister of Supply, and the Minister of Labour and National Service, to submit Memoranda showing the present rate of munition production for the Army and what could be achieved by way of acceleration.

Arrangements to Provide Information to the Dominions In regard to our War Plans.

4. Reference was made to the need for ensuring that the Dominions High Commissioners were fully informed of the military position.

The Prime Minister explained that he contemplated an arrangement whereby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs would receive the Agenda of all Meetings of the War Cabinet, and should attend Meetings whenever matters were discussed of which it was necessary that he should be aware in order to ensure that the

5 W.M. 1 (39).

Dominions were properly supplied with information. It would no doubt be desirable that this information should, on occasion, be supplemented by a more technical exposition of our defence plans.

The War Cabinet took note of this suggestion.

Assistance 5.   The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence explained that

offered by the    Australia had already asked what help we should require from her Dominions.       in addition to the help of the Royal Australian Navy.   The same question was likely to arise in regard to other Dominions.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To invite the Chiefs of Staff to submit a Paper dealing with this matter, and to include in their Paper a suggested form of reply to the Dominions.

Command in the Field.

6. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence suggested that it would be desirable for the War Cabinet to be informed of the position regarding Command in the Field, and other important matters which had formed the subject of conversations with the French.

The War Cabinet agreed that this course was desirable, and invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to arrange for the circulation to the War Cabinet of Memoranda dealing with these matters.

Periodical 7.   The Minister without Portfolio referred to the system

Reports from    which had been built up in the last War, whereby the War Cabinet Departments.    had received periodical reports showing the position under a number of heads, such as .Supply, Food, Oil Fuel, Shipping, &amp;c. He thought it would be desirable that a comprehensive system of such reports should be instituted.

The War Cabinet invited the Minister without Portfolio to submit a Memorandum setting out his proposals in this matter.

Attitude of 8.   In reply to an enquiry as to the attitude of Turkey, the

Turkey. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the draft of the

proposed Treaty between France, ourselves and Turkey was almost agreed, and he thought the Turks would probably be willing to sign it shortly. He had had no fresh information as to their attitude.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Roumania. 9.   The question was raised whether it would be in our interest

that Roumania should remain neutral, or whether we should endeavour to induce her to enter the War on our side. It was explained that a Memorandum on this subject was being prepared by the Chiefs of Staff, and it was agreed that this Memorandum should be circulated for consideration by the War Cabinet.

Military 10.   The War Cabinet, after hearing the views of Ministers,

Appointments,   approved the proposal that the Secretary of State for War should recommend to His Majesty the King 

(1) That General the Viscount Gort, V.C., K.C.B., C.B.E.,

D.S.O., M.V.O., M.C., should be appointed Commander-in-Chief, the British Field Force.

(2) That General Sir W. Edmund Ironside, G.C.B., C.M.G.,

D.S.O., should be appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in succession to General Gort. mt)

(3) That General Sir Walter Kirke, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.,

Londres, le 3 septembre 1939.

ULTIMATUM francais donne&quot; a douze heures, duree cinq heures. Les iostilites peuvent done commencer dix-sept heures. II etait hautement souhaitable que l&apos;aviation anglaise parte en meme temps que la notre. Or, elle envisagerait de ne partir que demain matin. C&apos;est la raison pour laquelle, en dehors de considerations politiques et diplomatiques, que vous devez connaitre, j&apos;ai demande a ne commeneer les hostilitis qu&apos;avec son concours.

C&apos;est sur les instances de l&apos;Angleterre, comme de la Pologne, que M. Daladier a fixe* ce soir dix-sept heures.

J&apos;estime que les camarades britanniques se doivent de commencer sur le plan ae^rien au moins cette nuit.

GAMELIN.

ANNEX II.

WAR Cabinet have considered air question, as raised by Gamelin&apos;s message as supplemented by later conversations and by representations from His Excellency the French Ambassador.

The War Cabinet decided : 

(1) Instructions have been given to attack the German Fleet at once if (as

is understood) it has just left Wilhelmshaven. (2^ To proceed with leaflet distribution to-night as arranged. (3) To adhere to decision that we should not commence bombing that might

mean attacking in ways involving civilian population; such bombing

would be contrary to undertakings we have given (as the French have

given) in reply to American President.

The risk is especially great at night, and His Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly wish most strongly to urge the French Government not to proceed with their proposed plan to-night.

His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad if joint discussions could be begun between the two Air Staffs to-morrow so as to arrange details for subsequent action.
