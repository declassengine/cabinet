The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that the Coastal

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, for the tenth

Situation. consecutive day, no British ship had been sunk by submarine action.

(Previous A Greek ship had been torpedoed on the previous day in the

Reference: Channel. The crew had taken to the boats, but, as a high sea was W.M. (39) 35th running, there were grave doubts whether any of them had been Conclusions, rescued.

Minute 2.) There was still some doubt as to the identity of the German

warship reported off South America. A Naval Attache&quot; had been sent to Rio de Janeiro to interrogate the crew of the steamship Clement in order to clear the matter up.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military 3.   The Secretary of State for War said that six more

Situation. German Divisions had been reported in the West, and a reduction

(Previous        of three Divisions in the East.

Reference: An Indian brigade for the Middle East was due to arrive in

The Prime Minister referred to the reference in M. Daladier&apos;s letter of the 1st October to the question which had often been raised in commissions of the French Chamber or Senate of the symbolic posting of British troops in the Maginot Line.

The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that the arrival of a British battalion in that part of the line which was actually in contact with the German Army would have a valuable psychological effect.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that no such request had been received either from General Gamelin or General Georges. He would, however, raise the matter specifically at his forthcoming meeting with General Gamelin.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

(a) Weekly Report No. 4 by the Secretary of State for War

(Paper W.P. (39) 69).

(b) Weekly Report No. 4 by the Secretary of State for Air

(Paper W.P. (39) 64).

5. The War Cabinet had before them a Commentary by the Chiefs of Staff Committee (Paper W.P. (39) 65) on observations made by General Gamelin on their Appreciation of the possible future course of the War (Paper W.P. (39) 33).

The Chief of the Air Staff said that the matters contained in W.M. (39) 24th para.graphs 4-7 of the Chiefs of Staff Commentary, which related to Franco-British co-operation on land, would be cleared up in the [20103] b 2

course of the next few days when he and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff met General Gamelin. Plans for air co-operation had been worked out in great detail, and special liaison arrangements had been made to meet the eventuality of a battle on the French right flank in addition to a battle elsewhere on the front. (Previous General Gamelin, in paragraph 4 of his observations, envisaged

Reference: a move of Allied forces from the Near East to Turkey or Salonica W.M. (39) 29th in the event of a German offensive into the Balkans. In the view Conclusions, of the Chiefs of Staff, such a movement could not take place until Minute 9.)       either Italy&apos;s neutrality was assured or she had been defeated.

In reply to an enquiry by the Prime Minister, the Chief of the Air Staff said that General Georges was in a position to give direct orders to the Air Forces under tne command of General Mouchard. These forces were in the same relation to General Georges as was the R.A.F. component with the Field Force to Lord Gort.

The Lord Privy Seal enquired whether the principal objectives which should be destroyed by air action, in conjunction with the Belgian demolitions, had been identified.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that a Franco-British Conference on the 30th September had drawn up complete plans for air action, and had at their disposal full information about these objectives.

There was a discussion about the readiness of the Belgian Army to play its part in the event of a German aggression. The War Cabinet were informed that, as far as was humanly possible, the Belgians had taken all steps to ensure complete demolitions in case of emergency. Their Army would compare favourably with the German Landwehr Divisions, but there were two weak spots. One was Luxembourg; the other was the Albert Canal, which, although it was a useful obstacle against a sudden rush, would require good troops to hold it against sustained attack.

The War Cabinet took note of General Gamelin&apos;s observations on the Chiefs of Staffs Appreciation on the possible course of the war, and the comments of the Chiefs of Staff thereon.

Assistance g   j1^ Minister for Co-ordination of Defence informed the

to Turkey. War Cabinet that, in the discussions in preparation for General (Previous Orbay&apos;s visit, a suggestion had been made that an offer of firm Reference: support by Franco-British troops in defence of the Turkish Thracian W.M. (39) 32na frontier might compensate the Turks for the delay which was bound Conclusions, to occur in securing arms and equipment from us. Such an offer Minute 14.)      might induce them to modify or abolish the &quot; suspensive &quot; clause.

He had asked the Chiefs of Staff to examine the possibility of

sending an allied force to support the Turks.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff were of the opinion that British forces could not be spared, but that French forces would be available, and they proposed to ask the French, through the Permanent Military Representatives, whether troops from Syria could be sent. Our own attitude was governed by that of Italy. A report on this matter would be before the War Cabinet very shortly.

A discussion then followed of ways and means of obtaining war material for Turkey, the most promising field being Spain. Information had been received that a quantity of arms which would be of use to the Turks was available in Spain, if finance could be arranged. It was pointed out that the export credit facilities could not legally be utilised for purchases outside this country, but it was thought that this difficulty could be overcome, in view of the importance of the object, without the need of legislation, at any rate

in the immediate future. It was suggested that a transaction might be arranged, whereby tobacco bought by us from Turkey might be resold to Spain, and the resulting funds used to purchase Spanish arms.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that he would be much embarrassed in his dealings with General Orbay by the emptiness of the offers we could make, and it was therefore urgent to investigate this proposal, which might have a decisive effect on our relations with Turkey.

The War Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to examine, as a matter of urgency,  the methods whereby we might purchase war material from Spain for supply to Turkey.

7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to the following telegrams relating to the Turco-Soviet conversations now proceeding in Moscow between MM. Stalin and Molotov on the one hand and M. Sarajoglu, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the other : 

Telegram No. 355, dated the 2nd October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, containing a report given to him by M. Sarajoglu of the long interview which he had had with M. Stalin the previous night (the 1st October, 1939);

Telegram No. 550, dated the 2nd October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, giving information communicated to him and his French colleague that evening by the Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Office regarding the conversations between M. Sarajoglu and MM. Stalin and Molotov, from which it appeared that M. Stalin had pressed very strongly for the following modifications of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty recently initialled at Ankara: 

(a) That Article 3 whereby Turkey undertakes to support

Great Britain and France in the execution of their guarantees to Greece and Roumania should be modified and should be included in either Article 4 or Article 5, which would provide only for consultation and not for action;

(b) That the Protocol exempting Turkey from hostilities with

the U.S.S.R. should be widened to provide that, in the event of the U.S.S.R. becoming engaged in war with Great Britain and France, the entire Treaty should be suspended for the period of the war;

Telegram No. 552, dated the 3rd October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, reporting that he had suggested to the Secretary-General that the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs might stipulate, as regards point (&amp;), that the proposed suspension of the Treaty might take place in the event of British or French aggression against the U.S.S.R., but not in the event of Soviet aggression on either France or ourselves.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he regarded the present development as highly disquieting and he had sent a telegram (No. 278) the previous afternoon, the 3rd October, 1939, to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, instructing him to ask M. Sarajoglu for a summary of the proposed Turco-Soviet Pact, since, as the ally of Turkey, we were entitled to information on this vitally important point. At the same time, he had asked Sir William Seeds to ascertain in what precise circumstances it was suggested that Turkey should remain a neutral in the event of the .   [20103] b 3


292

U.S.S.R. becoming a belligerent. He had added that, if Turkey&apos;s undertakings were to be limited, it would be necessary for us to consider whether we Gould continue to pledge our help to Turkey unconditionally under Article 1 of the Treaty and the exchange of Notes without any adequate return.

The Secretary of State drew attention to the opinion expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, in Telegram No. 550, referred to above, that it would be possible to hold the Turkish Government to the text which had been initialled, but that by doing so we should create serious difficulties for them with the Soviet Government.

In the discussion which ensued there was general agreement that it would be necessary to decide very shortly whether the balance of advantage lay in accepting modifications in the Treaty which had been initialled, in the hope of securing a Turco-Soviet Pact which would serve to provide a better understanding between the Turkish and Soviet Governments, or whether such modifications should be refused. On the information available there was a general feeling that if we were to accept the modifications demanded we should suffer a serious diplomatic defeat.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To consider further the position as regards the Anglo-Turkish Treaty in the light of the demands made at Moscow by M. Stalin to M. Sarajoglu in connection with the proposed Soviet-Turkish Pact, as soon as the further information asked for from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow, had been received.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 34th Conclusions, Minute 13.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the War Cabinet certain information regarding possible developments of German policy which he had received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, by whom the information in question had been received from the same source as that which he had communicated to the War Cabinet at the meeting quoted in the margin. Details of the information in question are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

the

The Problem 9.   The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to Telegram

of Polish No. 354, dated the 2nd October, 1939, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister,

Refugees. Bucharest, in which Sir Reginald Hoare 

(i) pointed out that, however tactfully we might refuse visas

to Polish refugees, a deplorable impression would be created amongst them if the refusal were not accompanied by some tangible proof of British sympathy with them in their terrible predicament: and

(ii) suggested that a substantial sum (say  1 million) should be

voted immediately for the relief of Polish refugees as and when required, since the effect of such an action, if taken at once, would be very great.

In the course of the discussion the following considerations were stressed : 

(a) At an interview with the Foreign Secretary some two or three days previously, Count Raczynski, the Polish Ambassador, had made an urgent plea for Polish civilian refugees, believing that those in Roumania were in


293

W.M. 36 (39).

considerable danger. He had put forward no concrete plan, but had spoken of the possibility of our diverting shipping to take refugees to Cyprus or elsewhere until further arrangements could be made. The Polish Authorities were in touch with the International Red Cross with a view to establishing a relief organisation, but Count Raczynski had recognised that, if the plan were to be effective, it would be necessary for ourselves or the French to make an additional grant in support of private charity.

(6) The Home Office was the Department responsible for the admission of Polish as of all other refugees into this country. No special decision had been taken and the difficulties reported by Sir Reginald Hoare arose no doubt from the working of the ordinary rules.

(c) The view was expressed that there were considerable

advantages in collecting Polish refugees in Cyprus, where those of military age could be formed into military units available for military purposes in the Middle East. An alternative suggestion made was that, in view of the fact that a Polish Army was being raised in France, we should endeavour to persuade the French Government to accept further refugees from Roumania for incorporation in the Polish Legion.

(d) The War Cabinet were informed that arrangements were

already being made by the French Authorities to collect Polish refugees at Beirut for the purpose of enlisting them in the French Service; and the view was expressed that Beirut might make a suitable clearing house through which Polish technicians and others could be recruited for the British or the French services as the case might be.

(e) The War Cabinet were anxious to absorb suitable Polish

technicians in armament factories. For strategical reasons it was desired to establish some factories of this kind in Palestine, and in that event a clearing house in Beirut would be very convenient.

In the course of the subsequent discussion there was general agreement that it was necessary in the first place to devise a scheme which would be acceptable to the Polish Government as well as to the French Government and ourselves, and, secondly, that, in view of the difficulties inherent in establishing any such organisation and of the large number of Departments concerned, it would be desirable to secure for this purpose the whole-time services of some experienced administrator. There was general agreement also that any organisation established would need to be attached to the Foreign Office.

The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as a matter of urgency : 

(a) to&quot; ascertain from the French Government their views and the action which they contemplated in regard to Polish refugees :

(6) in consultation with other interested Departments, to formulate a plan for making the best use of the man-power available among Polish refugees now in Roumania and elesewhere :

(c) to submit to the Prime Minister a suggestion as to the most suitable person to be invited to take charge of the proposed organisation.


294

Interception 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Minister

and for Co-ordination of Defence (Paper W.P. (39) 66) covering a Memo-

Examination of randum by the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Censor-Mails on ship on the interception and examination of mails on neutral vessels. Neutral Vessels. In the course of discussion the following considerations were stressed : 

(i) The object of the proposal submitted was to secure the

interception of mails inward bound for Germany, carried in neutral ships. The legal basis for such interception would be the search for contraband since, by fs Hague Convention XI of 1907, postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents found on board neutral or enemy ships at sea was inviolable.

(ii) From the point of view of the Ministry of Economic

Warfare, it was essential that such correspondence should be intercepted, since only in this way was it possible to secure evidence for the Contraband Control Committee. The action now proposed had been adopted in the last war. In the opinion of the Ministry, there was a grave risk that contraband control would break down unless authority was given to intercept mails in the manner proposed. It should be noted, however, that in their War Trade Agreement negotiations the Italians had attached great importance to the inviolability of their mails, and there was reason to believe that Germany might be sending her mails by Italian ships rather than by other neutral ships. No doubt the action proposed would cause annoyance in Italy, but, in view of the importance of contraband control, this was a risk which must be run. (iii) Previous to the outbreak of war, the Board of Trade had demurred to the present proposal, but in the present conditions they no longer did so. It was hoped, however, that the inconvenience to neutrals would be mitigated as far as possible, and in particular : 

(a) it was hoped that the scheme would not be started until an adequate staff had actually been assembled to ensure that intercepted mails were examined with the utmost dispatch;

(b) it was suggested that the expense of re-direction should be borne from British funds and not at the cost of the neutrals concerned.

(iv) It was desirable from the Foreign Office point of view that discretion should be used in deciding the geographical areas to which the plan should be applied, e.g., the present censorship at Trinidad of United States ships was causing considerable annoyance in the United States.

The War Cabinet agreed 

to approve the proposal submitted by the Standing &quot;Interdepartmental Committee on Censorship as set out in the 1 Annex attached to Paper W.P. (39) 66, but with the amendment included below :  

that mails on neutral ships inward bound to Europe and diverted to ports in the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland or to ports in the Mediterranean and Red Sea should be submitted to a full and thorough examination (although no Reprisals Order-in-Council has been issued), but that mails on neutral ships outward bound from Europe should not be examined, except in


295 W.M. 36 (39).

the case of those ships which call at the above ports in the ordinary course of trade, it being understood 

(a) that arrangements would be concerted between the

Departments concerned to ensure that the least possible inconvenience to neutrals was given by the operation of the plan, and, in particular, that the examination of mails should be carried out with the utmost despatch;

(b) that the question whether the expense of redirecting

mails after examination should be borne by the neutrals concerned or be defrayed from the . British Exchequer should form the subject of discussion between the President of the Board of Trade and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Recovery from 11.   The War Cabinet considered a Report by the Civil

Parents of Cost Defence Committee (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 27), recommending that

of Billeting arrangements should be made to recover a part of the cost of

School billeting from parents whose children had been evacuated under

Children. the Government scheme.

The Secretary of State for the Home Department said that the scheme submitted had been worked out with the co-operation of the Local Government Associations and of the London County Council. There had been informal consultations with the Opposition Parties and opposition on party lines was unlikely. There would be some criticism by individuals, however, and the Secretary of State for Scotland said that in Scotland the Independent Labour Party would probably oppose the proposals.

The proposal was that a payment of 6s. per week should be the standard charge (about two-thirds of the cost), and that parents who could do so would be invited to pay more, while the charge would be scaled down for the poorer parents. The Local Government officers who would undertake the work of collection would be acting under the directions of the Government and not of the Local Authorities. One effect would probably be to encourage some parents to bring their children back to the evacuation areas, but this was a risk which could not be avoided.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed his agreement with the proposals, but hoped that a larger sum would be collected than the estimated total of  3,600,000, bearing in mind that the total expenditure on billeting school-children was estimated at some  15 millions a year.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That, as from the 28th October, parents of evacuated school-children should be called upon to contribute towards the cost of billeting, in accordance with the proposals of the Civil Defence Committee set out in the Report quoted above; and that an announcement to this effect should be made as soon as possible.
