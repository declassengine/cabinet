Contents of Leaflets dropped in Germany. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 17th Conclusions, Minute 9.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air said that a high altitude reconnaissance had been carried out on the 23rd September over Germany, to a depth of 20 to 30 miles, and had met with no opposition. There was no further indication of any transfer of German air forces from East to West; nor had the Air Staff any confirmation of a report from French sources of a large concentration of enemy aircraft in the Munster-Aachen area. One of the latest types of German fighters had been brought down in France, and experts were going over to examine it.

Leaflets had been dropped on the Ruhr the previous night, and all aircraft had returned safely.. Some discussion ensued as to the contents of the leaflets. The view generally expressed was that they should contain more in the way of concrete facts. The Lord Privy Seal undertook to look into this matter.

The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for Air.

Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that H.M.S.

A number of aircraft and destroyers, supported by Conclusions,      stronger forces, had been sent to assist the submarine. Minute 2.) A British ship of 4,000 tons, the Steamship Hazelside, had been

sunk near the Fastnet; a French ship had been sunk, off Aldeburgh, probably by mine; and a Norwegian and a Swedish ship had also been sunk. Two Finnish ships had previously been sunk, and German submarines had thus sunk the ships of three neutral countries.

There had been four attacks on enemy submarines, but the results were indefinite.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Military 3.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, although

General Carton de Wiart estimated that about 600 of

their aircraft had made their escape to neutral countries in the last

few days.

During the campaign, large numbers of German mechanised columns had halted, either through mechanical breakdown, or for lack of petrol, and had formed &quot;laagers,&quot; which would have presented admirable targets if the Polish Air Force had been able to take advantage of them.

The provisional conclusions which he drew were, first, that the German Army would take much longer to reorganise and withdraw from Poland than he had previously thought; and, secondly, the vital importance of safeguarding one&apos;s own means of communication and destroying those of the enemy.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty, commenting on the fact that the line of demarcation in Poland between the Russians and the L20050] B 2

Germans was far West of the &quot; Curzon Line,&quot; said that the speed with which the Russians had mobilised and advanced was greater than anything which had been thought possible.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The Military 4.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there was

WM^ajH 25th Secretary of State for War urged that the fullest advantage

In addition, it might also be possible to give valuable assistance to the French in further improving their defence lines. With this object in view, he had arranged for consultations between the War Office and appropriate contractors.

The Prime Minister asked whether it could be inferred from the report of difficulties experienced by German mechanised units in Poland (see Minute 3) that the risk of a rapid break through Belgium by German mechanised columns had receded. It was explained that conditions in the West were far more favourable to mechanised columns than in the East. This reinforced the importance of ensuring effective demolition of roads in Belgium.

British Troops The Chief of the Air Staff said that the French Government&apos;s

The War Cabinet agreed to this suggestion.

5. Reference was made to Telegram No. 471 from Bucharest, which referred to German pressure on Hungary.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had no information which pointed to a concentration of German troops on the borders of Hungary.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Turkey. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to

Negotiations for telegram No. 501 from Ankara, containing the text of the Suspense Anglo-Franco-    Clause.  Under this Clause Turkey would not be required to carry Turkish Treaty. out her obligations under the Treaty until we had supplied her with (Previous        the gold and the armaments which we had undertaken to provide. Reference:       As regards the supply of armaments, the Ambassador had succeeded W.M. (39) 25th in securing that the conditions stipulated in the Suspense Clause Conclusions,      should be regarded as having been satisfied when we had supplied Minute 8.)       the war materials required for the defence of Turkish frontiers in Europe.   From this point of view the arming of the Dardanelles would be allowed to wait.   In the new circumstances it appeared that the provision in the draft Treaty that we should hand over the promised gold without delay had now been superseded, but this point was being cleared up. The latest position as to signature was set out in telegram No. 500.   It looked as though the negotiations would shortly be successfully completed.

The Chancellor of the E-xchequer said that he hoped that it would be possible to arrange for the gold to be delivered to the representatives of the Turkish Government either in London or in Paris, or at least that any subsequent movement of the gold should be at the risk of the Turkish Government and not at ours.

The War Cabinet took note of the stage reached in the negotiations with the Turkish Government as summarised above.

The Far Eastern 7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the Situation. attention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 1284, dated the Sino-Japanese 24th September, 1939, from Tokyo, in which our Ambassador hostilities. reported that he had reverted to a proposal originally suggested in April, that we should inform the Japanese Government that, if it was agreeable to them and to the Chinese National Government, we should be glad to use our good offices in bringing the two sides together, and would make Hong Kong available as a place of meeting. He (the Ambassador) had accordingly, through his Military Attache-, put forward this suggestion tentatively, and on the 22nd September, 1939, he had received a message that an approach on these lines would be agreeable to the Japanese Prime Minister and the Japanese Minister for War, and that the Japanese Government assumed that, &quot; as soon as matters had developed sufficiently,&apos;&apos; the Ambassador &apos;&apos; would communicate concrete proposals to the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs.&quot; Sir Robert Craigie asked for authority to inform the Japanese Prime Minister privately : 

(i) that he was authorised to state that, if the Japanese and

Chinese Governments favoured the idea, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to give facilities for a meeting to be held at Hong Kong with the object of bringing an end to the present Sino-Japanese conflict;

(ii) that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr had accordingly been

instructed to ascertain whether the projected meeting would be agreeable to General Chiang Kai-shek, although he (the Ambassador) doubted whether the General would be able to attend the meeting in person.

In the course of the discussion which ensued, the following considerations were stressed : 

(i) it was very important that we should do nothing which would give world public opinion an opportunity of believing that we were preparing to be parties to an arrangement whereby China&apos;s interests were sacrificed to Japan. It was therefore undesirable that we should become entangled in the negotiations. Against this, the view was expressed that the same objections would not apply if we only acted as an intermediary between the two parties;

(ii) the question was raised whether on broad lines it was to

our advantage or not that the present Sino-Japanese conflict should be brought to an end, having regard to the possibility that, relieved of this entanglement, the Japanese might thus be enabled to intervene to our disadvantage either in Europe or in the Pacific; on the other hand, it might well be unwise to lose an opportunity of improving our relations with Japan;

(iii) General Chiang Kai-shek represented a new spirit in the

Chinese nation, and it would be rash to assume, therefore, that his armies might shortly desert him, as they had deserted previous Chinese leaders, and that the


206

present might be the General&apos;s last chance of negotiating with Japan. On the contrary, it might well be that, given time, he might defeat the Japanese. Further, his struggle was in effect the same as ours. In any case it was essential that we should not take action with the Japanese Government behind the back of General Chiang Kai-shek; (iv) in view of the fact that the proposal for a meeting at Hong Kong arose through the initiative taken by our own Ambassador, care must be taken not to adopt a course which the Japanese Government would regard as a rebuff.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should circulate in the course of the day the text of telegram No. 1284 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, dated the 23rd September, 1939 : (6) to invite the Chiefs of Staff Committee: 

(i) to appreciate the present situation reached in the Sino-Japanese hostilities, and in particular to form an estimate, so far as possible, of the Chinese capacity for resistance; (ii) to express a view as to whether from the purely &apos; military point of view it is to our advantage that the hostilities should continue or cease:

(c) to give further consideration to this question at the meeting of the War Cabinet to be held on the following day (Tuesday, the 26th September, 1939).

The Setting up of Polish and Czedh Governments.

The Polish Government. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 8.)

The Czech Government. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 21st Conclusions, Minute 10.)

8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that our efforts had failed to persuade the Roumanian Government to permit the departure from Roumania of the Polish Government, and that he had nothing further at present to report regarding the suggestion that a substitute Polish Government should be established in Paris. The Polish Ambassadors in London and Paris were alive to the importance of this matter, and the former had arranged to call at the Foreign Office that day. It was possible that at this interview Count Raczynski would report some development.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was in conununication with the French Government as to setting up a Czech Government in Paris, but that he had not yet received their reply.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that while we should not commit ourselves on territorial questions, it was, in his opinion, very desirable that we should provide means by which oppressed peoples like the Poles and Czechs might be given the opportunity to take sides openly with us in the war. The Commander-in-Chief had paid a warm tribute to the high state of efficiency of the three Polish destroyers which had managed to escape.

The Lord Privy Seal suggested that, in view of the large Polish and Czech populations in the United States, we should inform the United States Government confidentially of whatever action we proposed to take with a view to securing their concurrence therein.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that this was desirable.

The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.

9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had no definite information as to the length of time likely to be occupied by the United States Senate in discussing the proposals of President Roosevelt for an amendment of the United States neutrality legislation.   This discussion might well, however, last for five or six weeks.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Purchase of

Chilean

Destroyers.

10. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Chilean Government possessed certain destroyers which they might be willing to sell and which he was anxious to obtain.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would communicate to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Santiago any proposals in the above matter which the First Lord might desire.
