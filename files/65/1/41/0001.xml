Minute 1.) 0f war

One of our reconnaissance aircraft had reported sighting a German force, consisting of one battleship, three cruisers and probably two destroyers near the Norwegian Coast proceeding in a northerly direction. Twelve Wellington heavy bombers had been sent out to attack them.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that Naval dispositions had been made with a view to intercepting the German ships.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Arrangements for neutral shipping to join our convoys were under discussion. In principle, the Admiralty would welcome without charge all neutral ships that wished to join our convoys.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

There was no news from the Western Front except for three reports indicating German activity near the Swiss Frontier.

There was no change in the number of German divisions identified in the West, but it was believed that they had formed two new divisions for duty in Czecho-Slovakia, bringing their total up to 126. Of this total, a maximum of 80 could be regarded as first-class divisions, the remainder being fit only for holding quiet sectors of the line or for internal security work. Some of them might be regarded as on a par with the French Territorial divisions, which were never put into the line. If the Germans concentrated all their forces for an attack in the West, they could count on employing only 80 divisions against the French 60, to which must be added our own 4. The danger was that the German divisions would be massed for the offensive at the selected point, whereas the Allies might be forced to move reserves to meet the German offensive under the full weight of German air attack.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
