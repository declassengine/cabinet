The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that the Wellington

Situation- Bombers which had been sent out on the previous afternoon had (Previous been unable to make contact with the German Naval Force which Beference: had been reported to be off the Norwegian Coast. All the machines W.M. (39) 41st had returned safely.

Conclusions, A reconnaissance of road and rail movements in North-West

Minute 1.) Germany had been carried out the previous day by aircraft of the Royal Air Force component of the Field Force. All aircraft taking part had returned safely. The results of the reconnaissance were not yet known.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the strong

Situation. Naval forces which had been sent out to intercept the German

(Previous force, referred to in the previous Minute, had also failed to make

Bef erence: contact.   It was probable that the German ships had returned to

W.M. (39) 41st harbour.

Conclusions, No attacks had been made on our ships in the previous

Minute 2.) twenty-four hours.

German Surface       There now appeared to be little doubt that the German ship

Vessel in South reported in the Southern Atlantic was the A dmiral Scheer. Nine

Atlantic. hunting units had been sent out.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 40th Conclusions, Minute 2.)

S.S. Iroquois. The United States liner Iroquois had been met by an escort of

Conclusions,

Mmute 3.)___

The Military 3.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that during

Situation. his recent visit to the British sector of the line in France he had

(Previous found a much greater advance in the preparation of the defences Reference: by the French than he had expected. Although our troops had now W.M. (39) 4lst taken over the sector, the French engineer units were carrying on Conclusions, with uncompleted works. Our own engineer units were in full Minute 3.) operation and the work would be pressed forward as rapidly as possible.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave the War Cabinet a brief description of the layout of the defence line in the British sector. He laid particular emphasis on the shortage of effective weapons against low-flying attack. In conclusion, he said that he had found the Field Force in great heart and he was more than satisfied with everything he had seen.

U.P. Weapon. The Prime Minister asked what progress had been made in the

development of the U.P. weapon.

The Chief of the Air Staff said that considerable progress had been made. Hitherto the development of the high-altitude weapon had been the main consideration, but it was now under consideration whether it would not be better to concentrate on the low-altitude weapon.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Transfer of A.A.       4,   The Chief of the Air Staff reminded the War Cabinet that Guns from Air   at the second meeting of the Supreme War Council on the Defence of       22nd September the French had asked for additional British A.A. Great Britain    guns to be sent to France in order to relieve French A.A. guns, to France. We haa already been able to go some distance towards meeting

(Previous the French request and the Chiefs of Staff had been examining

Beference:       whether more could not be done.   It would no doubt have an W.M. (39) 29th excellent political effect if some further concession could be made to Conclusions,      the French following upon the recent meeting with General Minute 6.)       Gamelin.   The Chiefs of Staff recommended that 48 3-inch guns should be released from the Air Defence of Great Britain, of which 40 would be allotted to the Advanced Air Striking Force area and 8 to the British Expeditionary Force area.

In the course of the discussion which ensued it was pointed out that the output of 3   7-inch guns would be about 80 per month, and personnel was ready to take them over as soon as the guns were produced. The subtraction from the Air&apos;Defence of Great Britain would therefore very quickly be made up. Some of the areas from which the guns were to be withdrawn were admittedly very important, but it was necessary to balance up the risks all the way round and to spread our resources accordingly.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(i) To authorise the War Office and the Air Ministry to take immediate steps for the release of 48 3-inch guns from the Air Defence of Great Britain and their transfer to the British forces in France, (ii) That the French should be informed forthwith of this decision.

Negotiations 5.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a Note by the

with the Turkish Chiefs of Staff dealing with the negotiations with the Turkish Mission under    Mission (Paper W.P. (39) 76). General Orbay.

(Previous The Chief of the Air Staff said that the officers who were

Beference:       negotiating with General Orbay had been originally instructed to W.M. (39) 32nd P.lav f r time until the Treaty had been signed.    At that Conclusions      time   it  had   been   anticipated   that   the   Treaty   would be Minute 14.)&apos;      signed very shortly.   Now, however, that signature was clearly going  to be delayed  for  a  long  time,  we could  not keep General Orbay in play indefinitely.    His first mission had failed, and if this one was equally unsuccessful there was a grave danger that the Turkish General Staff, who carried great weigBt in Turkey, would turn against us. The Chiefs of Staff considered that we should now proceed on the assumption that the Treaty would be signed.   There was admittedly a risk in doing this, since the Turks might back out at the last moment. But we could then always either stop shipment of the munitions or recall any which had not actually arrived in Turkey.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that the proposals contained in paragraph 10 of the Chiefs of Staff&apos;s Note meant that we might have to consent to the, Turks placing orders up to the full amount of  25 millions and taking deliveries in advance of the signature of the Anglo-French Credit Agreement with Turkey.

It was pointed out that at least a month would elapse before deliveries reached Turkey and there would therefore be time to see whether the Treaty was signed or not.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs supported the proposal of the Chiefs of Staff.


341

W.M. 42 (39).

The Chief of the Air Staff, in answer to a question by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that the French were acting jointly with us in the negotiations with General Orbay and that it was hoped that they would take the same line as ourselves over the question of immediate deliveries to the Turks.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To approve the instructions proposed by the Chiefs of Staff for the British Permanent Military Representatives in their discussions with General Orbay as set out in paragraph 10 of their Note (Paper W.P. (39) 76).

Turkey.

Turco-Soviet Conversations and the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 39th Conclusions, Minute 11.)

6. In connection with the preceding Minute the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to the following communications: 

(1) Telegram  No.  581  from  His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,

Ankara, reporting that the Turkish Government had decided to send to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs at Moscow the following instructions on the 10th October : 

(a) if we and the French agreed to the modifications

proposed, he was to stay and sign the Turco-Soviet Treaty:

(b) if we refused, he was to leave at once :

(c) if we returned no reply to the Turkish enquiry, he

was equally to leave at once.

(2) Telegram No. 495 to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara,

reporting that the Turkish Ambassador in London had informed the Foreign Secretary that he had been instructed to give an assurance that, if the proposed changes were made in the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Treaty, they would not in practice involve any change in the scope and sense of the undertakings between our Governments.

(3) Telegram  No.   372  from  His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,

Moscow, reporting an interview which he and the French Charge d&apos;Affaires had had with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. The latter had suggested that the French and ourselves should authorise him to tell Stalin orally that we agreed to the new wording of the Reserve Clause. Negotiations for the Turco-Soviet Treaty could then be pressed forward, and the text, when it emerged, could be submitted for the approval of the French and British Governments. If they took objection to anything in the draft Treaty, they could withdraw their previous oral approval. The Ambassador, who was not in favour of any further delay, supported this proposal.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs took the view that we should act quickly in this matter, and that if we did so we should probably secure the Treaty with Turkey. The French were coming round to our point of view, and there was every reason to believe that the Turks were playing straight with us over their negotiations with Russia. We should be fully safeguarded, under M. Sarajoglu&apos;s proposals, in the event of the Turco-Soviet Treaty containing anything objectionable to us.

The War Cabinet 

Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to accept the suggestion set out in Telegram No. 372 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow.


342

The Srao- 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

Japanese War Cabinet that he had telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,

Conflict. Tokyo, stating that, in view of the doubt as to whether the inter-

(Previous mediary with whom he had been in touch in regard to the proposed

Reference: Sino-Japanese meeting at Hong Kong was, in fact, authorised to

W.M. (39) 34th speak for the Japanese Government, he considered it would be better

Conclusions, that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Shanghai, should not broach the

Minute 11.) subject to General Chiang Kai-shek during his present visit to Chungking, at least until the situation became clearer.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Herr Hitler&apos;s Speech to the Reichstag, 6th October, 1939.

Draft Statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 40th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

8. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of a Statement to be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in reply to Herr Hitler&apos;s speech in the Reichstag (Paper W.P. (39) 77).

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that he had since received a copy of a further draft prepared by the First Lord of the Admiralty.

It was agreed that the most helpful course would be to have a discussion as to the general lines of the Statement, and not to deal with drafting points.

The Prime Minister drew attention to three main considerations : First, that he thought that, as the speech had aroused an unfriendly or critical reaction throughout the world, except perhaps in Italy, we should be justified in taking a somewhat stiffer tone in our reply than if the speech had revealed any serious cleavage of opinion. Secondly, that Herr Hitler&apos;s speech said in effect that there was to be no further discussion about Poland, as her future was the concern of Germany and Russia exclusively. Our reply should draw attention to this, and make quite clear that it was an impossible basis for starting peace negotiations, though we should not, on the other hand, commit ourselves to any specific solution of the Polish problem. He would not rule out the possibility of a similar reference to Czecho-Slovakia, but would emphasise that Germany&apos;s actions in Poland were the immediate background with which we were at present concerned. Thirdly, that, in regard to the more general proposals in Herr Hitler&apos;s speech, the answer should be that it would be no use discussing them, since it was impossible to believe anything that Herr Hitler said. This should be illustrated by reference to his past words and deeds. An essential preliminary to any discussion would need to be actions which would be evidence of Germany&apos;s intention to abandon the policy of domination by force, to accept discussion and to abide by their words.  We should avoid any precise statement of our war aims.

The First Lord of the Admiralty expressed his general agreement with the Prime Minister&apos;s points. Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals fell far short of what had been suggested in some quarters as likely to come from him, and opinion in all parties in this country and also in the Dominions and in neutral countries was clear that it was no use holding discussions with Herr Hitler until he showed by his actions that his policy had changed. His conclusion was that the reply should be more definite than he had contemplated even a few days previously, and that we should not attempt to manoeuvre in order to gain time.

The following further points were made in discussion : 

(i) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence attached importance to making clear the general nature of our aims at any Peace Conference; otherwise there was a risk that moderate Germans would feel that, if they deserted Nazism, they would be faced with a dictated peace.    This was reinforced by a telegram from


343

W.M. 42 (39).

Lord Lothian. There was general agreement, however, that we should not state our war aims in detail, and that this would have to be done in very general terms, as, for example, that we were fighting for the restoration of the life and sovereignty of Poland. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought that it was a general statement on these lines that Mr. Mackenzie King, in his telegram of the 7th October, had been anxious to see included in our reply.

(ii) It was agreed that, while the tone of the reply should be very firm, it should not definitely shut the door, but should make it clear that it was for Herr Hitler&apos;to give a reply to our answer.

(iii) One way to test the statement would be to look at it from the point of view of the average German, who might ask on what basis could peace be obtained, short of a peace imposed at the end of a long and bloody war. It must emerge from our statement that France and ourselves were not prepared to make peace unless there was some guarantee for the continuance of real peace thereafter. No doubt it would occur to many Germans that the easiest way to achieve this would be to get rid of Hitlerism.

(iv) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the French Government&apos;s attitude was one of anxiety that our reply was to be postponed as long as Wednesday. In further discussion, he said that he would be reluctant to abandon altogether the suggestion that non-belligerent Powers would be associated at the Peace Conference. No doubt this would let in Russia; but could we hope to exclude Russia altogether 1 He was anxious to include the United States of America; he also had in mind the section of opinion in Germany which took the view that, if they abandoned the Nazi regime, the result would be another Versailles.

(v) On the other hand, it was suggested that French opinion might be sensitive on this point, having regard to the fact that at the end of the last war the United States Government had withdrawn from their promise to guarantee the Franco-German frontier.

(vi) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the French did not ask to be shown a complete draft of our reply. He had therefore instructed Sir Alexander Cadogan to inform M. Corbin of the general lines of the statement which had been prepared. He agreed that it might be necessary that key sentences should be submitted to the French Government.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) To remit the drafting of a revised Statement, in the light

of the discussion which had taken place, to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty, with a view to the revised draft being submitted to the War Cabinet on Tuesday, the 10th October.

(b) That the Statement should be made by the Prime Minister

on Wednesday, the 11th October.

(c) To invite the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to

send further particulars as to the lines of the Statement to the Dominion Premiers that evening, after the Meeting of the Drafting Committee referred to in (a).

Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1. October 9, 1939.
