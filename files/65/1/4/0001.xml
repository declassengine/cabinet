Anglo-Frenoh Plan of Operations.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 3rd Conclusions, Minute 11.)

1. THE War Cabinet received a full report from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff regarding the discussions which they had just had in Paris with General Gamelin regarding the Anglo-French Plan of Operations.

In view of the extreme need for secrecy in this matter, the War Cabinet agreed : 

that no record of this item should be incorporated in the Minutes, but that a single manuscript copy should be attached to the Secretary&apos;s Standard File.

Aircraft 2.   The Secretary of State for A ir made a statement regarding

Production. the extent to which he anticipated it would be possible to increase the monthly rate of production of aircraft at stated dates, subject to no unanticipated difficulties arising in regard either to labour or to materials. As regards the former, the decision taken by the trade unions to permit the employment of women would greatly ease the position. At the present time the chief difficulty was in regard to the supply of certain materials, and later in the year it was likely that another major difficulty would be the supply of aero engines.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Possibility of 3.   The Secretary of State for Air drew attention to telegram

obtaining War No. 765 from Rome, dated 2nd September, 1939, in which Sir Percy Material from Loraine drew attention to the possibility of obtaining air frames Italy. and instruments from Italy and expressed the view that in existing

circumstances the establishment of commercial relations of this kind with Italy would be of great value to this country. The Air Staff had considered this suggestion, and were in favour of its adoption. The Foreign Office also, the Secretary of State understood, were of the opinion that the establishment of commercial contacts with Italy was of great importance.

An arrangement of this kind might be linked up with the sale of coal to Italy.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

that the Secretary of State for Air and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the President of the Board of Trade and any other Ministers concerned, should formulate definite proposals for the consideration of the War Cabinet as to the best way of profiting by the suggestion made by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, regarding the purchase of war material in Italy.
