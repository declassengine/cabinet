W.M. 58 (39).

The Air Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 57th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet that a number of fighter patrols had been despatched the previous day in the hope of intercepting reported raiders, but in no case had the presence of enemy aircraft been definitely established.

Intensive patrols had also been carried out by Coastal Command, during which an enemy submarine had been sighted 33 miles south-west of Portland, and four destroyers sent after it.

There had been no activity of any importance on the Western Front on either side.

Ten squadrons of long-range fighters had been identified in the neighbourhood of Cologne, and a number of aerodromes were reported as having been evacuated in that area. The Chief of the Air Staff explained that this evacuation was probably due to the removal of training squadrons to areas of greater safety inland. The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War

Situation.        Cabinet that there had been a false alarm that morning of a raid (Previous        on the northbound Convoy as it was entering the Forth. Reference: The Deutschland was still at large in the Atlantic on the trade

W.M. (39) 57th routes, but our convoys had so far escaped her. Suitable disposi-Conclusions, tions had been made. The whereabouts of the Admiral Scheer was Minute 2.)       still unknown.

(Previous Arrangements had been made for the protection of the convoy

Reference:       of vessels bringing Russian timber.

W.M. (39) 56th        Several attacks had been carried out on U-boats, both from the Conclusions,      air and by hunting-vessels, but the results were not known. Minute 2.) The Chief of Naval Staff said that the development of the

depth charge for use from aircraft was proceeding satisfactorily, but it remained to be decided whether the existing pistol would stand the shock of the drop, or whether it would be necessary to fit a parachute.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

The Military 3.   The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet

Situation. that there was nothing of importance to report from the Western (Previous Front.

Reference: As a result of a careful check, the latest calculation of the total

W.M. (39) 57th number of German Divisions on the Western Front showed a Conclusions,      reduction of 4 Divisions on the Dutch border in the Cologne area  Minute 4.)       the discrepancy probably being due to certain elements having been counted twice.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Size of the British Expeditionary Force.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 54th Conclusions, Minute 4.) Letter from General

Gamelin asking for the programme of expansion to be speeded up.

[20202]

4. The Secretary of State for War read a letter which had been sent by General Gamelin to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in which the main points were as follows: 

(a) By next Spring Germany would have 160 Divisions, of which 120 to 130 would be available for the Western Front.

(6) To meet this increase, General Gamelin was proposing to withdraw certain Divisions from the Alps and North Africa, but his freedom to do this must depend on Italy.

In addition, he hoped to be able to raise ten new French Divisions by the Spring.

b 2


484

(c) He calculated that, after making all deductions, the British Army would be able to provide 650,000 men by the Spring.   He doubted whether this would be sufficient and therefore asked that we should examine the possibility of speeding-up our programme. A detailed analysis of Germany&apos;s man-power position was attached to General Gamelin&apos;s letter.  This analysis purported to prove that this enormous army was being raised with no grave dislocation of industry.

In the discussion which ensued, the following were the main points which emerged : 

(i) The statement that Germany&apos;s military effort was being

carried out with little or no dislocation of her industrial life was not borne out by reports of shortage of labour in Germany.

(ii) It was clear from these repeated appeals from General

Gamelin that he was not aware of the very great war effort which was being made by this country. It was therefore desirable that we should take steps to enable the French authorities to appreciate that we had set on foot the maximum programme which we believed to be practicable. In this connection it was relevant to bear in mind the extent of our Air programme.

(iii) The additional Divisions which were now being raised by

both the Germans and the French would be poorly equipped. By contrast our plans contemplated that all the British Divisions would be fully equipped and armed.

(iv) Doubt was expressed whether we were entitled to maintain

for our troops a higher standard of equipment than that which would be possessed by certain of the French Divisions. It was suggested that the answer to this question turned on whether it was better to provide a smaller number of troops fully equipped, rather than a larger number of troops less well equipped, (v) Consideration was given to the question whether, in order to allay French misgivings as expressed by General Gamelin, we should inform him that we were planning on the basis of an Army of 55 Divisions by 1941. It was pointed out that General Gamelin had already been informed that our plans extended beyond the raising and equipping of 32 Divisions. We had, however, deliberately refrained from telling him that we were planning on the basis of 55 Divisions, since the French were likely to interpret this information as a commitment to send this number of Divisions to France. We might well wish to send some of these Divisions to other theatres.

It was suggested that the French authorities should be told that we were aiming at the maximum output of munitions, which we regarded as practical, and that, while they might be given a cautious indication that the output planned might equip 55 Divisions, there should be no definite promise that we should put that number of Divisions into the field.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) That General Gamelin&apos;s letter to the Chief of the Imperial

General Staff should be circulated to the War Cabinet as a very secret document to be withdrawn after Ministers had seen it.

(b) To invite the Secretary of State for War to circulate for

the consideration of the War Cabinet a reply to General Gamelin&apos;s letter, drafted on the lines indicated in the discussion.


485

W.M.S8 (39).

(c) To invite the Secretary of State for War to consider what steps might be taken to bring to the notice of the French authorities the true facts of the war effort which was being made by this country, either by inviting special French representatives to visit this country, or by - communicating information to the Permanent French. Military Representatives in this country.

Canada.

first Canadian Division. (Previous Eeference: W.M. (39) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

5. In connection with the preceding Minute the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had that morning received information that the First Canadian Division would be ready to leave Canada early in December. He asked that this information should be regarded as very secret.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Withdrawal of 6,   In connection with the discussion recorded in Minute 4

Regular British above, the First Lord of the A dmiralty suggested that we might Troops from strengthen our contribution to France on land by the withdrawal India. from India of British Divisions which comprised highly trained

(Previous professional soldiers.   Action on these lines would be comparable

Reference:       to the formation by Lord Kitchener during the last War of the W.M. (39) 15th 27th, 28th and 29th Divisions and of the two Anglo-Indian Conclusions,      Divisions.  He stressed very strongly his opinion that such troops Minute 14.)      would constitute a very valuable reinforcement to our forces in France, and that it would be a waste to leave them in India, where their place could be taken by less highly trained troops which were now in England.

The Secretary of State for War explained that steps were already being taken to withdraw the necessary personnel from India continuously, to act as Training Instructors. The difficulty was not one of man-power, but one of equipment. If. as was suggested, divisions were withdrawn from India, it would be necessary for them to leave their equipment behind. It would therefore simply become a choice between the merits of the men to be brought back from India and those who were now in this country. On this point his advisers held the view that the personnel of the Territorial Divisions, who would be sent to France in the near future, were equivalent to any which could be brought back from India. There were other strong arguments for not carrying out the exchange suggested by the First Lord, and he would welcome the opportunity of explaining the matter more fully on another occasion.

The Prime Minister thought that it would therefore be preferable that the whole question should be discussed by a Committee presided over by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

That the question, whether British Regular units should be withdrawn from India and replaced by Territorial units from this country, should be referred to a Ministerial Committee comprising: 

the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence; the Three Service Ministers; and the Minister without Portfolio.

War Alms. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, at

(Previous an interview the previous afternoon, M. Corbin, the French

Reference: Ambassador, had notified him formally of the desire of the French

W.M. (39) 45th Government to initiate discussions with us regarding the Allies&apos;

Conclusions, war aims. He had promised M. Corbin to consider this request.

Minute 7.)

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Eire: The need for the use of Berehaven as a Naval Base.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39) 51st Conclusions, Minute 3.)

The

Constitutional Position.

8. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper W.P.(39) 93) and a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (Paper W.P. (39) 98) on the need for facilities at Berehaven for the Royal Navy.

The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that Sir John Maffey&apos;s Report (enclosure to Paper W.P.(39) 98) showed the rigid and unsatisfactory attitude adopted by Mr. de Valera. Three possible courses were open to the War Cabinet. (1) To seek further discussion with Mr. de Valera: he did not think this would serve any useful purpose. (2) To acquiesce in Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude and endeavour to secure what we could, bit by bit: he feared, however, that this would produce only minor concessions of comparatively little value. (3) To make forcible use of the harbours. If we did so, he did not think that Mr. de Valera would oppose us with military force, but he would indict us before the world and rally his people against us. There would be serious repercussions in the United States and in the Dominions, and the passive support which we now received from great numbers of Irish people would be alienated. In addition, Eire might grant facilities to the enemy.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the easiest course would be to accept either the first or second of the alternatives put forward by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. This,  however, would mean that we accepted the probability of increased destruction of commerce and extreme strain on the protecting vessels and their crews. He thought we should challenge the constitutional position of Eire&apos;s neutrality. We should not admit that her neutrality was compatible with her position under the crown. Unlike the other Dominions which were separated from us by thousands of miles, Eire was an integral part of the British Isles. She had in fact refused to accept Dominion status. We should seek the support of the Dominions, pointing out to them that Eire&apos;s attitude ran contrary to their interests, and emphasising the grave dangers with which the Empire was faced. The submarine danger had so far been held in check, but the position might well become more serious. No doubt it would be advisable to postpone action until the United States Neutrality Act had been repealed; but we should then, having set out the juridical position and made clear to the world that we were not committing a violation of neutrality, insist on the use of the harbours.

The Secretary of State for Dominian Affairs said that when Eire had introduced a new Constitution in 1937, there might have been legal grounds for taking the view that that Constitution was not compatible with membership of the British Commonwealth. After consultation with the Dominions we had, however, decided not to take up the point.

We could, no doubt, challenge Eire&apos;s neutrality on legal grounds. But if we adopted that course we should not have the support of Canada or South Africa. Both these Dominions had taken the view that they were entitled to decide whether, if this country declared war, they should declare war also. Even if we could prove that Eire was not entitled to remain neutral and at the same time to remain a member of the British Commonwealth, the result would be, not to persuade Eire to abandon her neutrality, but that Eire would cease to be a member of the British Commonwealth.


487

W.M. 58 (39).

The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that the declaration that Eire was a foreign Power might have some very painful results for Eire At the present time Eire was having the best of both worlds. She should be told clearly that she was at the parting of the ways, and it should be brought home to her what she stood to lose in being declared a foreign Power. If matters came to such a pass that Eire was expelled from the Commonwealth, we should insist on the return of the strategic points we required.

The Prime Minister said that the First Lord had presented a powerful case. In his judgment, however, the case had not yet been established, and at this moment it was difficult to maintain that the use of the ports in question was a matter of life and death. Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude had been only what he had expected, and he did not doubt the truth of Mr. de Valera&apos;s assertion that the creed of Ireland was neutrality and that no Government could exist that departed from that principle. In his (the Prime Minister&apos;s) view, if we put the case as we saw it to the Dominions, we should obtain complete sympathy. Seizure of the ports, on the other hand, would undoubtedly have the reverse effect. It would have most unfortunate repercussions in the United States and in India, where it would be hailed as a high-handed and unwarranted action. He felt that the risks resulting from our seizure of the ports were so great that we were not justified in taking them until the situation became much worse. He thought that we should start discussions with the Dominions, and get them to share our view of the intolerable attitude adopted by Eire and the dangers for the whole Empire resulting from that attitude. We already had the sympathy of the Dominions, but they could be brought to realise the dangers to them of Eire&apos;s attitude. If Great Britain went down, the Dominions would go down with her.

/The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested that, at the present stage, we should not make use of any threats to Mr. de Valera, and should not make any further statement to him. He was well aware of our attitude.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty suggested that we should take stock of the weapons of coercion. The Law Officers of the Crown should be invited to prepare a Memorandum on legal usage. Again, what would be the consequences to Ireland as regards trade, employment, and so forth, of her being declared a foreign country ?

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, if we reached the stage of informing Eire that she was no longer a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, it might not appear so long a step to demanding the return of ports essential to our security.

The War Cabinet agreed 

(1) to invite the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to

take every opportunity of bringing home to the Dominions that the use of ports in Eire by the Royal Navy was essential for the security of the Empire, and that the present attitude adopted by Eire in that matter was intolerable;

(2) to invite the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers of the

Crown to prepare a Memorandum setting out the legal and Constitutional issues involved in the termination of Eire&apos;s membership of the British Commonwealth;

(3) to invite the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, in

consultation with the Departments concerned, to prepare a Memorandum on the financial, economic and political considerations involved in the termination of Eire&apos;s membership of the British Commonwealth.


488

Russia: pro- 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the

posal for a Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper W.P. (G.) (39) 50), T&apos;ade circulated by agreement with the President of the Board of Trade,

Agreement. and covering a Note prepared in the Board of Trade on the (Previous        possibilities of a Trade Agreement with Russia.

Reference: _     , .       .       . ,    0 ,

WM (39) 54th I11 ^ne co111&quot;86  * an introductory statement, the Secretary of Conclusions State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to the following points :  Minute 5.) (i) As a result of our recent dealings with the Soviet, we

should be cautious in approaching them again. The two alternative methods or obtaining a Trade Agreement were: 

(a) the safe course of conducting negotiations in

London:

(b) the more risky course proposed in Paper W.P. (G.) (39)

50 of conducting the first part of the negotiations in London, but arranging for a Minister of the Crown, preferably the President of the Board of Trade, to head a Delegation to Moscow for the purpose of putting the final touches to the business, and signing the Agreement.

(ii) The second course was open to some obvious objections, but

it was only this course which offered the opportunity of pulling off a big deal. It was only in this way that we should be able to extract from a Trade Agreement its maximum political effect.

The Foreign Secretary read to the War Cabinet a letter received from Sir Stafford Cripps advising His Majesty&apos;s Government in favour of the second method of procedure. According to Sir Stafford, the Russians take no interest in trade negotiations conducted entirely in London.

(iii) While he favoured the second course, he was not prepared

to go as far as Sir Stafford Cripps, who had suggested that the negotiations should be heralded with a press announcement by His Majesty&apos;s Government. This would be unwise.

(iv) He was influenced by the apparent result of Herr Hitler&apos;s

request to M. Stalin for economic assistance. It seemed that M. Stalin had replied that he wished to reserve his freedom to trade with the United Kingdom and the United States.

(v) It should be made clear that a British Delegation would

only proceed to Moscow if political conditions permitted. This would be readily understood as a warning that we should be unable to proceed further if Russia committed an act of aggression against Finland.

(vi) If all went well in London, it might be possible for our

Delegation to leave for Moscow in about three weeks&apos; time.

The following additional points emerged in the course of discussion : 

(a) The War Cabinet were reminded of the speech which

Herr von Ribbentrop was to make at Danzig that evening. It was possible that the indications as to the outcome of the recent Russo-German conversations had been misleading, and that Herr von Ribbentrop would announce that Russia was about to offer an extended measure of economic assistance to Germany.

(b) A telegram  of the  22nd  October  from  Sir Hughe

Knatchbull-Hugessen (Angora telegram No. 649) showed that the Turkish Foreign Minister was optimistic as to the Soviet Government&apos;s intentions. He had formed the


489

W.M. 58 (39).

impression that the Soviet were not anxious to play Germany&apos;s game, and expected to see a further Russian approach to Turkey in the near future.

(c) The War Cabinet Were informed that the Chancellor of the

Exchequer, who was unable to be present that morning, felt doubt as to the wisdom of any Delegation to Moscow at the present time being headed by a Minister of the Crown.

(d) On this last point the general view of the War Cabinet was

that nothing would be gained by half-measures, and that the risk involved was worth taking.

(e) It was also felt that, unless we were prepared to give a hint

fairly early in the proceedings that we were prepared to consider sending a Delegation to Moscow, headed by a Minister, the Trade, Negotiations would not make satisfactory progress.

(/) Owing to the uncertainty of the situation, our contraband control policy towards Russia had not yet been worked out in any detail. There were geographical difficulties in the way of any effective scheme of control, but there was no case for displaying greater leniency towards Russia than towards other neutrals. It followed that we must take effective measures to limit the importation into Russia of essential commodities likely to be passed on to Germany. It might be possible to evolve a &quot; navicert &quot; system of rationing Russia&apos;s imports, and to negotiate this in parallel with the Trade Agreement.

The War Cabinet agreed as follows :  (i) They invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade to take action on the general lines proposed in Paper WP. (G.) (39) 50.

(ii) The Conclusion at (i) was to be regarded as subject to reconsideration in the event of Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s speech at Danzig disclosing that Russia had committed herself to any far-reaching economic concessions to Germany.

(iii) The  procedure  contemplated  was  that  the Foreign

Secretary would send for M. Maisky the following day and would inform him that the President of the Board of Trade had a proposal to make for the improvement of trading relations between this country and the U.S.S.R. This proposal, however, could only be put into effect if political conditions permitted.

(iv) M. Maisky would then be received by the President of the

Board of Trade, who would inform him in guarded terms that, on the understanding that a sufficiently comprehensive Trade Agreement could be negotiated in London, and on the further understanding that, once substantial agreement had been reached here, the Soviet Government would not go back on it in Moscow, we should be willing to send a Delegation to Moscow for the purpose of completing and signing the formal document in which the Agreement would be embodied.

(v) As regards the question of a Minister of the Crown

heading the Delegation to Moscow, the President should confine himself at the present stage to a hint that, if the London negotiations should show good progress in general, and if it should appear that any outstanding difficulties were capable of being resolved by personal contact between Ministers, His Majesty&apos;s Government might think it desirable that the British Delegation to Moscow should be headed by a Minister. A Ministerial Delegation, however, would only be able to stay in Moscow for a very limited time, probably a week at the most.


490

(vi) To invite the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister for Economic Warfare to give further consideration to the contraband control policy to be pursued towards Russia, in order to ensure that contraband control issues should be taken into account in the negotiation of the Trade Agreement.

Criminal 10.   The Prime Minister said that he had to answer a

Justice Bill.     Parliamentary Question that afternoon on the intentions of the (Previous        Government in regard to the Criminal Justice Bill.   He had References:      discussed with the Lord Privy Seal and the Home Secretary the Cabinet 4 (38), possibility of proceeding with it.   There was a great deal more Conclusion 11.   work required on it, and it would impose a considerable strain on Cabinet 29 (38), the Home Office and on the drafting officers.  Further, it appeared Conclusion 8.)    that it would be virtually impossible for the Scottish Office to draft the necessary provisions for its application to Scotland, which were very complicated.   The Lord Privy Seal had informed him that, if it were not put through now, it might be many years before it could be revived, and though he felt it was most unfortunate that all the labour put into it should be wasted, he had reluctantly come to the conclusion that it was not possible to proceed with the measure at this juncture.

The Lord Privy Seal agreed, with regret, that it was probably inevitable that the measure should be dropped. There was, however, considerable public interest. There had been a leader in The Times and a good deal of comment in the provincial Press in favour of the measure. In the circumstances, he suggested that the statement should not be made until the following week, as it would then be possible to say with greater colour that there would be no time to put it through before the end of the session. Furthermore, it should be remembered that the Opposition had said that they would facilitate the Bill&apos;s passage.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(i) that, in the circumstances, it was not practicable to proceed with the further stages of the Criminal Justice Bill in the current Session : (ii) that the Prime Minister should answer the Parliamentary Question down for that afternoon by saying that he regretted that he was not in a position to answer the Question that day, but that he hoped to be able to make a statement the following week.

Food Rationing. 11. The First Lord of the Admiralty called attention to (Previous articles, which were appearing in the Press, foreshadowing the Reference: introduction of food rationing. No decision had yet been reached W.M. (39) 2nd by the War Cabinet in regard to the introduction of rationing, and Conclusions, the publicity in the Press was, therefore, most unfortunate. In his Minute 11.)      view there was no case for the introduction of meat and sugar

rationing in the near future.

In the course of discussion, it was generally agreed that

unauthorised publicity in regard to food rationing was undesirable.

Reference was also made to the consequences of petrol rationing.

which were very serious to a number of small traders.

The Lord Privy Seal said that the question of rationing would

come before the Home Policy Committee at a Meeting to be held at

10 a.m. on the 25th October, and would be considered later in the

morning by the War Cabinet.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1, October 24, 1939.
