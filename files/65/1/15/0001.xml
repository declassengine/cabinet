W.M. 15 (39).

Tne AIr 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that, except for an

Situation.        attack on a German submarine, there was nothing to report. (Previous .

Reference : W.M. (39), 14th Conclusions, Minute 3.)

The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it was hoped

Situation. that no British ships had been sunk in the previous 24 hours. Some (Previous anxiety was felt for one ship that had reported a submarine close Reference: at hand and from which no further news had been heard. A French W.M. (39), 14th trawler had been stopped by a submarine, but had been allowed to Conclusions, proceed when her nationality had been established. There had been Item 3.) seven attacks on enemy submarines.   The British submarine Ursula

had torpedoed an enemy submarine in the Bight. Steps were being taken to locate and carry out a further attack on the submarine which had been attacked by aircraft, as reported by the Secretary of State for Air. He thought that it might be advisable shortly to make an announcement about our attacks on enemy submarines. There was no doubt that we were giving them a very rough handling.

The large troop convoy was in the Mediterranean. One thousand tons of munitions for Turkey were in one of the ships of this convoy, but it would have to proceed to Alexandria as the munitions were at the bottom of the hold. Even so, the ship should arrive in a Turkish port on the 19th. The position regarding the remainder of the munitions for Turkey was somewhat obscure, and rather less promising than would appear from the information given

W.M. (39), 14th to the War Cabinet the previous day.   It was possible that some

Conclusions,      had been diverted round the Cape.

Item 9. In reply to an enquiry by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the

First Sea Lord said that he had wired to the Naval Attache in Spain for information about the German tanker reported off Ferrol, but had not yet had a reply.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Military 3.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there

Situation. were two serious features of the situation in Poland.    First, the

(Previous German thrust towards Lwow, which threatened to turn the left of

Reference: ^he Polish line&gt; and to sever their communications with Roumania : W.M (39), 14th secondly, the German advance from East Prussia behind Warsaw. Conclusions Now that communication across the Corridor was open, the Germans Item 4) were able to make use of the good railways in this area to reinforce

their left flank. Although there had been rain, it had not been enough to fill the rivers and marshes.

A discussion took place as to the probability of an attack on Roumania as the next German move. It was suggested that there were a number of indications to show that this was the German intention, and a successful campaign in that region would not only give the Germans access to the resources of Roumania and to the Black Sea, but would have a great moral effect on the Balkans as a whole.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it would be a very difficult operation to attack Roumania without passing through Hungary. If Germany were to make the attempt, it would remove all possibility of an attack by them in the West, at any rate until the spring. The further the Germans became involved in the East the more difficult it would be for them to withdraw their mechanised formations. There was good reason to hope that [19999] B 2


110

measures to prevent the Germans making immediate use of the Galician and Roumanian oilfields, if they captured them, would be successful.

On the Western Front there was nothing fresh to report. The number of German Divisions had increased to 36, and French preparations were proceeding. The scope of their next operation would probably depend on the degree of resistance encountered.

The Chief of the Air Staff confirmed this view from discussions which had taken place between the French Commander-in-Chief, and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.

German Observance of International Law.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 14th Conclusions, Minute 7.)

Suggested Approach to President Roosevelt.

Guidance for the Press.

4. The War Cabinet considered a report by the Chiefs of Staff on German observance of international law (Paper No. W.P. (39) 26).

The Chief of the Air Staff emphasised that whilst, from the strictly military point of view, the Chiefs of Staff adhered to the policy which they had recommended, and which the War Cabinet had approved, they realised that pressure of opinion might result in a change in policy, if it were established that Germany had had recourse to indiscriminate bombing in Poland. They therefore recommended that a secret and personal telegram should be addressed to our Ambassador in Washington asking if President Roosevelt would take steps to find out the true facts in regard to the allegations that Germany had adopted unrestricted air-warfare in Poland.

The Chiefs of Staff made two further requests, which were not included in the report, namely: 

(i) that our Ambassador in Washington should be given a

detailed statement of our policy :

(ii) that we should do nothing except in concert with the

French.

In the discussion which ensued, the view was expressed that we should exercise great caution before allowing ourselves to be persuaded, by German infringements of international law, to deviate from the policy which we had laid down for ourselves in the matter of air warfare. There was a risk that we might be led to use our air force on uneconomic operations and thereby jeopardise our chances of winning the War. On this account it was felt that the proposed telegram to President Roosevelt might result in our putting ourselves into a false position. Other arguments adduced were that the United States Government would not welcome our asking them to conduct an inquiry in Poland, one result of which might be to put on the President the responsibility for giving us the signal to start unrestricted air warfare. It was also felt that the proposed approach to President Roosevelt might serve to accentuate our-inability to help Poland, and thereby alienate neutral sympathy. It was also recalled that in the last War we had ourselves conducted an inquiry into the German atrocities in Belgium, and that this inquiry had occupied several weeks.

The Prime Minister said that it was evident that there was general agreement that a telegram on the lines proposed should not be sent to President Roosevelt. He thought that such a telegram would be construed as a dodge on our part to draw the Americans into the war, and would, therefore, provoke resentment.

The question was raised as to how. this matter should be dealt with by the Ministry of Information. It was agreed that the Press should be given a free hand, and that, while the Government should, of course, in no way defend the German action, they should not for the present issue an official Communique&quot; on the subject.

W.M. 45 (39).

It was pointed out that a Parliamentary Question was to be asked that afternoon in regard to the official German announcement. It was agreed that the Answer to this should be on the following lines : First, that this announcement was in flat contradiction to the German Chancellor&apos;s recent statement in the Reichstag; secondly, that the restrictions which we had imposed on our operations were based on the observance of similar restrictions by our opponents; thirdly, that our strategy and tactics must be governed by the consideration of the most effective prosecution of the War.

Some discussion ensued as to Air objectives. The discussion on this point is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(a) that no communication should be addressed to President

Roosevelt in regard to the reports that Germany had adopted methods of unrestricted air warfare on Poland :

(b) that a detailed statement of our policy, with an explanation

of the reasons for our apparent inactivity vis-a-vis Poland, should be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington:

(c) that the Press should be allowed freedom of expression in

regard to the alleged adoption by Germany of unrestricted air warfare in Poland.

Air Strength. 5.   In the course of discussion on the preceding item, the view

was expressed that the War Cabinet should be furnished with an up-to-date analysis of our Air position, in a form which would enable them to consider Air Policy in terms of our Air strength in relation to that of Germany. It was agreed that the most stringent precautions should be taken to safeguard this information.

The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for Air to prepare a detailed analysis showing 

(a) the present Air strength of this country in relation to that

of Germany, with particulars of first-line Air strength, immediate and stored reserves :

(b) the present and future production position.

Reopening of 6.   The Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security

Cinemas, reminded the War Cabinet that, in pursuance of the conclusion

Theatres and     noted in the margin, arrangements had been made under which other Places of  cinemas, theatres and other places of entertainment in neutral and Entertainment,   reception areas should be allowed to remain open until 10 p.m., (Previous        subject to the right of Chief Officers of Police to close particular Reference:       premises if they thought necessary.   The matter had been further W.M. (39), 7th considered by the Committee for Home Security at their first Conclusions,      Meeting on the 12th September (Reference (H.S.C. (39) 1st Con-Minute 6.)       elusions)) from the point of view of cinemas and other places of entertainment in the evacuation areas.    The Home Security Committee thought that some further relaxation would be justified. The question had been discussed with the Trade, which had indicated that, in the absence of information as to the future policy of the Government, they would have to consider the disbandment of their organisation, the closing of the premises, dismissal of staff, &amp;c.

The proposal which the Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security desired to make was that, except in a small area in central London, cinemas and other places of entertainment in evacuation areas should remain open up to 10 p.m. In the small central London area the closing hour would be 6 p.m.


112

There was reason to believe that the Trade would accept the new proposal and would not disband their organisation. The proposal involved some risk, but the Chief Officers of Police would arrange that adequate precautions were taken. If and when the air attacks on this country materialised, the position would be immediately reviewed.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To approve the proposals of the Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security that cinemas and other places of entertainment in evacuation areas should, for the present, be allowed to remain open until 10 p.m., except in the case of a small area in central London where the closing hour should be 6 p.m.

Obscuration of 7.   In the course of the discussion recorded in the foregoing

Lighting. Conclusion, The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War

(Previous Cabinet that the Controller of the Navy had pressed for some

Reference:       relaxation of the lighting restrictions in factories engaged on W.M. (39), 14th essential Naval production. Conclusions, The War Cabinet agreed : 

Minute 0) To invite the First Lord of the Admiralty to confer on

the matter with the Home Secretary and Minister for Home Security and the Secretary of State for Air.

Balkan Neutrality.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 7th Conclusions, Minute 9 (d).)

8. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee (W.P. (39) 18) and a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (39) 25).

The Foreign Secretary referred to paragraph 28 of his Memorandum, where he expressed the view that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be directed, so long as Italy remained neutral, and so long as we attached importance to that neutrality, towards ensuring, so far as might be possible, the formation of a neutral bloc in the Balkans. If the War Cabinet approved this conclusion, he proposed to convey its substance to the French Government.

The Foreign Secretary warned the War Cabinet that the appreciation in his Memorandum was liable to be offset by German action such as an invasion by Germany of Roumania, the possibility of which was mentioned in Sir R. Campbell&apos;s telegram No. 203 from Belgrade, but unless, and until, this happened, we should frame our policy on the basis mentioned in the concluding sentence of his Memorandum, namely, &quot; A neutral, and a fortiori friendly Italy seems more valuable to us than a Balkans forced by us into belligerency.   And the two are almost certainly incompatible.&quot; .

Since his Memorandum had been drafted we had received two telegrams from Mr. Rendel at Sofia, the first of which (No. 176) recommended that we should urge the Roumanians to ensure themselves against the risk of Bulgaria joining in a German attack upon them by satisfying the Bulgarian claim to the Southern Dobrudja. We might make representations to this effect to Roumania, but he, the Foreign Secretary, saw no chance of such representations being successful. The second telegram (No. 177) contained the suggestion that His Majesty The King might address a private and personal letter to King Boris. He, the Foreign Secretary, favoured this proposal and was in communication with The King&apos;s Private Secretary on the subject.

The Foreign Secretary also referred to a very secret telegram received from Belgrade, in which Sir R. Campbell intimated that Yugoslavia and Turkey might be about to put pressure on Bulgaria


113

W.M. 15 (39).

to declare how she stood. He, the Foreign Secretary, had not yet had an opportunity of consulting with his advisers, but his own inclination favoured some less drastic procedure.

The Foreign Secretary said that on the previous day he had had a long discussion with the Roumanian Minister, who had stated that Roumania&apos;s policy was based upon 

(i) a neutral bloc in the Balkans into which it was hoped to bring Bulgaria;

(ii) an improvement in Roumania&apos;s relations with Hungary;

and

(iii) the creation of a Black Sea non-aggression bloc.

Here again this policy might be upset by a German invasion of Roumania. He, the Foreign Secretary, understood that in the course of his conversations with M. Daladier, the Prime Minister had received assurances that the French Government were in general agreement with us as to the line to be pursued in the Balkans.

The Prime Minister agreed that this was so.

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, while he agreed with the line which the Foreign Secretary proposed to take, he thought that, if it was true that Germany was about to attack Roumania, the policy would require reconsideration. In the light of the latest information, it might be all to the good if Yugoslavia joined with Turkey in putting pressure upon Bulgaria to declare her intentions, and he would also suggest that we should put considerable pressure on Roumania to offer to Bulgaria the southern portion of the Dobrudja, which was entirely inhabited by Bulgars and which Roumania had seized after the last Balkan war. Certain Roumanians in London had informed him that Roumania would not exclude the cession to Bulgaria of the Southern Dobrudja, if by that means Bulgaria could be brought into the Balkan bloc. As a result of pressure from Yugoslavia and Turkey, and of an offer of territorial concessions by Roumania, it might be possible to obtain Bulgarian acquiescence in joining that bloc. In any case if our present policy was to be broken down, we should do everything possible to marshal Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria ana Roumania against the German threat to invade the latter.

The Prime Minister saw no reason why we should discourage Yugoslavia and Turkey from putting pressure on Bulgaria to declare herself. On the other hand, he thought that it would be undesirable for us to put pressure on Roumania to surrender the Southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria since, first, we had already made representations to this effect without any success, and, secondly, the pressure of events might well make Roumania adopt a much less intransigent attitude. It seemed not unlikely that, if Germany overran Roumania, Bulgaria would remain neutral, but would have some secret arrangement with Germany by which she was to receive the Southern Dobrudj reward for keeping quiet.

The Foreign Secretary thought that perhaps the most significant feature of Sir R. Campbell&apos;s telegram was that Prince Paul should be contemplating so drastic a step as joint pressure with Turkey on Bulgaria. This looked as if Prince Paul&apos;s fears in regard to Italy had diminished. In this connection the Foreign Secretary informed the War Cabinet of a telegram just received from Sir P. Loraine which contained re-assuring information as to the general attitude of the Italian Government.


114

The War Cabinet: 

(i) approved generally the appreciation of the position in the Balkans as set out in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (39) 25) and authorised the Secretary of State to convey the substance of the appreciation to the French Government;

(ii) took note of the conclusions in the Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (39) 18).

Turkish Aid to 9. In the course of the discussion recorded in Minute 8 above, Roumania. the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he had the previous day seen M. Tilea,.the Roumanian Minister in London, who was confident that, if Roumania was attacked by Germany, Turkey would come to her aid. Contacts between the two Governments had been greatly improved since the German-Soviet pact, and the Roumanian Government were counting upon receiving substantial Turkish help if Roumania were invaded by Germany.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that Turkey would certainly not be able to transport a large force across the Black Sea in time to prevent Roumania from being overrun.

The First Lord of the Admiralty considered that the arrival of even three or four Turkish divisions in Roumania would be of the greatest assistance. Transport over land would be possible, if Bulgaria could be persuaded to throw in her lot with Roumania.

The Prime Minister said that the desirability of securing an overland route for the passage of Turkish troops to Roumania provided an additional reason for not putting obstacles in the way of the plan of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia (referred to in the discussion recorded in Minutes 8 above) to make Bulgaria declare her position.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Turkey. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the

(Previous        attention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 443, dated the Reference:        13th September, 1939, received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, W.M. (39), 13th Ankara, stating that he had heard that the British counter-Conclusions,      proposals had been considered by the Council of Ministers on the Minute 9.)       previous day, that extreme dissatisfaction had been expressed at our delay in meeting Turkish requirements, both as regards finance and war material, and that it had been decided to adhere to the original Turkish proposals.   The Ambassador expected to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day (the 14th September, 1939), and proposed to offer to increase the proposed gold loan to  15 million, the maximum authorised, and to point out our intention to purchase large quantities of Turkish tobacco, and our decision to examine the possibility of making further purchases of Turkish produce.

In the discussion which ensued the view was expressed that the Turkish Government were probably trying to drive a still harder bargain, and that the best prospect of securing their early agreement to the proposed treaty would be to indicate clearly that we were not prepared to increase our offer.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

To postpone further consideration of the position of Turkey until after the receipt of a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, reporting the result of his meeting that day with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

W.M. IS (39).

Italy- 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the

(Previous War Cabinet that he had received from a highly secret source a

Reference:       report, which corroborated information previously received, both as W.M. (39), 12th to the internal situation in Italy and as to the general desire in that Conclusions,      country for the maintenance of neutrality.   It was clear that the Minute 2.)       economic difficulties of Italy were very great.  In the case of coal in particular, stocks in Italy were very low, and great difficulties were experienced in arranging the transport of further supplies from Germany.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Far Eastern Situation.

(Previous Reference: W.M. (39), Conclusions, Minute 13.)

8th

12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention of the War Cabinet to a secret telegram received the previous day from Sir A. Clark Kerr, Shanghai, reporting that arrangements had been made for the meeting of the Japanese Defence Council. There were reasons for thinking that the Japanese had proposed to establish a new defence scheme, and would thereupon make a demand for the withdrawal of French and British contingents from Shanghai. A telegram had been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, asking him to exert such influence as was possible on the Japanese Government in this matter.

As regards Tientsin, telegram No. 436 of the 11th September, 1939, from Mr. Jamieson showed that the barrier restrictions were still in full force.

As regards the Japanese suggestion that British and French garrisons and warships should be withdrawn from China, an interim reply had been received to the communication addressed to the French Government (in accordance with the decision reached at the meeting of the War Cabinet, noted in the margin), from which it appeared likely that the French Government would not dissent from our view, but would be largely guided by the nature of the reply we received from the United States Government to the communication we had addressed to them on this subject.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Supply of Air- 13.   The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet of

craft to Poland, the steps which were being taken to meet the request of the Polish (Previous Government for the immediate supply of aircraft by this country. Reference: While the Air Staff adhered to the view that no fighter aircraft

W.M. (39), 9th could be spared at the present time, they were prepared immediately Conclusions, to release 20 battle aircraft for the Polish Government, and to agree Minute 5.) that, if necessary, these should be flown to France for collection there and subsequent delivery to Poland by Polish pilots. The Air Staff were further prepared to facilitate in every possible way the arrival of the necessary Polish pilots in France, and a plan was at present under consideration whereby one or two bomber transport aircraft, or possibly civil aircraft operating on the Mediterranean air routes, might be sent to Poland to fetch them if this was desired.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

Assistance from 14. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the India. Secretary of State for India (W.P. (G) (39) 6) dealing with pro-

(Previous posals put forward by the Government of India for increasing the Reference: output of munition factories in India, and for forming two addi-W.M. (39), 8th tional Brigade Groups for employment overseas.

Conclusions, j-Ag Secretary of State for India suggested that the financial

Mmute 4.)       aspects of these proposals could best be dealt with in discussion between the Treasury and the India Office.   These proposals formed [19999] c


116

no part of the recommendations of Lord Chatfield&apos;s Committee on the Defence of India. The expenditure involved must, therefore, be regarded as falling outside the Chatfield settlement.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that, in determining the incidence of the cost, regard must be had to India&apos;s capacity to pay. It would not be possible in time of war to regard the size of India&apos;s peace-time budget as a sufficient indication of that capacity.

The Secretary of State for India said that he must ask that in present circumstances the proposed additional Brigade Groups should not be employed in Palestine. It was true that the Brigade Groups would be mixed (British and Indian), but the use in Palestine of even the British troops in a mixed Brigade Group would be severely criticised in India.

The War Cabinet: 

Gave general approval to the proposals in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India. It was agreed that it would be impracticable in present circumstances for Indian troops to be employed in Palestine, but no decision was reached as to the employment in that country of British troops forming part of mixed Brigade Groups.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for India were invited to settle in consultation the incidence of the cost of the proposals.

Question of Recalling Regular British Troops from India.

15. The First Lord of the Admiralty reminded the War Cabinet that one of the measures adopted in 1914 had been to recall home the Regular British battalions serving in India, replacing them by Territorial battalions. The result had been to make a fine body of seasoned troops available for inclusion in the British Expeditionary Force in France.

The First Lord asked whether it was not desirable that a similar exchange of troops should be carried out now.

The Secretary of State for War said that the immediate need was to obtain Regular personnel from India to assist in training. His immediate policy was to obtain such Regular personnel by a system of reliefs, Territorial personnel being sent out from England to India. For the time being, however, it was not the intention to send out Territorial units to India.

The War Cabinet: 

Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War to examine the matter further in consultation.

Report of a Discussion with the High Commissioners for Canada and for the Commonwealth of Australia. (Previous Reference: W.M. (39), 8th Conclusions, Minute 16.)

16. The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported to the War Cabinet that there had been a discussion on the previous evening between certain members of the War Cabinet and Mr. Bruce (the High Commissioner for the Commonwealth of Australia) and Mr. Vincent Massey (the High Commissioner for Canada). The Foreign Secretary, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, the Minister without Portfolio, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and himself had been present.

Mr. Bruce and Mr. Massey had asked that they might be put into a position to give their Governments a clear picture of the strategical situation which might be expected to arise during the next six months.

The two High Commissioners had taken an unwarrantably gloomy view of the situation, and in particular of relative air


117

W.M. 15 (39).

strengths. This view was based on misleading information which they had received from certain Dominion Officers on duty in this country.

The United Kingdom Ministers had not been fully briefed in all the details raised by Mr. Bruce and Mr. Massey, but they had been able to demonstrate that the situation was much more favourable than the latter had been led to believe.

The War Cabinet agreed : 

(1) That the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff Committee

should be instructed to prepare an appreciation of the political and military situation for the information of Dominion Governments. (A military appreciation for the information of the Dominion Governments was understood to be already in course of preparation by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.)

(2) To invite the Minister without Portfolio (in the chair), the

Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to consider the existing system of collaboration with the Dominions; how far it met the needs of the present situation; and to make suggestions for any improvements that were considered desirable.
