The Beyeridge(previous reference:W.M.

Interim Report by the Committee on ReconstructionPriorities (W.P. (43) 58).(2) A Note by the Foreign Secretary covering a memorandum setting out the American reactions to the SeveridgeReport (W.P. (43) 59).In the absence of the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet had a provisional discussion as to the line to be taken by the government spokesmen in the Debate in the following week.The Lord President of the Council gave a summary of the mainconclusions reached by the Committee on Reconstruction Priorities.The following were the main points made in discussion The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the question whether we could afford the expenditure involved in giving effect to theproposals in the Beveridge Report was sure to be raised in the debate. From this point of view he attached the greatest importance to paragraphs 3-6 of the Committee&apos;s Report. these paragraphs recommended that the Government Spokesmen shouldmake it clear that no firm commitments would be entered into at thepresent time, and that any statement of the Governments views on particular proposals in the Beveridge Plan were all subject to this general proviso. Furthermore, while the Government must reachprovisional decisions as to post-war plans, all these plans must bebrought under review and related to the financial situation when thetime came to give them legislative effect.Furthermore, it would be wrong to hold out any hopes of speedylegislation. While the Government could say that a start wouldbe made on working out detailed plans, this would put a greatburden on the Departments and could not, therefore, proceedvery fast.These views were accepted.At the same time, several Ministers stressed that acceptance ofthe main &quot;features of the Report should not be expressed in agrudging spirit, since any such attitude would be contrary to thegeneral opinion likely to find strong expression in Parliament andin the country.The Paymaster-General thought it would be desirable toemphasise, even more strongly than in paragraph 4 of theCommittee&apos;s Report, the extent of the competing claims on theExchequer, and to make it clear that, if Parliament wished theprinciples in the Beveridge Report to be accepted, this must mean that there would be less money available for other objects.... As regards paragraph 4 of the Report, the President of theBoard of Education said that the draft Education Bill (which hadbeen mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech) would be ready for considera-. tion by Ministers in six or eight weeks.Discussion ensued as to whether, subject to the proviso on thefinancial aspects, the Government. Spokesmen should say that theGovernment looked with favour on certain proposals in the report but rejected others, at any rate in their present form. Thesuggestion was made that the Government might with advantagedeal with the matter much more generally, and do no more thanindicate that they looked with favour on the principles underlying the Report generally, but reserved the right to vary details,. The view of the War Cabinet was that, having regard to thepublic interest which had been aroused and the general attitude inthe House of Commons, it was not practicable to deal with thematter in such general terms.The Committee had recommended (paragraph 11 of Report)that it should be announced in the Debate that, the Governmentfavoured a scheme of childrenVaUowances, but considered that the[25038-3] b 2
A compre-liensive health service.Maintenance of^Employment -(paragraphs 16-Universality ofInsuranea(paragraph 28).amount should be 5s. for each child after the first in every fauuly.Tt should be added that, concurrently, every effort would be made to supplement the cash allowance by developing the child welfare services.&apos;The PaymasterzGeneral suggested that, if the government spokesman had to say, at the outset of his statement, that theGovernment, while accepting the principle of children&apos;s allowances,proposed to reduce the amount from the 8s. suggested by Sir william beveridge to 5s., it would be difficult to avoid giving the impression that the Government, while accepting the principles of the Report,were proposing to pare down its recommendations wherever possible.In discussion it was suggested that a definite acceptance of theprinciple of children&apos;s allowances, at a figure of 5s. in respect ofeach child after- the first in every family, was not likely to beregarded as ungenerous. Until the figure of 8s. had been mentionedin the Beveridge Report, advocates of children&apos;s allowances hadrarely suggested a higher rate of allowance than 5s. Further, it was an essential part of the Committee&apos;s recommendation that, inaddition to the cash allowance, allowances in kind should beextended to the fullest extent practicable.In this connection, it was pointed out that, in areas wherereasonably full provision was made for giving allowances in kind toschoolchildren (e.g., through meals, milk, &amp;c.) the services providedwere the.equivalent of a cash allowance Of Is. %di a week; and this figure would be raised to 2s. Qd. a week if the school meals were provided free of charge. If, therefore, these services were extendedto all parts of the country and fully developed, they would go aconsiderable way towards bridging the gap between the 5s. a weekwhich, under the Committee&apos;s proposal, would be given in cash andthe figure of 9s. a week which was assumed by Sir William Beveridgeas the minimum cost of maintenance.Reference was made to the advantages of allowances in kind, ascompared with cash allowances. When allowances were made in kind, there was a greater certainty that the benefit reached the child;and there was no danger of depressing wage levels. If the cashallowance were, put at 5s., there would be greater scope for thedevelopment of allowances in kind and the child welfare services in general.     . &apos;It appeared from the discussion that paragraph 11 of theCommittee&apos;s Report had not brought out sufficiently clearly theextent to which the Committee had intended to rely on the develop-ment of the system of making allowances in kind. It had, in fact,been the Committee&apos;s intention that it should be made clear in the debate that &quot;the Government favoured the grant of children&apos;allowances both in cash and in kind; and that, while the. cashallowance would be fixed at 5s., it was intended that allowances in kind should, concurrently, be developed- to the fullest extentpracticable. It had been contemplated that the government spokesmen would stress the value of existing child welfare servicesand would explain the extent to which these would be developed,concurrently with the introduction of a system of cash allowances.No points were raised on the recommendations inparagraphs 14-15 of the Committee&apos;s Report.It was suggested that possibly somewhat more emphasis, mighthave been placed on the statement in paragraph 20 of theCommittee&apos;s Report that the Government intended to make everyeffort to achieve and maintain a high level of employment; and thatthis paragraph might have been framed in a somewhat moreoptimistic tone.The Lord President of the Council said that there might be astrong feeling in the House that the State insurance scheme shouldnot be extended to classes which were net in heed of State assistance.He thought that the War Cabinet ought to consider this pointcarefully.
101 W.M.28C48).\u .t i;. ; The general view of the War Cabinet was in favour of making.: the plan of universal application. The: two main grounds in favourof, ,this decision were : first,&quot; the administrative difficulties of&apos; anyother basis; secondly^ that in present conditions it was extremely.. i;i difficult to draw a line between those Who were in need of insuranceunder the scheme and those of whom it could, safely be said that neither they nor their dependants Would ever be in need of any oftfie benefits &quot;of the Plan.Bates of The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security thoughtBenefit that it would be desirable to make it clear that, while final decisions&quot; Subsistence as to the rates to be adopted under the Plan must be deferred untilRate&quot; (para- legislation to give effect to it was introduced,, the Governmentgraphs 24-27). Spokesmen could state that, broadly speaking, the Government didnot think it would be necessary to depart at all widely from the ratesof unemployment and sickness benefit laid down in the Report.This view met with general approval.Discussion ensued as to the principle in the Beveridge Reportthat the rates of benefit should be sufficient to provide, withoutfurther resources, the income required&apos; for subsistence in all normalcases. The view generally taken was that the subsistence principle involved review of the rates in the event of a material change inthe cost of living, and that the embodiment of the principle in thescheme was therefore inconsistent with the fact that the scheme wascontributory, the rates of contribution being closely related to theamount of benefit.Unemployment.        No   points   were   raised   on   the   recommendations   inparagraphs 29-32 of the Committee&apos;s Report.Old Age The Committee had recommended (paragraph 36 of Report)Pensions. that the Government should reject the scheme of old age pensions- proposed in the Beveridge Plan, but should be prepared to consider what increases could be made in existing pension rates. these increases would take the form of fixed rates, not rates on a risingscale.In discussion, reference was made to a recent article by aMr. B. Seebohm Rowntree, in the course of which it was statedthat, even before the introduction of the supplementary pension scheme, not more than about one-third of old age pensioners were inpoverty, and to give full subsistence pensions from the outset of ascheme to people who had neither contributed for such pensionsnor were in need of them would place an unjustifiably heavy burden on the Exchequer. It was suggested that, in any new scheme, care should be taken to avoid providing pensions from public funds atincreased rates for people so circumstanced that they did not require futher assistance. On the other hand, it was recognised that proposals for increased pension rates would win Parliamentarysupport on grounds of sentiment; and there would be littleenthusiasm for provisions requiring a test of need.The War Cabinet, while in general agreement with therecommendations in the Committee&apos;s Report, thought that theGovernment Spokesman should call attention to the problem of avoiding a situation in which increased pensions would become payable to persons who had neither contributed for such pensions. \, nor were in need of additional assistance.The Government Spokesman should also be prepared to dealwith the problem of adjusting, in the light of any increase in Statepensions, retirement pensions payable under Trust Deeds.Invalidity No points were raised on the paragraphs in the Committee&apos;^(paragraphs 37- Report dealing with these subjects.88): . - ,\   .
- K y : 102.The Committee had recommended (paragraph 49 of &quot;Report)th&amp;teit^s^^- of the Approved Societies as independent&apos; financial units wasincompatible with the basic conception ^security plan; but the Government Were ready;&apos;to. consider thepossibility of Using the services of the Approved Societies within the- framework of a comprehensive scheme. &apos;In. discussion it was stated that the Approved Societies were preparing to resist this conclusion, and were seeking to mobiliseParliamentary support for their interests. It was probable thai?there would be some Parliamentary controversy on this point. 1$these circumstances it was for consideration whether the govern -ment Spokesmen should take the definite line suggested in theCommittee&apos;s Report, or whether the Government should avoid sucha definite pronouncement Until they had heard the views expressedin the course of the Debate.The War Cabinet favoured a definite statement on the lines,recommended by the Committee. Among other reasons for adoptingthis course was the fact that, until such a statement had been made,the Approved Societies would be unwilling to discuss seriously thepossibility of their services being used on an agency basis.Beath Benefit - The Committee&quot; had recommended (paragraphs 50-51) that and Industrial death benefit should be included under the unified scheme of socialAssurance . insurance; but had recommended the rejection of the tentative(paragraphs 50- suggestion in the Beveridge Report that industrial assurance as51). a whole should be converted into a public service.The War Cabinet endorsed the Committee&apos;s conclusionsregarding death benefits. As regards industrial assurancegenerally, they decided that the Government Spokesmen in &quot;the debate should not go further than to say that the proposal to convertindustrial assurance into a public service was not an integral partof the social security plan, and it was therefore unnecessary for theGovernment to take a final decision on that point at this stage.Widows&apos; No points were raised on the paragraphs in the Committees-Benefits (para-  Reports dealing with these matters.graphs 52-53). &quot; .Administration(paragraph 54).      &quot; .,     &apos; -Government . It was agreed that the Lord President of the Council shouldSpokesmen in be the first Government Spokesman in&apos;the Debate, and that thethe Debate.       Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and the Chancellorof the Exchequer should hold themselves ready to. speak on thesecond and third days. &quot;Approved^asieties;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W-1,February 1% 1943,
