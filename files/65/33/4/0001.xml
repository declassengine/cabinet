The Colonies.

Future Colonial Policy. (Previous Reference W.M. (42) 166th Conclusions, Minute 1).

1. The War Cabinet had before them the following documents:-

(1) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (43) 6)covering the Comments of the Dominion Governments on the draft Declaration which had been approved by the War Cabinet on the 9th December.

(2) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Lord Privt Seal and the Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (43) 8), covering a revised draft of a proposed Joint Declaration on Colonial Policy.

(3) Four Memoranda dealing with the position of India and Burma in regard to the Declaration (W.P. (42) 575, 606 and 614 and W.P. (43) 7).

(4) A telegram from the Viceroy (W.P. (43) 9) giving his personal views on the position.

(5) A Note by the Lord Chancellor (W.P. (42) 607) do the term "parent State."

The following points were made in discussion:-

(a) It would be unfortunate if any ground were given for the view that the proposed Declaration was to be made in response to pressure of United States opinion; moe especially when our achievements and record in the Colonial field were taken into account. It was explained, however, that the proposal to issued a Declaration had in the first instance arisen from the demand for such a statement from opinion in Pariament and among the people of this country.

(b) It was believed that the issue of the Declaration would have a reassuring effect on public opinion in this country and would make it clear that we had no intention whatsoever of yielding to ill-informed clamour about our Colonial Empire. Attention was drawn in this connection to the first sentence of paragraph 4, which stated that the "Parent States would remain responsible for the administration of their territories."

(c) The first three paragraphs of the draft Declaration did no more than put on record our existing Colonial policy. The fourth paragraph incoporated the proposal of Regional Commissions. This was generally regarded as a great improvement on the system of the Mandated Commission of the League of Nations which had operated between the two wars.

(d)  It was generally felt that it would be of advantage if the proposed statement were made, not unilaterally, but jointly with the United States. It was suggested however, that changes in political opinion in that country made it by no means certain that they would now wish to associate themselves with the Declaration. It was proposed that the Dutch Government should, at an appropriate moment, be asked to associate themselves with the Declaration.

(e) There was much to be said for rather larger units in Colonial administration. We had learned much from the successful experiment of setting up a Resident Minister in West Africa.

The War Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions were as follows:-

I. The following amendments should be made in the draft Declaration: - 

Paragraph 1 should read as follows:-

"The immediate object of the United Nations is to defeat the present agression and to render future agression impossible. This requires for its successul achievement the establishment of conditions under which security, prosperity and equal opportunity can be assured to all peoples."
PwdgYapft &amp;; Ufa! 1: The^wbrd?n eventual&quot; shouldomitted.Paragraph 4-  The: fii^t&apos;sentence should read as:;-fbllowsr&apos;:- ; ., -  -.&quot;The Parent, or Trustee States will remain responsible fortones, fefut the policy embodied in this Declarationcannot, successfully be pursued without a^large measure, of co-operation between nations,&quot; ,&apos;Thrp^ughaut^the Declaration the phrase &quot; Parent&quot;or &quot; Trustee&quot; States should be used instead of the phrase.&quot;Parent&quot; States.II. The Declaration as amended should be sent to theDominion Governments&apos; by the Secretary of State for; Dbmittiori Affairs, under cover of telegrams explainingthe1 extent to which it had been possible to meet their comments, and why it had not been possible&apos; to accept,^number of their sug^stiohs. -III. The replies of the Dominion Governments, when received, -would be circulated to the War Cabinet before further action Was decided upon&apos;.IT: The position&apos; of India and Burma in regard to theproposed1 Declaration was as stated in paragraph 4 ofthe MemOraridum by the Secretary of State for theColonies, i.e:, once the area&apos;covered and the functionsof the proposed Commission for South-East Asia hadbeen defined, it would be decided, as a matter of fact,whether India arid Burma have a major economic orstrategic ititJere^t in the region, and should with advan-tage haVe representation on the Commission. Theexistence, of a considerable Indian population in one oftfie territories would not of itself constitute a major economic interest.India. 2!  When it was decided in the summer of 1942 that GandhiDetention should be detained, it was agreed that, if he^ declared a fast, heof Gandhi. would not be released&apos;: specifarrariements were to be&apos;made with a(Previous- view to relieving the Government of India of responsibility forEeferehce: safeguarding his life and health; aridif he chose&apos;to fast, he was toW.M.(42)i2ist be left to1 take1 ^consequerieeslConclusions, The War Cabinet now had before them? a Memorandum by the minute 3).

This hadgrevibusly beeti the view of the majority of the Provincialoverriors and: of the Viceroy&apos;s Council; and iri the view of the considerations now; rirgetf by Sir Roger Luhiley the Viceroy felt obliged to revert to his earlier view that, if&apos; Gandhi begun to fast,he should Be released as ^obrias^his life&apos;was Endangered.The War cabinet also had&apos; before them three telegrams fromthe Viceroy (Nbsv 22-SC; 3^S and 38-S) from which it appeared that Garidfii might be contemplating a fest:   In a personaf letteris^id that he had given himself six months(which worildJexprre on the 9th February) and was now nearing theetfd&apos;-bf!fiispatierifce:The Secretary bf State for /ferf^ said t^at, while he wouldhave preferred to adher??tb the original decision, he felt that this; (  : :   wa^ primarily a matter for the Government of India and that therewere no sufficient grounds for overriding the views formed by the responsible authorities On the spot.     .
.. assumed that, they- would. in practice - recoinmend -hisV      release^ almost as soon as he began to fast.    Infapt,therefore, such a decision would mean, not release whenhe was at the point of death, but release very soon-   I after he first refused food.   He would thus be put in a!:      position to obtain his release at any moment he chose.If he were so released, and then broke his fast, it was* unlikely that the Government of India would bring himback into detention^. : trouble. : h ;(b) The view was expressed that it would be an act of weak-ness on the part of the Government of India to decide in advance that Gandhi should be released as soon ashe began to fast. If his detention had been justified,. it was unjustifiable to allow him to decide when it shouldbe brought to an end.. On the other hand, it was urged that the situation had changed during the six. months of his detention.The movement of revolt which he had sought to instigatehad been broken. Though the position of the Govern-ment of India would have been fatally weakened if theyhad given way to him at that time, there was now norisk that his release could be acclaimed as a victory forCongress.   . -I&apos;(c) It was not suggested that any of the other Congress leadersunder detention should be released if they declared afast. Was it reasonable to give this preferential treat-ment to Gandhi ?Some members of the War Cabinet felt that a distinction could be drawn in this matter betweenGandhi and the other Congress leaders-partly on theground of his great age and failing health, and.partly because he was a great religious figure in India.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that if circum-stances were now such that Gandhi could be released without serious risk of reviving unrest, it would be preferable that the Governmentof India should release him as an act of State, rather than be forced into doing so by hiis own decision to begin to fast.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary, of State for India to remind theViceroy that it had been clearly understood from the outset that, if Gandhi were detained, he should not be allowed tosecure his release by a threat to fast unto death. TheWar Cabinet attached great importance to preserving theprinciple involved. If conditions ;iwSre now such that, Gandhi could be released:.without.serious.-risk, they would prefer that he should be set at liberty oncompassionategrounds (e.g., his age, health, and the fact that he hadalready been, detained for nearly six months) rather than beable by fasting to secure his-i^iea^^^^;^u^;&apos;.:^-.!:The War Cabinet would be glad to haveviews on- this suggestionbefore: any further action wastaken, and in the meantime no reply need,he sent to the personal letter whichGandhi had addressed tp the Viceroy;, The draft pf this telegram ?. to the Viceroy should besubmitted to the Prime Minister before despatch.v !
