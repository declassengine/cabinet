(W.PJ (43) 104)&apos;Minute 4.) recommending (a) That the loading of 30,000 tons of cereals and10,000 tons of nitrates monthly for the Middle&apos;     .     East.&quot;should rank as a&apos; first charge On: cargoshipping space to that area, even if military&apos; programmes should thereby be affected.(b) That: the Minister of State should be invited to make available for delivery by sea to Turkey 10,000 tonsof cereals monthlyup to a, total of 50,OOQ tons, tobe lifted in Turkish ships^ in addition to suchbarley as he could provide for delivery by rail&apos; &apos; from Iraq.. -(3) A Note by the Prime Minister (W.P. (43) 106) emphasising the need for adopting a strict line in dealing withrequests for cereals froni the Indian Ocean area.The Minister of War Transport said he was now satisfied thatit would be necessary to replace the 50,000 tons of cereals Which wereto be sent fromf Egypt to Turkey. Withdrawals from Egypt for thebenefit of other countries in the Middle East area, including persia and Malta, made this replacement necessary., This should, however,meet all Egypfs essential heeds, so far as cereals were concerned.As regards nitrates, failure to meet Egypt&apos;s minimum needswould have the result of i obliging us to ship increased quantities ofcereals into the Middle East area at a later stage. Moreover, theEgyptian Government would not part with cereals now, for, export to-other territories within this area whose needs were more urgent,unless they were satisfied that they..would get enough nitrates to assure their next season&apos;s. crop. It was therefore to the advantageof our shipping situation generally to meet Egypfs essential needs for nitrates.. . iThe Minister of War Transport asked that these monthlyloadings of 40,000 tons of cereals and nitrates should rank as a first charge on cargo shipping space to the Middle East, even thoughmilitary programmes might thereby be affected. He explained,however, that within the last few days the Chiefs of Staff had asked the United States authorities to make available for the Red Sea14 additional American^controlled ships, which were regarded asthe minimum addition necessary for essential military needs. Ifthese ships were made available, it would be possible to arrange forthem to carry, in addition to military supplies, a large part of the cereals and nitrates how in question, and the?; programme!of civilimports which he now proposed could be carried through with very-little effect on the shipping of military requirements; If, on theother hand, the request for the 14 United States ships were unsuccessful, this; wouldmean the postponeinent of the dates of pro-jected military^operations; but, in that event, other ships wouldbecome available for the carriage of the cereals and nitrates -to.Egypt.The Secretary of State for War agreed that a substantial partof this civil programme could be carried! in the 14 additionalUnited States ships without prejudice to military requirements.He&apos; pointed out,^however, that the &apos; recommendation made- in w.P. (43) 104 was not expressed &quot;as contingent on the success of theapplication for the, 14&apos; additional United States &quot;ships.1- Moreover,was it reasonable to assume that we should either obtain all the14 ships or none at all ? If the United States authorities agreed to: ;ioafee a- somewhat ;&apos;si^Ue!r?h^b0if- di-osiri^
155 W.M.i 39 (43).able to meet essential military needs by the due dates if this smaller number of ships was used wholly for the carriage of militaryreSoirements. For this reason he was opposed to reaching anydecSkrnnoWwhich would make this civil programme a first charge on shipping to the Middle East.The discussion was then adjourned until 6 p,m. in order thatan agreed estimate might be prepared of the tonnage, in terms ofships, required to carry that part of the civil requirements whichcould! not be stowed, Without prejudice to military jteeds, in vesselsdevoted primarily to military stores.     ,&apos;.. When the discussion was resumed, the War Gabinet were^informed that this balance, Over and above the civil cargoes which* could be carried in ships devoted primarily ifco military stores, was probably the equivalent of 3 ships. The Ministers were agreedthat, if 14 additional United States ships were forthcoming, thewhole of the civil cargoes in question could be carried! withoutprejudice to military requirements. If, however, the United states authorities provided less than 14 additional ships, there would bea point at which supplies for military operations would been dangered if, as suggested in W.P. (43) 104, the monthly shipment of 40,000 tons of civil requirements remained a first charge on shipping proceeding to the Middle East. That point would bereached if not more than 11 additional ships were madeavailable by the United States authorities.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, as the marginwas not more than the equivalent of 3 ships, the right course wasto give the Minister of State the assurance for which he had askedand, if the need should arise, to find from other sources such additional shipping as might be required to fulfil the civil pro-gramme, and to meet essential military needs by the due dates.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows : (1) The Minister of State should be informed that arrange-ments would be made to ensure the monthly shipment tov Egypt from North America of 30,000 tons of cereals andv . 10,000 tons of nitrates for a period of five months beginning in April next.(2) The Minister of &quot;War Transport was.authorised to arrangefor the shipment of the above quantities of cereals andnitrates to the Middle East.(3) If the United States authorities supplied a number ofadditional ships, somewhat less than the 14 for whichthey had been asked, and the shipping space available forthe Middle East became insufficient to meet the abovecivil requirements and minimum military needs,additional shipping would have to be found from other-    \ sources, so as to avoid prejudice to essential military needs.(4) The Minister of State should also be authorised to arrangefor the delivery by sea to Turkey of 10,00.0 tons of cerealsmonthly up to a total ,of 50,000 tons, to be lifted in turkish ships, in addition to such barley as he could provide for delivery by rail from Iraq.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,March 11,1943.
