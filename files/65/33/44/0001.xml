Two enemy ships of an escortedconvoy had been sunk by M.T.Bs. off Terschelling.In Central Tunisia, in spite of the weather, which had turnedthe ground into a swamp; the American Army had begun their attck on the 16th March. They had entered Gafsa on the 17th, andhad now occupied El Guettar.

The main enemy positions had beenpenetrated, and it was probable that the battle would last several days. The enemy showed every sign of being determined to standand fight.The War Cabinet were given an account of the operations against Akyab, together with a statement of the opposing forces inthis area and the total casualties suffered by both sides up to theend of February.Operations in Russia were still hampered by thaw conditions.In the northern and central sectors there had been less activity. Theenemy had made some progress north-west of Kursk, and his successat Kharkov had been followed up by the capture of Byelgorod.On the Taman Peninsula the thaw still prevented any major operations, but the German evacuation was continuing, probablymainly by sea..

At their meeting on the 22nd February,the War cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to submit the!draft of a Parliamentary Question and AnsWer Snowing&apos; the extentto which refugees had already been admitted to British territory.TheWar Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by thePrime Minister (W.P. (43) 113) covering the draft of a Parlia-mentary Question and Answer on this subject.The draft Answer gave the numbers of refugees of differentnationalities received at various times into various parts of theBritish Commonwealth. It was suggested that there might be advantages in adding a sentence; giving the gross total of all the items now mentioned separately.The Lord Privy Seal asked whether he might, use some of thesefigures in a debate which was to take place in the House of lords on the following day. Most of the figures had already been published, and it was agreed that there would be no objection tosome of them being quoted in the House of Lords before the answer was given in the House of Commons.The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that certain minor drafting alterations would have tobe made before the Answer was given.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle, the draft Answer circulated with-P (43) 113.(2) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to consider the above suggestions, andto submit the draft, as amended, to the Prime Ministerfor use at an early date as a written reply to a Parlia-mentary Question.Prisoners ofMar.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet were informed that the German Govern-ment&apos;s reply to the communication addressed to them was tp theeffect that they proposed to continue the shackling of our prisonersunless we and the Canadian Government issued a complete andcategorical order which would forbid, under severe penalty, anyshackling of prisoners.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that a further communication had now been receivedfrom Berne in regard to an avant-projet received from the GermanGovernment as to the repatriation of British and German sick, and wounded prisoners of war. He thought it would be convenient to postpone discussion until the two matters could be considered together.        - MThe War Cabinet-Agreed to this suggestion.
