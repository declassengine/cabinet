v: &apos; - - :    112    . ?;       -     - mThe War Cabinet were informed that, at the conclusion of themeeting of the House on the previous day, a meeting, had been heldof the Administrative Committee of the Labour Party, at whichdissatisfaction had been expressed with the Government^ attitudetowards the Beveridge Report. In consequence, four members ofthe Labour Party had put down the following amendment toMr. Greenwood&apos;s Motion,* namely, to leave out all words after&quot; this House&quot; and to add &quot;expresses its dissatisfaction with thenow declared .policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards! theReport of Sir William Beveridge on Social Insurance and allied services, and urges the reconsideration of that policy with a view tothe early implementation of the plan.&apos;&apos;      iThe War Cabinet were informed that the Chair might feel itnecessary to call this amendment in the Debate on the following day.The matter had been further discussed at a meeting of theLabour Party that morning, which had shown that the dissatisfaction-tion had centred round two pointsFirst, feeling in the Labour Party strongly favoured theimmediate setting up of a Ministry of Social Security. TheGovernment spokesman, however, had made it clear that no new organisation would be established until legislation had been passed through Parliament; and, moreover, had left open the questionwhether the proposed unified administration of the Social SecurityScheme should be a Ministry or should take the form of some kindof Statutory Board.Secondly, the impression had been&apos; created that the government did not intend to introduce legislation for some considerable time,possibly until after the end of the war, or until a- new parliament had been elected.On the first point, the Minister of Labour and National service said that, for administering the payment of benefits in accordancewith specific rules, there were strong arguments in favour of a statutory Board rather than a)-Ministry. Formatters where policy was developing, however, or where a wide measure of discretion mustbe exercised, a Ministry was to be preferred.As to the date when the new organisation should fee-set up, itwas generally agreed that to establish it now wOuld hinder and not help work on the preparation of detailed schemes and the drafting of legislation, all of which must be dene before effect could be givento the plan as a whole.The War Cabinet-. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to deal with thismatter on the above lines in the course of the Debate that afternoon.So far as concerned the second point, the War Cabinet decided against any departure from the position as set out in para-graphs 3-6 of the Report of the Committee on \ ReconstructionPriorities (W.P. (43) 58) and the decisions which they had already reached.-.- Thus,, as soon as the Debate was over, work would proceed in formulating the details of the new scheme, on the basis of thedecisions reached by the Government, and negotiations would atonce be begun with the interests concerned. considerable importance was attached by Ministers to adequate time being allowed for negotiations with the various organisations andAssociations. It was clear that all this work would take a veryconsiderable time, and that it might well be at least a year beforethe necessary legislation had been drafted.* &quot;That this House welcomes the report of Sir William Beveridge on social Insurance and Allied &quot;Services as a comprehensive review of the present3)1-0visions in this sphere and. as a valuable aid in determining the lines onwhich developments and- legislation should be pursued as part of theGovernments policy of post-war reconstruction.&quot;Parliament.The JBeveridgeReport.(previous reference:W.m. (43) 29thConclusions.)
113W.M. 31 (43).-By the time that stage was reached, the Government wouldprobably be in a position to give a much closer estimate of the costof the other claims likely to be made on the Exchequer by schemesof post-war reconstruction. At that point it would be appropriate for the Government to bring.all these plans under review, to relatethem to the financial situation, and to decide which plans should go forward. There was, therefore, nothing to be gained by the Govern-menfs entering into a commitment at this stage - to introduce legislation for the reform of social services during the war.Equally, however, the Government had not debarred, and did not intend to debar themselves from introducing such legislation duringthe lifetime of the present Parliament.One possible course of procedure mentioned in discussion wouldbe that the Government should introduce and pass this legislation during the war, but should leave over for later determination theAppointed Days on which the various parts of the scheme would bebrought into operation, and perhaps also the Rates of Benefit.While there were disadvantages in this procedure, it would atleast have the merit that it would avoid the Government being forced to enter into financial commitments in respect of social security before it could be seen whether the nation&apos;s finances couldcarry this extra burden without damage to objectives of higher priority; e.g., international security and measures to maintainemployment at the highest attainable level.The War Cabinet accordingly-Decided against any modification of the decisionspreviously recorded; and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to deal with the form and date of establishmentof a unified organisation for Social Security, on the lines indicated in the discussion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,February 17, 1943.
