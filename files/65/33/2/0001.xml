Relief, Food (W.B, (42) 61ft), the President of the Board of Trade(Previous      (WP- (42)621) and the Chancellor of the Exchequei (W.P. (43)2)Reference:,      about relief stocks. -Co^ludons&quot;94 following were the main points made in discussionV-^ - -Minute 2.) (1) The Minister of Food said that his representatives^ in&quot;Washington were faced with eiiquirieSjj-a^Cjt^,^^^.contribution we could make to the United States policyof building up food stocks for the &quot;relief of occupied orliberated areas While we could make no large contri-bution, he thought that we ought to offer to do what we* could, and thus make sure that we worked hand in hand. with the United States on post-war relief.. (2) Any action which we could take would also strengthen thehands of the United States authorities in their task of reducing consumption in order to build up stock pilesand to make food available on lend-lease terms for theUnited Nations. Unless rationing was introduced inthe United States, there was a risk that the UnitedStates might be unable to send us sufficient supplies,particularly of those types of food which were valuable*for giving a more varied diet.(3) Unless we now explained what we intended to do in regardto post-war relief, it. would be difficult to prevent certain countries, e.g., the Dutch and the Norwegians, from nowpurchasing food themselves in order to build up stocks.(4) The Minister of Food therefore favoured giving an under-taking that we should be prepared to make foodavailable from our own stoeks: for the purposes Of relief,subject to early replacement where this was essential.He also thought we should. invite the United StatesGovernment to make a joint declaration with us to theeffect that we would continue after the war the rationing of food (and presumably also of clothes) and other suitable measures of control over essential commodities,so long as the available supplies were insufficient to meetthe urgent needs of the allied countries which hadregained their freedom.(5) It was emphasised in discussion that, with the best will inthe world, no contribution which we could make would go far to alleviate the famine conditions with which,v large areas of Europe would be faced after the war.Thus,  The Minister of A griculiure and Fisheries, mentioned an estimate that, if the war ended a yearhence, world supplies of food, other than wheat, wouldnot suffice to ensure for the population of Europe morethan half the food rations (other, than wheat) whichthe people of this country at present received. Again,he thought that cereal production! in Europe could nptbe restored in less than three years, and that it mightbe a generation before the cattle population wasback Jtbjnormal: For these reasons it was for&apos;consideration whether wib -ought not;:to;-plan, for the continued expansion of our home production even after the War,thereby increasing the amount available for relief.(6) It was also pointed out that the resources of the United&apos;States.,-though immeasurably greater&apos;than Our own inthis respecty would not go, far to meet the famine conditions anticipated in Eurofte. Moreover, the stocks which the United States v^^^, proposing to accumulatedid not represent a very hign proppiition of their foodproduction. For example/ttewere only  per ce^cent.; and potatoes, 11 per cent. *&apos;
; (7) On the other hand, relief needs: would not be limited to food;Thus, the President of the Board of Trade pointed Outthat from the surplus stocks xtf the Forces we might beable &apos; to prpyide : substahtial &quot;quantities. of medical&apos; supplies, clothing and boots,&apos; lorries and&apos; * ambulances.Furthermore; We held large&apos; stocks of Wool and cotton,&apos;&apos;1 both here and overseas. After making provision for thefull employment of our textile industries in this country,there would still be a substantial balance which could bemade available for relief purposes. We need not, of;cOursev undertake in advance to give away these stocks,but might indicate that these surpluses would be^available for use in the rehabilitation of Europe.(8) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thought itwould be desirable that Dominion Governments shouldbe consulted in this matter, more especially seeing thatrationing had not so far been applied throughout theDominions.(9) The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the latest information from the Treasury representative in washington was that the position in America had now changed,. and it was no longer intended to make animmediate approach to Congress for any appropriationfor relief.   While he agreed generally that it was- desirable that the relief supply problems should bebrought under the Combined Boards machinery, he didnot think that the time had yet come to make any declaration about post-war consumption policy or a continuance of rationing on account of relief. Hethought that the first step, was that an authoritativeenquiry should be made to find out what president roosevelt had in mind on this matter.(10) The Foreign Secretary, on the other hand, pointed outthat in a telegram received on the previous day our ambassador at Washington expressed the view that itwas most important that some action should be taken todispel the impression which was gaining ground inAmerica that the United States would have to bear thewhole burden of post-war relief and rehabilitation. he supported the proposals contained in the Memorandumof the Minister of Food and hoped the War Cabinet- would accept them.(11) In further discussion, general agreement was expressed with the view that it was important that some indication of our attitude in this matter should now be given to theUnited States Government. On the other hand, several ministers doubted the wisdom of making a joint state-ment at this stage in regard to continuance of food rationing after the war:(12)- The Prime Minister, while confident that the people ofthis country would be willing to act with philanthropy,and charity towards the liberated peoples of Europeafter the war, thought that it would be better that any decision on this matter should be taken by the people themselves&apos;when the time came, rather than that weshould enter into an undertaking on their behalf at thepresent time, when the circumstances Which would existcould not clearly be foreseen. The Prime Minister addedthat, in his view, no decision could be taken untilPresident Robsevelt&apos;s intentions had been ascertained:
Gabinet-s cp  .rheI Prime Minister undertook to ascertain the Presidentsviews and intentions on this issue, and to communicate with him in the sense of the following:--(a) We have been told that the United States Adminis-tration are considering the building up of stocksof foodstuffs for the relief of reoccupied andliberated territories.(6) We are both ready and willing that it should be known that this country will play such part inthis matter as its capacity and circumstancesallow. It has been suggested that a joint declara-tion by the United States Government and HisMajesty&apos;s Government of their intentions mightbe helpful.(c) If the President favours such a joint declaration,the War Cabinet would almost certainly agree toa declaration to the effect that, in dealing withthe relief of reoccupied and liberated territories,Great Britain will not fall behind any other country in philanthropy, charity and readiness tomake sacrifices after the war.The Dominion Governments should be consulted in thismatter/ but not until a reply had been receivedindicating the Presidents views.es of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,January 5, 1943.
