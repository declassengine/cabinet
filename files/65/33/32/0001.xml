117 W.M. 32 (43).1.   The War Cabinet had before them  v s.  j;(i) A Note by the Prime Minister (WJP.(43) 54) coveriM-adraft Directive indicating the&apos; assumptions rbgardmgthe duration of the war on which Ministers sbduulproceed in determining priorities for research anddevelopment;(ii) A Note by the Lord President of the Council and theMinister of Production (W.P. (43) 66) suggesting that,in the light of this Directive, Departments should review -all research projects now in hand, and that, in order thatthe maximum advantage might be derived therefrom,arrangements should also be made for them to beconsidered centrally.^ The War Cabinet endorsed the draft Directive attached to thePrime Ministers Note, and agreed that each of the Departmentsconcerned with research work should assess in the light of thatDirective the relative value of the research projects for which eachwas responsible.Discussion centred round the proposal for a central survey.The Secretary of State for War asked whether it would not be enough that each of the Ministers concerned should determine, inthe light of the Prime Minister&apos;s Directive, priorities among the research projects for which his Department was responsible ?It was pointed out that the need for some central review arose from the fact that there Was now an acute shortage of skilledpersonnel, materials and apparatus for various specialised branchesof research work. It was essential that the limited resources available should be applied in fields where results were likely tomature in time to be of effective use before the end of the war. a minister looking only at the needs of his. own Department was notin a position to judge whether specialised resources available tohim were being used to the best national advantage^It was suggested that, if it were a question of making the best use of resources which were in short supply, it would be preferable to rely on existing organisations, rather than to set up a new body to make this central survey on the lines proposed in paragraph 3 of w.P. (43) 66. The Lord President of the Council, who had a general responsibility for scientific research, should therefore be invited to supervise the central survey proposed in W.P. (43) 66.In the course of further discussion The Lord President of theCouncil explained that, if he were asked to undertake this responsi-bility, he would not seek authority to determinesfinally any conflict of interest which might arise between Departments. If, as a resultof the central survey, he was satisfied that changes should be madein the common interest, he would frame his conclusions in the form,not of binding decisions, but of recommendations to the ministers concerned-though, he must of course reserve his right to bring thematter to the War Cabinet for decision if his recommendations werenot adopted, He would, of course, keep in close touch with theMinister of Production. . .The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the terms of the draft Directive annexed toW.P. (43) 54.(2) Agreed that arrangements should be made for &amp; centralsurvey to be carried out, and invited the Lord Presidentof the Council to undertake the responsibility therefor.Beseasoh andQeSelopmentf25067]
!Eychange ofCT^nincais Unitormstion  -f ((previous reference:W.M. (42) 141st-Conclusions,Minute 3.)2. .TJb.e ,W,ar , Cabinet/iCQnsideredi a Memorandum si-by i^the.Minister of Production (W.P.;(43) 67) on the means of implementing the Agreement for tie interchange of technical information between. the British and Soviet Governments.    ;The Minister of Production, in Iris Memorandum, recommended,;with the agreement of the1 Allied Supplies Executive, that a smalltechnical Mission of high standing headed by Sir Henry Tizardshould go to Moscow. The question submitted for decision by theWar Cabinet was i whether Sir Henry Tizard should be given full discretion as to the best method of eliciting information from theRussians, being required neither to insist on, nor to refrain from,bargaining for the exchange of information.The views of the Chiefs of Staff on this point were set out ina Minute attached to the Minister of Production^ Memorandum.The War Cabinet also had before them a telegram. from admiral Miles, Head of the Military Mission in Moscow, reporting that the American Military Attache&quot; was proposing to ask hisAmbassador to lodge a protest with the Russian government against the withholding of military information/and had suggestedthat we should take a similar course. :y iThe Secretary of State for War said that the Chiefs of staff had recently reviewed the principles which should govern the inter-change of military information between our Military Mission in moscow and the Russian authorities; and they could not tolerate thecontinuance of the present position, in which we communicated agreat deal of information and got nothing in return. In his view,Sir Henry Tizard should be fully informed of the past experienceof our Military Mission; and he should be advised that, if he foundthat a forthcoming attitude on his part was not met with a similar,readiness on the Russian side to impart information, he should makeit clear that he could not give further information withoutdemanding something in return.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that there wouldbe. no advantage in sending Sir Henry Tizard on this Mission to moscow unless he were given full discretion as to the best means ofeliciting information, whether by bargaining or otherwise (it being understood, of course, that certain items of information could notbe disclosed for security reasons). His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador hadalready been instructed to make representations at the highest levelon his return to Moscow regarding the reluctance of the russian military authorities to disclose information to our Military Mission.These representations might have the effect of creating a morefavourable atmosphere for Sir Henry Tizard&apos;s Mission. It mightbe ^advantageous if, in addition, it were made clear through the diplomatic channel that the object of Sir Henry Tizard&apos;s Missionwould be to receive, as well as to impart, information. There was much to be said for making this point clear before Sir Henry arrived in Moscow. .The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal in W.P. (43) 67 for the despatch to moscow of a technical Mission headed by Sir HenryTizard.(2) Agreed that, as proposed in W.P. (43) 67, Sir Henry Tizard-should be given full discretion as to the best means ofeliciting information from the Russians, and should berequired neither to insist on, nor to refrain from,,:     bargaining for the exchange of information.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toconsider the suggestion at &quot;A &quot; above.
119W.M. 32 (43).- : ; 3. On the 20th January the War Cabinet had invited theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister of Production to give further consideration to the labour requirements of the airfieldconstruction programme in the light of the new programme of aircraft production in this country.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (43) 68) recording the result of had discussions with the Secretary of State for Air and recommending that the Air Ministry building labour force should remain at thefigure of 115,000 until the end of March (instead of the figure of90,000 previously proposed). No counter-balancing reduction coul(clbe made in the remainder of the Government building programnitebut the Minister of Labour and National Service had agreed that the resulting deficiency could be made good temporarily. For the period after March, the Minister of Production was not yet in a positionto submit definite proposals, but it was clear that the full AirMinistry requirements, together with the needs of the rest of theGovernment programme, could not be met. The Secretary of Statefor Air&apos;s requirements covered the construction of 8 new airfieldsover and above the 106 airfields which were already under construc-tion. In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 17th December (W.M. (42) &apos;170th Conclusions,Minute 1), this proposal was being submitted to the Minister ofDefence.. In the course of discussion, The Secretary of State for Warsaid that on the basis of the figures given at the CasablancaConference for the movement of United States troops to thiscountry, the War Office would require an additional 80,000 ofbuilding labour to construct personnel accommodation for UnitedStates troops, and another 20,000 to construct additional storage and hospitals. He was not at this moment asking for an additionalallocation of labour clearly a demand on the scale he had indicatedcould not be met. So far as personnel was concerned, the situation would have to be met by putting troops under canvas and by muchcloser billeting. But he thought it only right to give a warning that, at any rate so far as storage and hospital accommodation was concerned, he might have to put forward an additional demand ata later date.The War Cabinet-(1) Accepted the recommendation that the Air Ministrybuilding labour force should remain at the figure of115,000 until the 31st March, 1943, and took note thatthe deficiency of 22,600 until that date could be temporarily made good without affecting the intake intothe forces:(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for Air wassubmitting his proposals in regard to the eight proposed new airfields to the Minister of Defence.(3) Invited the Minister of Production to undertake a review&quot; of all Departmental building programmes for the period after the 31st March, 1943, and to submit his recom-mendations to the War Cabinet.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Ministerof War Transport (W.P. (43) 63) setting out a number of demandstor tne delivery of cereals within the next few months which hadbeen.made by countries in the Indian Ocean area. It would bepossible to switch sixteen ships during February and March towards meeting these demands. This would represent a loss to the UnitedKingdom Import Programme of about 70,000 tons and would still leave a deficiency of four ships on the Indian Ocean requirements as recommended by the Shipping Committee.The Minister of War Transport gave further details in regardto some of the demands set out in his Paper.
The following were the main rpoihts made in discussion&apos;  i;(1) India.-The position had eased considerably. Tlie fia^yesjt&quot;prospects in India were now much md^f&amp;yoaii^to/W^kwhen the Indian demand had first been put fbjWard.The Minister of War Transport suggested tha(t: it mightbe possible to relieve some of the more pressing iieed^dfOther countries by the release of some of the ships alreadyallotted to India.(2) Kenya. The demand for cereals for Kenya was of great urgency and there was general agreement that a diversion of one or two cargoes from India would bejustified.The Secretary of State for India undertook to sendan immediate telegram to the Viceroy, asking his assent to this diversion which was regarded as urgently necessary.(3) Southern Rhodesia. The Minister of War Transportthought that this demand was not of great urgency.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat a further telegram had just been received from southern Rhodesia.   :It was agreed that Southern Rhodesia&apos;s request should be further considered by the Shipping committee before a final decision was reached.(4) Ceylon.-The Minister of War Transport thought it wouldbe possible to, provide a considerable quantity of ricefrom Egypt for Ceylon. He hoped that India would alsobe able to give help.(5) Turkey.-The Minister of War Transport explained thatwhile 50,000 tons of cereals were being found for Turkeyfrom the Middle East area, it would be a very serious. matter if an additional 100,000 tons for Turkey had tobe sent to the Middle East from Australia.The degree of urgency attaching to this request was difficult to assess. Similar demands had been made in earlier years, and not met.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthis demand must be considered against the background of the growing strategic importance of Turkey.Moreover, he was somewhat disturbed at the extent to. which the Turkish import programme in such essential commodities as sulphur and lubricating oil had been cut.The War Cabinet agreed that the Turkish position should be examined by the Allied Supplies Executive.(6) Persia-It was explained that the Persian demand for wheat was due to the purchase of grain by the russian military Authorities, which had created a shortage ofsupplies for the civilian population. This made itnecessary for 20,000 tons to be shipped from^^Tdr^hAmerica, and it was clear that this could only be shippedin Russian-aid ships. This had been explained&apos; ffo&quot; M. Maisky by the Secretary of state  for Foreign Affairslast November. Apart \from the fact that Other ships were not available, congestion in the -Persian ports andover the Persian railways made it out of the question tosend additional ships to Persia.the Minister of War Transportsaid that he had-  1 been in consultation with Mr.Warriman, who had askedfor an expression of our views.      tVi;: -,:,\
121WiM. 32 (43).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked for time to consider this matter.*(7) General-The Minister of Food.said that with the present level of imports we could not afford to allow any furtherdiversions from the United Kingdom Import Pro-gramme!.The Minister of War Transport said that there were three ships now in Australia which were ready to sail. in.the next week, and would sail to the United Kingdomunless diverted to meet urgent needs in the Indian Oceanarea. &apos; &apos; -* The War Cabinet took the view that these ships should.sail to the United Kingdom.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows :-(1) Diversions of shipping from the United Kingdom import programme to meet the Indian Ocean needs must bereduced to what was absolutely necessary to meet themost urgent cases.(2) Subject to the consent of the Secretary of State for Indiaand Secretary of State for Burma (who undertook to telegraph at once to the Viceroy), the urgent needs of kenya should be met by the diversion of not more than two ships already allocated to sail to India.(3) Southern Rhodesia&apos;s request would not be decided without-further consideration by the Shipping Committee.(4) The question whether Turkey should be furnished with anycereals, in excess of the 50,000 tons already available inthe Middle East, together with the question of imports to Turkey generally, was referred&apos;for consideration bythe Allied Supplies Executive. *-(5) The three ships now in Australia, due to sail to the UnitedKingdom in the immediate future unless diverted toother needs, should be ordered to sail to this country.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,February 18, 1943.* Note. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs subsequently assentedto the course proposed and agreed that the Minister of War Transport should speak to Mr. Harriman in this sense.
