The first raid on Berlin on Saturday,the 16th January, had. been very successful. 146 aircraft. had attacked their primary target and% only, one bomber had.been lost,The second raid on the: next night had not been so successful owingto weather conditions. Of: 187 aircraft despatched, 98 so,far hadclaimed to have attacked their primary targets. Reports from other aircraft had not yet been received. Twenty-two aircraft had notreturned. These losses-were mainly due to enemy night-fighters, forwhich the weather had been favourable. V *&apos;. About 60 enemy aircraft had attacked South-East England and london on the previous night. Eight had been destroyed by ournight-fighters and 3 by A. A. fire. One night-fighter pilot had shot-down 4 aircraft.Coastal Command had probably damaged 3 U-boats and hadhit 4 merchant ships, 3 of which had probably been sunk.United States Army Air Forces had attacked the steel works at Lille.Enemy losses during the week had&quot; been 11 fighters and11 bombers. Our losses had been 12 fighters, 35 bombers and5 Coastal Command aircraft.Our air activity had been directed against ports and transport-tation in Weather which had been generally unfavourable.r Heavy bombers had continued their attacks on Tunis, Tripoliand Naples.Allied claims had been 25 enemy aircraft destroyed against damaged of our own. There had been /indications of deterioration-tion in the 8kin of Japanese pilots and older types of aircraft were now being used by them.. Shipping losses for the previous week amounted to 107,000 tons.This figure included belated reports of 84,500 tons.Three U-boats, 2 German and 1 Italian, had been sunk.In the Mediterranean our submarines had sunk some 5 enemy merchant ships varying between 1,300 and 6,000 tons.The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff undertook to furnish details ofthe present rate of enemy shipbuilding.The lull in Tunisia continued and was due to bad weather.The War Cabinet were given the latest information regardingthe recent advance by the Eighth Army, It was likely that Field-Marshal Rommel would now fall back to the next natural line ofdefence, about 50 miles to the north.The Russians had opened a new offensive south of Voronezhand had captured a considerable stretch of the Voronezh-RostovRailway. This, if cleared, Would be of considerable strategic value to the Russians. In other sectors the Russians had continued tomake successful progress during the week. The position of the sixth German Army at Stalingrad must now be regarded ashopeless.Our forces were now within 15 miles of Akyab.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
Air Raida.

Casualties and Damage. (Previous Reference W.M. (42) 142nd Conclusions, Minute 2.)

2. The Home secretary and Minister of Home Security said that the weight of the enemy attack on the night of the 17th/18th January had ben directed against London. There had been some fires at industrial premises, but the damage in the main had been to residential property. The latest estimates of casualties were 54 killed and 174 seriously injured.

A noticeable feature of this raid had been the large number of casualties due to the explosion of A.A. shell on percussion. About 50 of the incidents reported had resulted from this; and, of the fatal casualties, at least 10 were due to explosion of A.A. shells. The number of A.A. rounds fired during the raid hed been exceptionally large.

The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

Social Services.

The Beveridge Report. Previous reference w.m. (48) 8th Conclusions Minute 3.)

3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to statements published in Reynolds newspaper the previous day to the effect that the Treasury had reported adversely on the financial implications of the proposals made in the Beveridge Report and that the matter was shortly to be considered by the Lord President&apos;s Committee. Though these statements did not accurately refect the attitude of the Treasury in this matter, their publicatin at this moment suggested that the newspaper might by some means have obtained access to confidential information. It was particularly important that every possible care should be taken to prevent any premature disclosure of the discussions now proceeding on the proposals put forward in the Beveridge Report.

The War Cabinet-

Endorsed the view expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Prisoners of War.

(Previous Reference W.M. (43) 1st Conclusions Minute 6)



4. The Secretary of State for War drew attention to a Parliamentary Question by Sir Alfred Knox, M.P., for answer the following day, asking what response had been made by the German Government to our decision to free all German prisoners from schackles, and wheter British prisoners in Germany were now subject to reprisals by shackling, by a ban on correspondence, or by the withholding of parcels.

The War Cabinet-

Agreed that this Question could best be dealt with by saying that we were not at present in a position to make any statement as regards shackling, but that it was understood that the restrictions on prisoners&apos; correspondence had now been removed.
