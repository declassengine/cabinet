2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord President of the Council (W.P. (43) 108) regarding theproposed amendment of Defence Regulation 54CA, which empowerscompetent authorities (mainly Supply Departments) to appointGovernment directors to, companies engaged in war production.The War Cabinet were informed that this; power was requiredto meet certain cases in&quot;t^:-aircTaifc--ihdtis;tfy&apos;?where the board of directors needed strengthening, but it was not considered necessaryto put in a controller Under the ihofe drastic powers alreadyconferred by Defence Regulation 55 (4).It was explained that a Regulation giving these powers hadalready been made on the 10th February last. What was nowproposed was to substitute for this an amended Ijegtilation Whichat certain points would meet some of the criticisms made againstthe original Regulation. The Ministers primarily concerned were satisfied that the proposed new Regulation would.be easier todefend against criticism. It was perhaps unfortunate that thisparticular Regulation should have to be debated at a time when there was general uneasiness in the House of Commons about thewhole practice of legislation by Regulation; and the risk of contro-versy being aroused could not be ignored. But in principle thereshould.be no difficulty in substantiating the claim that the Govern-ment should have a right to be represented on the board of a company in which it has substantial financial interests.Furthermore, it would be. most inexpedient that, a Regulationhaving already been made giving powers to appoint Governmentdirectors to companies engaged on war production, the scheme should not be proceeded with.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the existing Regulation 54CA should be revoked and replaced by the hew draft set but inAppendix ll of W.P. (43) 108. This should, if possible,be done before the Motion for the annulment of theexisting Regulation Was debated in the House of Commons.WasProduction.Power toappointGovernmentDirectors tocertainundertakings.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.March 16, 1943.
