Trie Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.Bomber Command had attacked^Wilhetmshaveh (twice), Lorientand Bremen.   Enemy losses had been 24 dest^^destroyed and 15 damaged.   Our losses had been 11 fighters,&apos;28 -bohibers, .3/Coastal Command aircraft and 4 Army Co-operationCoinmahd aircraft. vIn the Mediterranean our aircraft had attacked 5 U-boats andhit 5 merchant ships. *.Shipping losses for the previous week amounted to 18,000 tons.This figure did not include losses in the two outgoing atlantic convoys, which were now being attacked.&apos; A Spanish ship of some 6,000 tons, having.on board a cargo ofplatinum and 2 stowaways from the Graf Spee, had been intercepted,and a prize crew put on board.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to make enquiries regarding difficulties raised by the Russians to the installation by us at Murmansk of certain wireless apparatus which,we regarded &quot;as of vital importance to our convoys to Russia.The Germans had delivered a successful attack againstAmerican forces the previous week in Central Tunisia. !       ; jThe 8th Army had advanced some 70 miles since the previousweek and was now in touch with the Mareth Line. Tripoli Harbourwas now capable of handling some 4,000 tons a day.Fighting had taken place south Of Leningrad and in the LakeIlmen district. The Russians were pushing strongly in the Orelsector. Further south they were making a thrust towardsDnepropetrovsk. East of this there had been heavy fighting atKrasnoarmeisk. The Germans were now evacuating troops from theTaman peninsula by air, by sea and across the Kerch Straits; Therecent thaw had hampered Russian activities, but, according tothe latest reports, the weather was hardening again.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Prisoners of \War.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 26thConclusions,Minute 8;), The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that areport had been received from Geneva that a member of the Inter-national Red Cross Organisation had been informed that in some ofthe German camps shackling was becoming merely symbolical Hewas endeavouring to obtain confirmation of this report. Meanwhile,it was still not possible to make any announcement as to the positionm Parliament. -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also undertook to enquire into the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Governments,communication to the German Government, as finally delivered bythe Protecting Power, had differed in any point of substance fromthe text approved by the War Cabinet on the 8th February.3. The War Cabinet had before them a. Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W- P. (43) 73) regarding asghehie forsegregatingIta.lian prisoners of war opposed to the fascist regime and forming them into special Labour Battalionsunder their own leaders. This seheme had already been introduced in India, Should it be extended to Italian prisoners in GreatBritain and British East Africa ? ,It was explained that, if LaboUr Battalions were formed, the-prisohers Would first be liberated and enlisted as volunteers undermilitary law.   This would ayoiCdhvehtibhi   Moreoyer, such Latcontravention of the Genevar Battalions could be. quickly[25084]

Indeed, such acourse^htSuaU^^coSy! Uken^as alwhole, by introducing a cause ot controversy intothe camps.The War Cabinet- -(1) Confirmed the approval already given by the. Secretary otState for Foreign Affairs for the introduction of this&apos;      scheme in India. /     . n\       ,(o\ Aereed  that,   subject   to   consultation  with   General&apos; &apos;   8Sir William Platt, the scheme might, be extended, on an experimental basis to Italian prisoners in British h,astAfrica, but not to Italian prisoners m other territories.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that onthe 11th January the War Cabinet had agreed that an approach should be made to the United States Government on the basis thatthe refugee problem as a whole should be regarded as a united nations responsibility, in respect of which each nation should agreeto make a definite contribution (W.M. (43) 6th Conclusions,Minute 4). These representations had so far elicited no response,and it was becoming difficult to hold the Parliamentary position on.the basis that we were engaged in international negotiations when in fact the United States Government had shown no readiness todiscuss the matter. Should we continue to maintain that theproblem, should be dealt with as a United-Nations responsibility, or should we consider making some independent contribution ?The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that,while it would be possible to admit between 1,000 and 2,000additional refugees into this country, he would not favour this being done except as part of a United Nations scheme. Those who were pressing for further concessions did. not, in his view, sufficientlyrealise the extent of the contribution already made by the BritishCommonwealth of Nations and the practical difficulties of trans-ferring and maintaining any considerable proportion of those who might wish to escape from enemy-occupied territories.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that for the present we should maintain our attitude that this problem was one which should be dealt with ona United Nations basis, and that we&apos;should not hold out any hope of; receiving additional refugees in this countryexcept as part of a United Nations agreement.; (2) Invited the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs tocontinue to press for a reply to the enquiries alreadyaddressed to the United States Government in thismatter. J-(3) Decided that a statement should be made, in answer to a parliamentary Question, showing the extent to Whichrefugees, had already been adinitted to British territoryover a convenient period (possibly since the beginning ofthe War); and invited the Secretary Of&apos;State for ForeignAffairs to submit for consideration by the..War&apos;-Cabinet,the draft Of a Qhestion and answer on this point.Reception andAccommodationof refugees from Enemy-occupied territory.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for War said that he had to answera question in Parliament on the following day as to whether thepamphlet dealing with the Beveridge Report, prepared by the ArmyBureau of Current Affairs, would now be circulated.In discussion, it was pointed out that one reason which had beengiven for the previous withdrawal of the pamphlet had been thatit was inappropriate that the Beveridge Report should be discussed-at debates neld under the aegis of A.B.C.A. before it had beendebated in Parliament, and the impression had been given that theissue of the pamphlet had been postponed rather than cancelled.In the circumstances, the War Cabinet took the view that theSecretary of State for War should reply on the following lines : thathe was considering the possibility of producing a more comprehensive-sive brief than the earlier version, in a form suitable as a basis forA.B.C.A. discussions.The Secretary of State for War would, no doubt, also consult the Ministers concerned before authorising the issue of the revisedbrief, which would be limited to a summary of Sir william beveridge&apos;s proposals, and the Governments decisions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,February 22, 1943.
