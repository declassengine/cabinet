The Lord Privy Seal said that, in connection with the motion being discussed in Secret Session in the House Of Lords that afternoon on the U-boat campaign, a suggestion was likely to bemade that a precis should be published of the discussion,eliminating any material which would be of assistance to theenemy. A letter on this subject from Lord Cecil of Chelwood hadappeared1 in The Times that morning.The War cabinet agreed that it would be out of the question to publish abowdlerised summary of what happened in Secret Session.The Lord Privy Seal could, of course, indicate that theGovernment would continue to consider how much infor-mation on this subject could be published consistently withthe public interest on suitable occasions.The Lord Privy Seal referred to the decision reached by theWar Cabinet on the 25th January that the Debate on Lord Winster&apos;motion in regard to the equipment of the Fleet Air Arm should takeplace in Secret Session.Lord Winster had now withdrawn his Motion, but LordBeaverbrook had put down a Motion &quot; To call attention to the workof the Ministry of Aircraft Production, and to move for Papers.&quot;The Lord Privy Seal thought that the reasons which had made it desirable that the Debate on Lord Winster&apos;s Motion should takeplace in secret also applied to Lord Beaverbrook!s Motion.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view.ices of the War Cabinet, S.W.February-4, 1943.
