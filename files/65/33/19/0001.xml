This now seemed unlikely.   Moreover, preparation ofa Paper on German breaches of the rules of warfare as a whole wouldraise a number of controversial and delicate issues.   In thecircumstances, he thought that action could now be suspended onI the War Cabinet Conclusion, directing that a Paper about Germanbreaches of the rules of warfare should be prepared and held ready fl^HH for publication. II The War Cabinet- IAgreed to this course.Parliament; 3.   The Hamle Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidSuggestion that that a request had been received from Lord Salisbury thatthe Inspector-    Wing-Commander Hodsoll should address a meeting of Members ofGeneral, both Houses on his experiences in North Africa.   A Report fromAir Raid Wing-Commander Hodsoll on Civil Defence and Passive AirPrecautions,      Defence in North Africa had been circulated to the War Cabinet j^^fshould address a (W.P. (42) 6lS);Meeting of It was pointed, out that if this request was granted it wouldPeers and be very difficult for Wing-Commander Hodsoll to avoid being drawnm.Ps. m[ into dealing with controversial issues of policy which should behandled by Ministers. Moreover, he had gone out to advise General.Eisenhower; and there were objections to an officer who had acted j^^Has adviser to a United States General addressing a meeting of Peersand Members of Parliament on the position in North Africa.I I 1 The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeSecurity should inform Lord Salisbury that as Wing-Commander Hodsdll was Adviser to the United StatesCbmmander-in-Chief, it would not be appropriate for himtb address the proposed meeting. &apos;*&quot;&gt;&apos;The Falkland 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum^^K^Mfct        Islands. by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affair^ (W.P. (43) 41) aboutArgentine the South Orkneys and the South Shetland Islands. These wereEncroachments among the Antarctic Dependencies of the Falkland Islands, and weagainst held a title by discovery although we had never been in effectiveAntarctic occupation of them.     The Argentine Government included theseDependencies, islands in their general Antarctic claims and had recently takenVarious steps calculated to support this claim. Further, anArgentine naval transport was expected to leave shortly for theislands and relieve the Argentine ratings at the wireless stationmaintained on Laurie Island. Chilean naval officers were takingH part in the trip. HI [24972-1] b 2 I
I IThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that an armed Hmerchant cruiser was being sent on a tour of these islands, and it Hwas proposed that certain other steps should be taken to strengthen Hour title to them. If importance was attached to these islands, the IHpresent was a good time to reaffirm our Sovereignty. But he felt Hbound to warn the War Cabinet that the Argentine Government Hwould almost certainly react to the steps proposed. There was alsothe possibility that they might try to bring the question up to a HPan-American Conference and that the United States might offermediation.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that legally the IIslands belonged to us and that he was strongly in favour of the      y v&apos;Bp ^|action proposed. After the war there might be attacks on theBritish Colonial Empire. We should greatly weaken our positionif we allowed ourselves to give up territories, such as those nowin question, through indifference. He could not believe that theArgentine would react very strongly.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that if the route roundCape Horn became more important these islands would be of valueto us. Further, they were a potential base for raiders. In theAdmiralty view if we intended to prevent acts of sovereignty by theArgentine Government, the present was a suitable time for action.The territories concerned were in an area for the defence of whichwe and not the United States were responsible.The Deputy Prime Minister said that there could of course beno question of taking any action which might lead to the surrenderof British interests in these islands unless the Dominions Govern-. ments were first consulted.Mr. Bruce favoured action on the lines proposed. If we failedto, take action now, it might encourage the Argentine Government torenew their claims to the Falkland Islands.The War Cabinet-(a) Agreed that action should proceed on the lines set out inparagraph 4 of W.P. (43) 41;(b) Agreed that the Admiralty should inform the United StatesNaval Authorities (as a matter of naval routine) that oneof our armed merchant cruisers was paying a visit tothese dependencies.Shipping Losses. 5, The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that he had evidence(Previous that the campaign in a section of the Press stressing the severityEeferences: of our shipping losses was having a very bad effect on public opinion,W.M. (43) 18th and, in particular, was detrimental to the morale of the MerchantConclusions,      Navy. &apos;^Jjfa ^J k      s|f|f T^&apos;&apos;^Minute 4; and It was also pointed out that the campaign now being carried onW.M. (42) 101st in the Press to stimulate economy in food had tended to stress  &quot; x.&quot;Conclusions,      shipping losses.   There was also some criticism of the fact thatMinute 3.)       pertain figures had been made known in North America which had ,rd fet^^Hbeen kept secret in this country. V ^^^1The War Cabinet-Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty-(a) To consult with the Minister of Information and tb&apos;ask the latter to take appropriate action to bringabout an improved tone in the Press, and(6.) To consult with the Minister of Food regarding thepoint referred to at &quot;X.&quot;. ,
I H71 W.M. 19 (43).|f  Reference was also made to the decision reached at the previousMeeting of the War Cabinet, that the Debate in the House of Lordsin the following week should be held in secret. Consideration wasgiven to the question whether, seeing that the impression given in thePress exaggerated the seriousness of the position, there might beadvantage in holding the Debate in public.I The War Cabinet-Decided that the balance of advantage lay in the Debatebeing held in secret, as previously arranged.^HPf Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
