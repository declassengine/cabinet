n *\ The War Cabinet considered various questions about theaireed^communique in regard to this Conference, which was to behv rZJS w nfGl ?Wm? iay&apos; ^getter with the Joint declaration by (xeneral de Gaulle and General Giraud.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the text of these two documents should be read to both Houses of Parliament in Secret Session that afternoon  and also communicated by telegram to theDominion Prime Ministers.Catering Wages 2. The War Cabinet were informed that, at! the meeting ofBIH. the Legislation Committee on the 19th January,* the Minister of(Previous Labour and National Service had accepted a suggestion, made on reference: behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that Clause 4 (1) of thew.M.(42)i50th Catering Wages Bill should be so amended as to make it clear that conclusions, the Catering Wages Commission would make such enquiries as theyMinute 3.) considered necessary before recommending to the Minister theappointment of a Wages Board.It was pointed out that the Trade Boards Acts on which theprocedure of the present Bill was modelled included provisions forthe holding of a public enquiry. The First Schedule to the trade boards Act, 1918, provided that, where the Minister did not amendor withdraw a draft Order to which objection had been made inthe prescribed form, he should, before making the Order, unless he considered that the objection was of a frivolous character, direct apublic enquiry to be held. It was suggested that, as the Minister ofLabour proposed to claim that the Bill was modelled on trade boards legislation, he would be in a stronger position to resistcriticism if the procedure under Clause 4 were more closelyassimilated to that of the Trade Boards Act by including a similar provision for the holding of a public enquiry.It was suggested that such public enquiries would involve sub-stantial delay, and that the work of the Catering Wages Commission-would be impeded if those who were opposed to the regulation ofwages and conditions in these trades were at liberty to demand apublic enquiry on every occasion. This point could be met byleaving to the Minister a discretion to decide whether the Commis-sion should be directed to hold a public enquiry in any particular case. Political pressure for a public enquiry would be best dealtwith by the Minister, whose decision, if it were challenged on political grounds, could be defended in Parliament. On the otherhand, it was pointed out that the decision whether or not a public enquiry should be held would not turn always on political issues;and there would be advantages in leaving this decision with theCommission, since there were good reasons for emphasising theCommission^ independence of the Minister. The middle course might be to provide that the Commission might, and if so directed by the Minister should, hold a public enquiry.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toconsider, in the light of the discussion, whether the pro-cedure under Clause 4 of the Bill could not be assimilatedmore closely to that prescribed in the First Schedule to theTrade Boards Act, 1918, by adding some provision tosecure in suitable cases the holding of a public enquiry bythe Commission before making a Wages Board recommen-dation..,  Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,January 26, 1943.* H.P.C.
