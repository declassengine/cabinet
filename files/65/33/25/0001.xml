JtndlSff   - i.   The   War  Cabinet  had   before \\ :&apos;th&apos;em0^ii   followingDetention of    documents:- ,Mr. Gaiidhi. ^Memoranda by the Secretary of State for India (W.P. (43)(Previous 52 and 57). &quot; &apos; &apos;Heference: Telegrams from the Viceroy to the Secretary,of State fdrWffL4$Wttii      India, Nos. 302 S, 304 S, 316 S,,332 S, 333 S,-335 S.Minute 2)&apos; The Secretary of State for India said that the-telegrams aopbefore the WarCabinet showed that the Viceroy&apos;s Cotociiwjpr^Of;the opinion that the&quot;right course was that Gandhi should !berefeasedon starting his &quot; fast to capacity &quot;for a period of 21 days, on thei understanding that on ,its completion he would return to detention.Telegram No. 335 S containedi the text Of a statement which it was proposed should be issued in India as soon as Gandhi began his fast.In telegram No. 333 S the Viceroy said that he would gladly have seen Gandhi.handled more firmly, but that he was sure that it wassounder to be able to face matters with his Council solidly,behind him.[ The Secretary of State for India said that the Viceroy clearlyfelt that he had achieved a good deal in getting the Council to agreeunanimously on the course of action proposed. He thought that it; was impracticable for the issues involved to be handled from this&apos;end, and that the War Cabinet should support the Viceroy in theline of action which he.proposed. He added that he thought that,if the War Cabinet did not now approve of action being taken on. the lines proposed, the Viceroy might well be faced with the resigna-ti,on of most of his Council.V In discussion, various criticisms were ra&apos;ised of the line of&apos;* &quot;   action proposed by the Viceroy and his Council: (1) The War Cabinet had agreed, with some reluctance, to thei view that, if Gandhi fasted, he should be let put of, detention as soon as the doctors advised that this mustbe done in order to prevent his dying in detention. Butthe War Cabinet had never agreed to the present proposal, which Was that Gandhi should be let out of detention, on a threat to fast. .1 (2) The present proposal seemed to involve an undertaking byGandhi to return to detention after his fast was over.Strong objection Was seen to any arrangement or under-standing being arrived at with Gandhi.(3) Furthermore, the proposal was open to practical, objections.What would happen if Gandhi, after his release, at oncestopped his fast: was he to be redetained at once ?&quot; Moreover, if Gandhi refused to give the undertakingreferred to, and started his. fast in detention, was theVieeroy&apos;s Council then prepared to let him fast to deathin detention?(4) Again, there were risks that Gandhi, if released fromdetention, would re-establish contacts, and that thiswould lead to a revival of agitation in India. (See, forexample, the points raised by Sir Maurice Hallett and summarised in telegram No. 316. S from the Viceroy tothe Secretary of State.)       ,(5) It was also pointed put that the new proposal involved what might be described .as &quot;cat-and-mouse&quot; procedure,&apos; i.e., it was proposed that Gandhi should be let Out for aperiod and later put back into detention again withoutfresh cause. The Cabinet saw. strong objections to this.Hitherto the utmost they had contemplated had beenthat Gandhi, if released on grounds of health, might beredetained if he gave fresh cause for such action.(6). Strong objection was taken to the terms of the draft announcement (telegram No. 335 S). This draft-seemed&quot;toi contain an admission that the Government felt boundto yield to Gandhi&apos;s threat to hunger-strike. It wasv;. thought ,that ;it would create an impression of great1 &apos;* weakness.  ! :. &quot; , V .
Fori these reasons the War ^Cabinet were gravely disturbed bythe Viceroy,&apos;s proposals. While; realising that the Viceroy had proceeded a long way on the basis of these proposals, the i t WarCabinet reached the. conclusion that it was essential that he shouldbe informed Of their misgivings and asked for.a further expression of his views before action was authorised. In particular, it shouldbe made clear to the Viceroy that he would have effective support from the War Cabinet if he decided to adhere either to the line ofaction for which the War Cabinet had themselves expressed a preference in previous discussions, or to the line of action on whichthey had previously agreed that the Viceroy should have authority,to proceed, i.e., release only at the point when danger to life was involved;The War Cabinet accordingly- &apos;(1) Gave directions for the immediate despatch to the Viceroy\ of a telegram informing him that the War Cabinet didnot feel able to approve action on the lines proposedwithout further consideration,  and asking him to suspend action on these proposals until further notice.(A telegram in this sense Was drafted and despatched during the Meeting as No. 2360 to theViceroy of the 7th February.)(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, the LordChancellor and the Secretary of State for India to draft a telegram to the Viceroy in the light of the discussion.This telegram should be submitted to the Prime Minister,who would authorise its immediate despatch unless any point arose which, in his opinion, called for considera-tion by the War Cabinet.(This telegram was later sent as No. 2361 to theViceroy of the 8th February.)Note.; In the result, action proceeded on the basis of the planfavoured by the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council? without thefurther expression of the Viceroy&apos;s views desired by theWar Cabinet (vide telegrams Nos. 362 S and 356 S fromthe Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India. printed asNos. 28 and 29 in W.P. (43) 62).2. The Prime Minister, who had returned to England that day, made a statement on the Casablanca Conference, on had discussions with the Turks at Adana, and on his visits to Cairo,Tripoli and Algiers. - .A record of the Prime Minister-s statement is contained in the:Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,Februaryr 8,1943.
