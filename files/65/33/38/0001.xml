1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of the

past week.

Bomber Command had had a most satisfactory week, dropping

2.600 tons of bombs. Berlin, Hamburg and Essen had been attacked.

The attack on Essen was considered the best of the war. Mosquitos

had bombed the plant of the important molybdenum mines at

Knaben. Coastal Command had made one promising attack on a

U-boat. Enemy losses for the week had been 14 destroyed, 1 probably

destroyed and 7 damaged. Our losses had been 52 bombers,

3 fighters and 6 Coastal Command aircraft.

United States forces had made good attacks on Rotterdam,

Brest and Lorient.

Enemy losses in Northern and Southern Tunisia had been

50 aircraft destroyed, 34 probably destroyed and 62 damaged. Our

losses had been 28 destroyed and 15 damaged.

Nine enemy merchant ships had been hit during the week.

In the attack on the Japanese convoy during the previous week

off Cape Gloucester some 45 enemy aircraft had been destroyed in

the air. Japanese losses reported in the Pacific area during the

week were 80 destroyed, 25 probably destroyed and 22 damaged, for

the loss of 5 Allied machines.

Shipping losses for the previous week amounted to 116,000 tons..

One ship of a homeward-bound convoy from Russia had been

sunk by a U-boat.

German attacks on Mejez el Bab had been held. Further north,

in the fighting in the Sedjenane area, the Germans had attacked

and suffered heavy casualties, including between 30-40 tanks. The

Germans had made another attack that morning in this sector. In

the Pichon area United States forces were almost back to the

positions which they had held before the German attack.

The Germans had made two attacks on the previous morning

on the western portion of the Eighth Army front. Both attacks

had been&apos; held and stopped and heavy casualties inflicted on the

enemy, including 33 tanks. There had been indications that the

German columns were now retiring.

West of Moscow definite progress had been made by the

Russians. In the Bryansk-Orel salient the Russians had made a

considerable advance, but south of Kharkov they had had to give

ground. The Russians had also made some progress against the

Taman bridgehead.

2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that no

solution had been reached on the difficulties which the Russian

authorities were making about the proposal to send RA.F.

squadrons to North Russia. Facilities had, however, now been

accorded for the operation of the radio equipment which had been

confiscated.

 

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that he had

given M. Massigli a letter, for delivery to General de Gaulle, asking

that his proposed journey to the Middle East should be deferred.

There were no further developments in the situation to report.


The Greeks.

Reference was made to the revolt which had taken place among

Greek troops in Syria.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that these

troubles, which were political in origin, were probably due in part

to the fact that the Greek King and Government were not in the

Middle East. He would shortly be seeing the King of Greece, and

he proposed to urge the King strongly to go out to the Middle East

and to establish the Greek Government there. He thought that our

policy should be one of out-and-out support for the Greek King and

Government, although this might involve our having rather fewer

contacts with some of the patriotic elements inside Greece, which

were apt to be of a rather different political complexion from the

present Greek Government.

3. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security gave

a report of recent enemy air activity against this country. The

chief incident had been the attack against Eastbourne on the

previous day by a small number of aircraft flying at a very low

altitude.

On the night of Wednesday/ Thursday, the 3rd/4th March,

enemy aircraft had made 60 sorties over the home country, of which,

however, only 10 had reached the London area.

The War Cabinet-

Took note of this statement.

Bethnal Green

Incident.

4. The Home Secretary anal Minister of Home Security

referred to the incident in Bethnal Green on the night of

Wednesday / Thursday, the 3rd/4th March, when 180 people had

been crushed to death in the entrance to a shelter. It would seem

that this disaster had not been started by panic, but simply by one

or two people having fallen down the steps and others having fallen

on them in the dark.

The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that

a meeting had been held at Oxford House, and that there was some

pressure for a public enquiry. He favoured an enquiry, but thought

that it should not be held in public.

After a short discussion, the War Cabinet 

Endorsed the proposal made by the Home Secretary and

Minister of Home Security that Mr. Laurence Dunne, the

Metropolitan Magistrate, should be asked to carry out this

enquiry; that the enquiry should be held in private, but

that it should be announced that, subject to security con-

siderations, the conclusions would be published.

The War Cabinet also agreed that, provided the state of

public business permitted, an announcement to this effect

should be made by the Home Secretary and Minister of

Home Security in the House of Commons on Wednesday,

the 10th March.

5. The War Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of

State for Air and the Minister without Portfolio (W.P. (43) 91)

covering the draft of a statement on Air Transport to be made by

the Government spokesman in the forthcoming debate on the Air

Estimates.


151 W.M. 38 (43).

In discussion, the following suggestions were made for amend-

ment of the draft statement: 

(a) References to the conversion of military aircraft for civil

use might provoke embarrassing reactions from persons in the

United States who were critical of the Lease-Lend arrangements.

Paragraph 8 of the draft should therefore be amended by

omitting the word &apos;&apos; new &apos;&apos; in line 2, and by omitting all words after

&quot;war effort.&quot;

Any interjections about the conversion of existing types could

be answered on the following lines : &quot;As the House is aware, the

transport needs of the Services have already obliged us to convert

some of our best British bombers for transport purposes.&quot;

(b) The second and third sentences in paragraph 12 of the draft

should read as follows : &quot;Our exploratory work is, in fact, in hand,

and we are now in preliminary consultation with the Dominions and

India. Consultation with other members of the United Nations

will follow.&quot;

(c) In paragraph 13, for &quot; the principles which seem likely to

govern . . . .&quot; there should be substituted &quot; the principles which

should govern . . . .&quot;

The War Cabinet 

(1) Approved the draft statement appended to W.P. (43) 91,

subject to amendment on the points noted above.

(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to make this state-

ment on behalf of the War Cabinet during the course of

the forthcoming debate on Air Estimates in the House

of Commons.

(3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement in

identical terms in the debate in the House of Lords on

the 11th March.

6. The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the

Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (43) 92) reporting the decision of

the Air Council to establish a Royal Air Force Transport Command,

which would be responsible for the control of R.A.F. transport

squadrons at home, for the organisation and control of strategic air

routes, for all overseas ferrying, and for the reinforcement moves

of squadrons to and between overseas theatres.

7. The War Cabinet were informed that the House of

Commons would meet on the following day for the purpose of

electing a new Speaker. It was hoped that it would be possible to

obtain the Royal Assent during the course of the same day, so that

the House might be in a position to resume normal business on the

10th March. The first duty of the House would then be to pass a

Motion recording their appreciation of the manner in which the late

Speaker had discharged his duties, and expressing their sympathy

with Mrs. FitzRoy and her family. The War Cabinet discussed

and approved the terms of a Motion to be moved on behalf of the

Government by the Leader of the House. .

The War Cabinet 

Took note of these arrangements.
