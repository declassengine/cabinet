The Chief8 of Staff reported the principal events of tho,-pa^.week.yi- &apos;   -Weather conditions during the past week had been twfavoilr-awe ^ By night Band liorient, where300 tons of bombs had been dropped in excellentweather conditions. .On the 20th January, during the daylight attack on London andSouth-East England, enemy losses had been 14 destroyed, 3 probably destroyed and 11 damaged. Our losses had been 2 aircraft (onepilot safe).The United States Air Force ,h^alternative target of Brest, losing 5 aircraft.   The assessment of enemy losses was not yet complete.        \\Air attacks had been against the ports of Bizerta and Tunis.Aircraft-based on Malta had been operating on an increased scaleagainst targets in North Africa and Sicily, as well as shipping. in tripolitania our air attacks had been directed against enemyretreating columns, whilst our heavy bombers continued to attackTripoli and enemy airfields. The enemy had suffered considerablecasualties on the ground from our air attacks on their aerodromes.United States heavy&quot; bombers, in their attacks on Rabaulshipping, claimed to have sunk 8 and damaged 2 merchant ships.Another merchant vessel had been sunk off Caveing.Shipping losses for the previous week, including belatedreports, amounted to 38,049 tons.A/convoy bound for Russia had been unsuccessfully attacked on the previous day by enemy aircraft, 2 of which had been destroyed.M.T.Bs. had sunk an enemy merchant ship and an escortingtrawler off the Hook of Holland, destroyed a wireless station on theNorwegian coast north of Bergen and damaged a pyrites mine andquays south of Bergen.During the previous week our submarines had sunk a numberof enemy merchant vessels. Our submarines had now sunk1,000,000 tons of enemy shipping in the Mediterranean.The War Cabinet-Invited the First Sea Lord to send a message of congratulations-tion from the War Cabinet on this achievement.The First Sea Lord gave information about the enemy merchant-shipping situation.In Northern waters the enemy had a surplus of tanker tonnage,but was unable to make use of it owing to lack of oil. As regards other tonnage, the enemy was short of some 250,000 tons. Few new ships were being built.In the Mediterranean the enemy merchant shipping position had been critical, but now that they had obtained 800,000 tons fromthe French they possessed as many ships as they required. In theFar East the sinking of enemy ships outstripped production by some50,000 tons a month.        -In the Veliki Luki area fighting had died down. On the UpperDon the Russians were making progress, and at Stalingrad theRussians maintained heavy pressure against the German 6th Army.In the Don sector good progress had been made from the north, butstiff German resistance was being met towards Rostov. South-east of Rostov the Russians had crossed the lower Manich River and had captured Salsk. In the Caucasus the Germans were retreatingnorthwards with the Russians hard in pursuit. A report from theRussian General Staff stated that it was expected that the Germans -would make a supreme effort to hold Rostov, and that in the Caucasusmild weather conditions were hampering their advance.The enemy had attacked the French positions in Central Tunisiaduring the previous week and had driven them back some distance.Reinforcements from the Americans and ourselves had, however,almost restoredthe original position.Tripoli1 had been Occupied On the previous Saturday, and our forces were now ih-touCh with the enemy some 20 miles west of theb 2

There were questibrisoU the order paperWarnings.;       about the failure to give an air raid warning before bombs had been(Previous        dropped.   Moreover, there had been a difficulty in the telephone&apos;-Reference:       communications at Fighter Command.W.M,; (43).i2th        The nature of this difficulty was explained by the Secretary of conclusions,State for Air, who said that, even had there been none, the warningMinute 7.)       would have been given at. the same moment as the bombs were-    ,   dropped.  The real point at issue was whether warnings Were to begiven in the London area as sobn as aircraft crossed the coast. ;If;this was done there would be a great increase in the number ofwarnings given in the London area which were not followed by raids,:     with the result that warnings would tend to be ignored.The general view of the two Ministers concerned was^that,broadly speaking, the present policy should be continued, and thatsome risks must continue to be run. The position was, however,being examined by representatives of -the two Departments.the Secretary of State for A %r said that there was also likelyto be some criticism on the ground that the balloons had been close-hauled in the area on which bombs had been dropped&apos;. This had been due to the fact that the calibration of instruments was proceeding.The Secretary of State for Air said that he Was not satisfied that itwas essential for balloons to be down while calibration of instru-ments was being carried out, and he was investigating the matter.The War Cabinet-. Expressed general agreement with the line of policyindicated by the Ministers concerned in their statements.Diplomatic - 8.   At their Meeting on the 3rd December, 1942, the WarSendee. Cabinet had appointed a Committee to consider the terms of theProposals for draft White Paper summarising the proposals for the reform of the reform. Foreign Service.(Previous The War Cabinet now had before them the Report of this reference:       Committee (W.P. (43) 29) with a revised draft of the White Paper.W.M. (42) 164th       In discussion, the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeConclusions,      Security drew attention to the fact that paragraph 13 Of the revisedMinute 4.)       draft still included the statement that in the Foreign Service officersof similar rank would in future receive similar salaries whetheremployed at home or in foreign posts.   The Chancellor of theExchequer, in his Memorandum (W.P. (42) 560), had pointed otitthat this would mean that Assistant Under-Secretaries of State inthe Foreign Office would have their&apos;salaries increased from  1,700to  2,000.  There had been some difference of view on this questionamong members of the Committee, arid it had been agreed that theissue should be determined by the&apos;Chairman of the Committee.  TheHome Secretary, while he did not dissent from the decision reached,felt that the attention of the War Cabinet should be drawn to it,as it might lead to a demand that the salaries of officers of corresponding rank in the Home Service should equally be raised to.    2,000 a year. &apos;:,/ \ &apos; &apos; J/&apos;&apos;&apos;.    &apos;   --The Deputy Prime Minister s&amp;id that, mhe had been influenced by the consideration that the expenditure ofmembers of the Foreign Service while in this country was likely torbe greater by reason of the fact that they.were, liable to be posted

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (43) 25), drawing attentionto the serious shortage of administrative personnel in the colonial service, and recommending that steps should be initiated at once toplace at his disposal, for restoration to civil duty, all members of theColonial Service who had been lent for service with the armed forces,on the understandings (a) that a reasonable time would be allowed for arrangements.      - for replacement to be made; and(6) that special consideration would be given to the case ofofficers who had been assigned to service in occupied, enemy territories or to other duties from which they couldnot be released without difficulty.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that this problemhad been causing anxiety for some time past; and, in spite of the partial relief afforded by ad hoc measures taken in the last fewmonths, there was growing evidence of excessive strain on the civiladministrations in the Colonies. In Africa, for example, some25 per cent, of administrative officers had been released for service with the armed forces; and the Minister Resident in WestAfrica had recently informed him that the administrative machinewas so stretched that it might at any moment break at some important point.The proposals in his Memorandum had been discussed with theService Ministers, and, subject to a minor reservation by theAdmiralty, agreed with them.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty said that theAdmiralty wished to preserve a discretion to retain officers who had come into the Navy from the Colonial Service and were anxious toremain in the Navy. The numbers were small; and if in any of thesecases it were represented, that an officer would be of particular value in the Colonial Service, the Admiralty would be prepared to consider sympathetically an application for his release.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that for the present he was prepared to accept the qualification made on behalf of theAdmiralty. If he found that in practice this reservation was seriously limiting the numbers released from the Navy, he would seek a further ruling from the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals put forward in W.P. (43) 25,subject to the reservation made on behalf of the admiralty in the course of the discussion- ,,,

(43) 6thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the-Bulgarian and Turkish Governments had now concurred in thearrangements for the transfer of 4,000 Jewish children from bulgaria to Palestine; and in the ordinary course he would have proposed that these arrangements should be announced withoutdelay. In present circumstances, however, there would be great advantages in being able to announce some further concession at thesame time; and he had invited the views of the High Commissionerfor Palestine on the suggestion that the whole of the 30,000 placeson the Palestine Immigration Quota should be dealt with on asimilar basis^ i.e., that 80 per cent: of these places should be regardedas available for children who were refugees from enemy-occupied countries, and that the remaining 20 per cent, should be reserved for adults accompanying such children, for doctors, Rabbis and similarspecial cases. The rate at which such immigrants could arrive inPalestine would, of course,, depend on the practical difficulties oftransport, &amp;c.; but we might undertake that refugees within these categories would be received into Palestine as and when facilities fortheir transfer could be arranged.He proposed that announcement of the arrangements for the-transfer/of the 4,000 children from Bulgaria should be deferred until he had received and considered the High Commissioners comments on this suggestion.The War Cabinet-Agreed that announcement of the arrangements made forthe reception of refugee children from Bulgaria should be deferred for a few days pending examination by the;Ministers concerned of the suggestion now put forward bythe Colonial Secretary..Indian Army.&apos;Powers of indian officers over british Service, Pessonnel..(previous reference:W.Mr (42) 110thConclusions,Minute 10.)7.

The War Cabinet were informed that an early decision was required as to the number of ships to be included in the forthcoming(February) cargo shipping programme to the Middle East and India.The question at issue was whether it should comprise 46 ships or40 ships.A full account of the points made in discussion is recorded separately.The War Cabinefs decision was that the War Office should send a most immediate communication to the authorities in the middle east and in India informing them that, owing to the stringency ofthe shipping situation, it was felt that the February shipments mustbe reduced from 46 to 40 ships, and inviting the comments of theauthorities in the Middle East and in India as to the items on whichthis cut should be imposed, together with a short statement as towhat effect the imposition of these further cuts might be expectedto have.The telegram should make it clear that replies must be receivedwithin four days at the outside.10. The War Cabinet were informed that Lord Winster had put down the following Motion for Wednesday, the 27th January: &quot; To ask His Majestv&apos;s Government if it is their policy that the nation should make every possible effort to see that theFleet Air Arm is equipped with the most modern planes we can get for them; and to move for Papers.&apos;&apos;It was believed that in speaking to this Motion reference wouldbe made to a recent public statement by the First Lord, which hadbeen misreported in the Press.It was represented to the War Cabinet that a full and adequateanswer to the points likely to be made by the mover of the Motioncould not be given in public session. At the same time, it was feltthat there would be some difficulty in proposing that the Debate enthis Motion should be held in secret.The Lord Privy Seal also informed the War Cabinet that theLeaders of the Liberal and Labour Parties in the House of LordsShipping.\&apos;.

Copy No,SHIPPINGRefibrietionof shipments to the middle east and India.ST. RESTRICTED circulation;Mw(4S) 16th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 9.25th January, 1945.:. \       I -      i .        . V;THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF gave asummary of how the present position had been reached.Some time back, the Prime Minister had decided thatthe cargo ship programme to the Middle East and india should be reduced by 25$.     This reduction had been effected, and had brought down the number of ships sailingeach month to about 92.At the end of December 1942 the Prime minister had issued a directive calling for a further reduction to between 40 and 50 ships a month.     The Departments con-cerned had taken this as calling for a 50?5 cut, i.e., tosay 46 ships a month.The January programme had been cut to 40 ships amonth, apart from 5 ships which had been delayed from the december convoy.Coming now to the number of ships to be included inthe February programme, the position was that the WarOff ice had called upon the authorities in the Middle east to revise their programme on the basis of 46 ships amonth, and all work had proceeded on this basis.   If thenumber of ships in the programme was now to be reduced from 46 to 40, the authorities in this country were not ina position to say what items should be cut.     It wouldtake some time to get statements from the Middle East andIndia as to what further items should be excluded if theprogramme was to be cut to 40 ships;   and meanwhile load-ing would be delayed.     Moreover, there were importantoperational issues involved.     There was grave risk tbatthe preparations for future operations would be delayedif the February programme was now to be, reduced to 40 shipsi

For this reason the Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staffpressed that the February convoy should comprise Jj.6 ships.If the Departments concerned could not show good reason for maintaining sailings at this level, an appropriate reduction could always he made from the number of ships included in the programmes for later months.THE PAYMASTERS-GENERAL emphasised that if ships were nowdespatched to the Middle East, they could not he made availableto assist the U.K. Import Programme for many months.     Therewas an urgent need for assistance to the U* K. Import programme in the immediately ensuing months if we were to avoid impair-ment of our war effort.     He therefore pressed that the february shipping programme should he reduced to hO ships.     he also suggested that if the Mediterranean was likely to heopened in the Spring, it was uneconomical to send by the longjourney round the Gape, any stores which we could hope to sendthrough the Mediterranean in a few months&apos; time.THE VIGE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that many of the items included in the convoy were urgently requiredfor impending military operations and must he despatched now.If they were not despatched, there was a risk that theoperations in question would he delayed or their effectivenessimpaired.     He also pointed out that, while the War office were acting as the mouthpiece in this matter, other departments were largely interested.     The tonnage in the February programme was made up roughly as followss-Adrairalty        .....* 3%&quot;Air Ministry   ...... 16?civil Requirements ... 31%Army               ...   ... k3%Discussion then turned on the question whether it was essential to start loading at once, or whether there was timeto get an answer from the Middle,East as to the effect of reducing the February ships from kS to UO ships.

SIR CYRIL HURGOMB said that the february convoy could .be loaded by the due date if an answer was received within,^ say, a week. ;The War Cabinet&apos;s decision was that the War office should send a most immediate communication to the authorities$ in the Middle East and in India informing them that, owingto the stringency of the shipping situation, it was felt thatthe February shipments must be reduced from l\6 to UO ships,and inviting the comments of the authorities in the middle east and in India as to the items on which this cut should be imposed, together with a short statement as to what effect theimposition of these further cuts might be expected to have.The telegram should make it clear that replies must bereceived within four days at the outside.(Copy sent to V.C.I.G.S.)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
