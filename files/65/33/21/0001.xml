The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of thepast week.During the-previous week Bomber Command had carried out succesful raids under bad weather conditions oh DuisbUrg and hamburg. Berlin had been raided twice during daylight by a fewMosquitos on the 30th January. Coastal Command had sunk a6,000-ton merchant ship off Norway. Enemy losses had been13 destroyed, 3 probably destroyed and 7 damaged. Our losses hadbeen 9 fighters, 29 bombers and 6 Coastal Command aircraft.On the 27th January United States Army Air Forces had dropped their first bombs on Germany, when they had attackedWilhelmshaven and Emden. The United States Forces claimed tohave destroyed over 22 enemy aircraft for the loss of 3 of their own.Fleet. Air Arm and United States aircraft claimed to have hit13 enemy merchant ships and 2 destroyers. Tunisian ports and airfields had been attacked. In Tunisia the number of Allied sortieshad-been more than double that of the enemy. The Americansclaimed to have destroyed 65 enemy aircraft in the air and 30 on theground. Allied losses amounted to 13 destroyed in the air and 4 onthe ground.Shipping losses for the previous week amounted to 43,000 tons.The total losses for January (292,000 tons) were the lowest for any month.since November 1941. This satisfactory result was, however,partly due to good fortune, and heavier sinkings must be expected,in the future. The whole question of convoys and convoy escorts hadbeen examined at the Casablanca Conference.A convoy of 14 ships had arrived safely at North Russian ports on the 27th January.It was considered that the supersession of Admiral Raeder by admiral Doenitz as Commander-in-Chief of the German navy would result in increased activity by German surface ships.Attacks on enemy convoys to Tunisia had resulted in the sinking of 4 merchant ships, 6 schooners and other small craft.So far, there had been contingency confirmation from American sources of the Japanese claim to have sunk 2 American battleships and tohave damaged some cruisers in the area south of Guadalcanal.The Russians were endeavouring to w^iden the corridor toLeningrad. In the Upper Don sector there had been no indication of the line which the Germans proposed to take up after beingdriven out of their bridgehead at Voronezh. At Stalingrad the remnants of the German Sixth Army had been split into two small groups. The, group under Field-Marshal Paulus had surrendered.While there seemed to be some doubt as to the total number of troops which the Germans had lost (in killed and prisoners), there was nodoubt that the Russians had gained a very remarkable victory.In the Don sector no further: progress had been made towardsRostov. The Germans were counter-attacking strongly. South-east of Rostov the Russians had advanced some 45 miles. In theNorthern Caucasus the German retreat continued and Tikhoretskjunction ihad/been captured. The Russians had also advanced to within 40 miles of Krasnodar. Maikop had been retaken.. In the sector south of Krasnodar theRussian pressure continued and some progress had been made, northwards. Both west of Voronezh andin Caucasia- it had been a satisfactory week.   But the Russian
th&amp;b&amp;ckotiTunisia-Libya.not^et been brokeft &apos; -In Tunisia the United States forces had; joined the French andpushed the German^ back from Ousseltia. On the p^eyious Saturdaya German column of between60-70 tanks had attacked in the FaidGap. fighting cont^ /, Since the capt^owing to obstructions by the enemy and to had gping. Zuara hadbeen taken oh the previous day.   Ronunel&apos;s main forces had nowcompleted their withdrawal to the Mareth position.The War Cabinet--        Took note of these statements.Beyeridge &apos;Report.(Previous&quot;Reference: -W.M. (48) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.)3.   The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the forthrcoming Debate on the Beveridge Report. The first point discussed).was whether the Debate should take place On a Motion put forward by the Government, or from some other quarter of the House. This,point was linked with the line to he taken by the government spokesman in the Debate.   The original, plan for the Debate hadbeen that Members of the House should have an ppportuhity of expressing their views before any statement was made on behalf ofthe Government; but it was generally felt that some statement wouldbe called for from the Government during the Debate, indicating,;broadly their general attitude towards the&apos;main proposals in the;Eeport.The Lord President said that there was a reasonable prospect that the Reconstruction Priorities Committee would be in a positionto formulate, for discussion by the War Cabinet early in thefollowing week, some general recommendations on the main -proposals in the Report. In these circumstances, it was generally felt that it would be undesirable to announce definite plans for the debate for, say, a week&apos;s time.The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows: (1) It would be desirable, if possible, to adhere to the-plan of holding this Debate in the series of Sittings beginningthe 16th February. If questioned on this point during !the present week, the Leader of the House could only saythat the date for the Debate had riot yet been finally fixed.&apos;.It was, however, important that the date should be finallyannounced early in the following week.(2) Early in the following week the War Cabinet should be ina position to decide whether it would be possible to make,a statement in the near future which, without entering into any details, would indicate broadly the Govern-menfs attitude towards the main proposals in the,Report;, and it could be decided at that stage whether J.the Debate should be taken on a Government Motion,and, if So, what form that Motion should take.  .Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
