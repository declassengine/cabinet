War Cabinet Concisions. woRestrictions in coastal Areas.(Previous .Reference:W.M. (43) 34thConclusions,Minute 1.). 4. At their meeting oh the 23rd February the War cabinet decided that the suspension of the restrictions oh entry into the isle of Wight and the coastal area from King&apos;s Lynn to Littlehamptonshould be continued until the 1st April, and had invited the WarOffice to formulate hew proposals^ for restrictions designed tosafeguard our preparations for offensive operations.The Secretary of State for War had circulated a Memorandum(W.P. (43) 112) proposing that a large part of-the coastline shouldbe declared, under Defence Regulation 13a, to be a Regulated Area,&quot;within which the military authorities would have power to imposelocal restrictions; and that, in addition, there should be restric-tions on the admission of visitors to the whole of the coastal area from Hull to Land&apos;s End.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security had also circulated a Memorandum(W.P. (43) ll6) in which, while accepting the first of theseproposals, he had summarised the arguments against the proposalfor a visitors&apos; ban. \The War Cabinet were informed that, by the Prime Ministersdirection, the issues raised by these two Memoranda had beenconsidered by the Lord Presidents Committee.*The Lord President of the Council explained that agreement. had been reached on the basis that (except in the Isle of Wight) thevisitors&apos; ban would not be reimposed in the areas where it was atpresent in abeyance; but an extensive area of the coast would be declared a Regulated Area, within which access to particular placesmight from time to time be restricted or completely barred by themilitary authorities, in consultation with the Regional Commis-sioner. This new system would apply to a coastal belt, 10 mileswide, from the Humber to Penzance, to the coastal area fromMilford Haven to Portishead, and to areas round the estuaries ofthe Forth, Tay and Clyde.The Prime Minister said he hoped that the military authorities would exercise due discretion in the exercise of these powers.The War Cabinet- ,(1) Took note, with approval, of the decision reached by theLord Presidents Committee.(2) Agreed that the new arrangements should be announced bythe Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Home Security at an early date in reply toa Private Notice Question.ElectoralReport ofCommittee.hvft Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandunof ?Fy ?

forward proposals for securing an improved register for the purposeof war-time By-Elections. The general feeling of the War cabinet was, however, against taking a hasty decision on this matter.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows :-(1) A Cabinet Committee should be appointed to consider thequestions of policy raised by the Report&quot; of theCommittee on Electoral Machinery. The Prime minister unertook to determine its composition^(2) It should be announced in the House of Commons., that theGovernment were not prepared to make emergency arrangements for improving the Register of Voters forpurposes, of war-time By-Elections in advance of their decisions on the wider questions raised in the Reportof the Committee on Electoral Machinery.(3) If there were a Debate on the application for a Writ to bemade on the following day, this announcement might bemade in the course of that Debate. Otherwise theSecretary of State for the Home Department and minister of Home Security should make the announce-ment in reply to a Parliamentary Question on Thursday,the. 1st April.Food 6.   The Prime Minister said that, if the forthcoming food conference.

A team of officials from theW.M. ,(43) 45th Departments concerned Were already at work on this. The draft conclusions.) instructions would, no doubt, be submitted for final approval to theWar Cabinet, but a good many points requiring reference to ministers might arise before this stage was reached.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the War Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to exercise ageneral supervision over the preparation of instructionsto the delegates, in consultation with the ministers concerned.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,March 29, 1943.
