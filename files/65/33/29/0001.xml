The ,main issue discussed*&apos; was what.;:&apos;;shpuid-Vbo./said^:in:the-i forthcoming * Debate Ori the question whether legislation-; to; give;effect to the Beveridge Plan--Or a scheme on&quot; those lines-would beintroduced during the lifetime of the present Parliament. It mustbe remembered that parliament was now in its eighth year, andthat its extension had been prolonged by reason of, and&apos;for the;purposes of, the war.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, if we were to beready to deal effectively with post-war problems, much preparationmust be made during the war and: in. many cases those preparationscould not proceed very far unless decisions pf policy were taken.Some of those decisions would he in fields where no legislative action was necessary at this stage; but others might involve legislation without which preparation for post-war reconstruction would be gravely impeded.It was explained that the line to-be taken on behalf of theGovernment--as indicated in paragraphs 3-6 of the, Report of theReconstruction ; Priorities Committee (WP. (43) 58)-did not include any undertaking that legislation would be introduced duringthe war to implement any part of the Beveridge Plan. Many of thenew claims likely tp be made on the Exchequer after the&apos;war were still uncertain. At this stage the Government could only state thatpriority would be given to the expenditure necessary to ensureinternational security and, second only to that, to the expenditurerequired to maintain employment at the highest attainable level;that, as regards the other claims (among which were included theneeds of social security), it was impossible at this stage to establishany order of priority or to enter into definite commitments. it followed that, while it was the duty of the Government to reachprovisional decisions as to post-war plans in all spheres, these plansmust all be brought under review and. related to the financial-situation when the time was reached&quot; for them to be put intolegislative effect. On this basis the Government would proceed withtheir examination of the Beveridge Plan and would begin thenecessary consultations with the main interests affected. All thiswould occupy a considerable time and, until these preparations hadbeen completed, no question of legislation would arise. Whenspecific legislative proposals were ready for consideration, theGovernment would be in a better position to determine prioritiesas between the various reconstruction projects and to decide, in thelight of the circumstances then obtaining, whether to proceed with legislation. - .The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the general line to be taken by the government spokesmen in the forthcoming Debate should be asindicated in paragraphs 3-6 of the Report of theReconstruction Priorities Committee .(W:.Pi (43) 58).As regards legislation, the Government should not be committed to introducing legislation for the reform ofthe social services during the war; but, equally, thereshould be no negative conunitment debarring the Govern-ment from introducing such legislation during the life-time of the present Parliament.&apos; (2) Approved the recommendations set but in the Report of theReconstruction Priorities Committee (W.P. (43) 58) asto the line to be taken on the main features of the beveridge Plan, subject to the provisional conclusionsrecorded thereon by the War Cabinet at the Meeting onthe 12th February, which were endorsed.if the War Cabinet rS.W. 1,February 15, 1943;
