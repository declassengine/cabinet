uopseveltfs proposal for, a Conference on* (i) A Note by the Minister of Food (W.P. (43) 114).&apos;v(ii)&apos; A^Memorandum&apos;&apos;:by\?the ;Mimster;,&apos;6f&apos;v&apos;Algri0ulture&apos;- and&apos;.    :: Fisheries (W.P; (43); 118). - :;&quot;(iii) A Noteby the,! Secretary /W.P. (43) 119) covering an exchange of telegrams with Washington.(iv) A Note by the Secretary (W.P. (43) 121) covering two, draft telegrams to Washington aboutthe.scope&apos;Of theConference^The following were the main points made in&quot; discussion : (a) The Prime Minister emphasised&apos;: the importance to thiscountry of supplies of food at cheap rates. At theproposed Conference we were likely to find ourselves inan isolated position among delegates of producercountries.(b) The Minister of Food agreed that the Conference presented a number of potential dangers. Thus, it might fall intothe hands of food faddists who believed that optimumnutritional standards could be applied Universally to allthe peoples of the world.A second danger was that the Conference would start dealing with currency questions or commodity* control, which were outside its scope. Our delegates tothe Food Conference must not get involved in discussionOf these matters.There was a further difficulty, namely, that theinterests of this country as an importing country had tobe reconciled with those of the Dominions as producing;.; countries.   It was important that we should reach agreement with the Dominion representatives before theConference, so that the delegates from the whole Empirecould speak with q^e voice.(c) At the same time, the Minister of Food thought we ought not to ignore the danger of a food shortage after thewar. Consumption was increasing in many areas,owing to the rise in. internal spending-power,: whileproduction in some areas had fallen off. The relief of&apos;&apos; liberated areas would be a heavy drain on food reserves.He thought, therefore, that it would be wise that con-sideration should be given to the continuance for aperiod after the war of an organisation on the lines ofthe Combined Food Board, but on a wider internationalbasis. - -(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought the draft telegrams to Washington (W.P. (43) 121) were on theright lines. He emphasised the need for reaching some general prior understanding with the United States as. :    v to the Resolutions which it was\ proposed should&quot; be passed at the Conference. &apos;(e) The Lord President oj1 the, GtomciJ thought there was a real risk that, while the Conference might start withthe discussion of food problems, it would lead on to consideration of wider issues, e.g., currency questions,&apos;. commodity1, control . and - commercial&apos; &quot;relations.;&apos; We&apos; werenot re^thought/wei ought to have a perfectly clear undCT^standing with the United States Government, beforethe Conference, that it would not be allowed to become involved in discussion of these wider issues. . He agreed&apos; that, it was also-important that ;we;:shc^d..&apos;atibEtop]t.;to&apos;i reach an informal,understanding with the United States
Government, before the Conference, on the matters tobe dealt with at it. He would like to see the draft telegrams stiffened up considerably on these lines.General agreement was expressed with these views.(ff The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security andthe President of the Board of Trade said that thediscussion showed how important it was that we should get our own ideas clear as soon as practicable on thegeneral lines of our post-war economic policy. ThePresident of the Board of Trade also stressed thedifficulties which.would ensue if the Conference spread,over into discussion of commercial matters generally.[g) The Secretary of State for India said that the interestsof India, as a low-standard country, were different fromthose of the high-standard producer countries. It was important that India should be adequately represented at the Conference, especially as principles accepted withregard to foodstuffs might form a precedent for the subsequent treatment of raw materials.(h) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that M. Maisky had informed him that theRussian Government were likely to say that it was too early for the Conference to meet on the 27th April.It was generally agreed that postponement would bedesirable.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs also referred to a telegram received that; morning from Washington (No. 1408) reporting thatMr, Morgenthau was of opinion that it would be undesirable to publish the currency plans until thediscussions between the experts had taken place. Hethought it might be possible to use this as a lever to getthe Americans to agree to expedite discussions betweenthe experts, and he would like to insert a paragraph inthe telegram to Lord Halifax to this effect.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed to the despatch to Lord Halifax of telegramson the general lines of the drafts circulated asW.P. (43) 121, subject to stiffening on the lines indicated by the Lord President of the Council.(2) Asked the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Paymaster-General and theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to arrange for the telegrams to be redrafted onthe lines indicated in discussion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,March 25, 1943.
