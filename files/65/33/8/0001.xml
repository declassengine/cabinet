Leader of the House ofCommons would announce that the House would go into: Secret Session, in order to make a statement in regardto Business. The terms of the statement to be made inSecretSession were also discussed/fand settled...(3) Man-power Debate. IThe Secretary of State for Air suggested that theMinister of Labour and National Service might include in his speech a statement to the effect that the Govern-ment were now making certain reductions in our defensive power in order to achieve a greater conicen-tration on our offensive striking power. The Secretaryof State undertook to submit a draft paragraph to theMinister of Labour andi National Service on these lines.(4) Post-war Finance and Economics.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he hopedthat in the course of this Debate he would be able tosay that preliminary discussions had now startedbetween our Advisers and those of the United StatesGovernment on post-war economic problems, and that,when these had been Completed, discussions would takeplace with the other United Nations. The Chancelloradded, however, that the responsibility for handlingdiscussions on certain of these matters had passed fromthe State Department to the United States Treasury, andthat it looked as though the United States Governmentwere not now disposed to make rapid progress in thismatter.(5) beveridge report:The discussion is recorded in Minute 3 below.Lease-Lend. 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr. Stettinius,Tobacco. the Lease-Lend Administrator of the United States, had indicated(Previous that the Lease-Lend Administration wished to delete from theBeference: * forthcoming appropriation, provision for the free supply of tobaccoW.M.(42)22nd to the United Kingdom. They would for the present continue to conclusions, supply Australia and New Zealand with free tobacco, because of minute 5.) special agreements, and would supply the tobaccp to the UnitedKingdom for the troops: Yv   . The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that, in connectionwith Lease-Lend as a whole, recent calculations had been madeshowing that the Reciprocal Aid given by this country to theUnited States represented a far higher proportion than was generally understood. The figures Were so striking that it was proposed to send a telegram to the Treasury representative atWashington, asking him to represent to. Mr. Stettinius, who was already in possession of most of the figures, that the extent of our. Reciprocal Aid might be regarded by the Administration as astrong defence against any attacks in Congress, either upon theitem of tobaccoor anyother item in the appropriation. It wouldalso be emphasized that tobacco had always been regarded as essential for the war effort and that the necessary shipping space
had been allocated accordingly!. Although $he decision about theinclusion of tobacco in the appropriation was a matter for theApMinistratiion, the Treasury represe^ toputthe&apos; question in a friendly way whether the item might not beincluded in &apos;the appropriation arid, if necessary, withdrawn if infact it were strorigry^ criticised by Congress.It was emphasized that in explaining the extent of&apos; the reciprocal Aid, we had no interitiori of permitting the pound and dollar sign to come into the matter. ,The Chancellor said that he proposed to refer to the-extentof Reciprocal Aid in his Budget speech.The War Cabinet took note, with approval, of the&apos; above statement. TScsM 3.   The War Cabinet were reminded that the MinisterServices, without Portfolio; speaking in the House on the 1st December,The Beveridge 1942, had said that he hoped that early in the New Year MembersReport. of the House would be in a position to discuss the main questions(Previous       raised in the Report, and that when the Government had had the reference:      advantage of hearing the opinions expressed in Debate theyW.M.(43)5th   would be able to indicate to the House their general attitude.Conclusions, The question was.raised whether, now that the Debate on the minute 2.) Beveridge Report was not going to take place until the thirdweek in February, the Government would not be expected to expresson that occasion their general attitude.towards the Report.In this connection, attention was drawn to the Memorandum. which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had circulated to the Com-mittee on Reconstruction Problems (R.P. (43) 5)* setting out the many claims which would be made on the Exchequer in regard to international security, the need to secure full employment, and othermatters such as agriculture, housings education, colonial develop-ment, &amp;c.,1 and, urging that these claims should be assessed and someorder of priority determined.The War Cabinet was also informed that the Committee of officials, which had prepared a report on a number of pointssubmitted to them, had reached the conclusion that the proposals in; the Beveridge plan were closely inter-related; that any decision ofthe Government must therefore deal with the plan comprehensively;arid that, owing to the number of difficult issues involved, some time must elapse before this could be done.The general view of the War Cabinet, was that all this groundcould not possibly be covered before the third week in February.The Government should, however, be able,to make a satisfactorystatement in general terms on-the occasion of this Debate, providedthat consideration of the Report by Ministers was taken in handforthwith and that the government spokesman in the Debate was ina position to explain the complexity of some of the questions whichhad to be&apos; determined, before an authoritative pronouncement could&apos;be made on the Beveridge plan as a whole.In this connection, the War Cabinet reviewed the arrangements. for consideration of Reconstruction problems.A stage had now been reached at which there was a much closer- linkage between current issues which must come before the WarCabinet and Reconstruction problems. In these circumstances itwas suggested that certain of the larger aspects of reconstruction problems should be considered, by a new. Committee of Ministersbefore consideration by the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Decided that consideration of the Beveridge Plan, togetherwith the general review of other substantial claims to financial assistance, set out in the Chancellor of the
Ex(*equer&apos;s Paper (R.F.J43J 5) should be remitted to aCommittee constituted as follows: The Lord President of the Council (Chairman).The Minister of Labour and National Service.the Minister of Production. .The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Privy seal the Minister without Portfolio.A number of other Ministers would be closely associatedwith the work of the Committee, by virtue of their depart-mental or other interest in the subject matter, andarrangements would be made for them to be supplied withthe proceedings of the Committee, and, of course, to attendwhen matters affecting their interests were under:discussion.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.

(42) 14th Meeting, of the 3rd December, 1942.2. Certain assumptions made in the Paper are of necessity tentative.Whilst I believe we can look forward with confidence to the future of our Country,-it-is obvious tb^t in the post-war period we shall be faced not only with many difficulties, but hi certain respects with problems even more anxious than in time;of,war itself. It would, therefore, be but prudent to avoid at this time largearid continuing commitments unless there is an overwhelming case for them.- 3- We have obviously to consider the Beveridge Report, which has much to&apos;ebmmerid it, riot only in relation to our present commitments, but in relation toother strongly pressed claims which have considerable force on their merits, andsome of which we must at any rate do our best to meet. -; 4. First and above all, we must make adequate provision for our contributiontft the armed forces that will be necessary after the war for international security,to insure, so far as we can, against any repetition of the evil and aggression whichtwice within a generation has brought such disaster to the world. This is rightlydemanded;above everything else. It cannot be done without considerable cost,and in our estimate of this we had better be on the safe side.5. Secondly) it is paramount that if we are to live after the war, even atpur present standards, and still more if we are to secure any social advancement,we have so to direct and shape our policy as to secure the fullest employment forour people. We have, moreover, lost most of our dollar assets and are incurringvery heavy sterling liabilities in various countries of the world; even with themost careful arrarigements our post-war exchange position, itself vital to full employment, must be one of great anxiety. We have, therefore,, to secure the fulls^stefratidriof trade arid business and, in particular, we must increase the volumeof our export trade at the least by 50 per cent, over pre-war. The State will nodoubt have to helpactively. Iri this corinectiori the incidence of taxation plays animportant, part;6, Taxation must^ on this account, if no other, be mitigated as soori as itimpossible if we are to have a fair chance of restoring trade and greatly increasingexports. All sections of the community will also certainly expect reliefs, and thecost of new social schemes arid^seryices, however beneficent and desirable, mustbe balanced against these.facts.; - .[24896] &apos; ....... B
7.  We have, I&apos;would together, in additionto BeVeridge, all; the other substantial claims to financial assistance that; h^y heph and will be&apos; made and pressed, such as Agriculture, Housing, Education^Roads, Forestry, Wa,ter* Electricity, Colonial Development, Civil Aviation, $s--&quot;sft^^-^y;necessary/&apos;distance&apos; to industry and any scheme which.ni^i^simple^from the Uthwatt Report. Some of the charges on these items may be -on capitalas well as revenue account (the Treasury paper i$ concerned only; with reverbexpenditure), but clearly we have to consider the demands on the national resources for capital as well as revenue. Housing must be placed highest, I think, and thereis Education, which we have promised in the King&apos;s Speech, while Agricultureho doubt has special claims also, and large figures have already been put forward in a&apos; Paper circulated by the Minister of Agriculture since the treasury memorandum was written. \8.   In any event we shall, I would suggest, have to assess these claims and determine some sort of priority, andin determining what shall foe done in respect of any particular proposalto see to it that the financial assistance that is made available is directed to real need, particularly in respect of the social services.9.   So far as the Beveridge Plan is concerned-(a) I welcome the value and importance of the strong emphasis which hasbeen placed by the author of the Report upon the contributoryprinciple and his insistence that high rates of. benefit can only be assured by relatively high rates of contribution. There are, however,indications that though &quot;the principles &quot; of tile Beveridge report may be accepted, there will be many reservations as to particularportions of the scheme and pressure for benefits to be increased andconditions revised in favour of the contributor. ,. . ,.(&amp;) But there is still left to fall on the Taxpayer and on industry what is described as &quot; Is. for 3d.,&quot; and the Budgetary cost may well exceed the estimates in the Report.10.   There are these possibilities :-(a) Unemployment may exceed the rate of 8  per cent, allowed for in theReport.(6) Rates of benefit may have to be increased to satisfy the Nationalsubsistence minimum..    (c) Contributions from new classes may not be forthcoming.(O) There may be pressure from the employers to shift their contribution oil to the general Taxpayer. . /(e) The largely increased sum compulsorily placed upon contributors (whichitself would have something of the nature of a tax) may make it moredifficult to levy taxation from the large number of taxpayers in thelower income groups upon whom we must continue to rely if we areto maintain a budget of the size envisaged.This last consideration is one which is bound to weigh heavily With theChancellor of the Exchequer. The Treasury memorandum shows clearly that allpur hopes, whether for social security or for other elements in our post-warplanning, are.inevitably bound up with the maintenance of the National budgetat a hign level, and that this means not only high rates of taxation, but a widespread over the whole population,K.Treasury Chambers,January 11, 1943.

It concerns itself solely with its financial, aspects, anddeals in this way only with the plan as presented. It does not attempt to envisage alternatives or modifications which might be decided upon.2; Acceptance of the complete plan involves a contract with many millions,of beneficiaries, the continued fulfilment of which would properly have to be,in good or bad times alike, a prior charge upon national resources. The methodsof tapping these resources for the partial redistribution of income which theplan, provides,, are by. general taxation and compulsory contributions. the broad impression left by the report on the ordinary reader is that in the author&apos;view the general finance of the scheme can be carried without undue difficulty:There are, however, lying in the future, so far as it can at present be dimlydiscerned, doubts and uncertainties suggesting that large new financial commit-ments cannot at this stage be undertaken without misgiving. There are alsodoubtful questions to be weighed in connection with the financial structure oftheplan,itself? This note is designed to develop these points for the considera-tibn of Ministers.3. The plan continues and extends the existing, contributory principle.The contributions of insured persons (a) pre-war, (b) under the plan at the outset, and (c) under the plan after 20 years represent respectively (a) 20 percent., Qi) 30 per cent.; and (p) 25 per cent: of the total cost. The correspondingproportions -for, the aggregate contribution of insured persons and of employers-a^-45/ per. -cent.,. 53v-per-&apos;eent. .&apos;and.,-41 per cent, respectively. Thus the general* taxpayer is^ calledupon at the outset to pay a, rather less proportion of the-totalcost (thoughthe total cost is greatly increased),, while the absolute amount-contributed;by;insured persons as such is increased heavily.4.   A mate^^l part of the total sum required comes from a continuation of cohtributiphsalready made to the same object by insured persons, employers^ and taxpayers under a system now wellr-established.  A further material part^represeute the broad; equivalent of money now paid- by individuals in respectCof health services; and&apos; certain types of small insurances without the interven-tion. of the States , The Scheme, moreover, can be regarded as a, redistribution^of national income.   The plan, is estimated.&apos; to require at the outset - m.607(including: raterbori^e expenditure) representing, it may be, rather less than10 per cent, of the national income.   If viewed in isolation and suitablydistributed,, this- total charge could easily be borne riot merely by a national:income? of: t^fe^amO^t which may; be anticipated post-war, but ^ a much smaller one.. - . &apos;-- &apos;-:i:^-:&apos;.:&quot;&apos;y:

And although this scheme is a continuation ofexisting established schemes, the sum required from industry is  ini37 perannum as compared with  m66 per annum pre-war, and the sumirequired fromthe general taxpayer is some  m275 per annum at the outseii^^^through a period of 20 years to some  m450 per annum, as cbmpaj^j*ith some ml35 pre-war.6. These increases cannot be judged solely by reference to the national income. The effects viewed in conjunction withthe^ effects of other publiccharges need.to be examined, and this entails some estimate of the future size of the national Budget.&apos;A     /      \   it&apos; &apos;   - ^.7. The amount of the taxable national income in the given post-war year&apos;s  dependent upon many factors. It may perhaps be put at  m7,150- But this figure assumes continued active employment (as is assumed in the plan), andassumes also, therefore, the large expansion of the volume of exports necessaryto achieve this measure of employment. It also assumes no reduction ofpeace-time working hours affecting output, and no relaxation of the ordinarypeace-time intensity of individual effort.8. If excess profits tax is abolished and that portion of the income taxwhich is now collected but becomes returnable as a post-war credit is no longercollected, but all other current taxation is kept jh full force, the yield oftaxation in the given post-war year with a national income of  nv7,150 maybe estimated at  002,050* with a margin of error of  ml25 on either side.9. The budgetary costs which are commitments under existing policy,exclusive of the cost of the armed forces and of sinking fund upon the war debts,,may be estimated at  ml,125.10.   This calculation would leave a surplus of  m925 to meet-&apos;(a) any correction required by a failure of the national income to reach m7,150;(&amp;) cost of the armed forces;(c) sinking fund;(d) new services and new commitments of all kinds;(e) remission of taxation.11, The post-war cost of the armed forces is at present entirely conjectural.The sum necessary to maintain forces (land, sea and air) of one million men with reasonably up-to-date equipment may be put at  mSOO per annum. It maybe considered pessimistic to envisage the possibility of so great a sum being required, and it is true that if a figure in this region is thought ofr,and if atthe same time the assumption is made that the enemy countries have been fully and effectively demilitarised, the corollary follows that the , budgetary positionof the enemy countries would in this particular respect be far better than thatof the victors. But it is assumed that the necessary cost of international security&apos;,whatever it may prove to be, must.be met; and until the Government are in aposition to give guidance upon this subject it has not Jseemed to the treasury to be prudent, either in the present connexion or in others, to frame post-war policy upon&apos;any confident hypothesis of a cost materially different from thatindicated. /12. This country, in common with others, has managed without any regularsinking fund upon war debt since 1931. If the cost of international security in the early future proves to be very high the budgetary burden of this cost,combined with that of social expenditure, may of sheer necessity postpone the resumption of a sinking fund till (happier times. Subject to that,  rnlOO perannum is the smallest reasonable sum to make an impression upon the greatlyswollen war debt with which we shall end the war.13. Apart from the social insurances, new demands which can at present be foreseen include demands for agriculture, housing, education, roads; rural watersupply, forestry, colonial development and civil aviation. In addition, there may* Of this sum  ml50 represents Purchase Tax.

It is not at present possible;!to asssign a definite figure to any one of these services but it would prima faciebe imprudent to assign- to these ten or more purposesa lesssum than  ml0Oper -annuia rising - as the&apos;- years progress.&apos; &quot;r . 14. Taxation to-day, even after eliminating the excess profits&apos; tax and that;part of the income tax represented by post-war credits, stands at entirelyunprecedented heights- income tax at 10s. in the   against 5s.&apos;,fid. in4s, 65. in1935) apd with personal allowances substantially reduced in absoluteamounts andeven more materiaUy reduced in relation to the changed price level;surtax advancing to a maximum of 19s. 6d. in the   against a maximuhiof 13s. 9^.; tobacco duty is^lOd. an ounce againstMd.; beer duty at an averageof6-38d.perpintas comparedwith 1-67*2. per pint; purchase tax, an entirely new tax, at rates rising from I6f per cent, to 66f per cent.,15. Ijnder a closed economy in war, money goes round in a circle andtaxpayers intent on the outcome of the war and deprived of ordinaryppportunitiesof spending will, for the time being, bear even the heaviest impostswkh equanimity. In peace-time the taxpayer is much more concerned with; the size of his tax bill and not equally mindful of the benefits either to himself or^P^bthers which his tax payments or part of them may confer.16. Taxation in 1938 took 3s. M. in the   of the national income; in 1941,with the adjustment above indicated, it took 5s. Id. in the  .&quot; In the post-war year, on the above estimate, it will at current rates similarly adjusted take 5s. 9s.ih the  . Experience shows that over-heavy public levies have a depressing effect upon the community and an adverse reaction upon industrial activity and upon employment, more especially in times of uncertainty or at the onsetand during the progress of any period of depression. It must be anticipatedthat large demands for reliefs from exceptional war-time burdens will be pressed by all levels of the community, and that the demand will be the stronger,especially from industry, in proportion as prosperity may elude us.* Incometax will produce roughly  m90 for each shilling. Beer and tobacco duties at current rates will exceed the pre-war yield by some  m380. Purchase tax- ml50 post-war-is likely to. be the subject of special criticism.&apos; 17. It is not possible to reduce these various considerations to specificarithmetical terms, if only for the reason that at present two great uncertaintiesoverhang the future of the Budget. Firstly, there is uncertainty as to the futurecost of international security; secondly, there is uncertainty as to the success ofthe effort to achieve and maintain a state of active employment with the highnational income that that state implies; as to the will there is no question, butthe result can at this stage scarcely be guaranteed.18. As matters stand to-day, the post-war cost to the Exchequer (includedjyg.. the foregoing figures) of the social insurance services will exceed the pre-war^eeatby some  m50 per annum. The taxpayers further share of cost arising fromthe social security plan is estimated in the report at  m86 per annum at the outset. It may be thought that, having regard to the position outlined above and the many uncertainties overhanging the situation, this further  m86 is fully as large a sum as should be allocated to this one specific purpose. But in accepting the estimate in the report certain risks have to be run and certain&apos;difficulties to be faced.* In judging the need to spread a Budget of the order indicated over a wide area thefollowing figures taken from the Budget White Paper of 1942 are of interest:- .&apos; j 5 &apos;   Aggregate^ gross personal incomes, 1940/41 (impersonal incomes not included):\&apos;H.V.&apos;^V:&apos;y^ ,1-:      -./&apos;     ; ypl      m.than  250 p.a.       ......      ...      .,.      ...      ...    . 3,344 250 to  500 p.a . ... ......      ...      ......      ... .1,038, 500 to  2,000 p.a.... ...      ......      ,......   ...... 797Over  2,000, p.a.    ... ...      ......... . .;: ...   .... 543/,&apos;vv:&apos;&apos;                                                               . &apos; 5,722if

The cost of most of the services can be estimated with iaisfcprecision, but the cost of unemployment benefit; is unpredictable. The figure of:8V pe^ centv unemployment adopted in the report for the purpose of financialC^culatiohs may prove to give a sufficient margin for the early years of thet^iS^ition period when once the temporary difficulties of demobilisation have,been surmounted. Whether it will give sumcient margin in the period followingdepends upon success in continuously maintaining active employment. In theevent of failure the whole extra cost will come upon, the taxpayer. /There may beam6&amp;set in theeairly stages in so far as there is unavoidable delay in bringing-into force some of the health service provisions, especially if in the interimcontributions are nevertheless levied at the full1 rates proposed.2Q. Secondly, the social security plan quotes benefit rates on the provisionalbasis that the cost of ljivingk will be 25 per cent, above the pre-war figure. Theb*sj.s of 30, cejity,. on which this npte proceeds, is more reasonable, especiallya$ it is related.tean amalgam of price levels, wholesale and retail, and not solelytp. the: oost of living. If the cost of living proves tp have increased by 30 to35 per cent., the provisional figures of benefit, unless increased, fail pro tantoto attain the national subsistence minimum as calculated in the report. But no concession^ could be- admitted on this point without deranging the financial structure.21. Thirdly;,, the; plan introduces; various new classes pf insured persons whose benefits will be small in relation to their, contributions or will be post?poned; e.g., the five millionnew claimants to old-age pensions pay contributions,for. 10 years without receiving any pensions, although they may have reached the pension age, and only begin to reach full pension after 20 years. Omission ofthese new classes would involve an addition of about JSml5 per annum to theExchequer cost duringthe first 10f years of: the plan.: 22. Fourthly, in paragraph 287 of the report it is ominously emphasised that there is nothing sapped about the division! of the burden there suggested, asbetween contributors and taxpayers, and that it is no more than a basis fordiscussion and argument. In such disoussions the taxpayer is apt to come offworst. This would; have to be avoided.23: The question is of especial importance in connection with the employer^contribution. Employers are to pay 3s. 3d. a week for each man employed, fpRany part of a week (at present Is. IQd. less in agriculture; and certain o$wrfindustries). The aggregate cost will be  ml37, against  m83 (includingworkmen&apos;s compensation) on the present basis. The increase can be represented as only about 2 per cent, on present wages. For products of high value inwhich labour costs are low this may seem unimportant, but for other products,ef, ., opal, where labour, costs form a high proportion, or for very competitiveexports, it, may be regarded as a dispiriting increase on the cost of production.Employers may well repeat, more forcibly, their, argument that no-part of; tftfrcost of the social services should be financed^ by a taxi on employment; especially as part Pf the additional cost arises from the inclusion: within the scheme or persons who are neither employers nor employed, and that the cost ofsuch a scheme/should fall upon general taxation. This argument would require also  to bielisted. l: -24. Whatever the cost of the scheme to the Exchequer at the outset&apos; may&quot; beyit, mu8.t..be expected from a very early date to begin to distort the present incidence of general taxation,25. The employer, the insured person and&apos; the taxpayer,- all of whom are tocontribute to the cost of the scheme, are not separate persons; everyone will contribute in two capacities (as taxpayer and insured person):, and some people&apos; ( (?., employers), in all three; The report purports to distinguish betweencontribution and taxation; on the ground- that benefits obtained0by contributionare discernible and belong to the contributor as of personal rightj whereas theadvantages secured through taxation appear to be much more indirect.

^ritrib^ as has happened in the past, thisdistinction /can VgeneraUy\be admitted, but the proposed contributions mean&apos;&quot;an^cxe^ej k:$d$&apos;*-W&amp; ^existing insured5 classes, of Sfe       a; week in the formofdetfoc&apos;^ 3&amp; a weekOironl the fncome of the gainfully occupied lad of otW person^ living atvhomewho are brought under insurance. ; Simultaneously, a large5 proportion ; - ofcontributors thus aflected wttl also-be paying direct taxes as well as their shareof indirect taxes;, all at a high, levels and, on the first, i atS a moment when it is quite possible that incomes,, whether fronj wagesi-oif,fromtrad^ will hot; have settled downinto a. proper relationship with! the price levels.The question arises whether, in view of the interplay of the factors of contribution and taxation, the proposed contributions can be looked upon as;^rm and at the same time it can be assumed that those contributors who feel the deduction most heavily will not strive to thrOw Off their share of generalJtax&amp;tfcnon to-other shoulders^.&apos; 26. the new plan Would save contributors their present expenditure famedical treatment; the total for all classes of the community may be as high as m40 per annum, though only a fraction of this sum would be paid by those oh^hom tihe new contribution would fall most heavily. Many of the contributorsalso would or might give Up current weekly contributions to insurance companies and clubs; to What extent this will occur seems to be a subject for doubt, for the habit of voluntary insurance, both for death benefits and health benefits, is deeplyingrained in the mass of the community, and feven if the industrial assurance&quot;Companies are converted into a State Corporation, as is alternatively suggested inthe plan) a very considerable volume of Voluntary insurance seems likely to persist.But, allowing for these facts,  11 per annum (in a period when war overtime willhave disappeared) is a heavy start for a working man, irrespective of his wages.It is.certainly not safe to assume that his ability and willingness to pay his shareof general taxes (including income tax) will be unaffected, t .27. Moreover, the cost of the plan is a gradually increasing one. It increasesover 20 years by  ml60 beyond its initial figure and (there being meanwhile asmall drop in the contribution) the charge on the taxpayer increases graduallyduring the same period by  m.168. It is reasonable to expect that over a periodof 20 years considerable improvements&apos;of those social services which are included within the plan would, in any event, find their way into the Statute Book if andwhen finance becomes available. But the adoption of the plan would involve a legislative contract with the contributors for the finding of this further money.It may be that the national income and the national taxable capacity will yetshow great expansion over a period of 20 years. There are many prophets readyto assert to-day that this will be the case. Those who hold this view are able topoint to the large increase in the real national income between 1914 and 1938 andto claim support from the evidence of important technological improvements in industry. The contrary argument does not so often find expression. It wouldallege that various new tendencies can be discerned which are by no meansfavourable in their character, and that it may conceivably prove that Britisheconomic life will have to undergo a phase of great and growing difficulty. the troubles connected with the adverse balance of payments with which we must expect to emerge from the war as the result of our heavy net loss of foreign invest-ment income and similar factors may, unless they can be surmounted, exertimportant repercussions on the level of our internal prosperity. In order to obtainthe food and raw materials we need from abroad, we must export on a much larger scale than in 1938; and we may find it extremely difficult to do this in a world in which agricultural countries are becoming rapidly industrialised andin which some of our staple exports, such as coal and cotton, may be seriouslyreduced, while a large-scale transfer of production to new industries mayinevitably be slow, and, owing to natural handicaps, such as the absence within&apos;our own borders of raw materials, e.g., for light alloys, may be for some timebeyond our competitive power.. It would certainly be wrong to draw pessimisticcoriclusiohs from these uncertain questions, and it may be hoped that favourableforces will predominate, it is, however, against this background that a definitenew commitment of  m426 per annum gross for the whole plan, including  m254( m86 phis  ml68) per annum or more for the taxpayer, on this part of socialser^ce expenditure must beconsidered.In this connection reference is made to the footnote to para^t The reaction upon industrial relations of the proposed contribution both of employers and employees is outside the.scope of this note. , &apos;V- i&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;
$j$t 28. Thus, in any attempt&apos;made at the present time to judge of the realweight of future taxation and , the real additional weight thrown upon the ta*-,payer by the plan, upon the assumption that the initial cost is*kept to^estimated  m8S per. annum, three principal uncertainties rem(a,V uncertainty as to the future cost of international security;       &apos;7&amp;y uncertainty as to success in the ^e^(c) uncertainty whether the subsequent growth of the national income wiEkeep pace with growing demahds, including the.     the plan. &apos;f29.   In due course all of these uncertainties may. be resolved, in ia favourablesense;;but in the meanwhile they exist.  In the meanwhiile, also-r-as a;mAtfe^r/jnoiof conjecture but of certainty- conditions for some tim^ after the war; tsfilt-l^v . those of continuing deprivations, and there will be need of a public readiness for-&apos; the time being to accept them rather than to expect immediate improvements inthe whole standard of life: .30. . Accordingly, if the Government, after examination of the plan, acceptits principles, detailed consideration should proceed from the standpoint-ofcurtailing any expenditures which may be held to be unnecessarily costly and of&apos;keeping the contractual element within proper limits. It would &quot;be prudent alsothat sections of the plan should be deferred for the time being or developed moregradually in such manner as Ministers may find practicable when.) the survey howbeing made in the Official Committee has become available.Treasury Chambers, ;  .January 1, 1943.
