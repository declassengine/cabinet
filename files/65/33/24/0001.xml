WhileMinute 2.)       they had at first taken the view that we should give an undertaking to the Germans not to shackle prisoners during operations, they were now prepared to agree that it should be made plain to the GermanGovernment that in special circumstances shackling should beauthorised on the field of battle.The Foreign Secretary handed round a revised draft telegram to Berne. In preparing this draft an attempt had been made tomeet the views of the Canadian Government. /Account had also beentaken of the fact that the statement made on the 13th October, to theeffect that the Geneva Convention did not attempt to regulate what happened in the actual fighting and was concerned with prisoners in the responsible charge of a nostile Government, could be repre-* sented as not being an accurate statement Of the case from the legalpoint of view. The Foreign Office were advised that the provisionsof the Convention came into force as soon as a man was madeprisoner.After discussion, the War Cabinet-Agreed that the revised draft should now be sent to theCanadian Government, under cover of a telegram sayingthat we were anxious to go as far as we could to meet theirviews, and asking whether they would be ready to-acceptthe revised draft.

These telegrams reported that Mr. Gandhi had decided to start a &quot;fast to capacity&quot; for three weeks on theWh February. This meant that he would take water and fruitjuices, The telegrams contained a report of the yiesra expressed at two meetings of J&amp;e Vjceroy&apos;s Council as to what action should betaken.The Council had given favourable consideration to a proposal that Gandhi should be released for the period of this fast, on theunderstanding that on its completion he would retfmim to detection.This suggestion was put forward on the ground that it would be thebest way to deflate Gandhi.
