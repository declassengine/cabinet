The American assessment of enemy losses inthis area had been 61 aircraft destroyed, 18 probably destroyed and.34 damjaged. Our losses had been 24 destroyed and 3 damaged.Our air activity had been increasing and attacks had been made%ainst airfields and troops on the ground.v Heavy air attacks had been made on Japanese shipping on its way to New Guinea. Three transports had been sunk and a numberof ships hit in Habaul Harbour. American assessment of Japaneselosses in this area had been 77 aircraft destroyed, 32 probably destroyed arid 33 damaged. Allied losses had been 5 aircraft destroyed.       .       -: Shipping losses for the previous week amounted to 82,000 tons.This figure included the losses suffered in the heavy attack by -boats on an oil convoy during the week-end.The main Russian advances had been along the railway fromStalingrad to Likhaya arid between the Sal River and the Don. Itwas believed that the -Russians had crossed the river atMelikhovskaya, 50 iniles from Rostov. Further south the russians had pushed on to the Manich River, while in the extreme south their forces had reached the Kuma River. The resistance of the6th German Army at Stalingrad was becoming weaker.In Tripolitania, where the weather had been bad, we had beenbuilding up our resources. The enemy had been thinning out his forces and some had gone back beyond Tripoli.: Both sides were engaged on building up their forces.The Prime Minister referred to General Eisenhower&apos;s request to be supplied with some &quot; Z &quot; batteries for the defence of ports;he thought it important that this request should be complied With,since it would be Valuable to get active service experience of thisweapon.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that arrangements had been made to send two &quot; Z &quot; batteries to North Africa in the.near future..    Our forces were pressing on towards Akyab.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.stt to h*k 2.

As regards (a), the Minister of Informationexplained that responsibility lay with the United States authorities, and not withthis country. As regards (ft)&quot;, responsibility would in future beplaced on the Commanders to consult the Civil Defence authoritieswhen planning operations, Arrangements had been made to ensurethat the Commanders were made aware of th ir responsibility in this\ respect. &quot; -&apos;The War Cabinet took note of the&apos; Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security:Refugees.Reception anilaccommodationof refugeesfroin enemy-occupied territory.(Previous&quot;Reference:W.M. (42) 172ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (48) 13) reporting the: conclusions reached by the Committee appointed to consider what arrangements could be made for the reception and accommodation of Jewish refugees from enemy-occupied territory.:. The Foreign Secretary said that the Committee had reached theconclusion that no differentiation should be made as between Jewishand non-Jewish refugees; and that the refugee problem, as a whole,should be regarded as a United Nations responsibility in respect ofwhich each nation should agree to make a definite contribution. Ifthis conclusion were accepted, the next step would be to try to persuade the United States Government to agree that the problem should be dealt with on these lines and that they would themselvesaccept a number, of the refugees already in Spain and Portugal.The draft of a telegram in this sense was submitted for the WarCabinefs approval.In discussion, it was agreed that the following alterationsshould be made inthesentence in paragraph4of the draft telegram,beginning: ;&apos;-Tn spite Of this, however, \ . . &quot;and in the foldingsentence : (i) For &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government would not dismiss &quot;.  - there should be substituted &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;.  are prepared to consider.&quot; -/(ii) The words &quot; in response to a lead from the United StagesGovernment and &quot;should be omitted,(iii) For &quot; a proportionate share&quot; there should be substituted&quot; a further share.&quot;

(43) i69th &quot;As regards ihdustriai lighting the Committee, while suggestingConclusions, no general relaxation of standards, recommended that the MinistryMinute 2.) of Home Security should continue to give sympathetic considerationto individual applications for special lighting to &apos; facilitateparticular industrial processes and services.In the second part of their Report the Committee recommendedthat the standard of interior lighting in trains and public servicevehicles should be raised to such a standard as would enablepassengers to read with comfort. They also recommended detailedimprovements in the lighting of railway stations and in operationallighting on the railways. ^As regards street lighting, , the Committee sought furtherdirections on two points : (i) was further consideration of a dualsystem of street lighting to be ruled out, in view of its substantialcost in terms of labour and materials; and (ii), if so, should enquiriesbe pursued into the possibility of raising to - 002-&quot;foot candles thestandard of street lighting which would remain alight during air raids?Points made in discussion were : (a) A more satisfactory standard of lighting in railwaycarriages could be secured if use was made of windowblinds. Two of the railway companies were, however,unwilling to rely on the use of blinds, though the other two companies had operated without difficulty a lightingsystem dependent on the use of blinds.It was agreed that, where a higher standard ofinterior lighting could be secured through the use ofwindow blinds already installed, the railway companies should be pressed to adopt such a standard instead ofrelying on a less satisfactory type of interior lightingwhich was not dependent on the use of blinds.(6) The Secretary of State for Air said that, if any change wasto be made in the system of street lighting, he would favour a dual system by which a secondary circuit of higher lighting could be extinguished on an air-raid warning. He would feel bound to advise against thealternative put forward in the Report of raising to&quot; . - 002-foot candles the street lighting which would remainalight during air raids. Street lighting of this intensitywouldI&quot;be visible from the air at considerable distances,,and would provide a useful navigational aid to enemy aircraft.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the dual system, while it would have had great advan-tagesif it had been installed earlier in the war, must nowv\ be regarded as impracticable Because of the high cost ofinstallation, in terms of labour Thelabour cost, in particular, made it impracticable toundertake theiristallatioh of such a system at
There were similar difficulties (apart from thesecurity objections-to a higher standardextending; the installation^of^street&apos;lighting designed tobe left on during air raids: Andy apart from and materialsinvolved, theI installation of street&quot;lightinginlareas;-where there was none at present would meanadditional1 fuel consumption.In these circumstances, it &quot;was suggested that itWould be preferable to concentrate on improving thesupply of torches (and batteries) for pedestrians,, andhead-lamps (and batteries) for pedal cyclists,(c); Further consideration might. also; he given to&apos; the provisionof a better driving light for lorries and motor, cars. Itmight be practicable to amend the specification so as ;t0provide for a wider spread of light. Further, meansmight also be found for ensuring that the owners of car sand lorries.took full advantage, by keeping the masksproperly adjusted and otherwise, of the existing regulations.The War Cabinet- ; ;(1) Approved the Committee&apos;s recommendations as regardsindustrial lighting, railway lighting and the interiorlighting of public service vehicles.(2) Agreed that the installation of a dual system of street lighting must in present circumstances be regarded as, impracticable, in view of its cost in terms of labour and&apos;. materials. M(3) Decided that for the present no action should be taken witha view to raising the standard of existing street lightingor arranging for its installation, at a higher standard, in areas where it has not hitherto been installed.(4) Invited the Committee to consider, and report, what further action could be taken to ensure-^- .(i) an adequate supply of torches (and batteries) forpedestpians;. (ii) an adequate supply of head-lamps (and batteries)for pedal cyclists;(iii) an improved performance for the head-lights of motor cars and lorries.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,January 11, 1943.
