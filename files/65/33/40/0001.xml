(43) 38thConclusions,&apos; ;Minute 1.)Air Operations.Home Theatre.TheChiefs ofpasteek.Staff reported the principal events; of theMediterranean.Tunisia.       &apos;naval operations.Mediterranean.Military-Operations.Burma.Tunisia.Bussia.Bomber Command had carried out four big night attacks- onNuremberg, Munich Stuttgart; and Essen. The raid on Essen hadbeen outstandingly good and the effect of the damage had been tQbring the work at Krupps virtually to a standstill. 3*200 tons of bombs had been dropped during the week. Coastal Command had made two promising attacks on U-boats. Enemy losses for the weekhad been 49 destroyed,, &amp; probably destroyed and 31 damaged. our losses had been 61 bombers, 19 fighters and 1 Coastal command aircraft.&quot; &quot;American bombers.had carried out attacks on railway targets at Amiens, Rouen and Rennes.The Prime Minister said he thought that we should be preparedfor the enemy attempting to increase the scale of bombing attacks on this country. .Some 20 enemy vessels of varying sizes, including one 9,000-tontanker, had been hit in the Mediterranean.In Tunisia the balance of air fighting had been in our favour.Shipping losses for the previous week amounted to 180,000 tons.This figure included the Empress of Canada and the California.In the Mediterranean we had lost a destroyer, the submarineTigress and the minesweeper ,A. bbeville.   .It was estimated that, of the enemy shipping which had sailedwith supplies to Tunisia in the previous week, one-third had arrived, one-third had been sunk for certain and the remaining-third had been torpedoed, but its fate was uncertain.Our operations directed against Akyab had been hampered bythe nature of the country and wastage amongst the troops. TheJapanese had been reinforced in this area and were now trying tomove round our eastern flank. The results so far obtained weredisappointing. On the other hand, a brigade despatched towardsthe line of the Irrawaddy had succeeded in doing great damage tothe railway running north from Mandalay.Enemy attacks had slackened throughout Tunisia, save in theTamera area in the north, where three attacks had been made onthe 11th March. These had all been unsuccessful and a number ofprisoners had been taken. On the 14th March we had launched alocal attack with the object of clearing the enemy from some high ground east of Tamera, but this had so far been only partiallysuccessful.In the south an enemy column had attacked Fighting french forces On the 10th March and forced them to withdraw; but, with assistance from the R.A.F., the position had been restored on thefollowing day.On the Russian front the thaw was limiting military operations in most sectors.; Enemy counter-attacks against Kharkov had made considerable progress, particularly from the west; and the enemyclaimed that the bulk of the city was now in their hands. It seemed unlikely; however, that the enemy, had succeeded in establishingany bridgeheads across the Donetz. It was probable that thegreater part of their strategic: reserve had been employed in thiscounter-attack.On the Taman Peninsula weather conditions had delayed theRussian advance; owing to this respite, the enemy might succeed in evacuating a higher proportion of their troops than had at onetime seemed likely.The War Cabinet- ..   -, Took note of these statements;[25170;
 &quot;peiich North * 2. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for*&apos;ForeignAMoa.:; Affairs &quot;said&apos; -that&apos; G*neraiVGiraud&apos;s:. speech, broadcast from AlgiersGeneral de the previous day, afforded a basis for agreement between General-Gaulle and Giraud and the French National Committee. Of four conditionsGeneral Giraud indicated by the Committee, this speech satisfied two in full and((Previous went some considerable Way towards &quot;/meeting the others. So far,Reference: however, General de GaUllefs reactions to the speech had not beenWM. (43) 37th very encouraging. It might be helpful if an Anglo-AmericanConclusions, statement were issued, welcoming General Giraud^ declarationMinute and making it clear that, in the view of the British and UnitedStates Governments, there was no difference of principle betweenthe aims of General Giraud and those of the French national committee. 1     . .The Lord Privy Seal said that there might be a debate.in theHouse of Lords on the following day, on a Motion by LordWedgwood, on the military and political situation in North Africa.It was agreed that, if an Anglo-American statement on general giraud&apos;s&apos;s declaration was likely to be issued within the next fewdays, it would be preferable if this debate could be postponed. TheLord Privy Seal undertook to see whether this could be arranged. &quot;;    The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should be invited to propose to the United  states authorities  in  Washington  the  issue of  an  Anglo-American statement on the lines suggested.Newfoundland. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (43) 102) onNewfoundland. The Secretary of State, in his Memorandum,pointed out that, under the terms of the arrangement made in 1933,we were pledged to restore self-government to Newfoundland, if sorequested, when the island was once more financially self-supporting. As a result of war conditions, this state of affairsnow obtained, and at the end of the war we should probably be facedwith a demand for the restoration of self-government. On the otherhand, the people in Newfoundland were hardly politically ripe forthe control of their own affairs.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs was anxious that .Parliamentary opinion should be better informed about Newfound-land, and proposed that a Mission composed of three Members ofParliament should be sent to the island this summer.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to sound the Governor as to the despatch of a Mission on thelines proposed, and, if he concurred, to proceed with the selection of Members.Services.Tiectures byMr. D. N. Pritt.(previous reference:WM, (42) 75th/Conclusions,Minute 4.)4. The War Cabinet were informed that Mr. D. N. Pritt,K.C., M.P., had written a number of letters to the Prime Ministerand to the Secretaries of State for War and Air enquiring whetherthe Government had imposed a ban on his lecturing to the troops.the Secretary of State for A ir-said that, prior to the decisionof the War Cabinet in June last, Mr. Pritt had delivered somelectures at Royal Air Force Stations to which no objection could betaken.
TheWar Cabinet reached the following conclusions:- -(1) All Departments should adopt the same attitude on this&quot;: matter, and facilities for lecturing &apos;tq members of His. . Majesty&apos;s Forces should continue to be withheld fromMr. Pritt.-(2) Mr. Pritt should be informed, in reply to enquiries, that&quot;a person who had taken so prominent a part inadvocating opposition to the war could not expect to be;given facilities .to lecture to His Majesty&apos;s Forces.   Itshould be made clear that the decision reached was adecision of His Majesty V Government.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,March 15, 1943.
