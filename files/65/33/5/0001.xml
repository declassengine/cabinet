1.;--The Secretary of State, for War.explained the two types of\ educational work in the Army. The first consisted of classes onaao technical subjects and lectures by more or less trainededucationalists on topics of general interest. In this connectionlectures to the troops on the Beveridge Report were being encouraged, provided that they Were objective. The second wasunder the aegis of ABC.A; The Bureau issued in alternateweeksbulletins called &apos;&apos; War &quot; and &apos;&apos; Current Affairs &apos;&apos; to regimentaloffices, and the troops attended a discussion, initiated and guided by the officer, on a subject contained in the bulletin. Attendance atthis was compulsory, I ...: About ten days ago it had come to his notice that an article bySir William Beveridge on his Report had been included inCurrent Affairs.&quot; In his view it was undesirable that a matterof political controversy should be the subject of discussion at a debate, attendance at which was Compulsory. In the circumstances he had given orders that the article, which rather took for granted that the recommendations in the Beveridge Report would be putinto force by the end of the war, should be withdrawn. There hadbeen no time for consultation with any other Ministers.The Secretary of State for War added that, while he was clear that withdrawal of the article at this late stage was preferable to allowing the arrangements for the issue of the article and for the debate to proceed, the matter should not have gone so far without this having been consulted. He was enquiring into this aspect ofthe matter.The War Cabinet took note of this statement, and agreed that the Secretary of State for War should be supported in his decision that the Beveridge Report wasnot a suitable subject for discussion at debates held underthe aegis of A.B.C.A., at any rate for the time being.Parliamentary 2. The War Cabinet discussed Parliamentary business on theBusiness. reassembly of Parliament, and agreed on the following(Previous       arrangements:-House of Commons. .(i) A statement on the war situation should be made on theday that Parliament reassembled (Tuesday, the19th January). As there was not much to add to thestatement made by the Prime Minister on the11th November, 1942, the statement need be of no greatlength, and there was no reason why it should be debated.(ii) Man-Power Debate (Wednesday and Thursday, 20th and21st January).  This Debate would be held in Secret.The Minister of Labour and National Service would open the Debate, and the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministry of Labour would reply to points affectinghis Department at the conclusion of the first day.The Lord President of the Council would wind upthe Debate on behalf of the Government on the secondday. -(iii) Post-War Finance and Economics.Following the suggestion made by the Chancellor. of the Exchequer in a recent Debate on War finance and Borrowing Policy, a two-day Debate should be heldearly in February. The Chancellor of the exchequer would speak early on ;the first day. The President ofthe Board of Trade would speak on the second day, andwould deal with matters5 affecting the re-establishmentof our export trade after the war.(The War Cabinet should have a general discussion on our post-war financial position before this Debatetook place.)        &apos;-Reference:  ./W.M.(42)120thConclusions,Minute 1.)
(iv) Beveridge Report.- Mr. Whiteley said that the LabourParty, who at one time had pressed for a Debate on the beveridge Report in January, were now content that itshould take place, say, in the third week of February.It was pointed out that this would allow time forconsideration by. Ministers of- the Report on the beveridge scheme which had heen prepared byi aCommittee of Officials: \ : -(v) Suggested Rebuilding of the Chamber. &apos;\v It was agreed that the question of putting down a- Motion to set up a Select Committee to examine plans and to report to the House, should be deferred for a short time and taken up later on.House of Lords.The Lord Privy Seal said that Lord Vansittart had putdown a Motion for the 26th January calling for a statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government on their policy towardsGeneral de Gaulle and the Fighting French and the representa-tives of Vichy respectively.The War Cabinet agreed that Lord Vansittart&apos;s attention should be drawn to the fact that General Giraud had now agreed to meet General, de Gaulle early in February, and thatin these circumstances a Debate on this Motion would be undesirable. If the Motion was not withdrawn, it should be debated in Secret.The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to a Motion by the bishop of Chichester calling attention to passages inM. Stalin&apos;s speech on the 6th November which distinguishedbetween Germany &quot; which it is impossible to destroy &quot; .and &quot;the Hitlerite State which can and should be destroyed,&quot;and asking whether the Government made the same distinctionin their war aims.   .      .The War Cabinet agreed that it was not possible tomaintain a complete distinction between the Hitlerite Stateand the German people, more especially when regard was paidto the atrocities inflicted under German occupation upon theJews and the people of occupied territories.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,January 8, 1943.

subject the   Chancellor of the Exchequer.   He read aletter dated 85th November, 1942, from Lord Herbert,Comptroller to the Duchess, putting the case for some provision being made by the State for the Duchess.   Theposition was that the  85,000 a year which the Duke received under the Civil List (80$ of which had been treated as taxfree under the Treasury ruling) ceased to be paid at the duke&apos;s death, and the Duchess now received nothing from theState.The Duke had been left considerable fortunes, out ofwhich he had provided Trusts for his three children.   Butthe income payable to the Duchess was subject to taxation,and (even after drawing upon the moneys in trust for herchildren for their upkeep and education ) she would nothave sufficient resources to be able to maintain an establishment such as she would require if she was to playher part in the public life of the country.   The PrimeMinister felt strongly that some action should be taken which would enable her to do so.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explained that thepoint he had had in mind throughout was that no action should be taken which could possibly reflect unfavourablyon the Roy al PiuDBdly.The Select Committee of 1889 (in a Report which ledto the Prince  of ^ales^Childre^s Act, 1889) had laiddown the principle that the children of the daughters andyounger sons of the Sovereign had no claim to provision

,;. . \ ,  .   - &apos;        0-&apos;&apos;- -i - /Cm&apos;: V:i.. - B - - . - Iyounger son cj-fKing G-0o5?ge y should c^ase to^b e paid ontne son s deaths   i*e., it excluded the survivorship*of thefldicwr ^&apos;-ffell;l^::of the children.   Thisi principle had been repeated in the Re of the Select Committee and theCivil  ist Acts on the accession of King Edward VIII and king George VI.establishedSince the principle wasytha.t there was no Stateprovision   for the widow and children of younger sons,the Civil List was framed so   as to enable the Royal Familyto make the necessary provision for them.   In this way,repeated requests to Parliament for additional grants tomeet individual cases would be avoided.If some further sum was required to supplement theDuchess of Kent1 s income, there was, therefore, nothinginappropriate in that sum being provided by re-allocation,as a private arrangement, of some of the grants made toother members of the Royal Family.If it was desired to obtain a grant from parliament by way of addition to the Civil List, the procedure-wouldbe for the King to send a Message to Parliament asking forsuch provision to be made, and a Select Committee would thenbe appointed to consider this request.   It was understoodthat His Majesty did not propose to suggest this course.In discussion, mention  was made of the following alternative methods of dealing with   the situation, whichhad been examined:- ,(l)/The possibility had been considered of introducing a Bill to enable Trust funds to be used for eurrentpurposes o   It appeared that in 1941 a Private Bill   Ihad been promoted by the Trustees of the ScarisbrookEstate tQ enable the Court to sanction   the raising of capital for income purposes.   The Bill had been   jreferred to two   Chancery Judges, who had reported

Agaitast it, on the ground that it raised a questioni^d^t witJ^   should he theffi?4eet of^a[0;eneralv Aet*   The matter had since been  examined from this wider point of ;view. andit seemed clear   that ieg^        f^r this purplewould! not be favourably!reeeiveA4 x-C2); A^^i^^^ges tion had b e^en that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, under Sche\duie EMtuies 9 iand ID ofthe Income iTttxAct, 19is;^should^ex^^tji from taxation, say,  5,000   of^he Ddchessfs income.TH^ OH^CELLOR   OP THE EXCHEQUER explained thathis. powers under these Rules were limited to public funds and did not extend to private income.(3) A further alternative was that a grant should bemade by the Prime Minister from   the Special ServiceFund.   This, however, would not be appropriate,since the Fund was not intended for continuinggrants.   It mights also be felt by the Royal Familythat it was a somewhat undignified proceeding toaccept a grant from this Fund.In discussion   at the War Cabinet, two points weremade:-(a) THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE CQCNOIL, dealing withsuggestion (2) above, said that since the income from the capital in the DuchessVs possession wasderived, in part at any rate, from accumulationsfrom previous Civil Lists, it could be argued that some part of her income could fairly beregarded as derived from public funds and couldthereby appropriately be declared free of incometax by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   this could be supported on grounds of equity, seeing that the Duke of Kentjbad been granted  SO,000 ayear free of tax for   the expenses of himself and his wifet   and clearly some part of this amount would be required by his widow, after his death,to cover the expenses of her position.   He thoughtthat this way of dealing with the question mightbe worth examination.(b) It was suggested that if the matter were now to bebrought to the notice of Parliament, the view would very likely be taken that the real trouble layin the way in which the Duke*s fortune had been settled;   and opinion might well be favourable to the granting of powers to amend the terms ofthe settlement.Summing up the diS cussion, THE PRIME MINISTER saidthat in his view the root question was whether the british people ceased to be under an obligation to make any provision for   the; Duchess the inpment;her husband died*He taught there was only one answer whic^ could b   givento this question, and he W48j most; anxious that; a way should

&quot;be found out&apos;of the difficulty.   He thought it would be., *She -mus^t-t^ of ,thfe--Roysli.
