The War Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments:  &apos;&quot; :(a) A letter, dated the 1st January, 1943, from the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Canada to the Dominions Office.This letter referred to previous&apos;telegrams, of which the upshot was as follows :-(i)(ii)The Canadian Government wished to know theviews of the United Kingdom Governmentsmilitary advisers on the German demand that prisoners should not be shackled on the battle-field.The Canadian Government would have no objectionif the United Kingdom Government were pre-pared to give a spontaneous assurance that we wished to confirm that prisoners of war should not\ be shackled even on the field of battle.&apos;(iii) Alternatively, the Canadian Government suggestedthat we might now submit the question;fordiscussion under Article 7 of the Geneva Conven-tion, with a neutral Chairman. ,(b) A Memorandum (W.P. (43) 4) setting out the main public statements already made by His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton this matter.The main points made in discussion were as follows   -(1) We should, as far as possible, confine our reply to areaffirmation of the attitude whlek we had .already taken (up; \(2)The Minister of &quot;AircraftF^odyMio^&apos; 4sM. that it was important tomake clear thatt there&apos;-could^ be no justifica-tion for the action of the german Government inmanacling of Britisli prisoners;(3) Mr.  Brii$e  gave instances emphasising  the. absolutenecessity for^tyjLpg the:certain circumstances.The W^ Cabinet jagreed as follows:--he  Secretary oStateforforeign ;\ i^Aii?s..-.;.:&apos;w^lthorised to despatch a reply \to the Swiss Government
, of State for War and,-theProduction. * i;&apos;^The main ljnes of the reply should be as follows;--&apos;1       His Majesty&apos;s GrOverm^of the message transmitted by the Swiss Goyerzinlteii^Bi^the request.of the German Governmen^t about tbJetyihgof hands of prisoners of war. *HisMajesty&apos;s Government desire to point out to- the Swiss Government that, whatever allegations theGerman Government may make as to actions taken byBritishsoldiers on thej Geld, of battle, these can providieno possible justification for the manacling of british prisoners in the hands of the German Government.Under Article 2 of the Geneva Convention the treatmentof prisoners as hostages, and their subjection to punish-ment for matters as to which they have no responsibility- .     whatever, is expressly forbidden.His Maj esty&apos; s Government&apos;s position in this matter had been clearly stated by the Prime Minister in theHouse of Commons on the 13th October, when he had, stated that they had never countenanced any general order for the tying up of prisoners on the/field of battle.Such a process might, however, be necessary from timeto time under stress of circumstances, and might, indeed,be in the best interest of the safety of the prisonersthemselves. To this statement His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have nothing to add.(III) The above reply .should be sent to the Canadian Govern-ment for their observations before being despatched tothe Protecting Power.(IV) The Canadian Government should also be informed (a) That we were not prepared to submit the question for discussion under Article 7 of the geneva convention : the position of German prisoners inour hands could at any time be ascertained by the protecting Power.(b) That the views of our military advisers as to theshackling of prisoners on the field of battle were as stated by the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons on the 13th October (see (II) above).Parliament. 7.
