The War Cabinet were informed that General de- GaulleAMoa., had asked for facilities to visit Free French troops in Africa andGeneral de the Middle East. When it had been suggested to him informallyGaulle and by Mr. Peake that this was not a suitable moment1 to make this general Giraud, journey, he had asked whether he was/ to regard -himself ;as a prisoner(Previous in this&apos;&apos;country,&quot; had repektedhisrequest for these facilities,&apos; ah hadBeference:        asked for an officialrJaply:to .W.M.(43)i^th        The War Cab^ of theConclusions, United Nations as a whole, itvwas undesirable that General de GaulleMinute 2.) should leave this country while the relations between the French&apos;National Committee and General Giraud&apos;s Committee remajnedin their present unsettled state. As General de Gaulle had been unwilling to listen to the informal advice in- this sense which hadalready been tendered to him, it was desirable that it should&apos;nowbe made Clear to him that facilities for such a journey woulddefinitely be withheld. It would be necessary to take specialsecurity measures to ensure that he did not leave the country under his own arrangements. It was to be expected that he would seek tomake trouble over the refusal of these facilities, and the Press shouldbe given guidance regarding the need for discretion in handling anyprotests which he might make...:&apos;.&apos; The War Cabinefs conclusions were asfollows :-r(1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform general de Gaulle, by way of a formal note deliveredthrough M. Massigli, that his request for facilities to visit the Free French troops in Africa and the middle east had been carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. It was the considered view of the Govern-ment that, in the interests of the United Nations as. awhole, it Was undesirable that General de Gaulle should, make this journey at the present juncture, while th$relations between the French National Committee andthe Committee under General Giraud remained in theirpresent unsettled state, and they would prefer that itshould be deferred, at any rate, until General Catrouxhad established his liaison mission in North Africa. Inthese circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government were notat present prepared to accord the facilities, for which general de Gaulle had asked:(2) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home j Security .should: . consider what special security, measures were requiredto ensure that General de Gaulle would not leave thiscountry, under his own arrangements.(3) The MinisterlOflnformatioh should give general guidance to newspaper editors regarding the representations which general de Gaulle was likely to make against thisdecision^Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.March 3, 1943.-&apos;&quot;;-.-y
