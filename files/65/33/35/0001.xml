As,u however, three Indian non-official members of the Council had recently resigned and difficult issues of law and order Were likelyto arise during the nextyear, the Viceroy felt that in. present circum-stances the best course would be to ask] Sir Reginald Maxwell tocontinue in office for another twelve months. The Secretary of Statesupported the Viceroy&apos;s recommendation.In discussion, the question was raised whether Sir ReginaldMaxwell was sufficiently vigorous, in mind and body, to undertake afurther year, of office. Even if the Viceroy were satisfied as to: Sir Reginald Maxwell&apos;s present capacity, it might not be necessaryto give a full year&apos;s extension, particularly as this would extend beyond the period of office of the present Viceroy.The War Cabinet-, Agreed in principle that the term of office of Sir ReginaldMaxwell, as Home Member of the Government of India,should be extended for a further period (not necessarily fora full twelve months) if the Viceroy were satisfied that hewas sufficiently vigorous, in mind and body, to undertake this further period of duty.Supplies to 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSrassia. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (43) 85) covering a noteAir Protection from the Soviet Ambassador about the proposal to send R.A.F.of Convoys. squadrons to North Russia for the protection of convoys. -(previous reference The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theWM (43)33rd Russians had accepted the original plan, which involved sendingConclusions     400-500 R.A.F. personnel to operate these squadrons. Subsequently,&apos;Minute 1)&apos;    tne ^r Ministry had found that larger numbers would be required,and at this stage the Russians had raised difficulties. He had thenexplained the position fully to M. Maisky, who had promised to do what he could to help.   M. Maisky had now, however, suggestedthat, in view of the difficulties of finding accommodation, the- proposal to send the R.A.F. squadrons should be abandoned; that* - the air protection Of convoys should be undertaken by the Soviet AirForce; and that for this purpose we should hand over to the SovietGovernment the aircraft which we had proposed to operate ourselvesfrom North Russia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he. intendedto see M. Maisky and to tell him firmly that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could not entertain this proposal. He would explain thedifficulties of operating this air protection of convoys and would show that, because of the technical problems, the need for. close co-operation with the British naval authorities, &amp;c, it would be quite impossible for the Russians to operate these aircraft. Hewould give a full statement of all the losses incurred up to date in; ; the;cdhvoys, and would emphasise that, as bur ships and the lives ofour sailors were at stake; we must retain-the responsibility for their protection. ^&quot;He^should end &apos;by- pressing his request&quot;&apos; for the grant oftb4) hecedsary.:faoilities:fpr: sendi^:-tibj^.^iiad^b Vtp Nbi^Ruaaiar&apos;and would say that, if these were wit forfced to. review the whole question of continuing the convoys.; iv&quot;-&apos;

(43)53) outlining the recommendations made by an inter--i.    Departmental Committee, appointed,, under the Chairmanship of;.   Lord Brabazon, to consider the new types of aircraft needed for post-war air transport, ;the conversion of existing types as an interim measure, and the possibility of using spare design and productive &quot;capacity without interference with war production.This Committee had recommended immediate action to design- v:    certain new types; and, as an interim measure, to &quot; jig and tool&quot;for the production of transport versions of certain existing militarytypes.The Ministers stated, in their Memorandum, that they were considering the extent to which design staffs and other resources-could be transferred to this civil work, and would submit recommendations to the War Cabinet in due course. Meanwhile,however, discussions were to be opened with the Dominion and united States Governments about the organisation of air transportafter the war; and it seemed important that Ministers conductingthose discussions should be able to assert from the outset that theUnited Kingdom intends to play, and will have the resources toplay, a big part in post-war air transport. The War Cabinet were therefore invited  -.   (i) to record a decision that British air transport after the.,- .       war shall be on a scale and quality in keeping with ourf .     //-world.position, and that work on the design of new types of civil aircraft and the conversion of existing militarytypes shall proceed under the direction of the Govern-ment as and when this can be done without impairingV ... the war effort; andI (ii): to accept financial responsibility for the initiation of a programme of civil aviation upon a basis adequate toprOvide a minimum number of essential types of aircraft in the immediate post-war period.It was explained in the Memorandum that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, while in general agreement with these proposals,could not at this stage accept a commitment in principle that theproduction of aircraft for civil transport afer the war will necessarily be financed from public funds. He therefore wished to- be consulted,&apos; in the case of new types, before any expenditure was incurred beyond the&apos; prototype stage and, in the case of convertedmilitary aircraft, before orders were placed for aircraft unlikely to be used in support of the war effort./      Points raised in discussion were :&apos;-*(a) Attention was. drawn to the. importance of framing our&apos;.*.:-, &quot;&apos;: %bii(?y with a view to maintaining a substantial aircraftr      industry after the war.

It would, inhisview^be impossible to persuside ---the1various firms to combine in carrying through the necessary preparatory work unless they could-be satisfied that production ofprototypes would be followed by: brders for substantial*i numbers Of aircraft, and that the Government intendedto see that out civil aviation after the war was effectively: organised&apos;&apos; on the basis&apos; of the types fibw proposed.(c) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wasnot at present proposing to initiate discussions with theUnited States Government in this matter; and, if thequestion were raised by the Americans, he would not wish to go so far as was suggested in paragraph 6 of w.P. (43) 83. He would prefer to content himself withmaking clear (i) that we were discussing the wholequestion in all its implications with Dominion Govern-ments; (ii) that, as soon as these had progressedsufficiently, we should like to hold discussions with the United States authorities; and (iii) that we were engagedin planning a programme for the post-war constructionof civil aircraft. . ,   . ;(d) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had had no opportiinty to consider the types of civil aircraftrequired for internal services&apos; in Colonial territories.There might be heed for a smaller type, in addition tothat mentioned in paragraph 2 (v) of W.P. (43) 83. Hewould pursue his enquiries 1 and would communicatefurther with the Minister of Aircraft Production.(e) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that additional types might also be required for internal&quot;       services in the Dominions; and we should not exclude the possibility of enlarging the list of types with a viewto meeting Dominion needs.- t!&apos;;4K; &apos;&apos;&apos; 1It was recognised, however, that we. should need forour own purposes all the various types listed inparagraphs 2 and 3 of W;.Pi, (43) $3; and^that we should proceed with, plans for the production of those typeswithout prejudice to, the,, possible, manufacture ofi additional: types required for, use inthie (Dominions and colonial territories. ,The War, Cabinet-(1) Decidedrthat work, on the deMg^bf hew types of civil&apos;.&apos;-,&apos;^cir*ft;!i^d oh; We convbrsipn df existing military types,... .&apos; &apos;^hpuldprofeiduhdier;GbVerhnient direction as and when this can he done without im(2) Agreed, th^t, while there could be no financial commitmentsat, this stage be^onp&quot;&apos; those involved in (1) above, theGovernments pbjeotiveih Arranging for this preliminary work! was to. rsecure :The production after the war office$ritish.frahspprt;ai^CTa^ft^ civil- and military, bri a scaleahd quality in&apos; keeping with&apos;b&apos;ur world position&apos;.
