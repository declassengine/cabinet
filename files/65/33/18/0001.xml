CasablancaConference.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 17thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet had a discussion on a matter arising outof this Conference. A record of the discussion and Of theConclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions. - - &apos;-[r&quot;-Prisoners ofWar.(previous reference:W.M (43) 16thConclusions,Minute 5.) . -2.. The War Cabinet were informed that, after consultationwith the War Office, Lieutenant-General Stuart, Chief of theCanadian General Staff, now shared the view of the militaryauthorities in this country that it was necessary to reserve a rightto bind prisoners immediately after capture. He thought it unlikelythat the Canadian Government would be influenced by an expression of the military view only; but, if a further approach was to be madeto them by His Majesty&apos;s Government in this country, he would be willing to send a separate telegram supporting.such an approach on military grounds.Discussion then turned on the question whether.the reply to the swiss Government should follow the lines agreed by the WarCabinet on the 4th January, or whether it should take the form of the revised draft embodied in W.P. (43) 38. The general feeling oftlieWar Cabinet was that there was little hope that, in whicheverform.it was cast, the reply would induce the German Governmentto abandon the position which they had taken up in this matter,and the revised draft was the more likely, to provoke furtherarguments on points of interpretation,. In these circumstances, itwas thought that it would be preferable to adhere to the terms ofthe original draft, which had been communicated to the canadian government in Dominions Office telegram No. 8, dated the12th January, 1943. -The War Cabinefs Conclusions were as follows : :(1) The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff would at onceascertain whether General Stuart would be prepared to telegraph to the Canadian Government reporting theresults of his conversations with the War Office and supporting on military grounds the proposal to reply tOthe Swiss Government in the terms of the draftcommunicated to the Canadian Government on the12th January.(2) As soon as it was known whether General Stuart wouldtelegraph in this sense, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should telegraph to the canadian government emphasising the importance of sending anearly reply to the Swiss Government and stressing theadvantages of a reply on the lines of the draft already communicate to them. In particular, it should be explained that there could be no compromise between a reply on these lines and complete acceptance of theconditions which the German Government had sought toimpose; and that no change in the wording of the reply would prevent the German Government from repudiatingthe Geneva Convention if they now desired to do so.(3) Subject to any further comments from the canadian government, the reply to the Swiss Government should then be despatched in the terms of the original draft, so-that an announcement of the latest, developments couldbe made in the House of Commons early in the following week.
65W.M. 18 (43).3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred .&apos; to the forth-coming Debate on Post-War Finance and Economics.The Chancellor said that he was having discussions with theMinisters concerned as to the general line which he proposed to take in his speech. There was, however, one point of general importance which he desired to bring to the notice of the War Cabinet, namely,that he proposed to foreshadow the continuance of measures ofcontrol for some time after the cessation of hostilities. He would confer with the Lord President and the Foreign Secretary upon other matters.The War Cabinet- \ &quot;Took note, with approval, of the Chancellors proposals.Parliament. 4.   The Lord Privy Seal informed the War Cabinet thatMotion in the Lord Hankey had put down a Motion &quot; To call attention to theHouse of Lords present position of the U-boat campaign, and to move for Papers.&quot;on Anti-U-boat Judging from particulars which Lord Hankey had given of theWarfare. matters which he proposed to raise, the Lord Privy Seal thoughtthat the debate on this Motion would have to take place in secret session.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view.Catering Wages 5. The Minister of Labour and National Service said that heBm* had considered, in the light of the discussion at the War Cabinefs(Previous        meeting on the previous day, how far the procedure Under Clause 4Reference:       of the Catering Wages Bill could be assimilated to that prescribedW.M. (43) 17th  in the First Schedule to the Trade Boards Act, 1918.Conclusions, The Minister now suggested that Clause 4 (2) of the Bill should minute 2.) be so amended as to require the Commission (i) to &quot;make suchinvestigations as they consider necessary &quot; before publishing theterms of their proposed recommendation; and (ii), after considering any written representations made to them within the prescribed period, to . &quot;make such further enquiries as they considered necessary &quot; before submitting their recommendation to the Minister.This wording left it to the discretion of the Commission to decide how the enquiries should be made at the second stage. these enquiries would be made after public notice and after consideringwritten representations; and it would be open to the Commission,in a suitable case, to proceed at this stage by way of a public enquiry.In view, however, of the delays which public enquiries might involve,he was anxious to avoid suggesting that, during the period of thewar at any rate, the Commission would normally follow the courseof holding a public enquiry.The Lord President said that, while the alterations now suggested did not fully meet the points made in the War Cabinet&apos;discussion on the previous day, he agreed that frequent recourse tothe procedure of public enquiry would not be appropriate under war conditions, and in these circumstances he was prepared tosupport the procedure now suggested on the ground that a sufficientsafeguard was provided by the provision enabling Orders made bythe Minister to be challenged and debated in Parliament.In discussion, it was suggested that Clause 15 of the Bill mightbe amended so as to provide that these Orders should not have effect until approved by affirmative Resolutions of both Houses of Parlia-ment. It was pointed out that this would involve a significantdeparture from the precedents of the Trade Boards Acts. If, afterthe bill&apos;s introduction, there were strong pressure for further/ safeguards, it might be preferable to include some provision for public enquiries ratherthan affirmative Resolutions. But this point was best left for consideration when the strength of Parliamentaryfeeling was known.Parliament.Debate oh   -Post-WarFinance andEconomics.(previous references:W.M.
