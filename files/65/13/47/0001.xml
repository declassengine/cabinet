TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.W.M. (40)  17^TH CONCLUSIONS.  MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(22nd June, 1940 - 9.30 p,mc)THE FIRST SEA LORD gave the following information regarding the present dispositions of theFrench and British Fleets:-French ships.(i) RICHELIEU, the most powerful battleshipafloat in the world today, had sailedwith a full crew and ammunition forDakar, where she was expected to arrivevery shortly0    She was not yet worked up,but all her armament was complete.(ii) JEAN BART,  the other modern battleship,was proceeding to Casablanca, where she would shortly arrive.    She was not complete and probably had no fighting value atall at present.(iii) The two battle-cruisers DUNKIRK andSTRASBOURG were at Oran.(iv) Of the French 8&quot; cruisers, part were atToulon.    Two were at Alexandria withthe British Fleet and v/ere to have sailedin company with them for operations in theMediterranean early this morning.    this operation had, however, been cancelled inorder that the two French cruisers mightbe kept safe in harbour under control ofthe British Fleet.British Ships.(v) H.M.S.  HOOD, H. M.S. ARK ROYAL and four destroyers v/ere now some 200 miles west of Gibraltar,    The destroyers v/ould haveto come i,n there to refuel, and H, M. S. HOODwould probably have to do the samebefore moving down to the Dakar area,(vi) H.M.S.  RESOLUTION and H.M.S.  DORSETSHIREwere at Gibraltar and had been ordered toraise steam.    Six destroyers at Gibraltarhad also been ordered to immediatereadiness.A signal had just been received from theBritish Naval Liaison Officer at Blzerta stating that information had been received from a French source thata committee of four Admirals including AdmiralAbrial and Admiral Estave.had been appointed

by Admiral Darlan to take charge in the event ofhis not being permitted to continue to function,These Admirals had been enjoined by admiral darlan to carry out his original orders that theFleet was to fight to a finish;    that thedefended ports v/ere to be held against theenemy;    and that the fleet v/as not to accept any orders from a foreign Government.TrE FIRST SEA LORD expressed the viewthat this information was in accordance with admiral Darlanfs previous assurances and showed that he had taken all possible steps to safeguard our interests.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in a matterso vital to the safety of the whole BritishEmpire we could not afford to rely on the word of admiral Darlan.    However   good his intentions mightbe, he might be forced to resign and his placetaken by another Minister v/ho would not shrink frombetraying us.    The most important thing to do v/asto make certain of the two modern battleshipsRICHELIEU and JEAN BART.    If these fell into thehands.-of the Germans,  they would have a veryformidable line of battle when the BISMARCK wascommissioned next August-,    Against these fast andpowerful ships v/e should&apos;only have NELSON,  RODNEYand the older battleships like VALIANTo    STRASBOURGand DUNKIRK would certainly be a great nuisance ifthey fell into the hands of the enemy, but it wasthe two modern ships which might alter the wholecourse of the war.    Oran v/as a strongly defended&apos;harbour and it would be very difficult to sink thetwo battle-cruisers behind such strong defences,.It was most unfortunate that we had not been ableto catch them at sea.    He enquired v/hat action could be taken to make sure of RICHELIEU andJEAN BART.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that Dakar, whereRICHELIEU would be, was a strongly defended harbourcovered by 9.4&quot; guns and v/ith all its defencesmodernised.    The defences of Casablanca were weak.,but there would not be room to use torpedo planesagainst a ship in the harbour.    Bombardment byships5 guns v/ould be difficult, since the shipwould be protected on one side by the mole.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at all costsRICHELIEU and JEAN BART,  particularly the former,must not be allowed to get loose.    It would havebeen better if v/e could have put our own shipsalongside them on the high seas in order to opena parley with their captains, but this must now bedone when the ships were in harbourc A strong force must be&quot;sent and RICHELIEU should be dealt with first.    If the captains refused   to parley, theymust be treated as traitors to the Allied cause,, Theships mighv- have to be bombed by aircraft fromARK ROYAL or they must be mined into their harbours and nava J. forces stationed outside to prevent theminefields, being swept up.    In no circumstanceswhateCover must these ships be allowed to escape.THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION suggestedthat an appeal should be sent immediately to admiral Darlan asking him to send a personal orderto the shipsf captains to sail their ships toBritish ports.

THE PRIME MINISTER doubted whether thiswould be of much use,.,      Admiral Darlan would neve;:.- beallowed by the present French Government to despatchsuch a message.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that we should exhaust every means of persuasionbefore using force..     He therefore suggested that atthis stage we should concentrate all our efforts on making the parleys a success0     We should select as ourenvoy for these a naval counterpart of General de Gaulle.Concurrently we should foster the sympathy for theAllies which we had reason to believe now existed in theFrench Navy by feeding it with the right kind of propaganda,THE PRIME MINISTER agreed but stressed that wemust at all times keep in view our main object, whichwas that in no circumstances must we run the mortal r-is^of allowing these ships to fall into the hands of theenemy0      Rather than that, we should have to fight andsink them,THE FIRST SEA LORD pointed out that whateverproposals we might make in our parleys, the Captainsof the ships would inevitably refer them to AdmiralEstava at Oran, with whom the ships were in wirelesscommunication,.     No French Captain would act on hisown responsibility in such a matter.      It was, therein e.,of paramount importance to send some one to AdmiralEstavay who was in command of all the French naval forces in the Mediterranean,      If we were successful in winning him to our side, we might get r.ot only   heRICHELIEU and the JEAN EART but also the battle-cruisers.He (the First Sea Lord) knew Admiral Estava well as aman of high principles and a determined character who could be trusted.     He was also one of the quadrumviratenominated by Admiral Darlan,We could either fly someone out to Oram orconvey a message to Admiral Estava through the NavalLiaison Officer at Oran,THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION was of the opinionthat we would be wrong to place too much faith in thegood intentions of Admiral Estava.      He would take his orders from the Minister of Marine whoever he might becOur object should be to foment a revolt against this authority, and there was no time to be lost.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that we should address our appeals both to Admiral Estava and to theFrench Captains.      At the same time we should take everystep to keep a close watch on the French ships,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that in fosteringthe spirit of revolt it would pay us to aim first at thedefection of the higher officers and only come down thescale when we had failed at the top,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat his contacts in France had convinced him that therewas still a tremendous spirit and will to fight which wasonly waiting for the opportunity to express itself,THE SECRETrJRY OF STATE FOR AIR suggested thatthe best moment to make our appeal would be when theItalian terms were presented.

In the course of further discussion,  itwas suggested that the Admiralty should considerwhether it would he desirable to send a message to Admiral Cunningham,  instructing him to useall possible persuasion to ensure that the french ships in the Eastern Mediterranean remained true to the Allied Cause.A telegram was also read out from theNaval Officer at   Arcachon, to the effect thathe feared that he would be faced with a dilemmain which he   ould have to choose between -(a) failing to take steps to make certain that the demolitionswere carried out;    or(b) taking high-handed action whichmight spoil our chances of getting hold of the french fleet oThe War Cabinet agreed that instructions should be sent to him that if faced with thischoice, he should act as at (a).The War Cabinet agreed(1). With a view to the vital need for obtainingcontrol of the French Navy, the following action should be taken immediately:-(a) A further appeal should be addressed to admiral Darlan in the form of personalmessages from the First Lord and theFirst Sea Lord./The terms of these messages were settled in the course of the Meeting./7(b) Simultaneously an appeal should be madeto Admiral Estava at Oran.It was proposed that this appeal should bemade by the Vice Chief of Naval Staff,who should fly out at once,,      It was also proposed that Lord Lloyd should accompany the Vice Chief of naval staff on his visit to 0rano    Besidesproviding valuable support in connectionwith the discussion in regard to theFleet, Lord Lloyd might later proceed

fcj   tfto Tunis,  and, possibly Syria, with aview to stiffening French resistance inthese Colonies,Note:    Subsequent to the above decisionhaving been reached,  confirmationwas received that the French had signed an armistice.     Accordinglyafter the Meeting,  the PrimeMinister, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, decided that it-would be wiser that the visit ofLord Lloyd and the Vice Chief ofNaval Staff to Oran should be postponed for, say, 24 hours,pending information as to how thesituation was developing.(c)   The Admiralty should assume responsibilityfor making sure that the French battleshipcRICHELIEU and JEAN BART did not leave the ports of Dakar and Casablanca respectively,,Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
