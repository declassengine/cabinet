(40) 130th CONCLUSIONS.. MINUTE 1..Confidential Annex.(19th May, 1940.)-THE western front.Progress of operations.   .I (previous reference: ;W.M.  (40) 129thConclusions,Minute 1.)THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAbU!informed the War Cabinet that the British were mtouch on their left with the Belgians about Oudersvrd,but on the right in the St.  Amand area the French werenot holding well at all. -     The Chief of the GeneralStaff at General Headquarters had rung up the WarOffice and said that if the gap on the right of theB.E-.F. widened, the Commander-in-Chief had it in mind to withdraw towards Dunkerque, resting his right on the canal running through St. Omer, and to fight it outthere.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff sard. &apos;&apos;that he had replied that this proposal could not beatcepted at all.  -    We might at a pinch be able tosupply the B.E.F.  in a bridgehead resting on the channel ports for a limited time, but we could certainly neverevacuate the force complete.  &apos;    He had already suggested on the previous evening that the B.E.F.should advance south-west through the Bethune-Arrasarea, with its left somewhat refused.- in order toget back on to -its lines of communication, and fightits way through to join up with the French.      If wecould get on to the line of the Somme and regaintouch with the French there, we might secure ourposition.    He had suggested that tactical trainsshould be used to supplement motor transport for themovement of the infantry.     The troops had alreadymoved some 180 miles and had had a certain amount of- 1 -

fighting.-     Although they were not being pressed bythe Germans they would not be able to retire further that night, since they would require time for re-organisation.He had spoken to General Headquartersabout an hour before the meeting, and the Chief of theGeneral Staff had said that things on the right were slightly better, but that they did not know in whosehands Cambrai was.It appeared that the B.E.F. had had no touchwith General Billotte since 1.0 a.m.  that morning.-Lord Gort was waiting for orders from General Georges,--who was at that moment in a conference with GeneralDill..      A letter from Gener&amp;l Dill, - writtenafter his conference with General Georges,  and presumably containing the latter&apos;s plan, was due toarrive in London at about 7.30 p.m.      The Frenchcounter attack by armoured troops and one infantry division in the Laon area had been reported as ready to go;off at 11.0 a.m.  that day, but no news had yet beenheard of it.     A counter attack was also being preparedbetween La Fere and Peronne with three divisions, butmessages which had been received gave the impression that these formations were intended to do little morethan hold the line of the canal.-THE PRIME MINISTER said that he fully agreed with the objection of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff to the proposal to fall back on the Channel ports.In such a position the British Expeditionary Force would .&apos;.be closely invested in a bomb-trap, and its total losswould be only a.matter of time.      Our forces must

therefore at all costs move hack towards Amiens.    Ifnecessary we could continue the retirement hackthrough Rouen, moving always towards our hases and reserves.     Admittedly this would uncover the channel ports, hut the Germans would in any case he able to operate against this country from aerodromes in theLow Countries.      The loss of the ports was thereforecomparatively less serious than in the last war, whenaircraft had not had such a long range.     We must face the fact that the Belgian Army might be lost altogether,but we should do them no service by sacrificing our ownArmy.     They should be urged to try and conform withthe movement of the British Expeditionary Force.      Atthe worst we would make every endeavour to evacuateas many of them as we could.The War Cabinet expressed general agreementwith these views.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said-that there was no alternative by which we could ensurethe disengagement of the Belgian Army unless, of course,the French themselves could drive back the Germans inthe Bulge.Some discussion followed regarding the arrange-ments to be made to co-Grdinate our proposals with thoseof General Georges, who was in command of the armies in the area concerned.      It was thought that before theseproposals were communicated to General Georges it wouldbe better to wait for the letter which General Dill wassending over at 7.30 p.m.      General Georges&apos; plancould then be discussed before the Chief of theImperial General Staff left to see Lord Gort.

The War Cabinet agreed:-&apos;(i) That, subject tp any new proposals put&apos; forward by General Georges -(a) The French should be informed thatthe British Expeditionary force was being instructed to move in a south-westerly direction on the axis Arras-Amiens attacking allenemy forces encountered, and to join&quot;up with the French Army.(b) The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should cross to France by sea after General Dill&apos;s letterhad been received and considered,and communicate the aboveinstructions to the Commander-in-Chief, British ExpeditionaryForce.(c) The Belgians should be urged to conform with the movements ofthe British Expeditionary Force,but they should be told thatwe would do our best to evacuatesuch of their Army as could not maintain contact with the british expeditionary Force.(ii) That the Admiralty should considerforthwith the measures necessary toprovide for the evacuation of Belgianforces from the Channel ports.(iii) To invite the Minister of information to indicate to the Press that thesituation, although not desperate,had become increasingly grave.(iv) That the Dominion Governments and high Commissioners should not beinformed at this stage as to thedecision at (i)  above.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
