MINUTE 10;Confidential Annex.(20th May, 1940.)&apos;m AIR DEFENCE The War Cabinet had before them a report of GREAT BRITAIN.by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(40) 159).Despatch of fighter aircraft THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had minutedto France.on the Chiefs of Staff Report suggesting:- -(previousififfi^Rnfifij (i)    A study of the covering operations whichwould be necessary from English &quot;bases,in the event of it being necessary towithdraw the British ExpeditionaryForce from France..(ii) Attacks on German bombers over france were no less valuable than operations against them over this country.(iii)    10 squadrons of fighters should &quot;be formedwithin a month from spare aircraft usedfor training purposes.(iv)    Plans should be made to use Battleaircraft to &quot;bombard German factoriesif possible.(v)   Arrangements should be made to get backas many of our aircraft as possible from france in the event of a withdrawal ofthe British Expeditionary Force or a collapse in France,(.vi) A.A. defences should be concentratedto protect the aircraft factories inthis country.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF made thefollowing remarks on these suggestions:-(i)   The Direotor of Operations (Home) in theAir Ministry was discussing plans with-the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Fighter Command, for covering operations over the various ports which might have tobe used.    If ports as far west as   le Harvewere employed, we should have to useaerodromes in France and reconnaissance of such aerodromes near Beauvais and west of the Seine was taking place.

(ii) &quot;Fighter aircraft could be employed muchmore economically in this country against german bombers, since we had a properlyorganised warning system, which avoided thewasteful system of continuous patrols.It was necessary to maintain these in France on the offchance of intercepting enemy aircraft.    Moreover, it was more likely that the German bombers operating overFrance would be escorted by fighters whichcould better engage our own aircraft.&quot;(iii)    Three new squadrons of Spitfires werebeing formed, but it would be uneconomicalto form-10 new squadrons within a month.It was better to dispose our available resources in aircraft.in depth, so thatsquadrons could as far as possible bekept up to their full operational efficiency.      There were only 15 Hurricanesat present in training units.    Everyavailable aircraft would be employed tomake good our losses.    Wastage, however,was very heavy.    Out of tjBsaf348 aircraft which had been specially sent over toassist in the Battle of the Bulge only10 were left serviceable at the presenttime,(iv)    Battle aircraft were unsuitable for operations against the Ruhr,  since theirrange was limited and they had inadequatefacilities for navigation.      They would,however, be of great use for attacks onthe German aerodromes in the Lot/ countries and against an attempted invasion by sea..(v)   Arrangements would certainly be made towithdraw as many as possible of our aircraft from France in case of a collapse.(vi)    The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Fighter Command, had been instructed to concentrate our air defences to protect the aircraft factories, and was working out a scheme for this purpose.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,referring to paragraph 8 of the Report, enquire whether it would be possible for additional fightersupport to be sent from this country, for a few days,at a time   of    crisis in the battle.

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said thatsuch arrangements might be made, using homeaerodromes, if the situation permitted, but only for a very limited period.    He recalled thatthe additional fighter squadrons already senthad been despatched simply to assist in the battle of the Bulge for a few days only.    Itwas not the intention that these should beretained permanently in France.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that we had reached the limit of the air assistance whichwe could senito France, and that we could notconsider despatching further resources permanentlyto France, thus denuding our defences at home.The War Cabinet -(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Agreed that no additionalfighter squadrons should be withdrawn from the Air Defenceof Great Britain for despatch to France apart from such support as might be affordedin a crisis by aircraft   .operating from bases in theUnited Kingdom), if thesituation so permitted.Richmond Terrace, S.W.X-

(40) 131stConclusions,liinute 1. )W.M.(40) 131st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 13.Confidential -Annex.(20th May, 1940. )At the close of the Meeting, THE SECRETARY of state FOR WAR reported a conversation which he had justhad with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.    Thelatter had not reached General Headquarters until 5 a,m.owing to the terrible congestion on the roads.He had seen Sir Roger Keyss and the General StaffOfficer Grade 1 of our Miss ton attached to the Belgians.He had explained to them our plan for the withdrawalof the B. E. F. and the circumstances which made this necessary.General Ironside said that a start was beingmade with the withdrawal to the south of three divisions of the B.E.F.     Two had been ordered to attack Arras,and were at that moment on the move.General Ironside said that Lord Gorfs main difficulty would be to extricate himself from his present position on the Esoautw    He was in contact withthe enemy on this line, and his units on the right -were mixed up with General Billotte&apos;s army.    Further,the lines of communication of the two armies crossed.General Ironside had seen General Billotteand had tried hard to make him attack;    he rathergathered that an attack on Cambrai was intended, but he expressed no great faith in this attack, or in General&quot;Billotte.    He had also spoken to General Weygand, whowas full of fire, and to General Dill.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had asked if he could stay out in Prance for the whole ofthat day, returning at dawn on the following morning.This had been agreed to.Generallronside had seemed rather more hopeful, and had said that he saw no reason why thesituation should not be put right, but that it wouldtake time.     Much would depend on what happened toour forces on the Escaut line.General Ironside also expressed the hopethat, now that General Weygand had become Generalissimo^,we should exercise considerable caution as to themanner in which we communicated to the French high command   the plans for the future movements of our forces.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
