THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 109It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.)  MOST SECRET. COPY NO. H_W.M.(40) 134TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Coiifidential Annex.(22nd May, 1940.)THE WESTERN THE PRIME MINISTER gave the War Cabinet anFRONT.--- account of his visit to France with the Vice Chiefs of progress of operations. Staff and General Ismay.     He had first seen   M. Reynaud.(previous He had gathered that M. Daladier was considerably shakenReferenee:W.M.(40) 133rd   by the serious defects which had been disclosed in theConclusions,Minute 2.) French military machine, particularly in view of the factthat he had been Minister for War for the past fouryears.     The party had then gone on to see general weygand, who had made a most favourable impression byhis vigour and confidence.General Weygand had given them his fullappreciation of the situation and it was clear that his views coincided exactly with those which the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff had expounded to the WarCabinet.     During his visit to the armies in the northon the previous day, General Weygand had, unfortunately,missed seeing Lord Gortj    but he had spent a considerable time with the King of the Belgians and the BelgianCommanders-in-Chief.     He had told them that it was essential for them to withdraw.     They had demurred onthe grounds that by doing so they would give up the wholeof their country.     The moral effect would be bad, andthe Belgian forces might question whether they was any-thing left for them to fight for.      The King had

suggested that the Belgians, in contact with the Britishshould fall back towards the coast and fight it out on aroughly semi-circular line with their backs to the sea.General Weygand had pointed out to them the hopelessnessof such a plan from the strategical, point of view, but hadnot left them convinced.    Nevertheless,  just before thePrime Minister had reached General Weygand, a message hadbeen received to the effect that the Belgians had agreed towithdraw to the line of the Yser.    General Weygand had issued orders for the sluices in that area to be opened inorder to cover the Belgian front.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinetthe conclusions^ which he had drawn up after his discussionwith General Weygand.    M. Reynaud had concurred in thedraft.    A copy of these conclusions had been despatched toLord Gort for his information.    The orders based on these conclusions would, of course, reach Lord Gort through thenormal channels.It was intended that the attacks by the british army and the French Army to the South-West and by the french army Group northward in the Amiens direction, should takeplace on the following day, 23rd May.THE CHIEF OF.THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF observedthat, so far as was known, no preparations had been madefor these attacks at noon that day, and he thought that the attacks would take some time to mount.THE PRIME MINISTER said that General Weygand had informed him that all German armoured divisions were operating in the Arras-Bapaume area, where, unfortunately,

bill the country was particularly favourable to them.     Onthe southern front, along the line of the Aisne, theGermans appeared to be preparing for an infantry attack in the &quot;classic style&quot;.     Air-Marshal Peirse had.explained to General Weygand the difficulties withwhich our bombers had to contend in attacking theGerman armoured columns by day.     He had, however,undertaken that the Royal Air Force would do everything possible to assist the proposed attacks by the Britishand French Armies, both by day and night.    provided the French fought well, there seemed a good prospectof success.THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that General Weygand had told him that he was doing everything possible to raise the morale of theFrench troops.      There was certainly a weakness in theFrench Commanders, but from the fact that the french forces had not fought much anywhere it seemed likely that the morale of the units as well was not too good.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR gave the WarCabinet an account of a conversation which he had had with Lord Mxinster, A.D.C to Lord Gortover the telephone at 5 p.m. that evening.     A copy is attached to these conclusions (Appendix II)^THE PRIME MINISTER said that General Weygandhad issued a stern order regarding refugees, who wereto be driven into the fields and to be forbidden theuse of the roads except for very limited and statedhours.     Furthermore the populace had been instructedto remain in their homes.

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF Informed theWar Cabinet that the first lot of iron rations hadbeen flown over by the Royal Air Force/ and that thesecond lot were ready to go.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that the firstfood ship had been sunk by a bomb off the Belgian coast.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY read telegramsreporting that Dunkfcrque, Calais and Boulogne had beenrepeatedly   bombed.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that reports which he had received up to that moment gave the Germanlosses of aircraft for that day as 7 against no Britishlosses.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.

APPENDIX.  I. . .Conclusions reached at the meeting between The Prime&apos; Minister andGeneral Weygand. .- .It was agreed:1..    That the Belgian Army should withdraw to theline of the Yser and stand there, the sluicesbeing opened,.2.    That the British Army and the French FirstArmy should attack south-west towards Bapaumeand Cambrai at the earliest moment - certainlytomorrow with about eight Divisions - and withthe Belgian Cavalry Corps on the right ofthe British.3.    That as this battle is vital to both Armiesand the British communications depend uponfreeing Amiens, the British Air Force should give the utmost possible help both by day andby night while it is going on.4.    That the new French Army group which isadvancing upon Amiens and forming a linealong the Somme should strike northwards andjoin hands with the British Divisions who areattacking southwards in the general directionof Bapaume.32nd May. 1940.

APPENDIX    II.Note by the Secretary of State for War recordinga conversation with Lord Minister (A.D.C. to Lord Gort).Lord Munster rang me up from Belgium to-day at 5 p,m^   He was with Sir Roger Keyes at some point onthe coast.    Lord Munster said that he had been charged by the Commander in Chief with a message for the PrimeMinister, but that in the absence of the Prime minister he would give me the message.The situation was very grave.    All the Lines ofCommunication of the B.E.P. were cut.    Conversation wasimpossible either with Paris or with London,    There was aserious shortage of the essential commodities for war bothin respect of food and munitions.    Above all, there was noco-ordination between ourselves and the French on our right.-   &quot;The Co-coordinator has had an accident andco-ordinates no longer&quot;.    Lord Gort had had a three hours&apos;conversation with the French, and received the impression that there was &quot;very little doing&quot;.    I asked what had happened at the meeting with Weygand yesterday.    LordMunster replied that there had been no such meeting.-   TheCommander-in-Chief had not seen Weygand, though he understood that the King of the Belgians had done so. -  LordGort had not known until after his departure where general weygand had been.    The message continued:    &quot;The gap mustbe closed at all costs on our right.    The French shouldclear our Lines of Communication,    As yet, however, theywere not prepared to fight, nor did they show any sign of doing so&quot;.

Lord Munster added as a suggestion of *iie ownthat it might he good if a Minister were to come out from England and see conditions for himself.      Theywere very grave.     Unfortunately, however, it was difficult to get out or to get hack.      I asked ifLord Munster could tell me how many days&apos;  supply offood and ammunition the B.E.P. had.     He replied thathe did not know precisely, hut only that they couldnot be sufficient for any large number of days-In further conversation Lord Munsteremphasised that the essential was to obtain aCo-coordinator at the earliest possible moment.    sir roger Keyes made it clear that the Belgians would accept Lord Gort.      Gould not we persuade the french to do the same?Lord Munster added that if we wished to see him tomorrow he could be fetched off in a destroyer,and Lord Gort was willing to spare him if we thought this desirable.Sir Roger Keyes then came to the telephone.He said that he had been present at the conversation between General Weygand and the King of the Belgians.General \7eygand had said that he must think like hell,but I gather that no definite plans had been decided upon beyond that agreed between the Belgians and theBritish, as a result of which the former were taking over thirteen miles of our line.     The King had described the interview with General Weygand as four hours of confused talking.

Owing to the fact that Lord Munster warnedme that the telephone conversation might be listenedin to, some of the references were, of course, moreveiled than appears in this record, but I am confident that the record contains the essentials.     Lord Munstercan reach Keyes1 Headquarters in two hours from hisown, and I have arranged with him that he shall motorthere again tomorrow, and get into communication with us.     We can call for him at any time through sir roger Keyes.22nd May. 1940--
