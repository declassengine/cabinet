THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 2 j 7It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.iinsT SECRET.COPY NO.W.M.- (40) 150th CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex.( 3.1st May, 1940, )(previousleference iI,M.(40) 149thJonclusions,minute 5. )The War Cabinet had before them TelegramNo.  21 DIPP from Sir Cecil Dormer describing an interviewwhich he had had with the Norwegian Minisi ,r for ForeignAffairs on the 3 0th May.The Minister had been very much upset at the newsthat British troops v/ere evacuating Bodo in spiteof our assurance that we intended to hold on to northern Norway.    M. Hambro who had been presenthad said that if Bodo could not oe held, the only course would be to make terms with the GermansDSir Cecil Dormer had warmly repudiated thesuggestion that the British v/ere deserting the norwegians at Bodo and had done his best toencourage the Norwegian Government to continuethe struggleeTHE SECRETARY- OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that shortly after the receipt of this Telegram hehad had a visit from the Norwegian Minister in London,who had urged the need for sending further reinforcements to Northern Norway, in particular fighters and anti-aircraft defences.    The successive destruction of oneNorv/norwegian town after another had made a deep impression on the Norv/norwegian people.    The end of Norway&apos;s capacity to resist was nearing and everything depended on promp action by the Allies.He had replied that it v/as extremely difficult for us now to provide additional fighters and anti-aircraft defences.    The position v/as altogether different from what it had been before the great offensive of theGermans on the Western Front.    Our defeat in the maintheatre would mean the end of any possible chance of re-establishing the freedom of Norv/ay.    He had, of course,said nothing about evacuation and had promised that wewould work in the closest co-operation with the norwegians.    Lord Cork had been instructed to reviewhis whole position in the light of the new developments in the war and to keep in close touch with theNorwegian Commander-in-Chief in the matter of themilitary plans of the Allies in Norv/ay.    He had made it quite clear to the Norwegian Minister that it v/asimpossible for us at the present moment to send anymore equipment to Norv/ay.

After the Norwegian Minister had left,theSwedish Minister had also visited the Foreign Secretary.He had been instructed by his Government to sound uson the possibilities of carrying through the Mowinkelplan for the neutralisation of Northern Norway underSwedish supervision.    The Germans were pressing the swedes very hard to allow traffic to pass through totheir troops at Narvik, but the Swedish government thought that the Germans would be prepared to acceptthe Mowinkel plan.The Foreign Secretary said that the Mowinkelplan, if it could be put through, would certainly be away of getting us out of Norway without discredit.    Hewas very unwilling to face the prospect of scuttlingout of Norway and would like to try every possible meansof saving our face in this matter     The advantages to us of the Mowinkel plan would be that:-(a) Northern Norway would be kept free from german domination for the Norwegian king and Government.(b) We should retain our access to Sweden,which was of importance to us.(c) Germany would be-prevented from reachingout too far to the North for our security.In these circumstances, he suggested that,if the Chiefs of Staff considered the proposal soundon military grounds, we should approach the Swedes and say that., although we thought the Mowinkel. plan a veryodd one, we were prepared to consider it,  if they thought that the Germans and the Norwegians would accept ito    We must, however, have an answer from themwithin, say, two days, owing to impending operations.If we received satisfactory assurances on &quot;this point,we should then tell the Norwegians that we had been approached by the Swedes on the Mowinkel plan, andthat although we had originally turned it down we had now been compelled by force of circumstances to considerit afresiir.    We should have to inform them that we were forced to evacuate our troops from Northern Norway inthe immediate future;. and accordingly it would be verymuch to the is? interests to accept the Mowinkel plan.We could not supply them with munitions, nor could weprevent Northern Norway being bombed, and if theydid not accept the plan the only alternative, other thancapitulation, would be to evacuate the King, theGovernment and the army.

Considerable discussion ensued on thisproposal, in which the following were the main points that emerged:-(i) The Chiefs of Staff in their original reporton the military implications of a complete withdrawal from Norway (W.P.(40) 165) had advised that, from the military point of view there was no harm in an attempt being madeto put through the Mowinkel plan, and thatthe capture of Narvik might well increasethe chances of reaching a successfulagreement.,    They had emphasised, however,that, once evacuation was decided upon, theoperation should be carried out at the propermoment, irrespective of negotiations on theMowinkel planD(ii) For the negotiations on the plan to have any chance of success time must be allowed, but theeffect of such delay on the success of theevacuation would be serious.    The aircraft carriersnow at Narvik would have to return to refuelafter five or six days.    The large number ofships already in course of despatch would haveto remain at sea with all the risks attendantthereto.    The a aircraft already at Narvik wouldbe wasting during the delay;    Lord Cork was already asking for additional aircraft to replacewastage that had taken place up to date.    Finally,if the evacuation were delayed the risk of notgetting our naval forces back in time to dealwith a German invasion of this country was increased.(iii) It would be disastrous if, after all, theMowinkel plan did net go through and, as aresult of the delay, successful evacuation from Narvik was prejudiced.    We should, ofcourse impress.; upon the Norwegians the greatimportance in their own interests of allowingno leakage of our intention to evacuate,but the danger of this knowledge coming to theears of the Germans remained.(iv) If a settlement on the lines of the Mowinkelplan could be reached, it would not prejudice the future possibility of carrying outOperation Paul since although our aircraft would not be able to fly over the part ofNorthern Norway which had been neutralised,they would still be able to reach Lulea by flying across the Southern part of Norwaywhich was in German hands.(v) It was difficult to say why the Swedes thoughtthat there was a real chance of the Germansaccepting the plan, but the following factorshad to be taken into account :-(a) Operations in Northern Norway must inevitably cause considerable drain on Germany&apos;s resources.

(b) Hitler had reasons of personal prestigefor wishing to save the troops at narvik from destruction.,(c) The Russians would not he at allanxious to have the Germans so farnorth in Norway.(vi)    It had been suggested by Colonel Pollock thatwe should endeavour to lead the Norwegiansthemselves to asking us to withdraw our troops in order that they might make thebest terms they could with the Germans.  it seemed, however, most unlikely that the norwegians would do this, since they would realise that they would be likely to getvery much better terms from the Germans ifthey had the support of our troopsc(viili   Our main objects were to keep Norway in thewar,  to get av/ay the Xing and Government safelyand to keep control of the Norwegian shipping and at the same time to withdraw our valuabletroops and material from Narvik.    The best chance of achieving these two objects mightbe to put it quite bluntly to the NorwegianKing and Government that we were compelled towithdraw and that he must leave the country with his Government and as many troops aspossible at the same time as the Allied forces,,We ought not to give him too long to make up his mind, but should try to hustle him out without any delayc    It seemed only honest andright not to keep the Norwegians in the darkany longer as to our real intentions.Sufficient shipping had been sent to evacuatesuch of the Norwegian forces as we were likelyto be able to get off,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs suggested that in the light of all the considerations which had been brought out in the discussion the best course would be:-(i)    To carry on r.l&apos;!:.h the evacuation as already planned,,(ii)    To inform the Norwegian Government immediatelythat we vrere evacuating our forces and toadvise them that they should immediatelyenter into negotiations on the Mowinkel planbefore knowledge of our intentions to evacuategot round to the Germans,  since this would prejudice any chance of a successful outcome of the negotiations.

(iii)    To inform the Norwegian Government thatif they were not prepared to negotiate on the Mowinkel plan or if thenegotiations failed, we would take off the  King, Government, and such of the forces as could he got away.The War Cabinet agreed:-(i)   That this suggestion of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs provided the best solution to the difficulty.(ii)   To invite the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to draft the necessary instructions toSir Cecil Dormer accordingly,(iii)   That these instructions should^emphasise the vital need forsecrecy(a) in order to give the norwegians the best chance of obtaining asettlement on the linesof the Mowinkel plan.(b) In order not to prejudice the success of ourevacuation.(iv-)   That these instructions shouldbe sent to Sir Cecil Dormerthrough Lord Cork, with whom he should consult beforeapproaching the NorwegianGovernmentoRichmond Terrace, S.W.1.
