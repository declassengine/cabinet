GLORIOUSwith 16 Hurricanes, had left Scapa for Narvik on the afternoon of the 24th May.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinetthat the question of the evacuation of Narvik had beendiscussed at a meeting of the Defence Committee theprevious evening.    The Chief of the Air Staff had submitted that the Hurricanes in H.M.S.  GLORIOUS would be essential for the successful and speedy evacuation of our forcesat Narvik.    It was recognised that these aircraft wouldbe lost when we evacuated, but we should probably be ableto get the pilots away.    The Defence Committee had agreedthat Lord Cork should be informed that it was our intention^,in view of developments on the Western Front, to evacuateNarvik as early as possible.    He read to the War Cabinetthe telegram^ which had been despatched to Lord Corkcontaining instuctions on this matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that hehad been approached by the Norwegian Minister for defence, who had pleaded for the supply of some 15,000rifles and ammunition to arm the Norwegian forces, whohad lost all their arsenals when Norway hadbeen invaded. 4 th se arms could not be supplied, some of the Norwegianforces would have to be demob ilis e d.

He had temporised in his reply to the Norwegian deputation, but it would bedifficult to hold the position for very long.In the discussion which ensued it was generally agreed that we could not in present circum-stances supply the Norwegians with any arms.      On theother hand it would be very much to our disadvantage in the Narvik area if the Norwegians collapsedaltogether.      The only course seemd to be to try andhold the position with the Norwegian Government onthis question   as long as possible, pending theevacuation from Narvik.      They would realise that inpresent circumstances it was extremely difficult forus to supply arms to them.The War Cabinet agreed(i) To endorse the instructions whichhad been sent to Lord Cork for theevacuation of Narvik at the earliest moment.(ii) To invite the Secretary of State forWar to explain to the norwegian government, if necessary, that, inpresent circumstances, we were not ina position to sLparo them any arms.

COPY HO.   /JfW.M.(40)  158TH CONCLUSIONS.  MINUTE 15.Confidential Annex.(25th May,  1940. )THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had hadanother telephone conversation with Admiral Sir RogerKeyes, who had spoken from Purnes.They had discussed the difficult positionof the King of the Belgians, who was anxious to remain with his army, rather than to follow his Ministers toa temporary capital on French soil.In the course of the discussion in theWar Cabinet the following points were made;-(l)    We were ready at any time to provide a vessel for the evacuation of King Leopold,if he wished to leave.    It now seemed thatit might be impracticable to embark theKing from Ostend and that the vessel   wouldhave to go to Dunkirk.(2)    THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would be  .speaking again to Sir Roger Keyes at 5 p.m.that day, and that he would send a messagepointing out to King Leopold that it was now necessary for him to give earnest considerationto the question of his personal safety, fromthe point of vie?/ of the best interests of his country.(3)    While one might sympathise with the Kingfsdesire to remain with his troops to the end,the possibility of his becoming a prisonerin German hands was very distasbBful.    germany might in the near future wish to make Belgiuman offer of a separate peace.    If KingLeopold were at the head of a Government onBelgian soil which accepted terms of surrenderit would be a disaster for the Allied cause.On the other hand,  if the King had leftBelgium he and his Government would continueto be at war with Germany.THE KING OF the belgians.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 137thConclusions,Minute 5. )

The War Cabinet -(i) Took note of the above statement,(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary toarrange for a message to be sentto Sir Roger Keyes urging strongly the arguments in favour of KingLeopold leaving his country,(iii) Took note that if the Klna aerreed toleave the necessary arrangements wouldbe made by the admiral ty direct with the authorities in Belgium.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
