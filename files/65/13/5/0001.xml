MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(8th May,  1940).THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY read to theWar Cabinet Lord Cork*s signal 0631/7 in reply tothe signal agreed upon at the previous meeting of theWar Cabinet.Lord Cork expressed himself in favour ofmaking the assault on Narvik, the garrison of which could not be in very good shapeafter continuous bombardment and in view oftheir inevitable shortage of supplies andammunition.    He appreciated the difficultyof the long passage in boats, but thought this could be avoided by carrying the troops in ships.    He did not consider success certain,but believed there was a good chance.    If the attempt was not made, early capture of thetown was impossible, and in view of theimportanoe of its capture, it was, from the broader point of view, worth taking the riskof a reverse.    The General Officer Commandinghad asked for 48 hours delay,  as he couldnot be ready before, and Lord Cork had thereforepostponed further preparations until GeneralAuchinleokfs arrival.It had been suggested to Lord Cork by theFirst Sea Lord that he should use one of His Majesty&apos;s ships in the same way as IMPLACABLE at Gallipoli, and hehad replied that he intended to use RESOLUTION in this manner in order to get the troops very close up to the landing place. ^

The Chiefs of Staff had considered thesesignals at their meeting that morning, and had drafteda reply.In the discussion which followed generalconcurrence was expressed in this draft.     Theprincipal points which; merged were asfollows(i)    It should he possible to hold Narvikeven against a heavy scale of air attack.     Conditions were altogetherdifferent from those at Andalsnes,where there had only been a smallconcentrated target round the quaysfor the Germans to attack.     At Narvik,on the other hand, the base area was some 20 to 30 miles across,  and the bombing targets would therefore be verymuch dispersed,(ii)    In favour of an immediate assault was theconsideration that we must not give theworld the impression that we were afraid of a difficult and dangerous undertaking.If the assault succeeded, we shouldcapture considerable numbers of german prisoners, which would have important political effects.     Moreover, the morale of the Norwegians would certainly he raisedby our success,(iii)   The early completion of aerodromesfrom which fighter aircraft could operatewas of vital importance. Further urgentrepresentations had been made to Lord Cork

on this matter.    According to reports fromNorwegians now in London, these aerodromes couldnot he ready &quot;before June, hut the norweigen minister of Defence had said that there wasplenty of Norwegian labour available which couldbe used for rapid clearance of the landing grounds.A telegram had been sent to the Norwegian localauthorities pressing them to give all possible assistance.    From a report received from wing commander Atcherley, it appeared that the landingstrips at Bardufoss might be ready by 15th May.The date when Skaanland would be ready could notyet be estimated,(iv)   Some Bofors guns had already been mounted atBardufoss, and more had arrived in the Narvik area.ARK ROYAL would provide some fighter protection andthe Gladiators would be arriving on the 13th May.The Hurricanes would arrive on the 15th May.    IfNarvik was taken by assault now, we should be no worse off from the point of view of air attackthan if more deliberate operations were undertaken,(v)    It was possible that the Germans would! concentrateall their efforts on making Narvik untenable.    Onthe other hand, air operations would he carried, out under conditions equally unfavourable to bothsides.    The Germans would be likely to sufferheavy losses from our fighters owing to the continuous daylight;   but this would entail agreat strain on our fighters, and consequently

Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.larger numbers of aircraft would &quot;be needed.In any event, it would &quot;be &quot;better that intensiveair operations should he carried out over Narvikthan over this country or in connection with aGerman invasion of the Western Front.The War Cabinet-Approved the despatch to Lord Corkof the draft telegram submitted bythe Chiefs of Staff, a copy ofwhich is attached to this Annex.

DRAFT TELEGRAM TO LORD CORK.His Majesty1s Government have studied yourappreciation.     The importance of capturing Narvikbefore operations for its relief can be developed, is great.     Further our information is that Germandefence of Narvik is weakening (vide AdmiraltyMessage 1433/7).In these circumstances, capture of Narvikshould be pressed with vigour, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will support you in taking any risks which you consider it necessary to accept.       As general auchinleck cannot arrive till 12th and would requireseveral days to get au fait with the situation, heshould be left out of your calculations.Reference your 2151/7, further reply willbe sent by Admiralty regarding Resolution &quot;Aurora&quot; and&quot;Enterprise&quot;.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.MOST    SECRET.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.W.M.(40) 115th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.(8th May, 1940.) -THE NETHERLANDS. The War Cabinet discussed the further action and BELGIUM.which should be taken by our bomber force in the eventAir action in theevent of a German of a German invasion of Holland,attack on holland and/or Belgium.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 114thConclusions,Minute 1.)THE PRIME MINISTER thought it had been clearlysettled that air attacks should be made on the Germanmarshalling yards if troops were actually on the move forward.     The question at issue was whether our bomber&apos;force should also be directed against targets such asthe German oil refineries, which were not directlyconnected with the movement of the invadingcolumns.     It was this question which the Chiefs ofStaff had been instructed to re-examine in the lightof the discussion at the previous meeting of the WarCabinet, together with the action which should be takenin the event of a German attack on the NetherlandIslands only.     In his view there was a clear dis-tinction between attacks on marshalling yards and attacks on the oil refineries in the Ruhr;    (thoughit might be a matter for argument how much weight should be attached to the distinction)    the former was an attack on a military target which would directly con-tribute to the defence against a land attacks     this consideration could not be said to apply to attacks onthe oil refineries.     On the other,hand it was truethat air attack on the marshalling yards would belikely to cause, casualties to civilians, and theGerman reactions to either of these forms of attackmight be the same.

THE MINISTER OP HOME SECURITY said that thestaunchness of the civilian population in this country under air attack would he likely to depend very much on the presentation of our case.      If there was an impression that it was we ourselves who had startedair attack on civilians, the shock to public opinion inthis country would be great.    It would have to be carefully explained that attacks on marshalling yards,although they might have caused casualties to civilians, were attacks on strictly military targets,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY did not favour attacks either against the marshalling yardsor the oil refineries until the great land battlehad begun.    We did not yet know for certain whetherthe French would enter Belgium if Holland was invaded.If they did, the land battle would have started,and then there would be no objection to attacking the marshalling yards.    If, however, we started these attacks before the land forces were in action, eventhough we&apos; might know that the German armies were onthe move forward, our action would be very muchcriticised.      Once the land battle had begun,thethunder of battle would cover the attacks on the Germanmarshalling yards, even though these resulted in heavy casualties to civilians.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the discussion had arisen- out of the possibility of a German attackon the Dutch islands only.     If such an attack weremade without a forward move of the German armies on land, he would not be in favour of bombing the marshalling yards.    If they attacked the islands and

then subsequently moved forward by land, attacks on the marshalling yards would be a proper form of counter action by us..In reply to a question from the Chief of theAir Staff,the PRIME MINISTER said that once the land battle had started, the marshalling yards could be attacked;   and it would not be necessary to make sure whether troops were actually moving through the yards   before delivering the attack..THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY observedthat we were not yet certain as to what the french would do in the event of an attack on the NetherlandIslands.only. He intended to go over to Paris at avery early date and clear up the position in thisrespect,The War Cabinet - -(i)   Agreed that in the event of aGerman invasion of Holland and/or belgium (i. e, an attack which involved the movement of troopsaoross the frontier)the RoyalAir Force should have authority toattack German marshalling yards,without further reference to theWar Cabinet.     This authority didnot, however, extend to oil refineries, or coking or powerplants in the Ruhr,(ii)   Agreed that the authority given in(i) above did not apply in theevent of a German attack on the netherland Islands only.(iii)   Agreed that the above discussion and conclusions should be borne in mind by the Chiefs of Staffin their re-examination of paper W.P.(40) 143.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
