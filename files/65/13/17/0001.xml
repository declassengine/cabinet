(40) 156th CONCLUSIONS.Confidential Annex.(23rd May, 1940.)WESTERN FRONT.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M.  (40) 155thConclusions,Minute 1.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been giving further consideration to the observations madeby the Lord Privy Seal that morning on the danger of falling between two stools, and that it might be bestfor the B.E.F. to fall back on the Channel Ports.    Hehad spoken to M. Reynaud and had told him that theposition of the B.E.F. was very difficult.   M. reynaud had replied that the French operations were continuing.He had then spoken to General Weygand at 6 p. m.,andGeneral Weygand had also had a conversation with theChief of the Imperial General Staff.    The gist of the \latter conversation had been summarised by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff as follows:-(l)   He (General Weygand) had taken Amiens,Albert and Peronne, and the manoeuvre was continuing under good conditions.(2)   He considered that the only solution wasto continue the manoeuvre.     The rest wasdisaster.(5)   He was quite unmoved when I told him of the weight of the forces moving up on the lineBethune - St. Omer.     He said that theGerman Armoured Divisions were reduced bycasualties.(4)   He talked of studying the question of feeding Blanchard from the sea.     I told him that we knew the difficulties and had little chance of doing much.(5)   Weygand was c onfi dent.General Weygand had demanded that theoperation should continue.     The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff and the Vice Chief of the Imperial

General Staff had both been of the view that it was better that the operation should continue,  since, ifthe B.E.F.were to retire on the Channel ports, it was unlikely that more than a small part of the force -could be got away.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that hehad sent a telegram to Lord Gort reporting the PrimeMinister&apos;s conversation with General Weygaud.     the telegram had stated that we realised Lord Gorfsdifficulties, and that if he found it impossible tocontinue operations in accord with General Weygand&apos;splan, he should inform the British Government so thatthe French could be informed,  and all possible navaland air steps taken to cover the move to the coast.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there had beenreports of a catastrophic situation at Boulogne.      Ithad been reported that the Germans had captured oneof the forts and were shelling the town.     A signalhad been sent from the Admiralty ordering theevacuation,  and stating that destroyers were being sent to take off the troops.      This signal, however,had crossed a-signal from the Senior Naval Officer atBoulogne,  stating that the situation was considerablyeasier, and that the British troops were holding onalthough they were being fairly heavily bombed.     Thefact that the Germans were bombing the town was a clear indication that they had not captured it.     Theorders to evacuate Boulogne had accordingly been cancelled.     There was no doubt that our troops wereundergoing a great ordeal and he would suggest that itmight be of the greatest help to them if even a fewhundred marines could be landed to reinforce them.

The Chief of Naval Staff was invited tofind out whether a party of marines was available.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff undertook to enquire whether the Officer in Commandat Boulogne was anxious to receive a reinforcement.A decision whether to send a reinforcement should depend on his reply, provided trained troops wereavailable,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that a Tank Regimenthad disembarked at Calais and had been placed under lord Gortc    They had been ordered to clear the route toSt.  Orner but had encountered enemy forces three milesout of Calais.    No details of the fighting had yet beenreceived,,    The remainder of the armoured division hadbeen disembarked at Cherbourg and had now reached apoint south of Abbeville,TKS CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat 250,000 rations had been landed at Calais.    He washopeful that means would be found to get them through to the army.    The ammunition position, however, wasserious0Summing up the position, THE PRIME minister thought that,even regarding the latest news in its most favourable light,there was as yet little ground forconfidence.    He felt, however,  that we had no choice inthe matter bu&quot;; to do our best to conform to general weygand&apos;s plan.     Any other course would wreck the chanceof General Waygans^s plan   succeeding.

According to a message from Sir Roger-Keyes, theKing of the Belgians had said that he would fullyunderstand if the B. E. F. was being withdrawn, butthat it could only have one result for the Belgian Army i. e.   capitulation.    So long as we adhered tothe plan, the Belgians would conform to it.    TheBelgian army would have fallen back to the line ofthe Yser by the following day.Attention was drawn to telegram Bo. 16from Geneva.    This telegram reported that HerrBurckhardt had seen an official of the German Ministryof Foreign Affairs the previous day, who had comestraight from Berlin.    This official said thatpopular feeling in Germany was not elated, and thatthe situation was considered serious.    A very highofficial in the German Ministry of Foreign affairs had said that if the present attack could be held fora few weeks, there was danger of a complete collapse.The War Cabinet agreed that it would be useful that this telegram should be repeated to our ambassador in Paris.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatGeneral Pill had had a personal message from LordGort earlier in the day, suggesting that the formershould fly over to Lord Gorfs headquarters in thecourse of the day, since the situation could not be fully appreciated except by someone on the spot.    Ifnecessary, General Dill might perhaps fly over toLord Gort on the following day.

Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.The War Cabinet agreed to a suggestion by the Secretary of State for War that he should send a personal message to Lord Gort from themembers of the War Cabinet, expressing their appreciation of his difficulties and of the spiritof fortitude and resource with which he was meetingthem.The War Cabinet took note of these statements and approved the decisionsoutlined by the Prime Minister.
