THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. ft-.----                             ^It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET. COPY NO.WAR CABINET (40)  180th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE fT,Confidential Annex.(24th June,  1940 - 10.30 p.m.)THE FIRST SEA LORD gave the War Cabinet aresume of the Naval Staff appreciation asked for bythe War Cabinet at their meeting at 6.0 p.m.     Hesaid that as soon as we made any attempt to take overor sink units of the French Fleet,  the crews of theremaining ships would probably become actively hostile,thus reducing our chances of securing more than a small part of the Fleet.      In addition the Germans would atonce take more stringent measures to get possession ofthe remaining ships.The Naval Staff had considered whether,  if theuse of force became necessary, it would be better toattempt to seize the French submarines or the capital ships.     If the submarines fell into German or Italianhands, it would be some time before they could be Sbrought into use against us and we could route our trade so that these submarines could only he brought tobear in northern waters.     Moreover,  it was only possible to use a limited number of submarines in a given area and this access of strength would not atonce materially benefit the enemy.If the capital ships fell into enemy hands,it would be some 2 months before the Germans couldefficiently employ them and some 3 months before theItalians could do so.      It was anticipated that italy would, in a few months&apos; time, have 5 or 6 capital ships of her own and, if 2 French ships were to be added tothis fleet, we should find ourselves unable to leave ourFleet in the Eastern Mediterranean and should need to augment our force at Gibraltar in order to keep thisItalian Fleet within Mediterranean waters.      If Spainwere to become actively hostile,  capital ships wouldbe needed for convoy purposes and, under theseconditions, we should be unable to maintain effective control of the western exits from the Mediterranean.If a choice had to be made, it would therefore bebetter to eliminate the French capital ships rather thanthe submarineSoThe most important units to be eliminatedwere the battle cruisers DUNKERQUE and STRASBOURGwhich, together with 2 other capital ships, some21 destroyers and an unknown number of submarines,were reported to be in a new harbour not far fromOran.     They were under the protection of 6-inchshore batteries.      The British forces available todeal with the Force de Rade, as this French squadronwas termed, consisted of HOOD, RESOLUTION and ARK ROYAL;FRANCE:The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M.

:  mibombing attacks but not torpedo attacks could..becarried out in the harbour by aircraft from the carrier..The only real chance of success lay in a surpriseattack carried out at dawn and without any form ofprior notification.     The operation might well resultin the loss or partial disablement of both our battle-ships, and we should then, in consequence, be badlyhandicapped in dealing with the RICHELIEU and JEAN BART.The First Sea Lord went on to say that theprobable loss of our 2 ships seemed a heavy price topay for the elimination or partial elimination of force de Rade.     Admiral Darlan and other FrenchAdmirals had maintained the consistent attitude thatin no circumstances would the French Fleet be surrendered, and it would seem more likely that weshould achieve our object by trusting in these assurances, rather than by attempting to eliminate unitsof the French Fleet by force.     He did not therefore recommend the proposed operation.In the discussion which ensued, the followingpoints were made:-(i)    If the operation were to have any chance atall of success,  it must be carried out as a surprise and no notification whatever shouldbe given to the French Government or otherFrench authorities.(ii)    If the operation were to result in the loss or disablement of 2 of our capital ships, weshould be in danger of losing our command ofthe Western Mediterranean.(iii)   The possibility that the Italian Fleet might present itself off Oran in order to takedelivery of the French squadron should not be ruled oat.(iv)    The decision to order the destruction of people who had only 48 hours before beenAllies would be hard to make.      If Frenchsailors were to be killed in action with theBritish Fleet, the French and german governments would declare that England was making war on France and the sympathy ofthe entire French Empire would probably be lost to us.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the ships thatmattered most were the JEAN BART and RICHELIEU whichwere at present unarmed and should prlve easy to secureonce they left the shelter of the French ports.     an operation to destroy the Force de Rade would undoubtedlyprove very costly and might not be successful.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRShandedrcunda draft communication to the French Govern-ment, demanding that steps should be taken forthwith to sink those vessels of the French Fleet which might bein danger of falling into the hands of the enemy.Considerable discussion took place on this draft.     Two revised drafts were drawn up and circulated.

In the course of this discussion, the lord privy SEAL pointed out that emphasis should, he placedon the illusory nature of the German pledge that theyhad no intention of using units of the French Fleetfor their own purposes.     The Armistice could be denounced at any time by the German Government on thepretext that any of its terms had been infringed.THE LORD PidSSIDENT OF THE COUNCIL pointedout that under the formula in Article 8 of theArmistice terms which gave the German Government theright to make claims on the French Fleet   for thepurpose of surveillance of the French coasts or mine-sweeping, the latter would be able to make use ofnaval vessels for other purposes.THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION drew attentionto the message reported to have been received bySir Dudley North to the effect that Admiral Darlan had given explicit assurances that in no circumstances would the French Government hand over their Fleetintact.     It was pointed out that this was tantamount to an admission that the French Government had decided to break the terms of the Armistice as soonas they had signed them.     Admiral Darlan&apos;s dilemmawas that he had either to break faith with us or to expose himself to the charge that he had deliberatelyentered into an engagement which he had no intentionof fulfilling.     This, it was pointed out, was whatthe German Government had done on the conclusion ofthe Armistice in 1918.THE PRIME MINISTER said that too much weightcould not be attached to these private messages.The situation had to be faced in the light of publicdocuments and in view of the terms of the Armisticeto which the Bordeaux Government had agreed.     Thecovert suggestion that the French authorities mightscuttle their ships could not be relied on.     It mustbe remembered that the protection given by theArmistice did not necessarily apply to the peace terms, although it might be expected that the peace terms would be framed on the basis of the Armistice.Once the German occupation of French territory was complete, and the French Government were entirely attheir mercy, there was nothing to prevent germany from imposing peace terms more onerous than those towhich the French had agreed for the purpose of theArmistice.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY urged thatthe communication to the Government at Bordeaux shouldnot be sent if there was any idea of carrying out the cutting out operation at Oran, for which a surpriseattack was essentialDiscussion ensued as to the action to betaken in regard to French naval units at Southampton,Portsmouth and Plymouth.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatarrangements had been made that all these ships should

be detained for at least another 24 hours.      It mightbe necessary to remove the crews from the vessels inSouthampton Water, but he did not think that suchaction would be necessary at the other ports.The War Cabinet:-(1)   Took note that steps would be takento continue to detain French naval units in British ports.     The FirstLord of the Admiralty was authorised,if necessary, to remove the crews frorrthe vessels in Southampton Water.This step would not however be taken for the present if it could be avoided.(2)   Deferred a decision as to the actionto be taken in regard to French naval units generally, other than those inBritish control, until it was seenhow the situation developed in thelight of the Franco-Italian armistice terms.      (This decision does not,  Of-course, affect the decisions already given as regards (a) the EMILE BERTIFand the BEARN, and (h) the french ships in the Eastern Mediterranean.)(3)   Decided to give further consideration on the following day to the communication to the French Govern-ment which had been drafted in thecourse of the Meeting.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
