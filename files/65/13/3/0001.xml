UP) 115th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE, jfcConfidential Annex.(6th May,      1940.)OPERATIONS in norway.Narvik.(previous reference:ff.M.(40) 112thConclusions,jllinute 3 T)lAir support.Bardufossaerodrome.-0THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that.M.S. ARK ROYAL would begin operating with 27 Skuasthat morning     It was anticipated that she would be ableto continue operating,  if necessary, either intermittently-at full effort or continuously at reduced effort untilWednesday, 15th May,THE FIRST SEA LORD said that ARK 20YAL Wouldbe protected by .6 destroyers, against submarine attack, andan anti-aircraft cruiser.    She would be working well tothe north of Narvik and would return to re-equip with aircraft after the 15th May.    If, however, floatplanescould not be provided to work at Narvik by that date, ARKROYAL would have to try and continue in operation a littlelonger.It was hoped that H.M.S. GLORIOUS would arrive inthe Narvik area on the 15th May with 18 Roc, 6 Walrus and Swordfish machines, all on floats.As it was thought that the aerodrome at Bardufosswould be ready to take Gladiator machines before it could take Hurricanes, it had been intended that H.M.S. FURIOUSshould, in the first place, take on 18 land Gladiatorsand sail for some place to the north of Narvik as soon asthe Gladiators were ready,    She would then &quot;be in a positionto fly off the Gladiators at the earliest moment after the aerodrome was ready.

Considerationof reply toLord Cork&apos;message of6th May,1940.It was anticipated that the interval betweenthe time when Bardufoss aerodrome would be fit forGladiators and the time when it would be fit forHurricanes would be sufficient to allow H.M.S. FURIOUS,after flying off the Gladiators, to go south and returnwith a load of Hurricanes.The possibility of sending H.M.S. GLORIOUS tothe Narvik area with an equipment of Gladiators andSkuas for operating from the carrier had   beenconsidered, but had been rejected, as it was thoughtthat a heavier air effort could be maintained with thefloat planes than by H.M.S. GLORIOUS acting as a carrier.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that Colonel Ljungbagthe Norwegian Minister for Defence, who was now in thiscountry, had stated that he had received information thatBardufoss aerodrome would be cleared of snow and ready for use by May 12th.   A telegram from Lord Cork, received that morning, had stated,   however, that nothing wouldbe ready before mid-June.      Colonel Ljungberg had telegraphed to Norway giving instructions that everyeffort was to be made to get the aerodrome ready foruse at the earliest possible moment.A number of Bofors and 3.7-inch guns were ontheir way.The First Lord read out a message(No.2355/5) from Admiral Lord Cork (a copy ofwhich is attached as Appendix I) referring  to the unanimous representations which had been made to him bySenior Army Officers, to the effect that a direct attackon Narvik in present circumstances would be unjustifiable.

The First Lord said that it was not clear from the telegram whether Lord Cork accepted these views.The First Lord then read out a draft replyto Lord Cork, which had been prepared by the Chiefsof Staff, seeking; information as to whether LordCork agreed with the views of his military advisers onthe question of an assault on Narvik;    stressing thepolitical importance of the early capture of Narvik;but stating that the final decision as to whether the assault should be made must be left to him   (LordCork).     He would be fully supported whether he decided for or against direct assault.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that he proposed to send, in addition, a private and personalsignal to Lord Cork referring to paragraphs 5 and of his telegram (2355/5) and asking:(i)   Whether the practicability of usingwarships for landing troops, on thelines of the action taken by H..M.S.IMPLACABLE at Gallipoli, had beenconsidered.(ii)    Whether it would be practicable fordestroyers to go alongside the wharvesin Narvik.During the discussion which ensued, the WarCabinet were informed that Colonel Trappes-Lomax,Colonel of the Scots Guards, who was in charge of theactual troops who would carry out the landingoperation, was of the opinion that a direct assault on Narvik in present circumstances was not justified.There was general agreement that the tenorof the draft telegram prepared by the Chiefs of staff was all in the direction of pressing for a direct

assault.      It was most important not to send anymessage which would bring pressure to hear on LordCork and might cause him to take action against hisbetter judgment.The War Cabinet were of opinion that theright course was to send a message to Lord Cork whichwould elicit his own appreciation of the position.Should the telegram to Lord Cork invite himto ask General Auchinleck to give his opinion on theproblem?   The General was due to leave in a convoysailing on the following day, but it was not theintention that he should take command at Narvik untilthe town had been captured.      It was generaly agreedthat Lord Cork should be informed that general auchinleck was on his way and would be available for consultation.       He would have to be sent up to Narvik,however, by the quickest possible means, and not in an ordinary convoy.In the course of discussion, the followingpoints were touched on:-(l)   What, were the relative merits of at directassault as compared with the more deliberateOperations which were now proceeding? &apos;In -\wigking this issue, it must be rememberedthat, for every day&apos;s delay, the scale ofair attack would increase.The danger of this attack was greatestduring mobile operations, since movementover the snow-covered ground naturallyattracted bombing.     Once the phase of movement was over and the troops werefirmly established at Narvik, they wouldhave very much less to fear from the air.The base establishments and the shippingusing the port would, however, still be in danger from the air.

(2)   Had we sufficient troops in the Narvikarea for operations of a deliberatecharacter?     It was thought that enoughtroops were available.       The demi-brigade of Chasseurs Alpins which had been namsos, could, if necessary, be sent up after refitting.      Deliberate operations for the capture of Narvik would, however,be slow.(3) Were the Germans likely to be reinforced by air? This possibility must be borne in mind.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that therehad been a report that German aircraft were operating from a frozen lake to the eastward of Narvik, wherethey were dropping supplies and parachute troops.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR referred toa report received from the South Wales Borderers fromthe Ankenes Peninsula, that a considerable number oflarge German aircraft had been sighted flying eastwardson the 5th May.(4) What action could be taken to reduce thescale of air attack on our troops in the narvik area?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that itwas proposed to bomb Stavanger aerodrome that night.He had, however, received strong representations fromthe Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command, asto the unsoundness of attempting to bomb the aerodrome at Trondhjem.     Trondhjem was at the limit of range of our aircraft;    and the nights were so short that theaircraft had to approach in daylight, and they could therefore only send over single machines at a time-.Even then there would be a heavy wastage of aircraft which were urgently required for mine-laying.     Moreover,we should be frittering away aircraft unprofitablywhich we might at any moment need very badly for operations on the Western Front.

Instructionsto GeneralAuchinleek.In the course of discussion, reference wasmade to the definition of the object of the Narvikoperations set out in W.P.(40) 144.       This object was defined as follows:-&quot;To secure and maintain a base in northern norway from which we can:-(a) Deny iron ore supplies to Germanyvia Narvik..(b) Interfere so far as may be possible with ore supplies to Germany fromLulea.(c) Preserve a part of Norway as a seat of Government for the Norwegian king and people. &quot;THE PRIME MINISTER said that the immediateobject was surely to preserve a part of Norway as aseat of government for the Norwegian King and people.Failure to achieve this would have a very badpolitical effect, not only on neutral Governments, butalso on the French.     The principal justification for operations at Narvik was that if we captured it, itwould be a potential threat to the Gallivare orefields..     In these circ\amstances, Narvik was bound to attract German air attack, and the question arosewhether such attack would be a bigger drain on Germanythan the defence would be upon ourselves.       He wouldlike to be reassured on this matter.THE FIRST LORD OF THE.ADMIRALTY said that a paper on this very question was to be considered by theMilitary Go-ordination Committee later that day.     he hoped to be able to prepare a note on the matter forthe consideration of the War Cabinet at an early date.He emphasised how very serious would be the reper-cussions of accepting a defeat at Narvik.       These

Richmond Terrace, S.W.-1.-would include the following:-(i)    It would show that our will to win and ourfighting capacity were less than those ofthe enemy.     The difficulties of the germans in the Narvik operations were no less than our own, and if we accepted defeat withouta hitter struggle,it would have a devastatingeffect on world opinion.(ii)    Norway would probably give in and makepeace with Germany.(iii)   As long as a battle for Narvik was raging,the temptation to Germany to violate Swedishneutrality would grow, and it would be to our advantage to have Sweden in the war on our side, since this would involve a big diversion of German effort.    Moreover, we should thenbe able to attack the ore fields and Luleadirectly from the air.(iv)   Provided we established ourselves at Narvik,however bitter the struggle might be, weshould be able to mine Lulea and bomb the ore ships even if Sweden did not come in.Our principal objective was to stop theLulea traffic, by which Germany would haveto get in 8 to 9 million tons of ore this summer.     This was an object which it waswell worth making the greatest efforts to achieve.Undoubtedly the Narvik operations would meanexpenditure of our air power, but the Germans wouldhave to expend theirs too.      It would be better for us if the air fighting took place at Narvik   rather thanover our own shores or in the Low Countries.The War Cabinet agreed: -(i)    That the telegram contained inAppendix II should be despatchedimmediately to Lord Cork.(ii)    That General Auchinleck should besent to Narvik by the quickestmethod in order that Lord Corkmight have the benefit of his advice.       Arrangements should bemade for him to travel by air if practicable.

APPENDIX^.5 E CE El, MESSAGE. IN,cProm P.0 . Narvik,2355/5/Kay.Date 6/5/40.Received 0421,NAVAL CYPHER (D) BY W/T,Addressed Admiralty.IMMEDIATE,136.      For Admiralty and for &quot;ar Office      Referenceprojected direct attach on Narvik the following unanimousrepresentations made by senior army officers are forwrrdedfor consideration.      In view of their unanimity I feel bound to refer the matter to the judgment   of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment which I do with great reluctance.      Begins1&apos; There are insufficient assault landing craft toput ashore an adequate force to cover landing of troc- s inunprotective craft.      Only half the A L C&apos;s out of 14&quot;required are available.2. Employment of local craft and trawlers isnecessary to supplement motor landing craft of which thereare only five.      Trawlers and local craft require a steeplysloping beach and with limited information and bad chartsit is uncertain whether they will ground within reach ofrocks.3o .   This means on only practicable front for assaultonly one small beach is available for each assaultingbattalion and one of these in 150 yards long.      Both arebordered by high rocks and steep slopes over which men couldbarely clamber let alone assault.4. CO.    H.M.S. AURORA. S.O.  Ofot Piord patrolsupports these views.5. During approach landing craft will be in sight of enemy for 1-g hours it is daylight throughout the 24 hourssurprise of any sort is therefore impossible.6. Men in open boats will be subject to air attackfor at least 4 hours.7C Ships carry no smoke shells and the use offunnel smoke and smoke  bats   is dependent on remote chanceof a suitable wind.8. Troops will be unable to dig on account of rocksand frost and so get protection from air attack against which there will be no adequate defence for the preaeiiu.

f0 Brigadier Eraser and all military officers experienced in war fully agree.      General Maclcesy whose attitude has been most helpful had no previous knowledge that these representa-tions were to &quot;be made.      lie has been doing his utmost tocarry out my orders but I fully realized his personal viewremained as he had always given it and as contained in hisG 53 of (? 21st April).He iiow adds that since that date situation in airhas grown worse and he regards an opposed landing in face ofunopposed enemy aircraft as being absolutely unjustified.The alternative to this direct attack is to continue with the development of base while keeping Narvik blockaded;,and to await as proposed the prearranged movements now proceeding, but at present making slow progress.2355/5,Advance copy sent....to &quot;Duty Captain (2.) and Xlax  Office0

APPENDIX II.FOLLOWING FOR LORD CORK IN REPLY TO HISSIGNAL 2555 - 5TH MAY.Your 136Whilst grounds for taking Narvik speedily areweighty, especially in view of effect on neutralsand probability of increasing air attacks,  themilitary views expressed in your Telegram cannot he lightly set aside.
