They had, therefore,decided to stay on, and give it out that, as theAllies had left them and they had no ammunition, theywould give up fighting and would remain, and wouldnegotiate with the Germans on the terms of stoppingfighting.     The King believed that the Allies wouldwin in the end, but the Norwegian would look on him andthe Crown Prince as deserters if they left their people to the mercy of the Germans!In discussion it was suggested that pressureshould be brought to bear on the King to embark atonce with the Royal Party and&apos;the Members of theGovernment that had returned to Norway.
