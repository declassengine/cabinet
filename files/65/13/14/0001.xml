(^HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.)v- MOST      S E, C R E T - Copy No. ;j fj gW.M. (40)  155rd CONCLUSIONST MINUTE 9.Confidential Annex.(82nd Mavt 1940.)SUBVERSIVE THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that theACTIVITIESIN LONDON. Prime Minister had asked him uo raise at the War Cabinetthe position disclosed in a document which he hadreceived, the general effect of which was that CaptainMaule Ramsay, M.P., who was the principal organiser ofan organisation known as the &quot;Right Club&quot;, had been engaged in treasonable practices in conjunction with an employee (a United States citizen by name Tyler Kent)at the United States Embassy.THE SECRETARY uF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENTsaid that he was in possession of a full report dealingwith this matter, which showed that a. woman named AnnaWolkoff, who had been interned some two or three dayspreviously, had been in relations with an employee atthe United States Embassy where he had held the positionof code and cipher clerk.    It appeared also that CaptainRamsay was in relations with this woman and also with sir Oswald Mosley, though, as regards the latter, notin connection with this woman.   With the consent of theUnited States Ambassador, a search had been made of therooms occupied by the employee referred to above, anda large mass of incriminating documents had been discovered, including a sealed packet containing a book in whichwere recorded the names and addresses of the members ofthe Right Club, which the employee of the United states embassy had admitted had been confided, to him by CaptainRamsay. ^

Continuing, the Home Secretary said that hi \) 7proposed to consult urgently with the Law Officers asto the action to be taken against Captain Ramsay.    Ifhe were interned only, he could be interrogated freely,but, if a prosecution was-contemplated, this would notbe possible.   The Right Club had hitherto been regardedas a semi-secret society, mainly anti-Semitic in itsobjects, and pro-Nazi only in a secondary degree.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said that thiswas obviously a most serious matter.    The informationdisclosed that, under the guise of anti-Semiticpropaganda, this body had been carrying on pro-C-ennanactivities and secret subversive work, with the objectof disorganising the Home Front and hindering the prosecution of the war.   Further, the Lord president said that the report disclosed that Anna Wolkoff hadmeans of communicating with persons in Germany.In discussion, the view was expressed that, in existing circumstances, action should be taken as quickly as possible against members of the Right Club.The view was aiso expressed that action could be ta.kengenerally against persons known to be members of thisorganis ation.The War Cabinet  (l) Invited the Secretary of State for the home department, in conjunction with the LawOfficers, to consider as a matter of urgencywhether the man principally implicated shouldbe internee&apos; only (in which case he could be freely interrogated), or whether he shouldbe prosecuted (in which case he could not beinterrogated);(2) Authorised him, in the light of the consultationreferred, to in (l), to take such action as seemed appropriate in regard to persons knownto have been members of the organisation.Prima facie, the V/ar Cabinet favoured the viewthat action should be taken a.gainst these persons.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
