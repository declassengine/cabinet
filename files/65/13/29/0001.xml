COPY HO., g &amp;W.M.  (40) 151st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.4.Confidential Annex.(1st June, 1940.)OPERATIONS OP Lord Gort said that, so far as concerned theTHE B.E.P., advance into Belgium, things had gone according to plan.jjAY, 1940. The B.E.F. had arrived on the Dyle well up to schedule.They had not been assisted, however, by the King of the belgians&apos; request that they should not go through thecentre of Brussels.When they had reached the Dyle line they had found that the Belgians had not carried out the workwhich they had undertaken to.    There had been nocontinuous anti-tank obstacles in the Gembloux gap.    Thede Cointet obstacle had been moved forward to a linerunning through Perwez and there were large gaps in itin front of the British sector.    None of the other riverlines back to the Escaut had been organised for defence.General Gamelin had not had the temps utileon the Dyle to which he had looked forward, as the resistance of the Belgian forces opposite the Maestrichtpeninsula had collapsed almost at once,    The speed ofthe German advance had coincided almost exactly with theestimate of G.H.Q. Intelligence Staff.The next trouble he had had to face had beenthat the French Army on his right under General Blanchardhad not had the powers of resistance anticipated.    It hadcomprised a number of units of native troops which had beenshattered by the effect of dive-bombing and tanks.    Thesame thing had happened in the case of the troopsholding Dinant, who had retreated as soon as they were attacked by dive-bombing.General Blanchard was of the professorialtype.   He had no initiative, no drive and no determination,and some of his subordinate Commanders had no confidence in him.    Again, there had been a lack of any realco-ordination.    The British had always urged that theyshould have French troops on their left, but this hadnot been fulfilled, and they had found themselves with the belgians on their left and the French on their right.IThe time taken in effecting co-ordination with the armies of two different Allies had added to his difficulties.General Billotte, who had been appointed tobe the SJrand Co-coordinator of the Allied Armies of theNorth, had been a great disappointment.    In person abig impressive man, he was in fact completely flabby.During the four days on the Dyle Lord Gort said he hadreceived only one order from General Billotte and that hadbeen given to him as a result of pressure which he had himself brought to bear on General Billotte.    GeneralBillotte had ordered a stand on the Antwerp-Wavre-Charleroiline, but at the time this order had been given, the French

were already requesting our Air Force to &quot;bomb Gharleroi.In other words, the order had been out of date at the timewhen it had been given.Lord Gort said that it had become obvious thatwe should have to retire from the Dyle line.    A plan of retirement had been arranged with the French, but thelatter had begun to retire before the hour agreed upon.It was no uncommon occurrence to agree with the French to retire at, say, 9 p.m. , and to find that the French troops on the line had,  in fact, begun to go back at 4.Lord Gort said that the next step which hehad taken had been to interview the King of the Belgians.He had had a talk with him at Antwerp and had found theKing in a very nervous condition.    His Chief of Staff,General von Overstraeten, who was a courtier and not a soldier, had been in an. even worse condition.    It had beena pity we had not known earlier the type of man we had todeal with.The King had been in tears and General vonOverstraeten almost stunned.    No real direction hadbeen given to the Belgian Army, and the resistance ofthe Belgian troops on the Albert line had by this timecollapsed.Lord Gort said that when he had said that it wasimpossible to continue to hold the line in front ofBrussels, the King and General von Overstraeten had accepted this view.    When the British troops had retired,he had blown up the bridges in front of their part of theline.    The French, unfortunately, had not done so, and asa result German tanks had been able to get through.Lord Gort said that the other cardinal mistakewhich had been made had been the action of the french in sending General Giraud&apos;s army into Holland.    There wasonly one line of approach into southern Holland, namely,through Antwerp.    There there was a single bridge and a tunnel which depended for its ventillation on twoventillation plants.    One of these had been knocked outby a German bomb, and the safety of the whole of general giraud&apos;s&apos;s army had depended on the other plant remainingintact.This French army had done no good in Holland.When the French had found there was a big gap in their line and that    they had no reserves to fill it, they had atonce given orders to General Giraud&apos;s army to retire.The result had been that almost all of General Giraud&apos;s army had withdrawn across the lines of communication of the British forces.    This had given rise to greatconfusion.The next stage in the battle had been theEscaut line.    This was a difficult line to hold, but the belgians had been keen to hold it in order to secureGhent.    Our part of the line had been more difficult tohold by the reported action of the French in turning onthe water to flood their part of the line, and thereby

decreasing the amount of water in front of our sector.The 44th Division holding the line in front of Oudenardehad &quot;been driven in by heavy German attacks.    Lord Gortsaid that he had seen the King of the Belgians and had told him that he thought it was necessary to retire tothe line of the Lys0    The King of the Belgians had agreedto do so, although he had said that in his view the lineof the Lys was not a good line to hold.    Lord Gort had offered to case matters hy extending our front up toCourtrai in order to help the Belgians; hut he hadstipulated that the Belgians must maintain contact between their right flank and our left flank.   He had alsostipulated that they should start flooding the line of theYser from Dixmude to Nieuport.    This the King of the Belgianshad undertaken to do0When they had got hack to the line of the frontierdefences, the French had had a large number of Divisionsoccupying a relatively short front on the line from Condethrough Valenciennes towards Bethune.    The French had saidthat their men were extremely exhausted and could do no more..    It had &quot;been irritating to see the French sittingdoing nothing, and saying that they were incapahle of movement, although they had done less than our army,who had fought all day long and marched all night.At this point, it had &quot;been suggested that theB.E.F. should make a push to the south, to meet a Frenchthrust northwards from south of the Somme.    Lord Gort saidthat he had never had very much faith in this French thrustsNevertheless, he had spoken to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, who was visiting General Billotte, and had said that he would put in an attack with two Divisionstowards Arras on the line of the Scarpe.    It had &quot;been understood from General Weygand that the French v/ould make an attack at the same time from the direction of Peronne.Lord Gort said that he had then gone to see general blanchard and had urged him to capture Cambrai.    general blanchard had &quot;been unwilling to attempt this.    He (LordGort) had said that General Blanchard might at least send out a force to see whether there were any large forcesof Germans in Camhrai.    General Blanchard had agreed todo so.    Next day he had said that his troops had advanced to Camhrai, hut that they had been attacked hy dive-bombing,and, as the British fighters had not come to their help,they had had to retire.    General Blanchard had said thathis troops were epuise and could do no more.    General de laLaurencie had been extremely dissatisfied with the french command and had wished to come under his (Lord Gorfs)&apos;Command, hut he had explained that this was a matter forthe French and British Governments.The next morning General Billotte had come tosee him at 1 a.m. and had said that he wished to showLord Gort a map,    This map had shown the gap in the lineas occupied hy eight Panzer Divisions, andwith the heads of some 16 other Infantry Divisionsfollowing them.    General Billotte had said &quot;What can I do?&quot;and had indicated that an attack was to be made thefollowing afternoon by some &quot;division cuirasses&quot; from thesouth.    After that, the effort would be finished.-   He hadbeen terribly depressed.

99 RC L 0Lord Gort said that he had then gone to seethe King of the Belgians who had again assured him that steps had been taken to flood the Yser line.    Although hehad made three requests on this matter, he believed thatproper steps were never taken by the Belgians to floodthe Yser.Lord Gort said that the next day he had gone to see General Blanchard at Dunkirk and had found theGeneral with the Admiral Word and General Fagalde in aconcrete fort.    The Admiral and General Fagalde had beenin this fort for some days, almost without leaving it,and therefore took a somewhat detached view of the position.Nevertheless, they had been thoroughly depressed.At Dunkirk at about 11 p.m. he had also seenGeneral Koeltz who had said to him &quot;Do you realise that theKing of the Belgians is asking for an armistice atmidnight?&quot;    He (Lord Gort) had said that this was news tohim.    The Belgian Staff had told him that they were retiringto the north and he had protested at their failure tomaintain contact with his Left Flank.    The immediate taskhad been to fill the gap between ourselves and the Belgians.The 12th Lancers had used their armoured cars as mobilepillboxes and he had pushed in other troops to occupy theline of the Ypres-Comines Canal.They had had a piece of good fortune, however, inthat a German Staff Officer who had been killed had had amongsthis papers plans for the various German thrusts;    these included an attack by a German corps on the Ypres-CominesCanal.    Lord Gort said that he had turned all the medium and heavy artillery of I Corps on to meet this attack, andhe thought that they had given the Germans a great deal more than they cared for.At one moment the B.E.F. had been holding some80 miles of front.    On the line Douai-St. Omer they hadblown up every bridge and they had put in small forces toguard the line.    The French troops when they saw theGermans advancing were apt to retire.    This had happenedat Carvin, but a territorial battalion of the NorthumberlandFusiliers had counter-attacked and driven the Germansback.The next day General Blanchard had come to see him.    He  Lord Gort) had told him that his orders were towithdraw to the coast with a view to embarkation.    general blanchard had said that his army could move no further,that his troops were exhausted, and that General Prioux andGeneral Altmayer were determined to fight matters outwhere they stood.    He (Lord Gort) had said that while therewas life there was hope.   He had told the French that hewould hold the line Cassel-Ypres and that they should comeback on to that line.    The French had said that if theBritish occupied this position they would expose the Frenchflank.   He had replied that he could not under his ordersstay where he was and sacrifice the B.E.F.    general blanchard had then gone off, heavy of heart, apparentlyresigned to do nothing.    General de la Laurencie, when hehad heard what had passed, had gone to General Blanchardand asked leave to take his corps to joint LordGort.    General Blanchard had allowed him to do so.

9 9 7L 6 iGeneral de la Laurencie had abandoned his transport and had marched his men to the north and had come intothe Dunkirk perimeter with over 5,000 men.    Lord Gorthadpressed strongly that arrangements should he made to ship General de la Laurencie&apos;s men hack to England,and he hoped that this had been done.     It was alsoworthy of note that, notwithstanding what had been said about fighting it out where they stood, GeneralAltmayer had also turned up at Dunkirk the day before.Lord Gort said that he had pressed general blanchard to return to England with him, since he wasno longer in command of any body of troops.      general blanchard, however, had not received instructions fromGeneral Weygand to leave.General Lord Gort said that the German generalshipcomments on had been extremely good and the junior leadership hadthe position.       also been first-rate.    Their staff work he thoughtwas no   hetter than ours.      The individual Germanleadership was, however, remarkable.       He saw some signs that the German bombers had begun to lose theirnerve.      It was not unusual to see them break away from formation and drop their bombs anywhere in the fields.It was the German tactics to feel for thesoft spot and having found it to press hard.     they made great use of trench mortars and dive-hombing,both of which frightened the French troo.ps.     Hethought that we should make more use of trench mortarswhich were easy to move about.      The French &quot;Char-B&quot;had been useful, but their Hotchkiss tanks had not beena success and had suffered very heavily.Asked by the Lord President of the Councilwhether our equipment had been satisfactory, Lord Gortsaid that our equipment had done extremely well.     both our 2-pdr. anti-tank gun and our Bofors gun (althoughwithout the predictor) had been a great success.    Our&quot;I&quot; tanks had succeeded in covering great distances.They had gone up to 40 miles a day whereas they were notsupposed to go more than 10 miles a day, but they had suffered rather severely from mechanical defects towardsthe end.     Perhaps our main defect was the absence ofa tank with a gun. It was better to have a gun inan armoured car than a tank without a gun in it.Lord Gort then described the position atDunkirk.     He thought that it would probably bepossible to hold the line until the night of lst/2ndJune but it might be a near thing.      It had alreadybeen necessary to close in the perimeter defence line to the frontier.     There had been some danger at Berguesearlier, but the flooding had now made this area safer.He was certain that no time should be wasted and that every effort should he made to finish the evacuationon the night lst/2nd June.      It might well be thatthere were more French than British troops in the perimeter but he doubted if there were many french troops of real fighting quality left in Dunkirk.
