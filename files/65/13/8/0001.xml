Four of these alone representedsome two million tons of oil, and their destructionwould have an immediate effect in slowing up theoperations, since the German General Staff would atonce be obliged to   consider    the effect of this loss on the conduct of the immediate operations.    the attack on the oil refineries could, moreover, be combined with one on the marshalling yards.    If,however, this attack was to be successful, it wasimperative that it should be ordered as soon aspossible during the waxing of the moon.   With thewaning moon, which rose later each night, thenightly period of moonlight would grow progressivelyless oTHE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explained thatin   no    circumstances would it be economical to-base heavy bombers in France, and that they should operate from this country.    The General and AirStaffs had, meanwhile,  carried out a joint study of the rail communications which should be attacked.This had been on the assumption that the principal

German attack was in the North.    It would be necessary  to revise this study in the light of thelatest situation, with a view to selecting targetswhich would have the effect of arresting the german advance in the South.    The translation of this change of target would inevitably result in a delay in the execution of the new attack by the bomber Command, as the preparation for such anattack demanded some 24 hours before the attackitself could be launched.   He therefore impressed upon the War Cabinet the need for an early decisionon this point.The War Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chief of the Air Staff should arrange for a joint study by the Generaland Air Staffs of the targets which could most profitably be attacked by our heavy bombers, on the assumption that the weightof the German offensive   was in theSoutho(b) To take no decision in the meantime inregard to the employment of our heavy bomber force.Richmond Terrs.ce, S .W.1 *
