MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(27th May, 1940.)WESTERN FRONT.Progress of operations.(previous reference:W.M.(40)  139thConclusions,Minute 1. )THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the meeting withMo Reynaud the previous afternoon,  complete agreement hadbeen reached that the British Expeditionary Force mustbe withdrawn to the coast.    The B.E.F. was being pressed on both flanks, and the Germans had made a break in theline East of Courtrai.    It was clear that we could not allow the security of our Army to be compromised in orderto save the First French Army.   He asked the Chief of theImperial General Staff to make the position in thisrespect clear to Lord Gort.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL wished it tobe on record that,  in his view, M. Reynaud, in the conversations the previous afternoon, had at first tried to place upon the B.E.F. the responsibility for thewithdrawal from Arras, and had attempted to make out thatthis withdrawal had made it impossible for th^ wrench to deliver a smashing attack from South of the *    in point of fact, there had never been any likexihood of theFrench delivering an effective attack from the South.M. Reynaud had, in the end, been persuaded to accept theBritish point of view, and the French agreement to our withdrawal to the coast had been given without recrimina-tion.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that an officer who had just arrived from Lord G-ort&apos;s headquarters had reported on the conditions on the roids, and represented that it was vital to have fighter protection.   Everyeffort   would be made to provide this protection, butdemands were also being received from the Belgian army for assistance in the Courtrai area, where the enemybreak-through might have very serious  consequences.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat our troops in Calais were still holding out withgreat gallantry.    Some of the garrison had been withdrawnin Naval vessels, and were to be replaced by other men ofthe same unit.It was recalled that on Friday last the Brigadierin command had been given one hour to surrender.The most serious attack was that on the Belgianline in the neighbourhood of the Comines Canal, and therewas grave danger of collapse.   Two British Divisions, the5th and 48th, had been sent to their assistance.    Onthe previous  day the Germans had attacked at Carvin and towards Hazebrouok on a ten-mile front.    It was to beexpected that if the Germans were held on that front,they would apply pressure elsewhere.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought thatit would be desirable to warn Mr Bruce of the dangers ofhis defeatist attitude.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that Mr Bruce&apos;s attitude was not shared by the PrimeMinister of Australia, from whom he had received a pledgeof the whole of Australia&apos;s resources in the event ofFrance going out of the war.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it would be aswell that he should issue a general injunction to ministers to use confident language.   He was  convincedthat the bulk of the people of the country would refuseto accept the possibility of defeat.THE SECRETARY !?F STATE FOR WAR thought thatthere was also a danger of a general assumption that france was going out of the war.   Unless and until thathappened, we should all assume that the French wouldfight on.There was  complete agreement with the views whichhad been expressed by the Prime Minister, the lord president of the Council and the Secretary of State forWar.The War cabinet invited the Lord President of the Councilto see the Dominion High Commissioners andto take the line indicated at A. above.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,-3

MINUTE 3.Confidential Annex.(27th may  1940.)THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that atelegram had been received from Lord Cork asking that a bomber squadron should be sent to Norwayto assist in the evacuation, but that it was not clear whether Lord Cork required the bombers at narvik in order to bomb advancing Germans, wnomight impede his embarkation, or whether he wished the bombers to take offensive action againstTrondheim.     Tho Chiefs of Staff were of theopinion that it would not be justifiable to sendbombers to Narvik for the purpose suggested.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF informed the WarCabinet of the details of the timetable for theevacuation of Narvik.    It was hoped that theevacuation would be completed by 6th June.Some discussion took place as to when weshould inform the Norwegian Government of our intention to evacuate Narvik and it was agreed thatthe question should be brought before the WarCabinet again in two or three days time.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY referredto the views which had been expressed by theCommander-in-Chief. Home Fleet, on the desirabilityof evacuating Narvik.    He (the First Lord) held the view that the chances of invasion of thiscountry would be increased if we left Narvik where we were containing much greater forces than our own.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he fully appreciated the force of the arguments which hadbeen put forward by the Commander-in-Chief, home fleet, but they had been unable to move him fromhis conviction that our only course was to evacuateNarvik.The War Cabinet took note of theabove discussion and agreed that thequestion of informing the norwegian government of our intentions should-be brought before the War cabinet again in two or three days&apos; time.Richmond Terrace, S*W&amp;i&amp;

(40) 141st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 9.Confidential Annex.(27th May, 1940).BRITISH STRATEGYIN THE NEARFUTURE.The War Cabinet had &quot;before them twoReports by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(40) 168 andW.P.(40) 169), and,a Note by the Minister without portfolio (W.P. (40) 171) referring to W.P. (40) 168.Comparativestrength of theBritish andGerman Air Forces.THE PRIME MINISTER dealt with the mainReport by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(40) 168) first.In his opinion this Report did not give a truepicture of the position.    In particular hechallenged the Tables of the British and German earstrengths (Appendices &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; ),. which gave   amisleading impression.    He had caused a statisticalexamination of the comparative position of the twoAir Forces to be made,  and although it had been extremely difficult to arrive at a true comparison,there v/ere certain observations which he wished tomake.(i)    During the last theee years, accordingto the figures provided by the AirMinistry, the Germans had turned out25,000 aircraft and we had produced15,000 i.e. a ratio   of 5 to 3.    On this basis it was quite misleading to say thatthe Germans had a superiority of 4 to 1over us.    Either we credited the Germanswith getting a much greater operationalstrength   out of a given production than ourselves, or we made insufficientallowance for all the difficulties which,if our own experience was to be any guide,they must have encountered in expandingtheir air force,(ii)    We knew the very large requirements of ourown training establishments and formations,,If the German Air Force was really four times as large as ours, presumably their training requirements must similarly be four times as great and would amount toan enormous total.      Unless we believedthat the Germans succeeded in carryingout their training with a far smaller proportion of wastage than ourselves(which seemed unlikely), we must acceptthe fact that training requirements madefar greater inroads into their operation-al strength than was shown in the tables.

(iii) In January, 1940, the Air Ministry had estimatedthat Germany was turning out 2,000 aircraft per month.    A detailed examination of this estimatehad heen carried out by the Ministry of economic warfare, however, and as a result of this theAir Ministry had finally accepted a very much lower estimate of only 1,000 aircraft per month.Our whole policy might depend on our assessment of the German air strength, and it was therefore essential that all estimates should he subjected to the most detailed scrutiny.( iv) With regard to the figures for the MetropolitanAir Force given in Appendix &quot;C&quot;, the late Secretaryof State for Air had given as his forecast off first-line strength on the 30th June, 1940, a figureof 2,150 aircraft.    The figure given in the Tables,however, amounted only to 1,256,  to which must beadded some 200 to 300 aircraft in France, a totalof, say, 1,550.    If these figures were correct, theywould imply that we had lost two-fifths of our effectivefore- since active operations had began on We stern Front.The figures of our losses up to the 24th May were 360,but against this must be offset the new intake since may 12th of 610 machines.The Prime Minister said that he proposed to go into these Tables of comparative strengths himself and try toobtain agreed figures on a truly comparable basis.    The Germanbombing force might be four times as great as ours, but he did not believe the ratio was anything like so great in respectof our total air force.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that the AirMinistry figures of 15,000 aircraft produced by otirselvesduring the last three years referred to aircraft without their full equipment.    The German figure of 25,000, however,covered aircraft complete in every respect.    It was theGerman system to turn their aircraft out of the factory withall ancillary equipment.    Out of the total of 15,000 which wehad produced during the last three years, a certain proportionhad had to be sent to the Middle East and other places overseas,as well as to the Fleet Air Arm. Germany, on the otherhand, had no extra Metropolitan air force.    It was true,however, that Germany had supplied very considerable numbersof aircraft to foreign customers, and he would ensure thatdue allowance had been made for this.With regard to the revised estimate - of Germanmonthly production at 1,000 aircraft per month, this figurecovered operational types only.THE VICE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF agreed thatAppendiees &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; were not drawn up on comparable bases.The British figures referred to operational strength, and theGerman figures to first-line strength.    An attempt had beenmade to arrive at a true basis of comparison, and he handed to the War Cabinet a comparative Table drawn up on theselines. ( C*U aMnttM^).THE PRIME MINISTER observed that from this Tableit appeared that the odds against us were only 2i to 1.    irour airmen were shooting down 3 to 1, the balance was on our side.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out that at night the balance would be very much less favourable for us.

Terms of aGermansettlementwith Prance.It was only in the day fighting that we were able to inflict such heavy losses on the enemy.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR drew attention tothe importance of the factors of morale and superiorequipment.    One of our fighter squadrons operating from Kent \had given battle to a crack German squadron equipped with me.110s.    The Germans had fought extremely well, but their losses had been very much greater than ours.THE PRIME MINISTER paid tribute to the skill ofthe Air Ministry&apos;s designers which had produced such a fine fighting machine as the Hurricane0Continuing, he observed that the Chiefs of staff report was based on the assumption that French resistancewould collapse completely, and that we should be exposed at short range to the concentrated attack of the whole of theGerman naval and air forces, operating from bases extendingfrom Norway to the North-west of France.    If France wentout of the war,  it did not necessarily follow that this assumption was correct;    France might become a neutral, andit was not certain that Germany would insist on retainingall the ports in Northern France.    She might be so anxiousto divide France from us that she would offer France very favourable terms of peace,-..THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL made thefollowing analysis of the two Reports of the Chiefs of Staff:-:(i) The main Report was based on the assumption thatthe United States of America would be willing togive us full economic and financial support.    Thiswas perhaps not an unjustifiable assumption, but we might not obtain this support in the immediate future.(ii) If France collapsed, our greatest danger was invasion bothby sea and air,  and particularly by armoured forces,against which we had in this country insufficientmeans of defence,(iii) Germany would undoubtedly try to invade us, but before she could do so she would require a greater measure of air superiority over us than she nowpossessed.    Air superiority, however, could not be measured in terms of numbers only; quality and moralehad to be counted in as well.(iv) If Germany could obtain air superiority, she might attempt an invasion, perhaps from several quarterssimultaneouslyo    It would then be very difficult for the Royal Navy to deal with such expeditions in face of a superior air force.    It was only logical to expect,  therefore, that the Germans would concentratetheir attacks in the first place on our air forces and aircraft industries.Danger of air   (v) The weak spot seemed to be the aircraft industries,  toattack on       . - -      which special reference was made in paragraph 10 of aircraft W.P.(40) 169,  in which it was stated that if the(industries. enemy pressed home night attacks, he was likely to achieve such material and moral damage within theindustrial area concerned as to bring all work to a standstill.    Our own bomber forces succeeded in reach-ing their targets in Germany night after night, andthere seemed no reason why the Germans should not beable to do the same over here.    The prospect of allwork in the aircraft industries being brought to acomplete standstill was&apos;extremely serious. &apos;   .- S-

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF concurred in the analysis by the Lord President of the Council, and inhis conclusion that the kernel of the whole problem was the danger of attack on the aircraft industries.It was true that our bombers suffered very little loss in their attacks on German targets, and with the equipment at present at our disposal we had no adequatereply against night attack by German bombers.      the anti-aircraft gun was a deterrent only, and we hadinsufficient experience at present of the efficacy of fighter aircraft in co-operation with searchlights.There seemed little doubt, however, that it might wellbe possible for the Germans to stop all work in the factories, and it was only right that the Chiefs ofStaff should make this clear to the War Cabinet.     Evenon dark nights the German bombers would be able to findbig areas like Coventry and bomb them indiscriminately.If the Germans succeeded in obtaining complete air superiority, it might not be necessary for them to invade us at all-      They might reduce us by air actionalonoaSome discussion followed on possible countermeasures against attack on the aircraft industries, inwhich the following were the principal points made:-(i)    It was thought probable that the workers,when put to it, would carry on even under air bombardment, provided of course that theactual factories themselves were not destroyed,(ii)   Various scientific devices to improve thedefence and the counter-offensive were being pressed forward with the utmost urgency,notably the proximity fuze, the A.I.device by which fighter aircraft would beable to &quot;smoll out&quot; the bomber,  and thestabilised bomb sight, which was giving verypromising results.(iii)   Elxperiments on the use of smoke screens tocover industrial areas were being carried out at present in the Tyne,(iv)   The building of traverrses in the aircraft factories and means to prevent damage by theshattering of the glass in windows, etc,should be pressed forward.(v)   A counter-offensive against German oil and aircraft factories would have some effect,but unfortunately the German factories werewidely dispersed and situated in distantparts of Germany where they were very much less vulnerable than our own.(vi)    If the Germans could escort their bombers by large numbers of fighters, we should be at a disadvantage even in the daytime, owing toour inferior strength.many*s oil THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Ministry ofPlies.

grave anxiety &quot;by the Autumn, and would be criticalby the Spring.economic aspects.. THE MINISTER V/ITHOUT PORTFOLIO assumed thatwe would now adopt the policy which he had outlined in W.P. (40) 171 of concentrating every effort on --(1) the needs of the Fighting and Civil defence services, and (2) the maintenance of the civilpopulatation under wartime conditions.This was agreed to,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the suggestion in W.P. (40) 171 that astrong Mission should be sent to America to secureeconomic and financial allies.     The Foreign office were already working through diplomatic channels topress for active economic assistance.     There was alsothe Anglo-French Purchasing Mission in the States,which had established good contacts with Mr. MorgenthacuHe doubted whether there would be any advantage in sending a special Mission.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO emphasised the valuable sources of supply which might be tappedin South America.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he would do everything possible to obtainthe economic co-operation of the South American States,but he was quite sure that they would take their cuefrom the United States.Irganisation to THE LORD PRIVY SEAL referred to the state-eal with ment in paragraph 5 of W.P. (40) 169 that if Germanynvasion. gained complete air superiority, we could not preventGerman taxiks and infantry from obtaining a firmfooting on our shores.     He suggested that one of the lessons of the French debacle was the delay and failure to seize the initiative due to the elaboration of the chain of command in a big army organised forstatic warfare.     He suggested that the organisation to deal with enemy landings, which might be attemptedat a great number of different places on the coast,should be decentralised as far as possible.     We shouldhave numerous highly mobile units,  ready to actquickly on their own initiative.     The Division was too bigo     Spain and Finland had provided examples ofwhat could be done against tanks by brave and detenninafmen, and he saw no reason whatever for accepting it asa forego&quot;\o conclusion that the German tanks wereinvincible.     Positional   warfare was useless..     Theimmediate destruction at all costs of any invadingforce, whether seaborne or airborne,, was all thatmattered.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFagreed.     The whole of our organisation was based onthe   need to deal promptly with initial landingseither from the air, or on the coast.     We must, atall costs,prevent the Germans from concentrating, say,an armoured Division, in this country.     We were working on the basis of small mobile columns.

He thought it wouldhe necessary to set up a special branch of the HomeDefence Executive to deal with the whole question ofthe control of aliens.    He asked for authority toconsider what measures were necessary to this end, andto give effect to them.    This was agreed to.The Lord President of the Council also asked for authority to take action, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, to giveeffect to recommendation (viii).    In this connection he would be grateful for a statement of the views ofthe Admiralty on the importance of the immediate useof Berehaven.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that Mr,  de Valera seemed to be moving in theright direction.    He had said that he would even beprepared to accept assistance from Ulster.    He was still adamant, however, that he did not want any assistance whatever until Eire had actually been attacked.    This would probably be too late.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that lord craigavon might be asked if he would be prepared totake part in an all-Ireland Council during the periodof the present emergency.The War Cabinet agreed to leave the matter to be handled by the Lord President of the Counciland the Secretary of- State for Dominion Affairs.The War Cabinet:-Re c omme agenda t i o n s(i) and (vil)(1) Gave general approval to therecommendations contained inparagraph 23 of the Chiefs of staff report (W.P.

Re c ommen da t i on s(iii) and (iv).(5)   Authorised the Lord President of theCouncil to consider what emergency measures should he taken to deal withthe danger of Fifth Column activities,and to take immediate steps to putsuch measures into operation.(4)    Invited the Lord President of theCouncil, in consultation with theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs,(a) to make an immediate approach toMr. de Valera in order to bring home to him the danger facingEire, and the need, in order to combat it, for early and full co-operation with this country.      Inparticular he should ask for theuse of Berehaven for the Navy;(b) To invite Lord Craigavon to agreethat the Government of NorthernIreland should take part in anAll-Ireland Council during theperiod of the present emergency.(5)    Invited the First Lord of the admiralty to provide the Lord President of theCouncil with an appreciation by theNaval Staff of the importance to theNavy of the immediate use of Berehaven.(6)   Invited the Prime Minister to conducta searching examination into thestrengths of the British and german air Forces with a view to revising thestatement appended to W.P.
