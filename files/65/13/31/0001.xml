Colban that afternoon , and&apos; to tell him that the norwegian government had been informed of our intention towithdraw Allied troops from Narvik.Operation&quot;Paul&quot;.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 155thConclusions,Minute 9 .)The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs thought that it was most unlikely that the Mowinckelplan would materialize;    but if it did it would stillbe possible for our aircraft to fly over the southern part of Norway, which would not be neutralized, to theGulf of Bothnia.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thathe understood that six German ships were already ontheir way to Lulea but that, owing to the necessityfor our aircraft carrier giving protection to the narvik withdrawal, it would not be possible for us toundertake any operations in the Gulf of Bothnia for about a fortnight.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.

MINUTE 10.WESTERN FRONT.Futureassistance toFrance.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 152ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Confidential Annex.(3rd June, 1940).The War Cabinet had before them a Reportby the Chiefs of Staff putting forward recommendations as to the reply which should be given to the Frenchdemands for assistance on the Western Front(W.P. (40) 189).THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the Reportaccurately set out the arguments for and against thedespatch of forces to France, but his personal view was that the proposed assistance was not sufficient.It was recommended in the report that we should sendtwo divisions;   but he thought that we should   promise to send a third division, provided that the Frenchcould supply the artillery for it.    During the interval before the third division could sail, we should havereceived from production 150 field guns and 80 anti-tank guns.    The position would therefore be somewhatbetter than that stated in paragraph 11 of the Report.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked if the possibilityof simultaneous attack both on the French and on thiscountry could be ruled out.    Would the Germans be ina position to attack both objectives if they threwin the whole of their forces?THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF thought thatthere was a possibility of simultaneous air attack,but he thought it more probable, and more in keeping with the German technique, that the Germans would first of all attempt to knock out France.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFthought that simultaneous attack on France and On thiscountry was possible, but not likely,Re-organisabion THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFof B.E. F, informed the War Cabinet that he had seen the commanders of the B.E.F. divisions that morning, andhad impressed on them the vital importance of gettingtheir formations into fighting trim as soon as possible.Two Bren carriers would be provided for each battalionand two anti-tank guns for each tank regiment.

Withdrawal ofgrafts from France.Despatch of AirFormations to france .With reference to paragraph 9 of theReport, the War Office were examining whether itwould he possible to send a reconstituted B.E. F.division instead of the 43rd Division to Prance.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thathe was anxious to withdraw the drafts for theB.E.F.  divisions who were, at present, in France,South of the Somme.    Their proper function wasto effect replacements in the divisions of theB. E. P.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that, fromthe political point of view,  it would he very-difficult to withdraw any considerable number ofmen from France, at 3 moment when the French wereurging us so desperately to send reinforcements.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFthought that it would be possible to carry out the gradual withdrawal, of these drafts at a later stage.In reply to a question, THE CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that the 52nd division would be ready to embark in about a week&apos;s time andwould take some ten days to transport to France.The next division would probably be able to followimmediately afterwards.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL pointedout that the situation might have changedconsiderably by the end of the next three or four weeks.    He therefore saw no harm in promising tosend a third division.    We should know better wherev/e stood before the division was ready to sail.Summing up the discussion in connectionv/ith military reinforcements, THE PRIME ministers aid that he was in full agreement with the viewof the Chiefs of Staff that it would be a mistake to s end the Canadian division to Pranceforthwith.    He proposed that we should tell theFrench that it was, of course, our intention tore-constitute the B,E.P.     The loss of the great bulk of our equipment would mean delay, but we hoped to fulfill  our undertakings within sixmonths of the dates originally given.    In the meanwhile, we were sending two divisions at once and a third would follow, provided that the Frenchcould supply artillery.Turning to the question of air forces,THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that on the 10thMay    we had had the following air forces in France.In the Air Component.4 Squadrons of Hurricanes,5 Army Co-operation Squadrons,(Lysanders).2 Squadrons of Blenheim Bombers.2 Army Co-operation Squadrons.(Blenheims).

In the   Panther Force.2 Squadrons of Hurricanes.&quot; &quot;   Battles.2       &quot; &quot;   Blenheim Bombers.If the recommendations in the report were adopted, we would have a smaller air forcein France than at the beginning of the battle.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed outthat the Advanced Air Striking Force had throughoutbeen an integral part of the Metropolitan Air Force,which had been located in France for operationalconvenience.    The two squadrons of fighters had been included in the force in order to protect theforce itself;    and not to defend France or theFrench Army.    The Advanced Air Striking force should now, in his view, be incorporated in the air component.    He recommended that our forces inFrance should be limited to six squadrons ofBattles and three fighter Squadrons,   in additionto the appropriate number of Lysanders andBlenheims for Army Co-operation, in accordancewith the strength of our military forces in France.He emphasised that our fighter defenceshad been organised to meet the bomber attack onthe United Kingdom from bases in Germany and were inadequate to meet short-range attack accompaniedby fighters.    He reminded the War Cabinet thatduring the intensive fighting in May from half to three quarters of a squadron had been lost everyday.    Our losses in fighting over France were muchgreater than   in fighting over this country,since the pilots of machines which had been shot down were seldom recovered.    Again large numbersof aircraft had been destroyed on the ground inFrance and the difficulties of repair were muchgreater.    Against the advice of the Air Officer,Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, we had sent/to France, over and above the fighter squadrons in .the Air Component and Advanced Air Striking Force,/girot f-g-s^aa4yens, then 0 g^g^gTlHEEI$lS^es-qua-arj2iis--iia-opj^^ They tSHdr-eeen ,opopating.at maa:minimun-.lntunoi&apos;b^ ever bliiuu bltn-id&quot;fch-Ma$&amp;,THE AIR OFFICER COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF,FIGHTER COMMAND, produced a graph illustrating the wastage in Hurricanes which had resulted from therecent intensive operations in France in the ten days 8th-18th May,.     250 Hurricanes had beenpermanently lost;    i.e., an expenditure at the rateof 25 a day, against 4 a day received from production had this rate of wastage continued throughout Maywe should have expended all our Hurricanes by theend of May.&quot;first four squadrons (64 aircraft), then 8flights (48 aircraft), then 32 aircraft from thefirst line at Home, making a total of 144aircraft to operate&apos; &quot;for a few days&quot;, in additionto 6 squadrons which had been ordered to operate in relays over France and Belgium at an early stage of the battle.    All these aircraft sentto Prance had been operating at maximumintensity ever since the 10th of May. &quot;

The fighting over Dunkirk had involved a tremendous strain on our fighter resources.    that very day, the last three squadrons of the fighter command which had not yet been engaged in the battlewere being withdrawn from Scotland to take part inthe operations.    At the present time the bottle-neck was trained fighter pilots.    On the previous night it had been necessary to call upon no lessthan 8 squadrons in order to make up a strongpatrol to cover the evacuation.    If the enemydeveloped a heavy air attack on the country at. this moment, he could not guarantee air superiority for more than 48 hours.THE PRIME MINISTER mentioned the heavy strain on the German Air Force.THE AIR OFFICER COMMANDING-IN-CHIEFagreed that we had inflicted heavy losses on theGermans, and he hoped that if an attack was launchedon this country we should be able to withstand itas a result of the greater fighting spirit of ourpilots.    Air war was, however, largely a matter ofattrition, and we needed to destroy German machinesat the rate of 8 to 1 in order to achieve clear air superiority.    In recent air fighting the enemy air losses had been in the proportion of 4 to 1...   Thefighting over France in the &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;had, on the other hand, been most wastefulfrom our point of view, and the rate of destruction had only been of the order of 1^ to 1, or even less favourable to us.It was vital that there should be norepetition of the conditions which had recentlyoperated in France, and that we should use our resources economically.    Our fighter operationsmust be regulated by the rate of output in such a manner as to ensure that we were not squanderingthe capital of our fighter aircraft.    This meant that we must not send to France more fighter squadrons than we could see our way to maintain..In reply to a question, the Air OfficerGommanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, said thatthe number of fighters serviceable on the 2nd june was 244 Hurricanes and 280 Spitfires.    This, however,did not represent the true picture, as a number ofthe pilots now in Fighter Squadrons had not yet done their first solo on 8-gun Fighters, and it would take some six weeks before they were sufficiently proficientto take part in active operations.In this connection, Air Chief MarshalDowding emphasised the importance of maintaining the high quality and fighting spirit of our Fighterpilots.    To ensure this, our pilots must not besent out except after adequate training, and instrong numbers, under conditions which would make them feel that their chances of survival were good.Given a reasonable period of respite from thepresent intensive operations,the output of trainedFighter pilots could be accelerated and theposition restored.

Whilst there was evidence that the morale ofthe German Air Force had &quot;been shaken as a result of thevery severe casualties which they had suffered, It wasto be remembered that out of their very large numbers,they had new squadrons on which to fall back.In conclusion, the Air Officer Commanding--in-Chief, Fighter Command, pointed out that, quite apartfrom the tremendous   drain which would he involvedin the despatch of any large numbers of Fightersto France, he was faced with a very formidable taskin reconstituting the Home Defence squadrons which had suffered heavily as a result of the recent operations in France.   Moreover, this had to be done at a time whenhe had to be prepared for an .air attack on this country which might be launched at any moment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that it seemed clear from what Air Chief MarshalDowding had said that the War Cabinet v/ould find itdifficult to go beyond the recommendations of theChiefs of Staff in the matter of giving air support toFrance.    He thought the case could be presented on thegrounds of wastage of aircraft and the lack of trainedpilots.    He was, however, anxious that we should not fall between the two stools - on the one hand of sending air forces which would be insufficient for their task in France, and on the other hand of unnecessarilyweakening our own forces in this country.A discussion then ensued on the question ofthe employment of our long-range bombers in support ofthe forthcoming land &quot;battle in France.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR considered thatthe most fruitful contribution which the MetropolitanAir Force   could make would be to continue Hie attackon objectives in Germany itself and not to he drawn offinto attacking targets on the battle field.    All theevidence of recent operations went to show that the bombing of roads, bridges and similar objectives wasvery unprofitable.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR considered thatthe land battle would so dominate the situation that itwould be impossible to neglect calls upon our MetropolitanAir Force to deal with such targets as the concentration of troops.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatthe French would be conducting the land battle, and thatthe necessary machinery was in being to enable them toask for such &quot;bombing operations as they might requirein support of this.     The Metropolitan Air force had, in fact, engaged every target of this character which had &quot;been asked of it in the past.   During the&quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot;, for example, the whole ofthe activities of our long-range bombers had been diverted to the attack of targets directly connected withthe land battle - though this.was a procedure whichhe himself had felt could not be justified on militarybut only on psychological grounds.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL was strongly in favour ofour long-range bombers continuing to exert pressure by the bombing of objectives in Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that allpossible pressure on objectives in Germany shouldcontinue to be applied by the Metropolitan Air Forceup to the opening of the land battle, but it would thenbe necessary to give priority to the needs of thelatter.   Any forces not employed in the battle couldbe used to attack targets in Germany.Continuing, he suggested that the french should be told of the air support which we could send to France in the first instance, and that the matter should then be reconsidered in ten days.    To them it looked as if we had some 500 fighters of incomparablequality which we would be withholding at a moment whenthey would be making a supreme effort on land.    Itwould therefore have to be pointed out to them thatwe were at this moment staggering under the enormousstrain of the recent operations in France and wouldrecover if we were given sufficient respite.    Untilthen, however, we could not do more than bring up to strength the six bomber and three Hurricane squadronsnow in France.    The despatch of any more fighter squadrons at this moment would be uneconomical,because it would be impossible to maintain them.The War Cabinet agreed:-That a reply should be sent to the Frenchdemands for assistance on the western front on the following lines: -(I) Land Forces.(a) A B.E.F. Headquarters in Prancewould be re-established at once.(b) We should indicate that we intended to build up a new B.E.P.in Prance as soon as possible,but that progress would necessarily be slow, havingregard to the fact that the divisions of the B.E.F. withdrawnfrom the Northern Front wouldhave to be entirely re-equipped.(c) We should offer to despatch 2Divisions and a proportion ofCorps troops to France as soonas practicable;    i.e., the 52ndDivision, starting   within abouta week, and another Division(either a re-constituted Divisionof the B.E.F. or the 45rd Division&quot;)in the latter half of June.

(d) We should offer to send a thirdDivision as soon as possible thereafter, but the date by whichthis Division would be availablewould depend largely on the date when its artillery could beprovided.      We should invitethe help of the French on thispoint.(II) Air.(a) The 6 Bomber and 3 Hurricanesquadrons now in France would bebrought up to full operationalstrength as soon as possible,and would be supplemented by army Co-operation Squadrons.(b) The remainder of the MetropolitanBomber Force would remain based onthis country, but would continueto give support as in the past,priority being given to the land battle.(c) The reply should indicate that thevery serious losses of the past three weeks made it quite impossiblefor us to send any further fighter squadrons to France at the presenttime, but should not entirelyclose the door to furtherconsideration of the position inthis respect at a later date.Richmond Terrace, S,W.l.
