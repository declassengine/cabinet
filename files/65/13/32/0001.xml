His own view was that we could not refuse tomaintain in France the same number of squadrons as v/e had hadthere before the last battle started, while keeping a larger number of squadrons than ever in this country at one time during the battle we had been down to 29 fighter squadrons inthe Air Defence of Great Britain whereas now rye had about 45t,According to figures produced by the Minister of aircraft production we had now more aircraft available in thiscountry than we had had before the German invasion of theLow Countries began-    We could never keep all that we wantedfor our own defence while the French were fighting for their lives,,Considerable discussion followed on the question ofair support to France in which the following points were made:(i)    THE MINISTER FOR AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION hoped that itwould be possible to keep up a rate of productionof 400 aircraft of all types a week, at least. throughout the month of June,,    Fighters were comingout at the rate of SS^a day.    The chief bottleneck was fabricated raw material0    He gave thefollowing figures for casualties and production:-s Whitley5s WellingtonHampdenk Blenheim/ Battle5  Hurricane55 SpitfireDefiantHudsonBeaufortAns on/ Swordfish/ Gladiatorr Hector/ SkuaLysander,,TOTALo1st Priority TypeCasualties15^1.May711171584321197561031211122524436P^jdu^jbi,ori19the; May..,,- 1st Juno.20421972151391292733NOTEo/ Not in current production,-(i) Casualties do not include aircraft repairablein situ,,(ii) Repaired aircraft not included in Production,Casualties in fighters amounted to 194, against 190produced.

(ii) THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR pointedout that the period selected above forcasualties did not include the first fewdays of the battle, when our losses in the battle of the Bulge had been particularlyhigh and the comparative casualty rate hadbeen very much less favourable to ourselvesthan later on when aircraft rod bee&apos;; operatingnearer home.      Moreover &quot;one productionfigures were in respect of aircraft deliveredfrom the factories to the air storage unitsoSuch aircraft would not be complete with all their equipment and could not therefore all be counted as fit for service-    Ancillaryequipment was the bottle neck.      He expressed his appreciation of the efforts of theMinister for Aircraft Production to increase output and asked that the Air Ministry mightbe supplied as early as possible with a revised forecast of the production position?(iii) Although the total number of fighter aircraft now available might be slightlygreater than on 10th May,  the overallefficiency of Fighter Command was very much less.      Owing to the very heavy losses which our fighters had sustained, squadrons were nowgreatly disorganised, and many of the leadershad been lost,      It would take a considerable time to reorganise the personnel and aircraft and re-form them into tactical units fit to operate against the enemy,,      Otherwise weshould run the risk cf a disaster by throwingin to the battle unorganised units.        if additional squadrons were to be sent to France,more leaders would be required and the re-organisation, of the fighter defences of theUnited Kingdom would be correspondingly delayed.(iv) The strength of the fighter forces in.this country had been originally fixed at 56,on the assumption that the Germans would notbe in possession of the Low Countries,-      Wewere now down to 45 aquadrons, with the enemy in possession of all the Channel ports,  evenif we did not send any additional squadrons toFranceo      The casualty rate had been far higherduring recent operations than we had budgetedfor, owing to the fact that squadrons had been operating over France instead of in thiscountry, where we had far better operational and recovery facilities,,(v) To make good our losses in pilots it hadbeen necessary to expand the fighteroperational training units -      The two existingoperational training units were being increased in size, and a third was being formed, which,if it got the necessary aircraft, would start._   functioning in 14 days8  time,      A total of 60. ...      - j   fighter aircraft complete with full equipment&apos;&apos;k)0^ -Wc^* ItcJ [to   would be required for this expansion of xheJ &apos;      &quot; ,.       ^ ! &quot;operational training units0      Incomplete air-J- 4*^   fLv craft would be of very little value in thesev      I \ units whose function was to train pilots forkjlcvvcd^) Ktf***vs&amp;Ak I   combat j and not merely to fly the fighter typesn    i   of aircraft.

(vi) It was pointed out that the AdvancedAir Striking Force in France had only beenthere for convenience and counted as partof the air forces in the United Kingdom.It had not been provided specifically forthe defence of France, though it was available for use either for the defenceof the United Kingdom or of France.     now that the front had come so far back thisinterchangeability no longer held good,Some   discussion followed on the best wayof replying to the French on the question of sendingadditional air support0THE PRIME MINISTER agreed with the terms ofan amendment to paragraph 4 of the draft telegramproposed by the Secretary of State for War, at least as a preliminary reply to the French.     He felt strongly that, from the psychological point of view,  it wouldbe very much better to send a larger number of squadrons to France than to increase the strength of squadrons by sending the equivalent number of aircraft.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that we should emphasise to the French thatthe v/hole success of the Allies depended on keeping upthe production of our aircraft factories.      If these were lost, the French, as well as ourselves, could notavoid defeat.      It was therefore no less to their advantage than our own that we should run no risks inthe air defences of Great Britain.The discussion then turned on paragraph 3 ofthe draft telegram relating to the despatch of land forces, to which certain amendments were proposed.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the Star Office were making every endeavour to despatch, as the second division promised, a reorganisedand re-equipped Regular division instead of a Territorialdivision.      So far as possible the despatch of this second division would begin before the first division tobe sent had completed its move overseas.He also drew attention to a request which hadbeen received from the French that we should take overthe air defence of the ports on the north-westernseaboard of France.THE PRIMS MINISTER drew attention to ParisTelegram No. 359 DIPP in which Sir Ronald Campbell reportedthat M. Reynaud had demurred to the suggestion thatthe French Air Force were not pulling their weight0He had said that they were losing aircraft at the rateof 37 a day, and their daily intake only amounted to 18,which included 8 from America.     These figures had been confirmed by Air Marshal Barratt.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR reported thatthe Vice Chief of the Air Staff had landed at Villacoublayjust when the raid on 3?aris was starting.      In spite of

previous detailed warnings from us that a raid was coming in,  only 3 French aircraft out of 40 which were on the aerodrome, had taken off to intercept the raiders0Despite the warning from us the pilots had not beenready for immediate action.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF confirmed that full warning of the raid had been sent to the Frenchthe previous day0    They had &quot;been informed of the routeit v/ould follow and of the rendezvous for the raidingsquadrons.    Air Marshal Barratt had sent up an aircraft which had intercepted the raiders at therendezvous and had given the French three-quarters of anhourTs notice of its arrival.    No doubt fighters hadbeen sent up to intercept the raiders from otheraerodromes - the Vice Chief of the Air Staffs reportreferred only to Villacoublay0    Nevertheless, it appeared that there was room for improvement in the Frencharrangements0THE PRIME MINISTER asked the Chief of theAir Staff to provide him with full details of thisoccurrence in order that the facts might be brought home to the French,    He felt that it was a time forplain speaking.The War Cabinet:-(i)    Invited the Prime Minister, inconsultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for War and theSecretary of State for Air,  to revise the draft telegram in thelight of the., discus si on which hadtaken place.&quot;(ii)   Invited the Chief of the Air staff to supply the Prime Minister with full details of the warning whichhad been given to the French of the raid on Paris on the 3rd June, with aview to bringing to the notice ofM. Reynaud the defects which had been disclosed in the French organisation for air defence.(iii)    Took note that the Minister for aircraft Production would supply theSecretary of State for Air withrevised forecasts of aircraft production on which the Air Ministrycould base their organisationprogramme055   A copy of the  telegram, as despatched is attached.

Telegram to Madelon, ParisIMMEDIATE.      0IPHEH.Following from. Prime Minister to General Spears for communication to M. Reyn aud.Begins.In reply to the message which you gave General Spearsto deliver to me on the 2nd June, I gave you my assurance lastFriday that we would immediately consider, without making any definite promise, what reinforcements we could send to france at once, and what air support we could afford to you in the impending battle2.     Let me first emphasise certain general points,(i.) That portion of the British Expeditionary Force which hasbeen recovered from the Northern Front will have to be entirelyre-equipped before it can be usedo      (ii)   The three divisions which you mention as being available in your message are not yetfully equipped,     Under our original programme the first of them would&apos;have been despatched to France towards the end of thismonth.      (iii)   Almost the entire fighter force has been engagedin the recent battleQ     The operations have been of an intensitynever before contemplated, and the losses in aircraft andparticularly in pilots have been correspondingly high.    I wouldmost earnestly ask you to appreciate that the above pointsmaterially affect the assistance that we can immediately render.3,      Our proposals are as follows,,     As regards land forces,we will re-establish a 3.E.F, headquarters in Prance and buildup a new B.E.F. as fast as we can.   One division is being prepared for immediate despatch, and will begin to proceedoverseas within seven days.     A second division, one of theseasoned regular divisions recovered from Dunkirk,  is being-equipped with greatest urgency, in order that it may follow the first division as quickly as possible.     A proportion ofCorps troops will also be despatched within this period.      It isnot possible to give you the precise date at which a thirddivision could be despatched, but we will press it forward as fast as possible.      The date at which this division will be readymay well&apos; depend largely on the date when its artillery can beprovided.     Could you help in this respect?     The appropriatecomponent of Army co-operation aircraft will also be despatched to France.4,     As regards fighters, the three squadrons now in Franceare being brought up to strength immediately.      In view of thevery serious losses of the last three weeks it must take some little time to overhaul our squadrons,  seek to replace our losses,,and determine what further help we can send and when.     We fully appreciate need for extreme urgency, and I will communicate with you further on the subject at the earliest possible moment.5.     As regards bomber aircraft, we intend to bring the squadrons now in France up to full operational strength assoon as possible.      The remainder of the Metropolitan bomber force will remain, based on this country, but will continue togive support as in the past   - priority being given to the land battle, and to action against objectives selected by your high command.4th June. 1940.

(40)  154.TH CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex,,(4th rune, 1940 - 11,30 a.xa. )THE FIRST SEA LORD said that phase two of the narvik Evacuation had been proceeding the previous evening.With regard to the destruction of Norwegianoil stocks, our information had been to the effect thatthere were some 12,000 tons at Harstad and 20,000 tons at Tromso, but Lord Cork had stated that these figures were greatly in excess of the actual amounts.    Lord Corkestimated that there were about 3,000 tons at Tromso andsmill amounts elsewhere and doubted the advisability of antagonising the Norwegians by destroying such smallstocks.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.Richmond Terrace, S,W. 1,
