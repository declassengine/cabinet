action on our part.      If we hesitated, they wouldgive way all along the line.      If they had nostomach for continuing, they would find plenty ofother pretexts for withdrawing.      In thesecircumstances, it would he best to continue toexpress our sympathy and to avoid recriminations,hut to act solely in accordance with the dictatesof our own safety.He (the Prime Minister) agreed with this line, which he proposed to take in a statement tohe made in Parliament.     We could not he expectedto release ships, aircraft and gold, all of whichwould he afterwards turned against us hy the enemy.A long discussion followed as to the action we should take to secure the French warships.     Theprincipal points made were as follows:-(l)   Whatever assurances the French might havereceived from the Germans, we could not prevent the enemy obtaining possession ofthe ships unless they were either scuttledor taken in possession hy us.      It would bea great temptation to Germany to use somepretext of non-fulfilment of the terms ofthe armistice to seize the ships when they came into ports under German or Italiancontrol, to he demilitarisedo     Moreover,the terms of Article 8 of the armisticeleft it open to the Germans to take as muchas they wanted of the French Fleet for&quot;coast surveillance and mine-sweeping&quot;.    Horeliance whatever could be placed upon the safeguards in this Article.      The best hopethereforelay in a French Government being setup     in North Africa, whose orders FrenchOfficers might be prepared to accept.    Butthe prospects of this were none to bright.If we were to stop the ships being handedover, we should have to act quickly.(2)   The only ships which we had actually under our control at present were those at alexandria and in harbours in the UnitedKingdom.      RICHELIEU and JEAN BART werebeing closely watched and should give notrouble.      There remained, however,  severaldestroyers, some cruisers, 90 submarines andthe whole of Force de Rade, consisting of2 battle-cruisers and 4 cruisers.      All the submarines still in French hands were at various places in the Mediterranean.Unfortunately, it was the least valuablepart of the Fleet (apart from the twomodern battleships) which was under our control.(3)    It might be a wise move to remove the crewsfrom all the small ships at Falmouth and southampton and repatriate them under as. pleasant conditions as possible.     A few ofthem could be sent round to the larger french ships in home waters in the hope that they/ould persuade their comrades to acceptrepatriation.     Even action on these lines,however, would amount to a virtual act ofwar, and it would be open to Admiral Darlanto say that, in these circumstances, he couldnot be expected to fulfil his previous

assurances to us that no ships would, he allowed to fall into enemy hands intact.(4)   Admiral Estava had made two points clear:-(i) He would obey the orders of hisGovernment, subject only to the proviso that -(ii) He would not hand over french ships intact to the Germans.If we seized any of the French ships, andthe German Government in consscuencedemanded that all the others sheaid- be -handed over intact for use against us,,Admiral Estava might feel that our use of force had released him from his obligation.(5)    The attitude of the Admiral commanding theForce de Rade had been that he wouldobey the orders of the constitutional government of France so long as oneexisted.      If there were no Governmenthe would continue to fight on our sideon his own responsibility.      this assurance, however, was of no value tous, since the Bordeaux Government was at present the only Government in France.(6)    The morale of Force de Rade wascomparatively high,  and it was unlikelythat the Admiral would be bluffed.      IfDUNKERQUE and STRASBOURG had to be tackled by force, it would be a difficultproposition.      The harbour defences atOran were powerful, and owing to theposition of the ships, they could not betorpedoed from the air in harbour.(7)    The EMILE BERTIN with  60,000,000 of goldon board was of very great importance.We did not want this ship scuttled and allthe gold lost to us.      She was expected inMartinique&apos; at noon on the 25th.     H.M.S&apos;.FIJI had been ordered to Martinique - afaster ship than H.M.S. DUNEDIN - but she would not arrive until late on the 26thJune;    before she could cross the Atlanticshe would probably have to re-fuel.(8)   Prom the broad point of view, the use of force against the French ships, whichwould necessarily involve casualties tothe crews, was to be avoided.      It wassuggested, therefore,  that we should allow the French ships to move to theirrendezvous as ordered by the FrenchGovernment, but should maintain forceswatching them all the time.

(9)    Broadly, there were two alternatives open tous.      The first was to take immediate actionto ensure that the main units   of the french fleet did not fall into the hands of theenemy,      If necessary, we should notscruple to use force to secure this end.The second was that we should allow theships of the French Fleet to go to the ports of rendezvous laid down,  and to watchevents closely, heing prepared to take action at once if we saw any risk that theships would fall into German hands.(10)    It was necessary to act promptly, sincesix hours after the terms of an armisticehad heen agreed to between France andItaly, the Germans would start to giveeffect to the armistice conditions.     Theymight at once fly over personnel to theNorth African French ports..(ll)    We might make a formal communication to theFrench Government that it was clear thatthere was a grave risk of the French shipsfalling into German hands and that thiswas a risk which we could not accept.      Weshould therefore demand that the ships shouldbe scuttled within a time to be specified;otherwise we should be forced to take action by force against them.      Such an ultimatummight be coupled with the removal of all french crews from ships under our control.(12)    On receipt of such an ultimatum, some   of theFrench ships now in harbour might put to sea.       This would be to our advantagesince it would be much easier to deal withthem there than if they were in harbourunder the protection of their own guns.It was not to be expected that the Frenchcrews would put up any very seriousresistance in any case.(13)    As regards French warships now in british ports, the position would be that we should hold these ships for the war.     the crews of these vessels should be allowedto return to France without their arms andequipment hy any convenient means thatpresented itself.      Similar action would naturally be taken with regard to any French naval vessels that fell into our hands on the High Seas.The War Cabinets-(i)    Invited the prime Minister andthe Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to draft an ultimatum to the FrenchGovernment on the lines proposed at &quot;X&quot; above.

(ii) Invited the First Lord of theAdmiralty to arrange for a&quot; naval staff appreciation to he prepared asto the action which would heinvolved if it was found necessaryto take action hy force againstFrench warships not at present under our control *(iii) In this connection the First Lordof the Admiralty would consider what changes in fleet dispositionsmight he immediately required.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
