COPY NO.     t^&quot;QW.M.  (40)  168th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1..Confidential Annex.(16th June, 1940 - 10.15 a.m.)The War Cabinet met to consider a requestwhich had been received from the French for theBritish Government&apos;s authorisation to enquire,through the United States Government, what armistice conditions would be offered to France by the enemy(vide Sir R. Campbell&apos;s telegrsm No.. 420 DIPP).  .THE FIRST SEA LORD reported the presentdispositions of the French Fleet and the arrangements which had already b een concerted with the FrenchAdmiralty with a view to safeguarding it.     TheCommander-in-Ghief, Mediterranean, had been instructed to try and keep with him the French ships now at Alexandria, consisting of one old battleship,two 8&quot; cruisers, two 6&quot; cruisers and some destroyers.The Force De Rade, consisting of two battle-cruisers and four 8&quot; cruisers, was at Oran, together with two battleships.     The other 8&quot; cruisers were atToulon.     He had already communicated with admiral darlan regarding the two ships under construction,RICHELIEU at Brest and JEAN BART at St. Nazaire.RICHELIEU could get away from Brest at any timeunder her own steam.     JEAN BART could only getaway from St. Nazaire at certain states of the tide,and the earliest date would be the 20th June, but she would be able to move under her own power.Admiral 0dend&apos;hal had informed him three or four days ago that in his opinion the crews of the French warships would be quite willing to bring their shipsout to British ports, but was somewhat doubtfulwhether they would fight them if all resistance inFrance on land was at an end.Admiral Darlan would now be with the FrenchGovernment at Bordeaux, where H.M.S. BERKELEY would very shortly be arriving, if she had not already reached it.     She would be able to get right up toBordeaux, close to the French Government, and thus be available for direct communication.H.M.S. ARETHUSA, which would be arriving next day, might not be able to get&apos;right up the riverto Bordeaux, but in this case H.M.S. BERKELEYwould remain at Bordeaux for communicationpurposes.SUGGESTEDARMISTICEBETWEENFRANCE ANDGERMANY.The french navy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 167thConclusions,Minute 6.

Prance1srequest tobe relieved from theundertakingnot toegotiateseparately.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the issue put tous hy M. Reynaud was a perfectly plain one.    The FrenchGovernment were insisting that before they left Frenchsoil they must at least find out what the enemy&apos;s terms for an armistice would he.    This seemed to imply thatthere was some possibility that if the terms were tooharsh, the French Government might be willing to carryon the struggle from outside France..    We had now todecide whether we should release them from their obligations to us not to enter into any discussion ofterms.      The question of their acceptance or refusal ofsuch terms would arise later when the terms themselveswere known.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that itwas clear that there was no more hope that the french would maintain their resistance in France.    our objectives therefore must now be:-(i) To save the French Fleet, since if this fellinto the hands of Germany, our position would very seriously deteriorate.(ii) To ensure that a French Government of some sort continued in being which would, at leastnominally, carry on the war.As regards (ii), we were being asked not toraise objections to the French Government enquiring theterms of an armistice.    If we did object, it was clear from Sir Ronald Campbell&apos;s telegrams that the presentFrench Government would probably resign and their successors might be very much worse from our point ofview.    M. Reynaud had told the Ambassador that he couldnot guarantee that his successor would maintain thedecision reached by the Council of Ministers that the surrender of the Fleet would be considered an unacceptablecondition (Telegram No.422 DIPP from Bordeaux).    Tniswas an argument which was very difficult to resist,and it seemed therefore that we had no choice but to consent to the French making enquiries.    He thought,therefore, that we should inform the French that we v/ouldnot stand in the way of their making enquiries as to theterms of an armistice, but that we should insist thatthere would be no acceptance of the terms without prior consulation with us.    In the meantime, we should take all possible steps to save from the wreck as much aspossible that we required ourselves, and should renewour invitation to the French Government to take asylumwith us.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL agreed that any organised resistance in France was now out of the question.    Theessential point was to secure the French Fleet.   he doubted whether, even if the French Government movedout of the country, they would be able to take any very active part in the war.    Obviously, they would be toosusceptible to German blackmail in the form of severe

pressure on the people who remained in Prance.Since, however,  the present French Government was more likely than any other to refuse to surrenderthe Fleet to Germany, his own view was that weshould consent to their request to be allowed to enquire the terms of an armistice.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSconcurred with these views.     It was clear fromSir Ronald Campbell&apos;s telegrams that if we refusedour assent, M. Reynaud would be forced to resignand we should then be faced with the greater of twoevils.     As to President Roosevelt&apos;s position, hehad gathered from hints dropped by Mr. Kennedythat the President, when pressed earlier to declare war had felt that, once he had taken that step, hewould have played his last card and could do no more.       He had therefore been keeping it in reserve for just such a situation as had now arisen.     he wanted to be able to say to Hitler &quot;The terms youoffer to France are impossible.     If you insist upon them, America will declare war&quot;.THE LORD PRLSIDENT OF THE COUNCIL agreed.President Roosevelt was keenly interested in the fate of the French Fleet.     If Germany made the surrender of the Fleet a condition of the armistice,the President could threaten to declare war unless this condition was modified.     If Hitler assentedto this modification,  resident Roosevelt would still be able to keep in reserve the threat of war as his trump card.Some discussion followed on the wording ofthe terms of our consent to the French request andwhether we should refuse to give our formal assent.It was suggested that a refusal of such formal assentmight give M.   Reynaud an excuse for resigning, andthis it was most important to avoid.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that we shouldmake it an absolute condition for the granting ofour consent that the French Fleet should sailforthwith for British ports pending any discussionof   armistice terms.     We should add that until these terms were known, the further question ofpeace terms could not, of course, arise, but that inno circumstances whatsoever would the BritishGovernment participate in any negotiations forarmistice or peace.     He pointed out that it wouldbe very dangerous to assent to the French requestwith the French Fleet in an indeterminate condition.It would be important also not to give any impression that by the mere resignation of M. Reynaud theFrench Government were cleared of their obligations to us.     We had the most solemn treaty obligationsby the French Government as a whole that neitherparty during the present war would either negotiateor conclude an armistice or treaty of peace except by mutual agreement.     President Roosevelt shouldbe sent a copy of our reply, and urged not to act asa mediator in any circumstances unless the safety of the French Fleet was previously secured..

General agreement was expressed with this view.In further discussion, the SECRETARY OP STATE FORWAR drew the attention of the War Cabinet to paragraph 5of Sir Ronald Campbell&apos;s telegram No.422 DIPP, which reported M.&apos; Mandel as having suggested that Great britain would be entitled to point out to Prance that, in circumstances similar to those in which she now foundherself, Poland, Norway and Holland had not in fact given up the struggle, and that Great Britain expected no less of france .&apos;THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it might be convenient if at this stage the War Cabinet were placed inpossession of the views of the Service Ministers.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the First Lord ofthe Admiralty was unable to attend the present meeting,as he was in Scotland.    The First Lord would undoubtedlywish to insist on the condition that while the French were making their inquiries, or contracting negotiations for an armistice, their Fleet should be away from France and inharbours where we could safeguard it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR entirely agreed with the course proposed.    Our right course was to demand from France what was essential (namely the talcing of stepsto safeguard their Fleet), but no more than was essential.By so doing v/e should strengthen the hands of M. Mandel andthe more resolute elements in France.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR also entirelyconcurred in the course proposed by the Prime Minister.He assumed that our message would confine itself to dealingwith the actual French request, and would contain no hintor suggestion of the likelihood of peace negotiations between france and Germany.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed.Our message should be confined to the essential points,namely, (a) France (and not M. Reynaud or his Government)was pledged to make no separate peace; (b) we could onlyrelease France from this pledge, to the limited extent thatthe French Government now desired, if they would accept our stipulation about their Fleet.    It was very undesirable for us to be led on to wider ground at the present juncture.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS fullyagreed with the course of action proposed fay the PrimeMinister.    He was, however, a little anxious as to the time factor.    He accepted the position that no prior consultationwith the Dominions was practicable.    He would inform them of the decision taken, and would add that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom were confident that the judgment of the Dominion Governments would coincide withtheir own.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was inComplete agreement with the clear and straightforward....answer proposed by the Prime Minister-.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the view ofthe War Cabinet was now clear.     We should send a brief message to the French Government which wouldmake it clear that our Treaty was not v/ith M. Reynaudor any other individual Prime Minister but with Franceherself.     We were prepared to release France fromthat Treaty to the limited extent necessary to allow of the enquiry as to Germany&apos;s armistice terms whichthe present French Cabinet wished to make, but onlyprovided that the French Fleet was immediately ordered to sail for a British harbour.In. addition, we should have to see to it that there was no kind of suggestion that the UnitedKingdom had any part or lot in the enquiries ornegotiations.     These were initiated by France aloneon her sole responsibility.Discussion ensued as to whether the FrenchGovernment&apos;s intention was to invite President roosevelt to act as a go-between?     The view was expressed thatif the French invoked President Roosevelt as an intermediary and he accepted that office, it would be easier for them to save their Fleet from Germany1sclutches.     It was not, however, for us to make thesuggestion that President Roosevelt should be askedto become the French Government&apos; s channel of communications.THE PRIME MINISTER said that one danger ofinvoking President Roosevelt was that he might give advice which was of application to the United kingdom as well as to France.    He might, for example, issue an appeal to all the belligerent Governments to call the war off.     This might to some extent shake some sections of British public opinion, the whole of whichwas at present united and inflexible.     At thepresent juncture all thoughts of coming to terms with the enemy must be dismissed so far as britain was concerned.     We were fighting for our lives and itwas vital that we should allow no chink to appear inour armour.he French In the course of discussion the CHIEF OF THEjr Force, AIR STAFF suggested that the reply to the french should also include a proposal for the custody of theFrench Air Force, particularly their Fighter Force -the proposal being put not as a condition but as arequesti     French aircraft could be very easily flownto this country,THE PRIME MINISTER felt that, at the presentmoment,  this would introduce a dangerous complication.Admiral Darlan, at the head of the French Fleet, had afar greater name and position than General Vuillemin,the head of the French Air Force.     Moreover, the AirForce differed from the Navy in being an essentialadjunct to the French Army, and it would therefore bedifficult to argue that they should be separated atthis juncture.     The proposal was however one thatmight follow later.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thought thatif the French Government decided to establish itself in North Africa, it v/ould follow naturally that theyshould take the French Air Force with them.   For the rest,he was opposed to complicating the issue by raising thequestion at this stage.There was general agreement that no reference should be made to the question of the French Air Forcein the telegram.THE PRIME MINISTER read the draft of the telegram which he had prepared.This, after various minor alterations   hadbeen suggested, v/as approved by the War Cabinet.  A copy ofthis telegram (No. 568 DIPP) is appended to this Annex&apos;C appendix i).In further discussion it v/as suggested thatthere were a number of subsidiary points which mightsuitably be embodied in a separate telegram to SirRonald Campbell.      These incl\ided the following:-(i)    That it v/as essential that we should again be consulted if and when terms were received by the French Government fromthe German Government.( ii)   That the possibility of part of the French air Force flying to North Africa or to thiscountry should be borne in mind.(iii)    That steps should be taken to ensure thatCzech, Polish and Belgian forces now inFrance were not included in the terms ofany armistice.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was authorised to despatch a telegram including these points (No. 369 DIPP).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs read the draft .of a telegram it was proposed to send to His Manesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington,  informing him of the reply that was being sent to the FrenchGovernment.      It was possible that the President might be asked to take some part in the negotiations and itwould be desirable for him to have the British point ofview.THE PRIME MINISTER emphasised that thePresident must be clearly informed of the point we had made in our message to the French Government concerningthe French Fleet.      It should be made clear also thatif the French Fleet were in our hands and the Germansmade any threat to torture France in order to bring aboutthe surrender of her Fleet, then the United states should play its trump card by threatening a declarationof war..The Foreign Secretary was authorised todispatch a telegram on the lines proposedo   (No.  1133to Washington) ,.

Aircraft andmunitionorders in theUnited Statesof America.General de gaulle 1 visit,In the course of the preceding discussion,the LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL read a telegram which had been received from New York addressedfrom Mr. Purvis (No. 183) - Appendix&quot; II to this annex.The Lord President of the Council saidthat it was of vital importance to ensure that thereshould be no stoppage of the manufacture of warmaterial in the United States.     He therefore suggested that a reply should immediately be sentto Mr. Purvis giving him not only the authority forwhich he asked in his telegram^ but also authorisinghim to give assurances to American manufacturers,without waiting for assignments from the French,that if need be the British Government would  takeover all orders for war material which had beenplaced either for the French or for ourselves.This was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ASftyreferringto General de Gaulle&apos;s visit, said that the general had come over mainly to discuss questions ofmaterial and evacuation of specialist personnel.He had agreed that all French material coming fromthe United States would be diverted to us.     his request that we should take off some 4,000 german prisoners had been accepted,  it being agreed that german pilots and officers should be taken first.General de Gaulle had also suggested that we shouldtake some 30,000 French mechanics and up to 600,000armament craftsmen.   Arrangements v/e re being madeby the French to send over some quarter of a millionrecruits to North Africa for training.      A very large quantity of shipping would be needed for theirtransportation.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
