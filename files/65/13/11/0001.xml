THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.MOST    SECRET.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.COPY not he war effort.Need foradditionalpowers.W.M.(40) 138th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(18th May, 1940.)THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thathe had been asked by the Prime Minister to examine theconsequences of the French Government withdrawing from paris in the event of the fall of that city, as wellas the problems which would arise if it was necessaryto withdraw the B.E.F. from France.(A copy of the report by the Lord Presidentof the Council is attached to this Annex.)He had been concerned in the main with a   ^situation in which we might find ourselves obliged to*continue ovp resistance single-handed in this countryuntil the United States of America could be induced tocome to our help.     In these circumstances it would beimperative that we should abandon our present rathereasy-going methods and resort to a form of governmentwhich would approach the totalitarian.    .      He had that morning seen the Minister of Labour, who had informed him that he had already been considering plans which went some way in the direction of those which he(the Lord President) was proposing.      Meanwhile, the essence of the problem was that it would be bothimpossible and undesirable immediately to effect acomplete and revolutionary change in the whole structure of the social system of this country.     What was required was that the Government should be given powersto take such drastic measures as might be necessary tomeet the serious contingencies for which they were designed.

As a preliminary step to open the way forthe acceptance of these^measures by the country, -theLord President suggested that it would be desirablethat the Prime Minister should broadcast a statement on the following day.     This statement should be in very general terms, and should indicate that we werein a tight fix and that no personal considerationsmust be allowed to stand in the way of measures necessary for victory.     The situation might deteriorateand, if so, further sacrifices would be called for.THE PERMANENT SECRETARY TO THE MINISTRY OPLABOUR said that, in discussion that morning, theMinister of Labour had stressed the point that authority to apply measures for the control of labour would have to be vested in the Ministry of Labour ifthey were to be practicable, and that they should notbe distributed among a number of Departments, aS inthe case of the measures which applied to the controlof property.     The Minister of Labour had also taken the view that it would be essential that the controlof profits should be put into operation simultaneously with that of labour.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL agreed that the controlof profits and persons would have to be taken together.-THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that there would be a substantial equality inthe application of the proposed control of persons and property, since the Government would not be exercisingthe control universally, but only over a part of thepopulation, and a part of property.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the proposedpowers would be transitory and would be related to the

declaration of a supreme emergency.     When thisemergency arose, the Government would claim the rightto take service and property as it might think right,When the emergency had passed, the reinstatement of former rights would he considered in accordance withthe constitutional usages of this country.     he considered that the request for the necessary powers should be presented to Parliament in the simplest terms and that the details of the scheme should be left tobe worked out under the guidance of the Lord Presidentof the Council, in association with the Ministers and officials concerned.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO was in complete agreement with the principle that the State must armitself with all the powers necessary to deal with theemergency which was envisaged.     He emphasised the need,however, to make the administration of the scheme assimple as possible.The War Cabinet:-(1)    Invited the Lord President of theCouncil to proceed with the working out of a scheme conferring on theGovernment drastic powers for thecontrol of property, business, labour and services, on the lines indicated inhis Report (attached to this Annex).(2)   Agreed that the institution of these measures should be linked to adeclaration of a supreme emergency.(3)   Agreed that the draft Bill, containing the necessary powers, should be couched in the simplest terms.(4)    Invited the Prime Minister to broadcasta statement on the following day, onthe lines suggested by the lord president,  indicating the serious-ness of the situation, in order topave the way for the acceptance ofthese measures by the country.

RgPORT BY THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL.le I was asked by the Prime Minister to examinethe consequences of the withdrawal of the FrenchGovernment from Paris in the event of &apos;ohe f all of thatcity, as well as the problems which would arise if itwere necessary to withdraw the BoSoFo from France,either along its communications or by the Belgian andChannel ports.      It was understood that the objectof the examination would be to enumerate the main considerations which arise and which could then be remitted to the S20 Accordingly a meeting was held yesterdayevening under my chairmanship at which the Lord privy seal, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchynf Lancaster were presente     We were assisted by a group of officers under Sir Findlater Stewart03. We were informed that the situations which would arise in the event of a. breakdown of resistance inFrance, and in particular the question of theevacuation of the BoEoFo and the Defence of these islands were being examined by the Joint planning committee and the War office     Reports on thesematters will, we understand, be submitted with theleast possible delay;,We do not doubt that this investigation will include consideration of the effect of the campaign in France and Belgium upon the Narvik expedition.,reach Action.   40 We recommend that the Foreign Office should be requested to ascertain at once from the FrenchGovernment what plans they have formed for the removalof Government from Paris, should that become necessary,5, Our attention,   was drawn to a number ofimportant matters which would arise in the event of a french collapse,.     These matters, where action has not already been taken, are being brought to the noticeof the Departments concerned0     They include such questions as:&apos;-The removal from France of gold, arms andequipment, aircraft, machine tools andother material;The sailing of war ships and merchant ships from french Ports;The destruction of oil reserve and factories;The destruction of ships on the stocks, and the blocking of French&quot; Ports,06, We have given special attention to the preparationof a scheme which would in our view be necessary tointroduce in the event of a collapse in Prance, to enablethe British Government to take complete power overproperty, business and labour0     A provisional draft ofsuch a scheme is contained in the Appendix and,is basedon advice we have received from the Heads of DepartmentsCommittee,.^litarySituations.

APPENDIXo1, We are faced with a situation so menacing as to demand that powers should he given to the Government toenable them to exercise complete control over property,businesses and labour0     Such powers waxLd enable theGovernment to make instant use of labour and property asit thinks besto2. Competent authorities0The competent authority for the exercise of thecontrol would in each case be the Minister of the department responsible for the field of effort concerned,     TheMinister would set up subordinate authorities to exercise his powers.     These powers would be subject to the over-riding power of the Military authorities in case of grave emergency.     The subordinate authorities whichhave absolute powers without the right of appeal.3* Sanctions,)The necessary assumption is that public opinionwill be behind these proposals;    otherwise it will beimpossible to impose them in the face of a large volumeof non-co-operation0 Nevertheless some specificsanction would obviously be necessary and it is thought thatthe best plan might be to establish labour corps to whichrecalcitrants could be compulsorily assigned,.     Theselabour corps would be under discipline and analogous to prison discipline.4. Application of scheme0The scheme outlined in this memorandum would apply toall persons irrespective of age, means or sex.5, Regulation of wages and profits.It must be recognised that for the full and effective use of the powers now proposed it would ultimately be necessaryto provide for the complete regulation of wages, and acorresponding regulation of the profits on capital.      It isprobable however that at the outset of the scheme no steps could or need be taken in this direction,,6* Presentation to the Public*Careful consideration would have to be given to themanner of the presentation of these measures in such a way as not to have the effect of precipitating the collapse of Prance, since a premature disclosure would inevitablyhave that effect.     The first move would be to convince thepublic that an immediate effort was required, and this wouldhave to be stated in such a way as to suggest that furthersacrifices might be required latero     We suggest that the best way of carrying out this first instruction to the public wouldbe a broadcast to be given today by the Prime Minister.,    Ifan actual collapse occurred in Prance the case for fullcompulsion would have to be stated bluntly.    (Emphasis couldbe&quot;&quot;Xaid^OTr-trhe--powaro...^.ch the Government already had).

7o On the assumption that the country is in a state ofsiege and that the Government has &quot;been given completepower over property.and labour, the following areexamples of how it might exercise its powers in theindustrial as distinct from, the military field0(i)    Con.trol oyer pr opsrty and bus 1 i:,ess 3The Government would assume complete controlover business concerns to whatever extentm.:-j be r.o&apos;.?essary-      The first stage of this control would apply to all firms mainlyengaged on Government &quot;business, and theywould as fro:.-?: the date 0:0. which the schemeoperates be assumed xo be working on government accounts(ii)    Control; over Labour0of labour are- urgently needed in the followingcases::(l) Transport,  (ecg*    vehicles can atpresent be taken over but not the labour to drive them)0( 2*) Ship^ Repairs c.(S) Aqri cultureo      (Powers to control wouldbe particularly valuable here to stop thepresent drain on agricultural labour toother better-paid industries)a(4) CjDal^Jgines^anil Jtoek^labour e(5) Air Raid; Precautionse(6) Extens 1 ongjofHourac (In many fields ofIndustry&quot;an&quot;extension of hours would benecessary)080 It is suggested that if the War Cabinet approve,the Scheme should be worked out in further detail, inconsultation with the Departments concerned and presentedagain in a form suitable for legislations
