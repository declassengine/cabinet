It would be complete by the 13th June instead of the 18th as originally proposed.      The standard of training ofthis division was not as high as could be wished,but was reasonably good.      After further considerationit had been decided to send the Canadian Division asthe next formation,  and its move would begin on the11th June.      The despatch of this division meant thewithdrawal from the United Kingdom of the best trainedreserve we had for defence against invasion.      Afterthe Canadian Division, the 3rd Division (Regular)would be despatched, after being re-formed;      the artillery for this division would have to be providedby the FrenchiGeneral Pownall, Lord Gort&apos;s Chief of GeneralStaff, had gone over to see General Weygand andGeneral Georges to concert the arrangements to bemade for the subsequent employment of the B.E.P.  in france.Our losses in material owing to theevacuation of the B.E.P. had been very heavy, amountingto approximately 7,000 tons of ammunition, 90,000rifles, 1,000 guns, 2,000 tractors,  8,000 Bren gunsand 400 anti-tank weapons.      The supply positioncertainly gave cause for anxiety.      The possibilityof using Hispano-Suiza guns surplus to R.A.P. re-quirements as anti-tank weapons was being examined.A full appreciation of the possible formand scale of a German attack on this country wasbeing carried out under the instruction of the Chiefsof Staff.THE PRIME MINISTER read various telegrams which had passed between himself and General Spears,for communication to M. Reynaud, on the subject ofBritish assistance to the French.      Copies areappended.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.

iJbST^SBOgET;ANNEX 1General Ismay; War Cabinet Secretariat; London,(Received 5th -June, 1940o)Following from General Spears to Prime Minister.Following was written out by Reynaud before me and in presence of Weygand, Retain and Darlan:(Translation begins).Reply from Monsieur Paul Reynaud toMr. Winston Churchill5 s message of iron June, 19u1:1 *     Despatch..o.f. British. Divisions-..General Weygand? s opinion is that if no way canbe found of keeping the battle going, there are graverisks that it will be lost,      Tho despatch of the british divisions must,,  therefore, be hastened,.You tell me that the first Division will onlyembark 7 days from now,      A further 8 days will be taken up between this disembarkation and the date on which itcould be used on the Front.,      Even this first Division istherefore likely to arrive too late,.My conclusion is that faced as we are with thenew factor of the offensive launched this morning,  thedespatch of the British Divisions must be hastened to themaximum possible extent.2 *     Fighter AircrafttYou /tell me in view of the heavy losses sustained by the British Fighter strength, you are only in a position at the moment to re-equip the three squadrons at presentin France.,You thus reject, the request put forward on 3rd June by General Vuillemin and forwarded by me yesterday,kth June9 to Sir Ronald Campbell, to the effect that thereshould be/despatched to France(i)    immediately, 10 squadrons of fighters(ii)    as soon as possible.. 10 further squadronsthese 2,0 squadrons representing one half of the totalfighter strength based in the United Kingdom,:        I cannot believe that your decision will be adhered to in presence of the new factor of the german offensive,      I would recall that in his letter of

3rd June to General Weygand, a copy of which has been handed to the British Government, General Vuilleminexpressed himself as follows:-&quot;If, as is likely, the enemy launches inthe near future a fresh mass attack with tanks and aircraft against a defensive front whichis still actually in course of organisation,there are no grounds for assuming that he will-not succeed once again in breaking through our positions and in effecting a rapid and deepadvance which we shall be powerless to arrestif v/e are not in a position, at the very moment when the attack is launched, to neutralise theGerman bomber forces by means of mass action by allied fighters&quot;.General Weygand fully concurs with this statement.It is unnecessary to stress the extremegravity of the situation which would arise if theBritish fighter forces do not give our Armies thesupport asked for by General Vuillernin;    it may be feared that the battle will be lost and Paris captured by the enemy.   . The consequences of loss of the battleand of the occupation of the capital are known to theBritish Government..3.     Bomber Aircraft..I  thank you for your declaration which givesus entire satisfaction.The French Government has full confidence inthe spirit of complete solidarity which animates theBritish Government and its Head.(Translation ends).      Message ends.Following from General Spears to prime Minister.General Weygand&apos;s formula is that the battleis lost if it is not prolonged, and it is unlikely wecan prolong it without fighting aircraft.Concerning last two lines of paragraph 2.Reynaud anxious to emphasise this point wasmade by Petain.     He however told me that some reliablemen he knew felt resistance to be hopeless and shouldnot be pursued if Paris fell.     He repeated that he will

fight on, hut might he replaced fay others, otherwiseminded.-The situation obviously considered of utmostgravity,     Weygand believes Germans are endeavouring to advance down traditional line of invasion, the OiseValley.He told me he is bringing up behind point of attack divisions without any anti-tank guns,  otherswith only one or two.Reynaud wishes to draw Prime Minister&apos;attention to this consideration.     Had resistance of dunkirk been prolonged, and had it been a question of saving portion of British Army, would not fightingaircraft have carried on this battle more vital tofate of both countries than Dunkirk.Message ends.To General Ismay, War Cabinet Secretariat, London.Following from General Spears to Prime Minister.Following was handed by Weygand to Reynaud ashe entered Council Room.     Begins:(?.r 80131 a t i on fa eg ins).The Commander-in-Chief   is  compelled to record that the  appeals addressed to the BritishGovernment have remained fruitless.     We are now facing the German attack without having received any furthersupport from England.      No fighter aircraft and no fresh Divisions.(Translation ends)Weygand emphasises he (?) does not mean to criticise Britain by this message, but is   merelyreporting to Head of Government unescapable   facts.(Message ends).

MOST SECRET.   :ANNEX II.Telegram Noc  297 DIP? dated 5th June from prime Minister to General Spears forM. Reynaud and Marshal Weygand.(Despatched 5.45 p.mn)Private and Personal.1. Your comments will he examined fay General Staff who haveorders to se.Td the two divisions as soon as possible.Permit me to observe that &apos; your divisions picked out of dunkirk are not to enter the line for a month. We are trying to send one of our seasoned divisions in a fortnight.2. Fighter aircraft,      General Vuillemin&apos;s demand wasaltogether unreasonable and his letter made the worst impression on everyone heru ard greatly increased my difficulties.     Kindlylook at the paragraph in which he refers to the assistance we gavein the recent battle0 You don&apos;t seem to understand at allthat British fighter aviation has been worn to a shred andfrightfully mixed up by the need of maintaining standing patrolsof forty-eight fighters over Dunkirk without which the evacuationwould have been impossible.      The mere sorting out of theaeroplanes from the different squadrons practically paralysesthe force for four or five days.      However, I have sent youthis morning a telegram saying that we would hold four squadrons of day bombers ad two of Hurricane fighters      available for operations this afternoon in addition to ^he nine squadronsyou have already,  and I shall try to maintain the same tomorrowwhen I will telegraph again.

IMMEDIATE.MOST SECRET.M.  Reynaud when I saw him this evening told me that marshall Petain on learning of the Prime Ministers reply^to thelatest French appeal for further help in the air had exclaimed&quot;well,  there is nothing left hut to make peace.      If you do not want to do it you can hand over to me&quot;.2.      M.  Reynaud had of course scouted the idea and said he only mentioned it to me to show how grave the situation was.He asked whether I thought that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcompletely realised it.      I said that I was quite certain theydid and that they were going,  and would continue to go, as far as was possible.        If they denuded British Isles of all their air defences on the eve of invasion by all of the enemy&apos;s devicesthey would incur an unforgiveable responsibility.3.      I am deeply distressed by the reiteration of theseappeals at a time when I know you are doing all you can, but thevery grave danger in which the French stand in this hour must be their excuse.3&apos;It is thought that this refers to the Prime Minister&apos;telegram of the 4th June (73033) and not to the telegramreproduced as Annex: II.CYPHER telegram from Sir R.  Campbell (Paris).5th June,  1940.D.      8.55 p.m. 5th June,  1940.R.     10.35 p. m. 5th June,  1940.No.  351    DIPP.
