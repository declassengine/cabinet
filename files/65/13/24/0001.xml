(40) 144thConclusions,Minute 6.)(previous reference:W.M.(40) 138thConclusions,Minute 8.)COPY NO._/W.M.(40) 145th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(28th May, 1940 - 4.0 p.m. )The Meeting was summoned to consider a message received from the French Government againproposing that a direct approach should he made toItaly by France and this country.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that it might be relevant to ray that Sir robert vansittart had again seen the member of the ItalianEmbassy whose initiative had led to his (the ForeignSecretary1s) talk with the Italian Ambassador.The Foreign Secretary said that he had thoughtthat the interview had been very satisfactory from theItalian point of view.    There was, however, reason tobelieve that the member of the Italian Embassy concerned had said that he (the Foreign Secretary) had made noadvance, and that the position was hopeless.The Foreign Secretary said that Sir robert vansittart had now discovered what the Italian embassy had in mind, namely, that we should give a clear indication that we should like to see mediation by Italy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clear thatthe French purpose was to see Signor Mussolini acting asintermediary between ourselves and Herr Hitler.    He was determined not to get into this position.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the proposal which had been discussed with M. Reynaud on Sunday hadbeen as follows:    that we should say that we wereprepared to fight to the death for our independence,but that, provided this could be secured, there were certain concessions that we were prepared to make toItaly.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the french were trying to get us on to the slippery slope.    Theposition would be entirely different when Germany had made an unsuccessful attempt to invade this country.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that

there could he no question of our making concessions to       /!Italy while the war continued.      The concessions which it  / Iwas contemplated we might have to make, e.g., in regard to&apos;&apos;   1Malta and Gibraltar, v/ould have to be part of a general settlement with Germany.      No settlement with Italy which left Germany still at war v/ould be of any value to us.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said it was clearthat Signor Mussolini would not be satisfied with theFrench offer.      There was also the point that Herr Hitlermight not want Italy in the War.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that on theprevious day the War Cabinet had taken the line that nothing must be done to cut across President Roosevelt&apos;approach.      We had now learned that the President&apos;s approachhad been ill-received.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it did not necessarily follow that, because Signor mussolini had not responded to President Roosevelt&apos;s approach, hewould turn down an approach made by the French.      It hadbeen   reported that Signor Mussolini had deeply resentedPresident Roosevelt&apos;s interference.Reference was made to public opinion in Italy.The view was expressed that, although a great many people in that country were opposed to war, they would almost certainly follow Signor Mussolini if he v/ent to war.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL doubted whetherSignor Mussolini intended to come into the war at themoment.      He agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s diagnosisthat M. Reynaud wanted to get Signor Mussolini engaged in conversations.      He v/ould then try and turn those conver-sations into a Conference.      If we rejected the terms offered, he would abuse us as he had abused the Belgians that morning.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO thought that if we agreed to the French making an approach on the lines proposed, and the discussion then took on a wider aspect,the integrity of our position would be seriously jeopardised.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed that there was little prospect that anything would result from an approach on thelines suggested by the French.      At the same time, thelarger issue was also involved.      Assuming that signor mussolini wished to play the part of mediator, and that hecould produce terms which would not affect our independence,he thought that we ought to be prepared to consider such terms.      He agreed, however, that this hypothesis was amost unlikely one.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought that therewas no possible chance of acceptable terms being open to us at the present moment.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that we must notignore the fact that we might get better terms beforeFrance went out of the war and our aircraft factorieswere bombed, than we might get in three months&apos;  time.

The various possibilities now underdevelopment of countering night-bombing were referredto.THE PRIME MINISTER then read out a draft whichexpressed his views.    To him the essential point wasthat M. Reynaud wanted to get us to the Conference-tablev/ith Herr Hitler.    If we once got to the table, weshould then find that the terms offered us touched ourindependence and integrity.    When, at this point,we got up to leave the Conference-table, we should find that all the forces of resolution which were nowat our disposal would have vanished.    M. reynaud had said that if he could save the independence of france , he would continue the fight.    It v/as clear,therefore, that M. Reynaud&apos;s aim was to end the war.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that,while he agreed with this general diagnosis, it was important to understand the French position, and to frame the answer to the French in a way which would beconvincing to them. He thought that the essential elements in the reply to M. Reynaud should be on the following lines:    That we regarded the suggested offer containedin his letter as a not very substantial one, whichopened up no real prospect of influencing signor mussolini&apos;s attitude,    The only object likely to beachieved by offering these concessions was to induceSignor Mussolini to adopt the position of a mediator.In our view, mediation at this stage,  in thepresence of a great disaster, and at a time when many people might think that we had no more resources left,could only have the most unfortunate results.    We inthis country felt that we had resources left to us of which we could make good use.    If, as we beleived,we could hold out, we should be able to obtain terms which would not affect our independence.We concluded, therefore,  that, withoutprejudice to the future, the present was not the time at which advances should be made to Signor Mussolini.If, however, both France and Great Britain continuedto play their part in the struggle, we were likelyto fare better than if we now allowed ourselves tobecome involved in negotiations with Signor Mussolini.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that M. Reynaudalso wanted the Allies to address an appeal to thePresident of the United States.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that a paragraphmight be added to the draft outlined by the lord president to the effect that we were ready inprinciple to associate ourselves with such an appeal.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO.thought thatM. Reynaud was too much inclined to hawk round appeals.This was another attempt to run out.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thoughtthat M.  Reynaud wanted President Roosevelt in negotiations as a counter to mediation by SiguorMussolini.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he came backto the point that the French wanted to get out of thev/ar, but did not want to break their treaty obligations to us.      Signor Mussolini,  if he came in as mediator, would take his whack out of us.It was impossible to imagine that Herr Hitler would,be so foolish as to let us continue our re-armament.In effect, his terms would put us completely at hismercy.      We should get no worse terms if we wenton fighting, even if we were beaten, than were opento us now.      If, however, we continued the war andGermany attacked us, no doiibt we should suffer some damage, but they also would suffer severe losses.Their oil supplies might be reduced.     A time might come when we felt that we had to put an end to thestruggle, but the terms would not then be moremortal than those offered to us now.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he stilldid not see what there was in the French suggestion of trying out the possibilities of mediation whichthe Prime Minister felt was so wrong.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL referredto paragraph 3 of W.P.(40)170.      This represented theline which had been agreed with M.  Reynaud in the conversations on Sunday.      It was clear to the world that we v/ere in a tight corner, and he did not see what we should lose if we said openly that, while wewould fight to the end to preserve our independence,we v/ere ready to consider decent terms if such were offered to us.The Lord President said that, on a dispassionatesurvey, it was right to remember that the alternative tofighting on nevertheless involved a considerable gamble.The War Cabinet agreed that this was a truestatement of the case.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the nations which went down fighting rose again, but those whichsurrendered, tamely were finished.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that anycourse which we took was attended by great danger.      Theline of resistance was certainly a gamble, but he did not feel that this was a time for ultimate capitulation.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that nothing in his suggestion could even remotely be described as ultimatecapitulation.THE PRIMS MINISTER thought that the chances of decent terms being offered to us at the present tunewere a thousand to one against.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that itwas our duty to look at the situation realistically. he felt bound to say that he was in agreement with the

Foreign Secretary in taking the view that if we thought itwas possible that we could now get terras which, althoughgrievous, would not threaten our independence, we shouldbe right to consider such terms.Again, looking at the matter realistically, he did not think it could be said that an approach to signor mussolini on the lines proposed by the French at thepresent time v/ould be likely to produce an offer of decentterms, certainly not with Paris in Kerr Hitler&apos;s grasp,but uncaptured.     He therefore concluded that it was no good making an approach on the lines proposed by M. Reynaudat the present time.      On the other hand, he thought thatif we were not very careful as to the terms of our answer/er,France might give up the struggle at once.     He did not want to give her any pretext for doing so.General agreement was expressed with this view.THE LOPJ.) PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL added that,while he thought that an approach to Italy was useless atthe present time, it might be that we should take adifferent view in a short time, possibly even a weekhence.      The real question was, therefore, how to frame a reply to the French v/hich, without rejecting their ideaaltogether, would persuede them that this was the wrongtime to make it.TEE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it was necessary topay regard to public opinion in this country.      The WarCabinet, with full information, had watched the situationgradually unfold itself.      But when the public realised the true position, they would sustain a severe shock.They would have to make a great effort to maintain theirmorale, and there was grave danger that, if v/e did whatPrance wanted, we should find it impossible to rally the morale of the people.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that,  so faras the industrial centres of the country v/ere concerned,they would regard anything like weakening on the part ofthe Government as a disaster.In further discussion, general agreement was expressed with the views put forward by the Lord President,THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR AIR adding that he thought thatit would be necessary to add some exhortation on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister.      He rather hoped thatthe Prime Minister would find it possible to go over to paris again shortly to see M. Reynaud and General Weygand.Discussion then turned on the proposed appeal tothe United States of America.      The general view was thatit was perhaps premature to make an appeal at the presenttime.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the Foreign office had prepared the draft for a broadcast that the PrimeMinister might give to the Empire, and which would berelayed to the States.      He indicated the general linestaken in this draft.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would be glad to look at the draft, hut he thought he had better notbroadcast at the present time.The Meeting adjourned at 6.15 p.m., and theLord President of the Council and theForeign Secretary prepared a draft replyto M. Reynaud&apos;s message.The Meeting reassembled at 7 p.m., when sir Alexander Cadogan was also present.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the interval hehad seen the Ministers not in the War Cabinet.     He had told them the latest news.      They had not expressed alarmat the position in France,tut had expressedthe greatestsatisfaction when he had told them that there was no chance of our giving up    the struggle.     He did not rememberhaving ever before heard a gathering of persons occupyinghigh places in political life express themselves soemphatically.The Prime Minister then read two letters whichhe had received from General Spears, recounting discussions which he had had with M. Reynaud,^&apos;THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL read the draft reply which he had prepared, and explained that it was intended to paint a picture which would persuade M. Reynaudthat it was worth his while to go on fighting, and thatwe were not merely looking at the matter from our ownpoint of view.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed himself as extremelysatisfied with the terms of the draft reply, and authorised the Foreign Secretary to despatch it to M. Reynaud, subjectto such drafting amendments as might be found necessary.(See Telegram No. 235 DIPP to Paris)0-THE FOREIGN SECRETARY again referred to theproposed appeal to the United States.    It appeared thatMr. Bullitt had told M.  Reynaud that he favoured the plan,but thought that Lord Lothian should be consulted beforeanything was done.      This differed somewhat from what. Reynaud had said.The Foreign Secretary also referred to a telegramfrom General Smuts, which took up the points made in mr. Menzies&apos; telegram^&apos;   General Smuts suggested a messagein the following terms:-&quot;We are going to fight on even if we haveto stand alone.      We want nothing for ourselves.      We are only concerned withthe defence of world liberty againstwhat will undoubtedly mean the domination of the world by Nazi power.      Will theUnited States help or will they stand aside and take no action in defence ofthe rights of man?&quot;This was clearly a much better line of approach than that suggested by M. Reynaud.      He thought that a telegram of

inquiry might he sent to Lord Lothian, giving him general smuts&apos;  suggestion and asking whether the publication of a message on the lines proposed by General Smuts would help to bring American public opinion on to our side.    It would,of course, be necessaryto obtain the approval of theUnited States Government before publishing such a message.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that an appeal to theUnited States at the present time would be altogetherpremature.      If we made a bold stand against Germany, thatwould command their admiration and respect;      but agrovelling appeal, if made now, would have the worstpossible effect.      He therefore did not favour making any approach on the subject at the present time.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.

THE PRIME MINISTER (C/o Major-General Ismay).On arrival, after paying my respects to the ambassador, I went straight to see Monsieur Paul Reynaud.I attended what was to all intents and purposes a WarCouncil.    There were present:-M. Paul ReynaudMarshal PetainGeneral WeygandAdmiral Darlan.(Admiral Darlan took no part in the discussion.   MarshalRetain was perfectly calm but ineffective.   The wholeCouncil was really a discussion between Weygand andReynaud.2. There was also present for part of the time aLiaison Officer, Commandant Pauvel, who left general blanchard at noon yesterday and got here this morning.(Incidentally I made up my old feud with General weygandquite easily, and he has been very helpful and welcomingto me.)    The attached document was actually dictated byWeygand to Paul Reynaud, who took it down in long-hand.3 . The first thing. I did was to clear up thequestion of Gort&apos;s having been accused of falling backyesterday without warning and. without orders.     I gotGenera.1 Weygand to apologise for this, which he did with good grace;    but I begged him not to jump in future tohasty conclusions  concerning the British Commander whowas loyal to a fault.4. On the strength of the report brought in byCommandant Pauvel, Genera.! Weygand. was inclined to alterhis instructions to Blanchard. in the sense of invitinghim to fall back to the Channel harbours .    But bothReynaud and I pointed out to him that he should bear inmind that Pauvel&apos;s report dated from mid-day Friday24 th.../

2l24th, whereas he had in fact had further information fromBlanehard dated midnight (last night) 24th, and that itmight lead to dreadful confusion to disregard, this latest information just because Pauvel had appeared, in person todasIn other words, Weygand tended to be somewhat influenced by the fact that Pauvel was on the spot here today,  forget-ting that his information was 12 hours old.    The result ofM. Reynaud&apos;s intervention, and to some extent of mine, wasto cause General Weygs.nd to issue no further instructionsto General Blanchard a.nd to stand, by the instructions given him yesterday, which were to use his own discretion. after all, Blanchard. on the spot knows the situation best and may consider he has got a chance of getting through to thesouth.5. Weygand&apos;s opinion is that attacks to the south bythe Blanchard group, which includes ourselves, can serveno other purpose than to gain breathing-space to fall backto a line covering the harbours .6. There seems no chance whatever of Weygand being able to attack northwards from the Somme in sufficient strength to disengage the Blanehard group.    rTe has only 8divisions  spread over 130 kilometres and obviously thisis not an attacking force&apos;. He has a bridgehead, at Picquignyand two small bridgeheads south of Peronne - one of whichis Ham.   He will do all he can to use these to distractGerman attention, but  cannot hope to be very effective.7. As regards General Evans&apos;   command, Weygand wouldbe very glad if he could be instructed to accept &quot;directivefromtthe local French Army Commander.    It does not seem a sound. ...

sound plan to have to ask London to give orders toGeneral Evans.    Communications are too difficult andprecarious for this,8.     Weygand is very satisfied with Blanchardbecause he considers he showed initiative in declaringhe was prepared to mount attacks to the south.    (Butit must he home in mind always that in General Weygand&apos;view any attacks to the south are &quot;coups de boutoirs&quot; -that is for the purpose of gaining &quot;breathing space. )Commandant Pauvel, on the other hand, told me personallythat he thought Blanchard &quot;tres fatigue&quot; &quot;by attempting to exercise the double command of his own army and thegroup of armies.    I took him to de Margerie and madehim   repeat this so that de Margerie could put it toWeygand.    I did not feel justified in suggesting myselfthat it might be wise to leave Blanchard in command ofhis army (which has confidence in him) and put somehodyelse in charge of the group of armies, as I only sense thatGort is not satisfied with Blanchard.9.     Commandant Pauvel was the very embodiment ofcastastrophe.    His pessimistic point of view is to someextent at least explained by the fact that he has been ordered to go back to Blanchard.    The Blanchard grouphave lost all their heavy guns, they have no armouredvehicles and movements have &quot;been incredibly hampered &quot;bythe &quot;blow of refugees.    Moreover every horse-drawnvehicle has &quot;been destroyed and the troops have no &quot;bread.There is some shortage of ammunition.    He spoke of avoiding(without much conviction) a &quot;capitulation en rase campagne&quot;and told me he was convinced that panzer divisions would

get through any new line the French might attempt todefend if the Blanchard group was destroyed.    I told him that whatever happened we were going on with thewar.    He lifted up his hands to heaven and said:&quot;Then you will bomb us&quot;, and I said &quot;Certainly;    just as you have bombed Belgian and Dutch towns that havebeen unable to defend themselves&quot;.    At the council I made a similar remark to Paul Reynaud, though what he said was merely in the nature of a hint.    Weygandsupported me and said &quot;Of course it goes without sayingI am fighting on. &quot;10.      In the Blanchard group there are only threegood fighting divisions left out of eight.    These arethe 15th, the 25th and the 12th.    You will see from theattached very rough sketch made during the actualCouncil Meeting from Fauvel&apos;s map that the position ofthe Blanchard group is that of a mushroom upside down,with most dangerous waist where local attacks simplymust be made if Blanchard decides to move north insteadof south.11,      Please excuse this very disjointed report,dictated in great haste to catch the &quot;plane.    Reynaudthought I had best go back to-night, but Weygand thoughtat such a time of crisis I was better employed here,for the moment at least and with this view I agreemyself.Paris,25th May, 1940.

OUTWARD TELEGRAMis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,kept under Lock and Key.]SPECIAL DiSTRlBUTlOIT AMD MliriR CA3I11ET.To   FRAriCEoCypher telegram to Sir R. Campbell, (Paris).Foreign Office, 28th May, 1940, 11.4-0 p.me By Telephone.No. 235 DIPP.MOST IMMEDIATE.Following from Prime Minister for M. Reynaud.I have with my colleagues examined with the most carefuland sympathetic attention the proposal for an approach byway of precise offer of concessions to Signor Mussolini thatyou have forwarded to me today, fully realising the terriblesituation with which we are both faced at this moment.2.   Since we last discussed this matter the new fact which has occurred, namely the capitulation of the Belgian Army, has greatly changed our position for the worse, for itis evident that the chance of withdrawing the armies ofGenerals Blanchard and Gort from the Channel ports has become very problematical.   The first effect of such a disaster mustbe to make it impossible at such a moment for Germany to putforward any terms likely to be acceptable and neither we noryou would be prepared to give up our independence withoutfighting for it to the end.3.   In the formula prepared last Sunday by Lord Halifaxit was suggested that if Signor Mussolini would co-operate with us in securing a settlement of all European ouestionswhich would safeguard our independence and form the basis ofa just and durable peace for Europe, we would be prepared todiscuss his claims in the Mediterranean.     You now proposeto add certain specific offers, which I cannot suppose wouldhave any chance of moving Signor Mussolini, and which oncemade could not be subsequently withdrawn, in order to inducehim to undertake the role of mediator, which the formuladiscussed on Sunday contemplated,4.     I and my colleagues believe that Signor Mussolinihas long had it in mind that he might eventually fill thisrole, no doubt counting upon substantial advantages for italy in the process.     But we are convinced that at this moment when Hitler is flushed with victory and certainly counts onearly and complete collapse of Allied resistance, it wouldbe impossible for Signor&quot;Mussolini to put forward proposalsfor a conference with any success.     I may remind you alsothat the President of the U.S.A. has received a whollynegative reply to the proposal which we jointly asked him to makemmmmmmmmmivimmmand/

2.LSrdlSlifVnaae^n tS S?e?.Qad? ,to ^ approach of saturday Italian Ambassador here last5.     Therefore, without excluding the possibility ofan approach to Signor Mussolini at some time, we cannot feelthat this would be the right moment and I am bound to add that in my opinion the effect on the morale of our people,which is now firm and resolute, would be extremelydangerous.     You yourself can best judge what v/ould bethe effect in France,6.     You will ask, then, how is the situation to be improved.     My reply is that by showing that after theloss of our two armies and the support of our Belgian Allywe still have stout hearts and confidence in ourselves, weshall at once strengthen our hands in negotiations anddraw to ourselves the admiration and perhaps the materialhelp of the U. Moreover, we feel that as long aswe stand together our undefeated Navy and our Air force which is daily destroying German fighters and bombers at a formidable rate afford us the means of exercising in our common interest a continuous pressure upon Germany&apos;internal life,7.     We have reason to believe that the Germans tooare working to a time-table and that their losses andthe hardships imposed on them together with the fear of our air raids is undermining their courage.     It would indeed be a tragedy if by too hasty an acceptance of defeat wethrow away a chance that was almost within our grasp ofsecuring an honourable issue from the struggle.8.     In ray view if we both stand out we may yet saveourselves from the fate of Denmark or Poland.     Our successmust depend first on our unity, then on our courage andenduranceo

COPY OF ORIGINAL DECYPHER OF A TELEGRAM FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONNER IN THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA, DATED 27TH MAY

IMMEDIATE

No. 249. Most Secret

Your telegrams M 29 and Circular Z 76.

In view of the latter Smuts has suspended action which he was proposing to take on the former. He has asked me to send you the following as indication of how his mind is working.

Smuts thinks it clear in view of telegram Z 76 that French collapse is imminent and that the Italians will either war against us forthwith or exert maximum pressure (to) shorten war. Egypt likely to be useless. Balkans to collapse, Turkey&apos;s position uncertain.

This means, in substance, that members of the British Commonwealth will be left alone to continue the struggle.

Smuts reaction to telegram M 29 has been that it appeared hopeless at the moment to expect from appeal by the Dominion Prime Ministers to Rooseveit, better results than those already achieved through other channels.

It was the United Stated Congress and public opinion which had to be converted. His Majesty&apos;s great broadcast and developments in France were likely to have great influence in this direction.

Most therefore which Smuts had contemplated by way of reply to Menzies was to suggest to him that Mackenzie King might be asked by the other Dominion Prime Ministers to privately talk with Roosevelt, put the Dominion viewpoint as strongly as possible and endeavour to ascertain the best line of further approach.

Any such action is of course out of date in the light of the latest developments (including Menzies to Roosevelt through Casey) but Smuts time may come almost immediately for the concoction of appeal to the United States on behalf of the United Kingdom and Dominions on the following lines. Begins. We

We want nothing for ourselves,   Ve are only concern d with thedefence of world liberty against what will undoubtedly mean the domination of the world by Saai power.   Will the flnlted Stateshelp or will they stand ASIDE ana take no set ion in defenceof the rights of taa:i*\ &amp;suts contemplates that in thefirst instance such ah appeal would have to go through diplomatic channels but also that if necessary it should be made public that such an &amp;p\ eal had been ssade.    He thinks that theeffect of this sight we LI be to produce revulsion of feeling in the baited States.Smuts has asked tse to add his deep sympathy with the UnitedKingdom is the present critical situation.
