(40)  120th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex,(loth May,  1940.)AIR POLICY.Action to be taken  by thelong range bombers.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the War cabinet would have to decide whether the heavy bombers of theRoyal Air Force should engage the oil refineries andmarshalling yards in the Ruhr starting on the night of 14th/15th  May, as provisionally agreed at a Meetingof Ministers held the previous evening at which theLord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfoliohad not been able to be present.     He would summarisethe arguments for and against this course of action as follows:-(a) The enemy, by the many atrocities he hadalready committed, had given amplejustification in the eyes of the worldfor an attack upon the Ruhr.(b) The Germans would undoubtedly attackvital objectives in this country as soonas they were ready to do so.     This wouldbe when they had established themselvesin Holland and secured air bases fromwhich they could bring their fighters and short range bombers to bear on this country.(c) Once the Germans had got well forward intoHolland and Belgium, they would have secured depth to their air defences.(d) An attack now would force the Germans to retaliate at a time when they were not ready to do so, and before our fighter and bomber strength had been worn down byprolonged operations.On the other hand -(a)    If the land battle, which might be decisive,was now opening it might be better to concentrate the whole resources of our AirForce in an effort to defeat the GermanArmieSo

(b) If it were not certain that the Germansproposed, to attack industrial, ob-Jeotivesin this country it would he unwise to provoke them into doing so.     Moreover,the greater relative strength of theGerman Air Force at the present time would increase the power of theirretaliation.(c) If it were decided to postpone the attack,it could he made at a later stage though of course under far less favourable conditions.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that hethought that the arguments in favour of making the attack were very strong,,THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said thathe had been giving considerable thought to thismatter and was doubtful whether, on military grounds,we should be wise to attack the Ruhr at the presenttime.      It might be that the Germans were not atpresent out for victory on land, but were preparing the ground for a great attack on this country.     Onthe other hand, it might be that the decisive battle of the war on land was about to open.      In the latter case,  it would be wrong not to concentrate all theefforts of our fighters and bombers on supporting theArmy.      It had been argued that if the heavy bombers were not directed against appropriate targets in the ruhr,  they could not be used effectively elsewhere;but it appeared quite possible that Italy might shortly be in the war,  in which case good use for our heavy bombers might be found.     The Germans had not so farbombed objectives in this country, presumably becauseof fear of our retaliation.      If we now bombed the ruhr, the Germans would be forced to retaliate andmight go for our aircraft factories and aerodromes,the defences of which were not as strong as they mightbe.     Recent events had shown the effect of a lack of

anti-aircraft defences.     The Oommander-in-Chiefof the British Expeditionary Force had made a request for more fighters to relieve hard-pressedunits of the Advanced Air Striking Force and the air component of the Field Force.     Would it he a wisepolicy to attract combers to this country, thusmaking it impossible to release further fighters for france?     He fully realised that we were unlikely3 ver   to have such a good opportunity for attacking the Ruhr, but he doubted the wisdom of dispersingour efforts at this critical moment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thoughtthat we would be taking a big risk if we sent anymore fighters from this country.     The Air Staffestimated that 60 fighter squadrons were requiredfor the adequate defence of this country, whereaswe only had 39 squadrons.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF added that theestimate of 60 squadrons had been made on theassumption that the Germans would be operating fromGermany.     It was doubtful if this number would beconsidered sufficient if the Germans were to operatefrom Holland.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he understoodthat, while an immediate attack on the Ruhr mightupset German plans and would probably have aconsiderable psychological effect, it would have no immediate effect on the land battle.     He asked towhat extent a German attack on the ports and railways in this country would affect the supply position forthe Army in France.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the Army in France was fully suppliedibr 60 days.

operations,,      The only immediate effect of german air attack might he to hold up the transport toFrance of the armoured division (150 light tanks)which was now proceeding.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatthe views of the War Office might he summarisedas follows:-(l)    It seemed clear from the information received from General Gort and the french high Command that the decisive land battlehad begun, although it was not yet clearwhere     the main German thrust would bemade.(2)    If (l) was correct, we should concentrate on winning the battle, and reduce our strength elsewhere to the minimum necessaryfor security^(3)    On the basis of (2), what action by theheavy bomber force would provide thegreatest assistance in the land battle?should we attack the Ruhr or attack theGerman forces?The destruction of German oil refineries wouldhave no immediate effect on the land battle, and itwould have no immediate moral effect on the german high Command or on their rank and file.    The resultingdiversion of German bombers would not lighten thescale of attack in the land battle to any considerable extent,    German reprisal attacks on this country,  onthe other hand, would almost inevitably be followedby a clamour for all available fighters to.be usedfor our defence.      The considered view of the WarOffice and the Commander-in-Chief in France was thatthe heavy bombers should be employed on the marshalling yards and communications of the German Army on to whichwe could not direct too great a scale of attack,

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that everyone accepted the thesis thatGermany would attack us at the moment when itsuited her convenience.    One of the main arguments in favour of attacking Germany now was that weshould seize the initiative,,    We had to set the positive value of acting now against the negativevalue of waiting to see how the battle developed.    Ifrhowever, we bombed the Ruhr now we should not preventthe Germans from establishing themselves in Holland,and it was therefore clear that we would have tomeet the German offensive from Holland in any case.As the Chief of the Air Staff had pointed out,interception by fighters at night was very difficult.The establishment of fighters in Holland, therefore,would not prevent our bombers getting through to the ruhr;    and, presumably, they would, be able to flyabove the range of the A, A.  defences established in holland.,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF agreed that therewould be no great danger from fighters in Holland,The establishment of a German warning system andsearchlights in Holland, however, would make theline of approach considerably more difficult.Searchlight illumination considerably increased theefficiency of fighters.    It must be borne in mind,moreover, that the intention was to attack, not only by night, but by day when cloud conditions were suitable.Continuing,  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS thought that if we attacked the Ruhr,the Army in France would, on balance, lose more than itgained.    Any gain in a lessening of the weight of Germanbombing attack would be more than offset by the

probability that we would not be able to spare asingle fighter for Prance.   Again, he felt that it wasto the interest of the nation in the weaker position,especially if it had great potential development, to refrain from exposing that potential to damage.    Hewould be gravely uneasy if we took a decision at this moment.    What was done could not be undone, and hewould prefer to wait a few days to see how the battle developed before embarking on action whichwould have the gravest consequences, but which wouldbe of no immediate assistance to the Commander-in-Chief in Prance.THE PRIME MINISTER felt that air attack onthis country was inevitable.      Whatever course thewar in Prance took, we could not afford to use up our fighters day by day, until the defences of thiscountry v/ere seriously impaired.    It was true thatour fighters would find it difficult to deal with german attacks by night, but, on the other hand,the Germans would be unable to bomb our vital points,with any degree of accuracy.    If, however, our fighter strength was seriously weakened, we wouldlay ourselves open to the far greater accuracy ofdaylight attack.    Such reinforcements as could be spared would be sent to the Army, but it must not bethought that in any circumstances it would bepossible to send large numbers of fighters to france .    Similarly, we should not allow our heavy bomber force to be frittered away, and thus depriveourselves of its powerful deterrent effect, and ofthe ability to deliver its heavy blow.    The Army,therefore, must not expect great assistance fromthe bomber force, any more than from the fighters.

He was by no means sure that the greatbattle was developing.      No great masses of german troops had yet come forward, and the position was quite compatible with German anxiety not to engagethe full strength of their army, but only to usespecialised troops.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff pointed out that mechanised forces could not be stabilised.      The Germans had so far only usedmechanised forces and we would inevitably be able to compel these forces to retire unless the Germansmoved their main army forward.       The retirement ofthe Germans from the positions they had at presentreached would mean a considerable moral loss and nodoubt the German High Command would be very reluctant to withdraw them.      It seemed fairly certain that weshould know one way or the other within the next 48hours.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in view of thebalanced nature of the arguments for and against attack on the Ruhr, he would prefer to put off adecision for three or four days, in order to make sure whether the great battle had started or not.The War Cabinet would, of course, review the situation from day to day, but it was mostimportant that the heavy bomber squadrons should nolonger be kept in a state of tension expecting dailyto get the order to attack, only to have it postponedat the last moment.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatthe whole period of the moon was required for the

planned operation,      The moon period had already started and postponement for three or four days wouldhe a very serious disadvantage.      As a further argument in favour of carrying out the attack hesuggested that it might tip the scale as regardsItaly&apos;s staying out of the war.        The results of ourattack on the German civil population might have agreat effect on the industrial population of North-Western Italy.Finally, he could not emphasise too strongly the dangers of denuding this country of Fighters.    Hewas in the fullest sympathy with the Army in Francehut, as Chief of the Air Staff, he had theresponsibility for defending the heart of the Empire.Germany must be prevented from defeating us in detailas she had defeated other countries.        In reply to aquestion whether we could send more fighters to France,he said that he would ask that before a decision wastaken to reduce the number of Fighter Squadrons inthis country by sending further squadrons to France,the Commander-in-Chief, Fighter Command,  should begiven an opportunity of expressing his views.     his present view was that if it were to be decided now toreduce the Fighter defences of this country he would ask to be formally overruled by the War Cabinet.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed withthe Prime Minister that it would be only prudent to watch the developments of the next few days.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was important not to waste our aircraft in France onunprofitable attacks on German tanks, which had given a

very good account of themselves against air attack-German tanks should he met by our own tanks anda rtilleryoSumming up the discussion, he thought that itwas the general view of the War Cabinet that it wouldbe only prudent to defer a decision for three or four days,  while daily reviewing the position in the lightof the Military situation.      In the meantime we shouldconserve the heavy bomber force as much as possible,and personnel should not be kept keyed up for anattack on the Ruhr,The War Cabinet agreed:-(a) To postpone a decision on thequestion of bombing military targets in the Ruhr for, say, three or four days until it was seen how the military situation was developing^The position should, however, be reviewed daily by the War Cabinet.(b)    That, in the meantime, the strengthof the heavy bomber force should beconserved, and the state of readiness of individual squadrons relaxed as faras practicableoRichmond Terrace, S.W.1,
