THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.70It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST    secret COPY MO.   / LW.M.(40)  160th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(10th June,  1940 - 12-30 p.m.)NAVAL OPERATIONSGerman warshipsat Trondhjem.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 159thConclusions,Minute 1. )THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that whenthe report of the sinking of H.M-S.- GLORIOUS had heenreceived, the Commander-in-Chief had heen warned that air reconnaissance would he carried out over Trondhjem,and that he should he ready to attack in the event ofany enemy ships being discovered.       The air reconnaissance had revealed either three or four enemycruisers, two of which were believed to be the scharnhorst and GNSISENAU inside Trondhjem harbour,and a third cruiser 6 miles to the East.      In consequenceof this report, the Commander-in-Chief had made a signalto the ARK ROYAL ordering her to join the RODNEY forthe purpose of carrying out an attack.      This attack would be made by 21 Swordfish escorted by 22 Skuas.These aircraft would be flown off at a point say 280miles West of Trondhjem.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether consideration had been given to the possibility that H.M.S. RODNEYand other capital ships should go in and attack theGerman cruisers in Trondhjem Harbour.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF replied that careful thought had been given to this possibility, but that itwas open to very serious disadvantages which hesummarized as follows:-(a) Our capital ships would almost certainly be located by our reconnaissances under theexisting conditions of continuous daylight.&apos;They would then be subjected to  ten-hourbombing on their way in, and to another ten-hour bombing on their way out.(b) The entrance to the Harbour would undoubtedly have been mined.(c)    Attack would havedefences.to be expected from shore(d) The German ships were anchored inland under conditions which would make it extremelydifficult to carry out a fleet action.(e) U-boats would be lying in wait in the approaches, and it would be impossible to count on dealing with them before they firetheir torpedoes.Consideration had been given to the possibilityof sending in one of our submarines, but in the absenceof any cover of darkness at night, the chances of hergetting in were thought to be so remote as to make thesuccess of such an operation impossible.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the War&quot;Cabinet could not but accept these as good reasons; he asked whether it would be possible to bottle the Germancruisers in Trondhjem by mining.

THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said thatarrangements for this were being made.     There were three entraiices.     A submarine was at present offone of them and a mine-layer was operating in oneof the others.     Mine-laying by surface craft wasnot possible at this time of year since it waslight all night.THE PRIME MINISTER had expressed grave doubts as to the wisdom of the proposed operation bythe Fleet Air Arm.     Neither the Swordfish nor theSkua would be a match for the very strong opposition which they would be likely to encounter from german aircraft bases at Trondhjem.     It would be a gallantoperation, but one which,  in his opinion, might well prove far too costly.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF advised strongly against the operation.     There were believed to be alarge number of Messerschmitts at Trondhjem, and our losses would be extremely heavy, with the possibilityof little or no return.     The same argument would apply to any suggestion of sending Hampdens,     Therewas no night and Trondhjem would be the extremity oftheir *-gri&quot;d..THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL consideredthat such an operation would be very injudicious havingregard to the heavy losses of pilots and aircraft which it might involve at a time when these were sourgently needed for other purposes!After further discussion the War Cabinetag reed:-(a) That instructions should be issuedforthwith by the Admiralty to theCommander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet,informing him that the proposed operation against Trondhjem withthe Fleet Air Arm and H.M.S. RODNEYwas not approved by the War cabinet at present on account of the unduepreponderance of shore based aircraft;(b) That the Admiralty should give urgent consideration to other methods ofdealing with the German men-of-war inTrondhjem harbour.
