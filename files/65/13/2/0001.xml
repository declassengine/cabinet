4 f*10THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat it would be convenient if this report could also include the arguments for and against the suggested air action,      The most obvious of thearguments against taking the action contemplated ras,of course,, the fact that reprisals by Germany would follow.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed that these aspects of the problem   would be dealt with in thereport he world make to the War Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER said that two suggestionshad occurred to him in connection with the rumours of an attack on Texel.    The object of such an attack would be to gain possession of Texel aerodrome.    This,and all the other Dutch aerodromes, constituted a standing temptation to the Germans,  comparable withthe temptation offered by the Swedish iron ore deposits 5-(l) We might ask the Netherlands government whether they would see objection to ourdelivering an immediate attack by air onTexel aerodrome, if and when the Germansseized it-.    The object would be to deliverour attack before the Germans had had timeto instal their anti-aircraft guns.    Inthis way any German aircraft at Texel might&apos; suffer the same fate as our Gladiators had suffered in Norway .(2) We might ask the Dutch to mine all theiraerodromes, with a view to their demolitionin the event of invasion.,   At a later stage,if that seemed a prudent course, the Dutchmight give notice of the action they hadta.ken, in the same way as notice was given of the laying of the minefields at sea.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to convey these suggestions to the netherlands government.Hichmond Terrace, S .W. 1.
