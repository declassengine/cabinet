(40)  156thConclusions,minute* )W. M. (40 ) 157TH CONCLUSIONS ^ - MINUTE 2.Confidential, Annex.(7th June, 1940 - 12.30 p.rn, )THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Frenchseemed to he resisting the German attack fairly wellin spite of the weight of the enemy&apos;s assualt.    The51st Division, however, v/as over matched, and noreinforcements could arrive for it for 2 or 3 days.The French were pressing us hard all the time tosend additional air support, and M. Monnet had cometo see him the previous evening to make a specialappeal.    It was clear that they would try and put the blame on us if they lost this critical battle.In point of fact we had had 144 fightersoperating, over France the previous day, mainly from home aerodromes, hut using advanced landing groundsin France.    This was the equivalent of 12 squadrons,and more than they had originally asked for.    an even larger number would be operating t*day *    0u^heavy bombers had also been active in attacking  tlaetargets which had been indicated by the french high Command.    He proposed, therefore, to send afurther telegram to M. Reynaud emphasising the great efforts v/hich we were making on their &quot;behalf.The reorganisation of Fighter Command was proceeding faster than had been previously expected.The Air Officer Commanding--in-Chief had reported that,out of 21 Hurricane squadrons, 14 werfe fit to operate the previous day gt^B^wret^*Ajauih-o        ud&quot;KiugiiiPM.This implied that all these squadrons had 12 or morepilots and 12 aircraft fit to fly.    Squadrons based in France would have to have 16.    Great efforts werebeing made to provide additional pilots.    Some werebeing obtained from the Fleet Air Arm, and allsuitable pilots under 30 years of age in the AirMinistry and the Ministry of Aircraft Productionwere being combed out.    It was hoped to produce 50from among the ferry pilots employed under theMinistry of Aircraft Production.    The flow of aircraft was very satisfactory, and the Minister of aircraft production had managed to lay his hands on some Dutchaircraft in transit from the United States.    There wasalso a possibility of his getting hold of someAmerican aircraft consigned to Sweden.The small arm ammunition position was lessunsatisfactory than had at first appeared.    We had acertain margin until August, when production wouldbroaden out.    There would, however, be a shortage ofspecial natures, such as armour-piercing.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR drew attention tothe risks we were running in accelerating the move of the fresh divisions to France by using Cherbourg, which hadinadequate anti-aircraft protection.    It was not possibleto move any anti-aircraft guns from Havre (which was notbeing used for the disembarkation of troops) owing to thesensitiveness of the French to any withdrawals from thisport.    He asked whether a fighter squadron could be provided to supplement the air defences of Cherbourg.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF undertook to examine this possibility,,THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thatGeneral Pownall had been instructed to impress on theFrench High Command that we were sending reinforcements as quickly as possible, and that transportation was the onlylimiting factor.    He had also written a personal letterto General Weygand in the same sense.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements,,Richmond Terrace, S.W.l0

GopY m,W, M,   (40)  157th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 10.Confidential Annex.(7th. June, 1940 - 12.30 p.m.)GERMAN OIL The War Cabinet had before them the FourthSUPPLIES. Report of Lord Hankey&apos;s Committee on Preventing oil from reaching Germany covering the Third Report of(Previous Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s Committee (W.P. (40) 191).W.M.  (40) 141st THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERConclusions, said that the first eleven paragraphs of the ReportMinute 9.) constituted a plea for vigorous action againstGermany&apos;s oil supplies and refineries.     Germandomestic production was the largest element in hertotal resources.      If successful action could he carried out, Germany&apos;s oil position might becomeextremely difficult in the near future.     this opinion was reinforced by a number of recent telegrams which indicated the possibility of Germany&apos;future operations being seriously affected hy ashortage of oil.Roumania was Germany&apos;s second largest source of oil supply.     We had so far been fairly successful in limiting the quantities which Germany obtainedfrom Roumania, but the situation was about to altervery much for the worse.     The Germans had established a virtual reign of terror in Roumania and our planshad nearly all been completely checked.      It seemedcertain that unless drastic action was taken to interrupt communications between Roumania and Germany,the latter would soon obtain greatly increasedquantities of oil.     The Committee considered thatthe most effective step would he to carry out theRoyal Marine Operation in the Danube.       In additionto   the damage which might be caused to shipping,there v/ould be a valuable moral effect on neutraltrafficTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that theAir Ministry were in full agreement as regards theimportance of attacking oil targets in Germany.     Amuch greater scale of attack would already have beencarried out on these targets had it not been for thedemands of the battle on the Western Front.    The shortnights at midsummer also increased the difficulties of long distance operations.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, while it was impossible to form an exactestimate of Germany&apos;s oil position, it was clear thatwe should do all we could to damage Germany&apos;s oil resources.     Air attack seemed the most hopeful method.The prospect of destroying the Roumanian oil wellsnow seemed extremely remote.     He thought that every*thing possible should he done in the way of sabotagebut he was not very sanguine of achieving importantresults by this means.

THE MINISTER OP ECONOMIC WARFARE emphasised the recommendation put forward in paragraph 10 of thereport that immediate air action should he taken against the principal synthetic plants in Germanyand not, as hitherto, only against the minor plants *THE -CHANNCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERsuggested that he should he authorised to convene ameeting to investigate all possible means ofcarrying out irregular operations and to put forward a scheme for the approval of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet:-(a) Approved generally the Report on theGerman Oil Position (W.P.(40) 191.(b) Agreed that all possible steps shouldbe taken to reduce the amount of oilreaching Germany from Roumania.    Tothis end:-(i) The Air Ministry should if possiblecarry out the Royal Marine operation for the Danube.(ii) The Air Ministry should give urgent consideration to the practicability of carrying out bomber operations at oil receiving depots atRegensburg, Passau, Vienna,Bratislava, and against the railway bridge over the Danube at Vienna.(iii) The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster should be authorised to convene a meeting to examine allpossible means of carrying outirregular operations, and tosubmit a scheme to the War Cabinets-Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
