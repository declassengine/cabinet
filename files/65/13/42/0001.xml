(40) 165th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(13th June, 1940 - 10.15 p.m. )-COPY NOTING WITHPJEYNAUDTOURS ifeth JUNE,i40.THE PRIME MINISTER gave the War Cabinet an account of the Meeting with M. Reynaud that afternoonat Tours.-   There had been considerable signs of disorganisation-tion, and refugees had been streaming through the town.The Meeting had heen held in a room in the prefecture,M. Reynaud had at first seemed very depressed.General Weygand had reported to him that the French Armieswere exhausted.    Their line was pierced in many places;refugees were pouring through the country; and many of thetroops were considerably disordered.   He felt that it wasnecessary to ask for an armistice while there were stillenough French troops left to keep order in the country untilpeace could he made,    M. Reynaud had said that the french had suffered as much as they could bear and had done their best as a loyal ally.   He now asked whether Great britain would release France from the pledge which she had made notto make a separate peace.In reply, he (the Prime Minister) had said that he felt on rather weak ground as we had so few troops taking part in the battle.    We would have had fourteen divisions,but for reverses met with as a result of applying an agreedstrategy in the North.    Nevertheless, we were determined to continue to give all the help in our power, and believedthat Hitler could not win the war without overcoming us.Our v/ar aim still remained the total defeat of Hitler, andwe felt that we could still bring this about.    We were,therefore, not in a position to release France from herobligation.    Whatever happened, we would level, no reproachesor recriminations at France; but that was a different matterfrom consenting to release her from her pledge.The discussion had then turned to the Americansituation.    M. Reynaud&apos;s message of 10th June, in which hehad said that France would fight on even if it meantcontinuing the struggle from French Possessions in America,had 3ust been published, and M-. Reynaud was evidently muchheartened by the fact that President Roosevelt hadconsented to this.   He (the Prime Minister) said that theFrench must now send a new demand to President Roosevelt,urging him to intervene.    This appeal would be backed up from here by a ^statement of the position and a request forassistance to France. - M. Reyhaud agreed to do this and proposed to make an appeal for the maximum help which thePresident could give short of sending an expeditionary force.

Matters were finally left that the french would hold on until the result of this final appealwas known. .The meeting had then ended, and he had gone into another room where he had seen a numberof Ministers including M. Herriot and M. Mandel.The former had shown himself resolutely determined to continue the struggle.Since returning to this  country a furtherremarkable message had been received from president roosevelt.    The Prime Minister then read to the WarCabinet this message, a copy of which is appended fcothese Minutes    (Annex I)o     This message he said,came as near as possible to a declaration of war andwas probably as much as the President could do withoutCongress.      The President could hardly urge theFrench to continue the struggle, and to undergo furthertorture, if he did not intend to enter the war tosupport them.      If the President were not disavowed byhis country, then it was clear that he would bring them in on our side in the near future.      This messagewould have been quite sufficient as an answer toM. Reynaud&apos;s final appeal, but it would be observedthat it had come in advance of it, which made theeffect even more striking.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said he had little to add to the Prime Minister&apos;s account of the Meeting.     According to Sir R. Campbell,M. Reynaud had apparently been in a stronger moodearlier in the day, and had recaptured that moodagain towards the end of the proceedings.      In fact,the Meeting had ended in an atmosphere of resolution,and Sir R. Campbell had been surprised by M. Herriot&apos;attitude.     The main impression created was that although the French Armies might be nearly finishedfor effective and organised operations, it oughtstill to be possible to get the French to play thepart of Holland, rather than of Denmark.     He feltthat they could be brought to see that if they made an armistice,they would embark on a slippery slopewhich would lead to the loss of their fleet, and eventually of their liberty.THE MINISTER FOR AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION feltthat M. Reynaud had asked the Prime Minister to come over to relieve him from his obligation and toagree; to France making  a sopamte peace0     ThePrime Minister, however, by kindly firmness, hadpersuaded him to a more resolute course of action.The new message which had just arrived from president roosevelt was a complete justification for theattitude taken up by the Prime Minister.    It was nowinevitable that the United States of America woulddeclare war.       M. Reynaud would be content with thevery big step forward which had already been taken bythe President..

THE MINISTER FOR INFORMATION said that an awkward situation had arisen over the publicationof M. Reynaud&apos;s message of the 10th June.      TheAmerican Press correspondents were anxious to know what reply had been received to this message and appeared to think that the President&apos;s speech whichhad been delivered on the same date should be taken as the reply.       He had been unable to give them any information on this point, nor had he been able tosay whether the message had been published with theauthority of the President.      If he could say this,the effect would undoubtedly be good and would indicate that the President had received the messagefavourably.Some discussion took place on this point and the FOREIGN SECRETARY pointed out that M. reynaud had said that he had leave to publish the message^and was much heartened by that fact.      Even if itcould not be said that the President had authorisedpublication, it could be suggested that the messagecould not have been published without the President&apos;authority.Later in the meeting the Prime Ministerleft the room to see the American Ambassador and onhis return informed the War Cabinet that Mr. Kennedyjwas convinced that the President must have authorised-r^-^the publication of the message.      The Virginia speechcould not be taken as being the President&apos;s answer,since it was delivered before the President hadreceived the message.     The Minister of information could therefore make these two facts clear to thePress.Some discussion followed on the preciseinterpretation which could be given to president roosevelt&apos;s latest message.      It was pointed outthat he had not stated in terms that the United states would declare war.     On the other hand,it was argued that no head of a State could send such a message to France, urging her to continue her agony,unless he was certain that his country was coming to her aid.     M. Reynaud would surely be entitled tosay that France was going forward with the strugglein the sure and certain hope of the full support ofthe United States.It was generally felt that, although the implications of the message might be clear to theAnglo-Saxon mind, they might appear in rather a differentlight to the French, who would be looking for something more definite.      It would be necessary to point out tothem that the message contained two points which weretantamount to a declaration of war - first, a promise of all material aid,    which implied active assistance;and second, a call to go on fighting even if theGovernment was driven right out of France.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that heshould say to M, Reynaud that President Roosevelt&apos;message fulfilled every hope and could only mean that the United States intended to enter the war onour side.    If the French continued the struggle,Hitler would enter Paris within a day or so, buthe would find the capital a mere empty shell.    though he might occupy much of her country, the soul ofFrance would&apos;have gone beyond his reach.    No doubthe would offer very specious terms to the French,but these we could not permit them to accept.    WhenHitler found that he could get no peace in thisway, his only course would be to try and smash this island.    He would probably make the attempt very quickly, perhaps within a fortnight; but before thatthe United States of America would be in the war on our side.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL urged that a statement in dramatic terms should be issued to hearten thepeople of France.    It was not enough merely to sendmessages of encouragement to the French Government.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he made it quite clear at the meeting that we should neverdesert France, and that if we won through, as webelieved wo should, the wrongs of France would berighted.    We should fight on and never quit thestruggle until France had been fully restored.There was general agreement that anannouncement in dramatic terms of the solidarity ofFrance and Groat Britain should be issuedo   We might say that &quot;France and Great Britain were one&quot;.Her Majesty the Queen might be invited toinclude this sentiment in her forthcoming broadcast to the women of France.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs then raised the question of the line we should take with Dominion Governments.    He stressed that itwas not enough to tell them all that had passed.They must be treated as full partners and theirassent must not be taken for granted.

THE PRIME MINISTER proposed that we should communicate to the Dominionsour announcement to theFrench people on our solidarity with them, and alsothe latest message which had heen received from president Roosevelt.     We should then add that ithad always heen our intention to fight on to thehitter end, and suggest that now was the time forDominion Governments to make a similar declaration.The Prime Minister summarised the immediate action which should he taken as follows(a) He would send a telegram to M. Reynaudmaking clear that President Roosevelt&apos;message of 13th June was the answer toM. Reynaud&apos;s appeal of the 10th June,and gave the latter the assurance offurther support which he considered essential if France was to continue thestruggle.        It was important to make clear to M. Reynaud to full implications of the President&apos;s message as we understoodit.(b) A statement should he issued, in the formof a message to the French Government fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government, proclaimingthe   indissoluble   union   of our two peoples and of our two Empires.      this statement should be given the widest -possible publicity.(c) He would send a telegram to president roosevelt seeking his consent to thepublication of his last message, and supporting the further appeal made byM. Reynaud.(d) A telegram should be sent to the Dominionsinforming them of the position and asking them publicly to endorse our policy.The Prime Minister then left the room to speak to the   American Ambassador.      During his absence a summary of M. Reynaud&apos;s broadcast appealto President Roosevelt, as reported on the tape, was brought in and read.On his return, the Prime Minister said thatMr. Kennedy had spoken to the President, who wasagreeable to publication of his message, but thatMr. Hull was opposed to it.      The President had heard that the meeting at Tours had been very successful,

and it seemed that he did not realise how criticalthe situation was. &quot;   Mr. Kennedy had gone hack to theAmerican Embassy in order to communicate to thePresident a full account of the meeting, based on notessupplied to him by the Prime Minister.     He was thenreturning to No. 10, Downing Street.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinetthe drafts of the following:-(a) A telegram from himself to M. Reynaud.(b) The message to the French Government fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government, proclaiming theindissoluble union of our two peoples andour two Empires.(c) A telegram from himself to president roosevelt.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs read out the draft of a telegram to the Dominions.The texts of these documents were agreed.Copies of (a)   and (h) are appended asAnnexes II and III to these Minutes.Richmond Terrace, S.W.. 1.

Begins,,Ambassador Kennedy will have told you about the Britishmeeting today with the French at Tours of which I showed himour record,     I cannot exaggerate its critical character.They v/ere very nearly gone.     7/eygand had advocated an armistice while he still had enough troops to prevent Francefrom lapsing into anarchy,,     Reynaud asked us whether in viewof the sacrifice and sufferings of France we v/ould releaseher from the obligation about not making a separate peace.Although the fact that we have unavoidably been largely outof this terrible battle weighed with us, I did not hesitatein the name of the British Government to refuse consent to an armistice or separate peace,     I urged that this issue shouldnot be discussed until a further appeal had been made byReynaud to you and the United States, which I undertook toseconds     Agreement was reached on this and a much bettermood prevailed for the moment with Reynaud and his Ministers.Reynaud felt strongly that it v/ould be beyond his powerto encourage his people to fight on -without hope of ultimatevictory, and that that hone could only be kindled by Americanintervention rap to the extreme limit open to you.     As he put it, they wanted to see light at the end of the tunnel.While we were flying back here your magnificent messagewas sent and Ambassador Kennedy brought it to me on myarrival.     The British Cabinet was profoundly impressed anddesire me to express their gratitude for it, but Mr. president must tell you that it seems to me absolutely vital that this message should be published tomorrow 14th June in order thatit may play the decisive part in turning the course of worldhistory.     It will I am sure decide the French to deny Hitlera patched-up peace with Frances     He needs- this peace in orderto destroy us and take a long step forward to world mastery.All the far-reaching plans strategic, economic, political and moral which your message expounds may be still-born if theFrench cut out now.     Therefore I urge that the message shouldbe published now.     Je realise fully that the moment Hitlerfinds he cannot dictate a Nazi peace in Paris he will turn hisfury on to us.     Me shall do our best to withstand it and ifwe succeed wide new doors are opened upon the future and all will come out even at the end oi the day0     Ends,,

COPY OP CIRCULAR CYPHER TELEGRAM SENT TO THE UNITED kingdom high COMMISSIONERS IN CANADA, COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA,NEW ZEALAND AND UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.Sent 5.0   a.m., 14th. June, 1940.Most Immediate Circular Z. No. 108Most Secret and PersonalPlease convey following message from -rime Ministerimmediately to Prime Minister.   Begins.The Foreign Secretary and I saw Reynaud this afternoon (Thursday) at Tours.   Reynaud said French armieswere at last gasp and Weygand said that he felt that itwould very soon he necessary to plead for an armistice inorder to save the soil and structure of France.   If france was to continue it was imperative to have proof that UnitedStates would come in with sufficient speed.Reynaud then referred to the message which he had sent to Roosevelt on June 10th.    (You v/ill have seen this in the Press:    it was pixblished at Roosevelt&apos;s suggestion and lloosevelt&apos; s speech of thay day was not in fact an answer to it.)   Reynaud thought that Roosevelt&quot;s speechofLJune 10th was encouraging and he said that he proposed tosend a further appeal to Roosevelt saying that the allied cause lay in America&apos;s hands.   Reynaud added that he feltthat he could not carry his Government with him in continuing the struggle unless Roosevelt&apos;s reply to this appealconveyed a firm assurance of immediate aid, though h$ didnot mean by this an expeditionary force.   He said that theFrench Council of Ministers had instructed him to enquirewhat our attitude would be should the v/orst come, and he,,therefore asked me x?hether we would admit that France havingdone all she could, might enter into a separate peace.I said $nat it was still our one thought to destroy Ilitlerism.   There would be no reproaches but wecould not consent to France making a separate peace.The first thing was for Reynaud to put the positionsquarely to Roosevelt ;and then await his answer.I returned to London this evening (Thursday).Meanwhile Reynaud sent the appeal to Rooseveltwhich he contemplated.    (You \vill have heard this broadcast).This was crossed by a very remarkable message from Roosevelt,the terms of which are as follows.     Message begins.Your message of June 10 has moved me very deeply.As I have already stated to you and to Mr. Churchillthis Government is doing everything in its power tomake available to the Allied Governments the material        \they so urgently require and our efforts to do stillmore are being redoubled.   This is so because of ourfaith in and our support of the ideals for which theAllies are fighting.The magnificent resistance of the French and british armies has profoundly impressed the American people.I am personally particularly impressed by yourdeclaration that France will continue to fight onbehalf

&quot;behalf of Democracy even if it means slow withdrawal,even to North. Africa and the Atlantic.   It is mostimportant to remember that the French and British fleetscontinue mastery of the Atlantic and other oceansj   alsoto remember that vital materials from the outside worldare necessary to raainiaan all armies.I am also greatly heartened by what Prime MinisterOhurchill said a few days ago about the continuedresistance ofthe British Empire and that determinationwould seem to apply equally to the great French Empireall w er the v/orld. Naval power in world affairs stillcarries the lessons of history, as Admiral Darlan wellknows.Message ends.We read this as an invitation to France to continue.Roosevelt of course is not able to declare war without the assent of Congress but hie message goes to the very edge ofsuch a step and seems to me to give the assurance whichReynaud required.We are accordingly sending a message to Reynaudin the f o 11 owing termsMessage begins.In this solemn hour for the British and Frenchnations and for the cause of freedom and Democracyto which they have vowed themselves His Majesty5 sGovernment desire to pay to the Government of theFrench Republic the tribute which is due to theheroic fortitude and constancy of the French.armies331 battle against enormous odds.   Their effort isworthy of the most glorious traditions of France andhas inflicted deep and long-lasting injury upon theenemyfs sti&apos;ength.   Great Britain will continue to givethe utmost aid in her power.   We take this opportunityof Disclaiming the indissoluble union of our twopeopleB and of our two Empires.   We cannot measure thevarious forms of tribulation which will fall upon ourpeoples in the near future.   We are sure that theordeal &quot;by fire will only fuse them together into oneunconquerable whole.   Ww renew to the French Republicour pledge and resolve to continue the struggle atall oosts in France, in this Island, upon the oceans,and in the air, wherever it may lead us, using ail our resources to the utmost limit and sharing together the burden of repairing the ravages of war.   Weshall

shall never turn from the conflict until Francestands safe and erect in all her grandeurs untilthe wronged and enslaved States and peoples haveheen liberated and until civilisation is freed from the nightmare of Nazidom.     That this day willdawn we are more sure than ever.     It may dawnsooner than we now have the right to expect.Message ends.I hope that Reynaud will now be prepared to carryout the intention which he expressed to us.,Ve are confident that you will be In full agreement with the tenor our assurances in the above message to Reynaud, more than ever now that Roosevelt has committedhimself, as we think he has., in his reply to Reynaud quoted above.     If you feel as we do, we earnestly hope that you will feel able to make a public declaration to French Government onthe lines of our message set out above at the earliest possible moment and issue it to the Press as soon as our message is published.     We regard this as a matter of very great urgency and importance,I may add that we arc urging the publication ofRoosevelt&apos;s message, which in any case stands on record, butthat we have not yet received his consent.s3 icis *
