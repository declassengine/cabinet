THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTUsT SECRET.NORWAY.Operationl&quot;Paul&quot;.[(previous reference:f.M.( 40) 156thConclusions,minute 5. )TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to   268ensure the secrecy of this document.COPY NO.g* W.M.  (40) 159th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.   &apos;.Confidential Annex.(9th June, 1940 - 7 p.m.)THE PIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that itwas proposed to carry out Operation &quot;Paul&quot; in the nearfuture.    He asked whether, hefore this Operation wascarried out, we should give any prior warning of our intentions to lay mines outside Lulea.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the normal practice was that prior notice should he given of intention to mine a given area, hut that notice might hewithheld for military reasons.    There was also the questionwhether we should carry out torpedo attacks from aircraftagainst iron ore ships.   Any aircraft carrying out such attacks v/ould he unable to return to the carrier and wouldhave to go to Finland and be &quot;interned.    There was alsothe possibility that ships of neutral countries might be attacked by mistake.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that no priorannouncement should be made of our intention to lay minesoutsido Lulea. It would also be&quot;worth while carrying out anumber of torpedo axtacks against iron ore ships.    Ifthese attacks resulted in sinking neutral ships, we should express out regret in suitable terms.THE PERMANENT UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that he had not,had an opportunity of discussingthis matter with the Foreign Secretary.    It might be argued that if we -carried out-this Operation, the result would beincreasing German pressure on Sweden, and&quot;this might resultin our being unable to obtain from Sweden certain specialsteels which we hoped to obtain from that country;    Onthe other hand, as Germany would now probably overrun thewhole of Northern Norway, the possibility of our obtainingany supplies from Sweden was, in any case, remote.The War Cabinet agreed:-(l) That no prior notification should be given of our intention to carry out Operation &quot;Paul&quot;.(2) To authorise the Admiralty, in addition tolaying mines outside Lulea, to carry outtorpedo attacks against iron ore ships inthe Gulf of Bothnia, notwithstanding therisk that this might involve attacks on ships belonging to neutral countries.
