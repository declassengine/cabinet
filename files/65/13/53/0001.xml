COPY NO.W.M.(40) 184TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(27th June, 1940, 12.0 noon.)PRANCE.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 183rdConclusions,Minute 5.)THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that theRICHELIEU had been located hy aircraft of H.M.S.DORSETSHIRE.     The aircraft had later had to make aforced landing, but the DORSETSHIRE had got in contact with the RICHELIEU at 3 p.m. the previous afternoon.       At that moment, however, the RICHELIEUhad altered course 180o and returned to Dakar, under orders from the French Admiral at Dakar.The HERMES, ALBATROSS, and two Britisharmed merchant cruisers were in Dakar.      The french admiral at that port had said that it was contrary tothe terms of the armistice for them to stay there, andhad asked them to leave the port.It was suggested that the reply to this request might be that we wished to be assured thatno German or Italian ships would be allowed to use the port, and to await a reply to this enquiry before our ships left.     Even if they had to leave, weshould still keep a ship cruising up and down outside.The WATCHMAN was still at Casablanca, andthe JEAN BART had not left this port.The French submarine NARWHAL had arrivedoff Malta and hadputinto harbour on the pretext thatshe required repairs.     She was now in dockyard hands.Another French submarine RUBIS which hadbeen engaged in minelaying off the Norwegian coastunder our orders was now returning to Dundee.The real question at issue was what to doas regards the French ships at Oran.    One coursewould be at once to mine them in with magnetic mines,informing them that we were adopting this course.    Ifthis was to be done at once, it could only be done by aircraftfnomthis country, which, would havo to land, ssay, in Tunisiawhen the operations had been completed.      If we wereprepared to wait three days, the operation could becarried out by aircraft from the ARK ROYAL.

By the 3rd July it v/ould be possible for aBritish Fleet comprising the HOOD, the NELSON, theVALIANT, the RESOLUTION and the ARK ROYAL to arriveoutside Oran.    This v/ould be a far stronger forcethan the French Fleet.    On arriving off the portthe following courses would be open to us;-(l) We could demand that the ships shouldbe demilitarised under our control;(2) We could ask the French ships to cometo sea and proceed to British ports;(3) We could say that unless the ships hadbeen sunk within three hours, we shouldbombard them.Another possibility was that we should leave tvw submarines outside the port,with orders to sink the ships if they came out.The position of the ships in the harbourwas explained.    It v/as believed that they weremoored v/ith their sterns to the breakwater, sothat they could not fire out to sea.In discussion, the view was expressed that it was? most important to take action to ensurethat the French Fleet could not be used against us.Public opinion was strongly insistent that weshould take action on the lines of the measures taken at Copenhagen against the Danish Fleet.In this connection, however, the referencesv/hich were now appearing in the Press, as to measureswhich might be taken against the French Fleet,were greatly to be deprecated,  and instructions should be sent to ensure that this matter was not discussed in the Press.THE PRIME MINISTER summed up the discussion as&apos; follows:      He thought that the War cabinet approved in principle that the operation proposed should take place on the 3rd July.    It might be combined with further operations in the Mediterranean,or v/ith operations designed to s secure the RICHELIEUand the JEAN BART.The possibility that we might offer theFrench to agree to the ships being interned in american ports was also mentioned.    This wouldrequire consideration from the political point ofview.   Meanwhile, plans for the operation shouldbe drawn up, and should be considered later at aMeeting of the Ministers directly concerned, withtheir Advisers.He was opposed to using aircraft based in this country to carry out magnetic mine-layingas he did not think it likely that the French ships would leave Oran immediately.

At the end of the discussion THE CHIEF OFNAVAL STAFF stated that a message had just beenreceived from the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,to the effect that Admiral   Godfroy now took theview that he must obey the orders of his Governmentand cease fighting.      The Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, would, of course, not allow the french ships in the Eastern Mediterranean to pass out of our control.-   The War Cabinet:-(l) Approved in principle the operation on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister at &quot;X&quot; above, and invited the First Lord of the Admiralty andthe Chief of Naval Staff to arrangefor the planning of the operation to he taken in hand at once.     Areport should he made at a Meeting ofMinisters directly affected, underthe Chairmanship of the PrimeMinister, at which any detailedpoints involved could be settled.The proposal to lay magnetic minesforthwith hy aircraft from theUnited Kingdom was however not approved.(2) Agreed that instructions should besent to the Ministry of information that there should be no discussion in the Press in regard to possible measures by this country againstthe French Fleet.      The reason tobe given for this direction shouldbe that discussion of such measuresmight have an unfavourable reaction in French circles which we hoped torally to our side.(3) Agreed that a temporizing answer should be given to the request thatour ships should leave Dakar.      Thisanswer should ask for assurances that German and Italian vesselswould not be allowed to use the port.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.
