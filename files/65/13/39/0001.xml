Some 50tons of bombs would be dropped during the night&apos;operations,,    The first target would be the Fiat motorfactory at Turin,    Other targets would be the Breda andAnsaldo factories at Milan and Genoa.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Embassy party would not have left Ancona,from which they were proceeding by sea to Lisbon, beforethe air attacks on North Italy would begin.    It might be some time before they got away, since there wouldprobably be haggling with the Italians over theconstitution of the party.    He did not feel, however, thatthe operations should be held up for fear of reprisals against our Ambassador,    The Italian Ambassador in london would still be here,    We already had full justification for air attack on Italy owing to the fact that Malta hadbeen bombed that morning,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that air marshal Barratt had, on his instructions, consultedGeneral Georges on the proposed operation to fire the black Forest with incendiary bombs.    General Georges had agreed.    It had since been ascertained, however, that colonel Grand had sent over an emissary to obtain theconsent of M.  Reynaud to similar attacks by means ofballoons carried out by the S, I. S.  organisation.    M.  reynaud had refused his consent.In discussion it was pointed out that, whereas the operations by the R.A.F, would be directed againstprecise targets, incendiary balloons might land anywhereand would be indiscriminate in their action.    The two operations might therefore be considered entirely separate,Lates? in the meeting MAJOR MORTON enteredand explained $he circumstances in which ColonelGrand had made an unofficial approach to French ministers on the matter,,    It appeared Colonel Grand had exceededhis instructions in the steps which he had taken.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR explained that wehad received full official authority from General Georgesfor carrying out the operations, and that he wished toproceed that same nightQ    If there was further delay, rainmight fall in the interval.

Meanwhile, air reconnaissance that morninghad reported that three enemy cruisers were back inTrondheim.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that aircraft of the Coastal Command had been ordered to attack theships in Trondheim Fjord.
