(40) 187thConclusions,Minute 80)THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleagues that the date on which the proposed operation inregard to the French Fleet at Oran could take placedepended on whether H.M.S. NELSON was to take partin the operation,      If it was decided to wait untilH.M.S. NELSON could reach the Western Mediterranean,the operation could not take place until the 5th July;If it was decided not to wait for the NELSON, theoperation could take place two days earlier.The Prime Minister said that the questionwhether the NELSON should he used in this operationdepended in part upon the position in Home Waters.He had given considerable attention in the last two days to the state of our defences against invasion.The Prime Minister gave some details of the discussions which he had had on this matter in the previous two days.     He had reached the conclusion that it would be wiser to keep H.M.S. NELSON in Home Waters rather than to send her to the Western Mediterranean.     This meant that the operation at Oran could take place on the3rd July.     On the whole, the sooner this operation was carried out the better.The War Cabinet expressed general agreementwith this view0Discussion ensued on the importance of taking steps to ensure that the statement which weshould make to the French naval authorities at Oranwould become known to the ships companies.     Thepossibility of dropping leaflets had been considered.The Minister of Information was invited to considerwhether it v/ould be possible to broadcast a message ona wavelength which would be picked up hy the crews ofthe French men-of-war at 0ranoThe operation at Oran should be contempora-neous in regard to action with other French men-of-war.Thus steps should be taken to establish full controlof all the French men-of-war in this country.     action should also be taken in regard to the EMILE BERTIN, andin regard to the ships under Admiral G-odfroy in theEastern Mediterranean.
