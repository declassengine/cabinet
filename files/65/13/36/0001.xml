MINUTE 11.Confidential Annex.(8th June,  1940 - 10.0 a.m, )THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER said thatin accordance with the conclusion of the War Cabinet attheir previous meeting (W.M. (40) 157th Conclusions, Minute10, Confidential Annex, conclusion (fa) (iii)) he hadconvened a meeting to examine all possible means ofcarrying out irregular operations to reduce the amount of oil reaching Germany from Roumania0    There were widespreadideas for these operations, some of which were concreteplans which could &quot;be put into operation as soon as approvalwas given while others were only termed &quot;projects&quot;.      Thelatter would require detailed examination to determine whether they were feasible.The War Cabinet had approved the carrying out ofthe R, Mn  operation on the Danube if it was found to be apracticafale possibility,,    If the project was carried out,he urged that we should make the most of it fay makingdiplomatic representations to all the Riparian Stateswarning them that the German section of the Danube was mined, and that no guarantee could be given that mineswould not reach neutral portions of the river.    The effectof the scheme v/ould be enhanced if it was found possible tofaornfa the oil receiving depots at Regensburg and other towns.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER then gave the War Cabinet a brief doc crip ti oh of a number of less arbheesr.schemes which might be attempted and an indication ofcertain projects of a military nature which, he suggested,should be referred to the Chiefs of Staff after they hadbeen prepared in detail fay the Projects Board.    He urgedthat the War Cabinet should approve the carrying out of the plans which were ready.    He pointed out that, once theorder had been given to go ahead,  it would be very difficultif not impossible, to cancel the order.    It was possiblethat all the schemes would fail;   but, in his view,  if theywere all tried simultaneously, there was a good chance thatone or more of them would succeed.    Any one of them wouldhave a valuable effect,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS feltno moral scruples about approving these schemes.    Therewere,  of course, political objections to such schemes, buthe was prepared to disregard political considerations,provided that there was a reasonably good chance that some success would be achieved.    If, on the other hand, therewas very little chance of success, political considerations would weigh   heavier in the scale.    He asked that he mightbe provided with a &quot;brief statement giving a list of theschemes with their probafale effect, the countries which would &quot;be affected,  and an estimate of the chances ofsuccess.

THE MINISTER OP ECONOMIC WARFARE strongly supported the views put forward hy the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster,,    He pointed out that theresults which might be achieved by the Royal AirForce, at considerable risk to the aircraft carryingout the operation, would only be 01 short durationunless they were backed up hy less orthodox operations,The War Cabinet:-(l) Invited the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster to provide a brief statement giving a list of theproposed schemes for irregularoperations, their probable effect and the countries which would beaffected.    The statement should also include an estimate of the chances of success.(2) Agreed that the above-mentioned statement should be considered by a committee consisting of the Lord President of theCouncil, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Chanco-iicr  ofthe Duchy of Lancaster, the Ministerof Economic Warfare and the Secretaryfor Petroleum, at a meeting to be heldon Monday, 10th June,    This Committeewas authorised to decide, on behalf ofthe War Cabinet, whether any or all ofthe schemes should he carried out.Richmond Terrace- S.W. 10
