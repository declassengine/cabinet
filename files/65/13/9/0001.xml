COPY NO  /W.M.   (40)  125rd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(15th May, 1940.)AIR POLICY.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 122ndConclusions,Minute 2.Despatch ofadditionalfightersto Prance.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there remainedtwo important questions to he decided that morning inregard to air operations:-(l)   Whether we should send any more fighter squadrons to Prance in response toM. Reynaud&apos;s appeal.(2)   Whether we should attack military objectives in the Ruhr and elsewhere in Germany east of the Rhine.As regards the former, he suggested thatthe War Cabinet would have little difficulty in deciding against the despatch of further fighter squadrons in view of the fact that no demand for these had been received from the Military authorities in france.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out that whilst it was true that no request for additionalfighters had been received from General Gamelin, he(the Chief of the Air Staff) had received such a request from the Commander-in-Chief, British AirForces in France.     Air Marshal Barratt had againemphasised the need for additional fighter support atthe end of the following telegram, which had beenreceived from him that morning at 10.13 a.m.:-&quot;I received message from General Georges last night that fact that French counter attack last night managed to prevent further enlargement of. pocket South of Sedan was in his view mainly dueto lack of German reinforcements.    This in turnhe said was due to sustained air action onbridges and communications during the day.General Tetu also reported captured Germanofficer stated his troops were exhausted as aresult of Allied sustained air attacks.   Earlythis morning General Georges&apos; representativeinformed me that main task to-day was to assistwith sustained air action the final counter

attack to close pocket.     He has now told me thatthis counter attack is not possible owing to furthergrave developments consequent on enemy having crossedMeuse between A R 19 and Laboux possibly also atA R 1 and German troops reported in area West ofq Montherme.Situation in Mezieres and South of it not clear.    Ihave warned Bomber Command that I shall have to callon them again to-day for action in the Dinant area.I do not propose to employ A.A.S.F. in daylight ifit can be avoided but have warned them they will berequired for night bombing to-night.     Aboveincreases emergency final settlement question ofadditional fighter support.    Barratt&quot;The Chief of the Air Staff explained that additional fighters for France could only be found bywithdrawing them from the active defences of this country.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Chief ofthe Air Staff said that he would not, at this moment,advise the despatch of any additional fighters to France.Air attack on THE PRIME MINISTER asked the Secretary of Statemilitaryobjectives for Air for his views on the question of an attack againstin the Ruhr.military objectives in the Ruhr and other similar targets.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that theexperience of the last few days in France pointed to thefact that, at the present rate of losses, it would be extremely difficult for the Royal Air Force to maintain itsfipresent effort in support of the land battle by daylightbombing operations.     Meanwhile, the extent to which theArmy could be supported in the immediate battle-zone by night bombing was very limited.      Targets would be smalland difficult to see, and the return would be out of allporportion to the expenditure of effort.     He therefore thought that the right course would be to extend theactivities of our long range night bombers.      By contrast with the heavy losses which had been sustained by ourlight bombers in daylight operations in France, our heavy^ bombers had gone out on the previous night 64 strong, and only one had failed to return.Turning to the question of targets, hesuggested that these should not necessarily be confined to the marshalling yards and oil- 2 -

refineries in the Ruhr hut should also include      * &quot;suitable targets elsewhere in Germany.      At Leunanear Leipzig, for example, there was a refinery whichproduced half-a-million tons of oil a year.    AtHanover and Bremen there were large stocks oflubricating oil which were vital to Germany&apos;sprosecution of the war.      These targets were,  in manycases, of enormous dimensions - and were highlyinflammable.    Such places could be easily found andidentified in the moonlight.      In this connection, heagain stressed the importance of taking early advantageof the waxing moon.      This would be full in less thana week, and after that the increasingly late hour atwhich it rose would make it impossible for our bombers^to complete their operations before daylight.    It wastherefore essential that these operations should beginwithin the next two days at the latest.He advocated these attacks in the full knowledge that they would almost certainly provokeretaliation on this country, quoting in this connectiona threat to that effect which had been broadcast overthe German wireless on the previous evening,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF entirely endorsed the views of the Secretary of State for Air, andstrongly advocated that the War Cabinet should approvethese operations.      If so, it would be possible to attack the marshalling yards that night and the oil refineries,if not that night, on the following night./&quot;Later, a message was received from the Vice Chiefof the Air Staff to say that the Commander-in-Chief,    Bomber Command, would be ready to start the full plan of attack against the Ruhr with100 bombers that night, if the War Cabinet soorderedjj7

THE VICE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF likewisewas in full agreement with these proposals.    In hisopinion, the attack on the oil refineries wouldunquestionably have the effect of retarding the land operations for which the Germans required largequantities of petrol for the use of their mechanisedforces,THE AIR OFFICER COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF,FIGHTER COMMAND, welcomed the proposal to attack the ruhr.      He considered that it was the soundest actionwhich we could take in the present situation..   Weshould not be deterred by the fear of attacks fromGermany since these,  in his opinion, were bound tocome sooner or later,THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that we must expectthis country to be hit in return.    The attraction ofGerman bombers to this country would, however, havethe advantage of relieving the pressure on France,THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF strongly supported the plan on strategic grounds.    A decision to put it into effect would, moreover, provide a convincing andconclusive reason for refusing the request of theFrench for the diversion of British fighter squadrons to Prance,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALY was in favourof the operation on the ground that if Hitler intended,as seemed the case, to stake everything on ending thewar this summer, we also ought not to delay in counter-attacking with all the strength at our command,THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFemphasised the importance of attacking the marshalling yards serving the Sedan area, since it was these which

were feeding the German attack - mentioning,  inparticular, the yards at Cologne, Gerolstein andTrier.      On the question of attacking oil refineries, such difference of opinion as hadprevailed between the General and Air Staffs had arisen over the question whether the land operationsmight not be better supported by attacking oil in transit rather than at its source.    The War office would prefer that it should be attacked in transit,but if, in the opinion of the Air Ministry, this was impracticable, he was prepared to agree to an attackon the refineries themselves.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thatthe German railway system was dependent for itssmooth running on the successful functioning of itsmarshalling yards.    He accordingly suggested thatit was most desirable that in choosing those whichwere to be attacked that night,  due regard shouldbe paid to the selection of yards of which the interruption would be likely to have the greatesteffect in delaying the movement of German reinforce-ments.       Among the targets to be attacked he (theSecretary of State for War) suggested Cologne orOpladen, Weden, and Vohwinkel.    He mentioned, inthis connection, that General Garnelin had taken theview that attacks by heavy bombers should go deep.THE VICE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said thatthe General and Air Staffs had already been inconsultation on the question of the most suitablemarshalling yards for attack.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, apart fromthe purely military aspect, there was the important consideration of neutral opinion which would have to

be taken into account,,    American sympathy had recently been veering very much in our favour,    would the operations in view produce a revulsion of feeling,or would they be accepted by the United States asa reasonable and justifiable retaliation for Germanmethods of warfare?THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSconsidered that the present circumstances fully justified the War Cabinet in taking the decision to order these attacks, provided that they were directed against military objectives.    He pointed out that wehad already attacked Aachen and Munchen-Gladbachwithout exciting any comment from America.THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION said that farfrom creating a bad impression in the United States,the proposed operations would in his view have anadmirable effect on American opinion whose onlycomplaint was that we were not doing more.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said thatthe War Cabinet would know that he had been anxiousto delay the attack on the Ruhr until he could seemore clearly how the land battle was developing.    he now felt that this battle had reached so critical a stage that it would be useless to attempt to influenceits course by continuing daylight bombing with the extremely heavy losses which this incurred, and that itwould therefore be wrong to stay our hands any longerfrom the proposed night-bombing operations,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL considered that themoment had arrived when it was essential that we shouldcounter-attack.    The proposed attack on the German

railways and oil refineries seemed to provide thebest means of doing this, and he was accordingly infavour of our carrying out these operationsforthwith.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clearthat the Y/ar Cabinet were united in favour of takingimmediate action in delivering a hard blow atGermany.      He considered that the proposed operations would cut Germany at its tap root, and was hopeful that they might even provide an immediatecontribution to the land battle.      They should dispelFrench doubts about our willingness to suffer andalso have a salutary effect on Italy,    Finally, he considered that this was the psychological moment to strike Germany in her own country and convince theGerman people that we had both the will and thepower to hit them hard.    He accordingly suggestedthat the operations should be carried out that evening.     There was no need to consult the FrenchGovernment as they had given us full authority, atthe Supreme War Council, to carry out this operation.It would therefore merely be necessary toinform them through the usual channels.The Prime Minister  asked the Minister ofInformation to arrange that discreet reference should be made in the press to the killing of civilians in France and the Low Countries,  in thecourse of German air attacks.      No reference should,however, be made to the possibility of retaliationon our part.

The War Cabinet agreed:-(l)    That no further fighter squadronsshould for the present be sent toFrance, and to invite the PrimeMinister so to inform MonsieurReynaud.(2)    To authorise the Chief of the AirStaff to order Bomber Command tocarry out attacks on suitablemilitary objectives,  (includingmarshalling yards and oil refineries)in the Ruhr as well as elsewhere inGermany;    and that these attacksshould begin that night withapproximately 100 heavy bombers.(3)   That the French Government shouldbe informed, through the normal channels, of our intention tocarry   out these operations.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.

79My dear friend and colleague,I have examined today with the War Cabinet andall the experts the request which you made to me last night and this morning for further fighter squadrons.We are all agreed that it is better to draw the enemy on to this Island by striking at his vitals,  and thus to aid the common cause.      I have seen several of thegreat offensives in the last war from high positions and I cannot yet feel that the German difficulties will beended by their making a breach or a bulge in the Front.All experience shows that these difficulties increase with every kilometre of advance.      It would be a short-sighted policy to squander bit by bit and day by day,the fighter squadrons which are in effect our maginot line.      The enemy can switch his bomber force on to these islands at a few hours&apos; notice;    and if he should find theminadequately defended, he would be able to strike a blowat our war industry which might irretrievably damage theAllied cause.      We have recently sent additional fighter

10, jBoimtiitg Stvett,scxuadrons to Frain.ce over and above the numbers agreed beforethe war,  and our fighter strength in this country has now beenreduced to a minimum.      So long as it is not further reducedwe do not shrink - indeed we welcome as a diversion - the attack which we expect.      But we must on no account ruptureour front line of defence.The fresh demands from Generals Gamelin andGeorges which have now for the first time been made will receive our earnest attention in the light of what I have written.With sincere good wishes,  to you and Daladier,
