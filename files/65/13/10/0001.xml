THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST   SECRET.COPY NO.THE western front.Despatch ofadditionalFighterAircraft toFrance,(previous reference:W.M.(40) 123rdConclusions,Minute 1.). W.M.(40)  124th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(16th May, 1940.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that an urgent appealhad been received from Prance for the despatch ofadditional fighter aircraft.       The War Cabinet wouldhave to decide, as a matter of urgency, whether this request should be met.     German armoured fighting vehicles appeared to have broken through and reachedthe area Hirson-Montcornet-Neufchatel.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that he had spoken to the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, british air Forces in France, that morning.     Air MarshalBarratt had reported that our fighter pilots were verytired;    they had had to deal all the previous day withwaves of 40 bombers every hour, heavily escorted by fighters.      Squadrons of fighters were the propercounter to this form of attack, but they had had to operate with flights of 3 or 5, always in greatnumerical inferiority.     Every pilot was carrying out4 or 5 sorties a day.       The French appeared to be making little resistance on the ground, and the Germancasualties had probably been comparatively small.     TheAir Component had been heavily bombed the previous day,andthey also were always faced by greatly superior forces.The situation on the ground seemed slightly better that morning than it had been the previous evening, and theFrench had been seen moving in an area where Germans hadhsen retorted the previous night. Nevertheless, a later messagereceived from Air Marshal Barratt stated that theGermans had broken through as far as Neufchatel, and

the situation on the Meuse in the Sedan area was certainly very serious..     Air Marshal Blunt, with theAir Component, said that the Germans were now attackingwiihwaves of 100 bombers at a time.Our Intelligence had reached the conclusionthat out of 16 German Geschwade, each of 120, one was still in Norway, one was refitting in Germany, and theremainder were all operating in France.-    Of theirshort-range dive-bombers, however, only 30 to 40 percent seemed to have ^een employed.Replacements of fighter casualties were being sent over to France as quickly as possible, butdeficiencies could not be made up in full.      On all theinformation at his disposal he had decided to recommendthat 8 flights, the equivalent of 4 fighter squadrons,should be sent immediately in response to the request from France.THE PRIME MINISTER said that to despatchfighter aircraft from this country at a time when wewere most likely to be attacked ourselves in response tothe attacks on military targets in the Ruhr the previous night,was taking a very grave risk, but it seemed essential todo something to bolster up the French..    Armoured fight-ing vehicles could not conquer the whole of France, butthere was a danger of their spreading panic behind thelines.     The first necessity, therefore, was to supportthe French morale and give them a chance to recoverthemselves and deal with German armoured forces by theuse of their own Army.     He favoured withdrawing the 2fighter squadrons allocated to the defence of Scapa andsending 6 squadrons in all.     More than that we couldnot do. .   If the fighters were taken away from Scapa theFleet might have to be sent round to the Clyde, butScapa was heavily defended by anti-aircraft artilleryin addition to the ships&apos; batteries.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR pointed outthat the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, fighter command, had made strong representations the previous dayagainst sending any fighters out of the country.   He hadnot changed this view, even when told of the situationin France.    In these circumstances, he (the Secretary ofState) was not in favour of sending more than the 4squadrons for which Air Marshal Barratt had asked.General Gamelin had certainly asked for 10 squadronsthe previous night, hut this had presumably been beforeconsultation between the Staffs.    Air Marshal Barratt&apos;message had been received at 7.0 a.m.  that morning,presumably after the Staffs had examined the situation.Air Marshal Joubert de la Ferte was going over to Francethat day to Air Marshal Barratt to discuss the position,and, in particular, to find out what use the French were making of their own fighters.   Fighter aircraft in theFrench service were very much decentralised, and it waspossible that full use was not being made of them.    he urged,  therefore, that we should at least await air marshal Jouberfs report before sending anything more than squadrons.    The despatch even of these squadrons wouldbe a very serious risk, and the War Cabinet should realise that they were acting contrary to the advice of theAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, who was responsible for the defence of this country.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Commander-in-Chief had been consulted regarding the withdrawal of fighters from Scapa.    There had been originally 48Hurricane fighters there.    Of these 16 had already been

withdrawn, hut the Commander-in-Chief thought 24 was the absolute minimum if the base was to be used by theFleet.    Apart from Hurricanes, he had only the equivalent of about 1-g- squadrons of older types of fighters available.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatit was not only the safety of the Fleet which had to beaconsidered, but also the defence of our other vitalpoints such as aircraft factories.    If the defencesof Scapa could be reduced, some of the fightersfrom there might be urgently required elsewhere inthe United Kingdom.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that hecould not recommend the despatch of 6 squadrons.    If the2 squadrons from Scapa could be used elsewhere, hethought they should be kept for the defence of thiscountry.    It would be for the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, to decide, in ^onoultatlon^wJAfoitk-a &quot;iTdjniral^fc, as to the disposition of these squadrons.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had just received a message from our ambassador in Paris, who reported that .M. Reynaud wasvery seriously alarmed and feared that German armoured fighting vehicles would reach Paris that night.    general gamelin was sending a fresh appeal for fighters and proposing that they should be based on the lower Seine,where they could be rapidly recalled to the UnitedKingdom in emergency.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat according to a message he had just received fromGeneral Gamelin, the Germans had not yet reached Laon,where there were French armoured troops.    The French were

going to counter-attack in that area.    Mezieres was still in French hands. &quot; Hirson seemed to be the northernedge of the break-through. &apos;THE PRIME MINISTER said that the main reasonfor the despatch of fighters was to give the Frenchmoral support.   Provided their ground troops furtherback put up some opposition against them, it should bepossible to deal with German armoured forces in comparatively small numbers.    They would surely notbe allowed to reach Paris altogether unopposed.The War Cabinet agreed:-(i) That arrangements should be made forthe immediate despatch of the equivalent of 4 fighter squadrons to Prance,-(ii) That preparations should be made forthe despatch of 2 additional fighter squadrons, at very short notice, if itwas so decided.-(iii) That a decision whether to send the %additional squadrons to France should betaken in the lighttof Air MarshalJoubert de la Ferte&apos;s report later in the day.(iv) That the French should be informed ofthe decision at (i) only.(NOTE;    The Chief of the Air Staffinformed the Air Staff ofthese decisions at 12 Noon.)
