MINUTE B.Confidential Annex.(31st May,  1940).THE FIRST SEA LORD read to the War Cabinet atelegram received from Lord Cork, the substance ofwhich was as follows:-Lord Cork felt that in telling the Norwegiansof our intention to egacuate northern Norway twoconditions would have to be fulfilled -(a) They should not be told so earlythat by a premature withdrawal oftheir troops they might endanger the safety of ours.(b) They should not be told so late thatthe withdrawal of our troops would endanger theirs.In order to satisfy these two c conditions Lord Corkasked that he might be empowered to fix. the timefor the making of the communication to the norwegian government, and he asked for instructions as to themethod by which the Norwegians should be told, and suggested that the British Minister should be askedto go to Harstad to concert matters with him.The War Cabinet v/ere informed that at ameeting of Ministers and Chiefs of Staff under theChairmanship of the Prime Minister which had beenheld at 11 p.m.  the evening before, it had beendecided that Lord Cork&apos;s proposal ought to be approved,and that a reply to his telegram ought to be preparedby the Foreign Secretary and the First Lord of theAdmiralty in consultation.    It should not be sent off,however, until the Prime Minister had notified from paris the French concurrence to our policy.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that he was of theopinion that the two conditions stated by Lord Corkcould not be satisfied unless the Norwegian troops,v/ere taken off at the same time as our own.    A reply had been drafted, v/hich he read to the War Cabinet,

The War Cabinet:::NOTE : The reply as approved wasnot sent - see,M.(40) 150thConclusions.(a) Approved the reply*to Lord Cork asamended in discussion, and took note that the Foreign Office would instructHis Majesty&apos;s Minister to proceed toHarstad to confer with Lord Cork.(b) Agreed that the reply to Lord Corkshould not be sent until word   hadbeen received from the Prime minister that the French were in agreementwith our policy in northern Norway..)estruction of THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the Chiefs of oil in Norway.       Staff had been considering whether it would be possibleto prevent all the oil stocks in northern Norway from falling into the hands of the Germans.     There were12,000 tons in the area occupied by our troops whichcould probably be destroyed &quot;!sy them, and there was38,000 tons farther north, mainly at Tromso, underNorwegian control.In the discussion,it was agreed that ifpossible all the oil should be destroyed but it was felt that it would be unwise to act without regard toNorwegian feelings in the matter, particularly as we hoped to retain the use of Norwegian shipping.      It wassuggested that if the Norwegians were unwilling to act,we might offer to compensate them for its destruction.It was thought best to consult Lord Cork before taking a decision.The War cabinet authorised the First Lord of theAdmiralty to draw the attention of admiral of the Fleet Lord Cork tothe desirability of ensuring thedestruction of Norwegian oil supplies,and to enquire what in his opinion would be the best method of proceeding in the matter, with the object ofsecuring the destruction of the oilwithout too much injury to our good relations with the Norwegians.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,THE SECRETARY OP STATS POR FOREIGN affairs said, he agreed that it was right to leave Lord Corkthe choice of the time for telling the Norwegians.The Foreign Office would send full instructionsthrough Lord Cork to Sir C. Dormer as to the lines on which he should speak to the Norwegian government when the time came.      Lord Cork had made no mention of the Norwegian King and Government, though in thedraft reply it was said that H.M.S.
