THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMEN^ 4 6TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST    SECRET, COPY NO.W-M.(40)  140th CONCLUSIONS,Confidential Annex.(26th May, 1940 - 2.0 p.m.)PRANCE.M. Reynaud&apos;visit.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did notthink that M. Reynaud would object to the british expeditionary Force being ordered to march to thecoast, although this matter had not yet been finally settled with him, ^The Prime Minister then gave an account ofMo Reynaud;s discussion with him over lunch.M. Reynaud had given an expose of France&apos;position^       Apart from the troops in&quot; the maginot line, including the fortress troops, the French had50 divisions between Maimed^ and the coast.      against these the Germans could put 150 divisions.        TheFrench Ministers had asked General Weygand for his views on the position.      They would defend Paris aslong as possible, but if Paris was taken they wouldretire to the south-west.      General Weygand had made it clear, however, that the Germans with theirsuperiority of numbers and tanks,  could pierce theline and pass through it*     While he would obey orders and fight it out as long as he was told to do so, andwould be prepared to go down fighting for the honour of the Flag, he did not think that France&apos;s resistancewas likely to last very long against a determinedGerman onslaught.The French Ministers therefore concluded that,with 50 divisions against 150, it was clear that thewar could not be won on lando      On sea we had goodfleets which had established a superiority over germany;    but if Germany had command of resources from Brest to Vladivostok it did not look as thoughthe blockade could win the war0      It was clear thatthis country would take a long time to build up a bigarmy, and that we could not make a big effort in 1941on land.This left the Air,      If the Germans tookParis they would have the air factories in thatneighbourhood, as well as those in Belgium and Holland.What of the United States of America?munitions industry in that country was feeble.The-1-$ fi cofr   oj-  the  .neS*^e   flnallyf  Sent  [torn    M.

Where, then,  could France look for salvation?Someone had suggested that a further approach should he made to Italy.    This would release 1C French divisionscThere were said to he a number of people in Italy,such as Grandi and Balbo, and the like, who thoughtthat to stab France in the back when she was in amortal struggle with Germany was rather too like theaction which Russia had taken in regard to PolandoIf an approach was made to Italy, what sort of terms would Italy ask?   Probably the neutralisationof Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, the demilitarisationof Malta, and the limitation of naval forces in theMediterranean    Some alteration in the status of Tuniswould also be asked for, and the Dodecanese (Sic) would haveto be put right.    The Prime Minister said that he hadnot understood what was meant by this.Apparently the French suggestion was that.theoffer of such terms might keep Italy out of the war.M. Reynaud realised that the Germans wouldprobably not keep any terms which they agreed to.    Hehad hinted that he himself would not sign peace termsimposed upon France, but that he might be forced to resign, or might feel that he ought to resign.The Prime Minister said that he had then put the other side of the case, and suggested that as soon asthe situation in North-eastern France had been cleared up, the Germane: would make no further attacks on theFrench line and would immediately start attacking thiscountry.    Me Reynaud thought that the dream of allGermans was to conquer Paris, and that they would marchon Paris.The Prime Minister had said that we were notprepared to give in on any account.    We would rathergo down fighting than be enslaved to Germany.    But inany case we were confident that we had a good chanceof s\irviving the German onslaught,,    France, however,must stay in the war.    If only we could stick thingsout for another three months, the position would be entirely different.    He had asked M. Reynaud if anypeace terms had been offered to him.    M. Reynaud had said &quot;No,&quot; but that they knew they could get an offer ifthey wanted one.    He repeated that General Weygand was prepared to fight on, but could hold out no hope that france had sufficient power of resistance.The Prime Minister said that he suggested thatthe Foreign Secretary should now go over and see M.Reynaud, who was at Admiralty House., and that he himself,the Lord President of the Council and the Lord privy seal should come over a few minutes later.A short further discussion ensued an whether we should make any approach to ItalycTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY favoured this course, and thought that the last thing that Signor Mussoliniwanted was to see Herr Hitler dominating Europe.    Hewould ba? anxious,  if he could, to persuade Herr Hitlerto&quot; take a more reasonable attitude.

THE PRIME MINISTER doubted whether anythingwould come of an approach to Italy, but said that thematter was one which the War Cabinet would have toconsider0THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that ifwe could maintain the struggle for some further weekshe thought that we could make use of our economicpower in regard to raw materials, textiles, and oil.Stocks in Germany were very depleted.        In any event,he hoped that France would take steps to see thatvaluable stocks and manufacturing capacity in Francedid not fall into German hands.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought theonly point to be settled that day was^that general weygand should be instructed (to persuade M. Reynaud)to issue orders for the B.E.F.  to march to the coast.It was important to make sure that the French had no complaint against us on the score that, by cutting our way to the coast, we were letting them down militarily.At the same time it was important that the orders forthe march to the coast should be issued as soon aspossibleo       He asked the Secretary of State for war to prepare a draft telegram for despatch, which shouldbe brought over to Admiralty House at 3.15 p.m.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL mentioned the possibilityof using smoke to mask the re-embarkation of our troops and of material.After M. Reynaud&apos;s departure, an informalMeeting of War Cabinet Ministers was held in AdmiraltyHouse.This record does not cover the first quarterof an hour of the discussion, during which the secretary was not present.5  X x x xTHE PRIME MINISTER said that we were in adifferent position from Prance.      In the first place,we still had powers of resistance- and attack, whichthey had noto        In the second place, they would belikely to be offered decent terms by Germany, whichwe should not0        If France could not defend herself,it was better that she should get out of the war ratherthan that she should drag us into a settlement which involved intolerable terms.      There was no    limit to   -the terms which Germany would impose upon us if-she had her way.       From one point of view, he wouldrather France was out of the war before she was broken up, and retained the position of a strong neutral whosefactories could not be used against us.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that Herr hitler was working to a time-limit, and he had to win by theend of the year.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thoughtthat he would have to win by the beginning of thewinter.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that if Prance nowwent out of the war, Herr Hitler would be able to turnon us the sooner0THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hoped thatPrance would hang on.        At the same time we must takecare not to be forced into a weak position in whichwe went to Signor Mussolini and invited him to go to herr Hitler and ask him to treat us nicely.     We mustnot get entangled in a position of that kind before we had been involved in any serious fighting.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he did notdisagree with this view, but that he attached perhapsrather more importance than the Prime Minister to thedesirability of allowing France to try out thepossibilities of European equilibrium.     He was not quite convinced that the Prime Minister&apos;s diagnosiswas correct and that it was in Herr Hitler&apos;s interestto insist on outrageous terms.     After all, he knewhis own internal weaknesses.     On this lay-out it mightbe possible to save France from the wreck.      He wouldnot like to see France subjected to the Gestapo.THE PRIME MINISTER did not think that germany was likely to attempt this in regard to Prance.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he was not so sure.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary thoughtthat we might say to Signor Mussolini that if there was any suggestion of terms which affected our independence,we should not look at them for a moment.      If, however,Signor Mussolini was as alarmed as we felt that he must be in regard to Herr Hitler&apos;s power, and was prepared to look at matters from the point of view ofthe balance of power, then we might consider Italianclaimso     At any rate, he could see no harm in tryingthis line of approach.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO thought thatwe should soon get to the point at which demands weremade which affected the security of the British Empire.But he saw no objection to this line of approach beingtried.     He doubted, however, whether it was withinSignor Mussolini&apos;s power to take a line independent of herr Hitler.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thoughtthat Signor Mussolini could only take an independentline if Herr Hitler was disposed to conform to the line which Signor Mussolini indicated.     Tne problem was avery difficult one, and it was right to talk it out from every point of view.

M8 Reynaud wanted us to say to signor mussolini that if he did not come into the war against us we were prepared to do a deal with him in regard tocertain named places.     We were not prepared to accept that proposition as it stood.     For one thing, the onlyadvantage we should get was that Prance would he ableto move away the ten divisions now on the italian front.    Signor Mussolini would get something fornothing, and what was offered would he only the starting-point for new demands.Another method of approach would he if theFrench told Signor Mussolini, that he must consider thefuture of Europe, including his own future.     Italy wasin no safer position that any other country.      IfSignor Mussolini was prepared to collaborate with usin getting tolerable terms, then we would be preparedto discuss Italian demands with him.Mo Reynaud, however, had thought that signor mussolini would not deal on these lines, but would want a specific offer made to him.The Prime Minister had said that it was undesirable that France should be in a position to saythat we had stood between her and a tolerable settlement.He referred to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement that we might be better off without France.     Thatmeant, provided we could obtain safeguards on particular points,     This was certainly a point of view whichdeserved serious consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was best to decide nothing until we saw how much of the Army wecould re-embark from France.      The operation might bea great failure.     On the other hand, our troops mightwell fight magnificently, and we might save a con-siderable portion of the Force.     A good deal of there-embarkation would be carried out by day.       Thiswould afford a real test of air superiority, since theGermans would attempt to bomb the ships and boats.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that germany might well attempt some diversion against this countrywhile we were engaged in re-embarking the Force.x x x x        xTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY then explained theposition in regard to the approach to Italy.     He readout the joint communication which we had made with theFrench to the United States (See Telegrams No.198 DIPP to paris, dated 24.5.40 and 887 DIPP to Washington, dated25. 5,40;.s&amp;. It was not certain what action, xf any,PresidentT Roosevelt would take on this demarche.The Foreign Secretary then read out an accountof the interview which he had had with the italian ambassador the previous day (See Despatch to RomeNo. 413^)

THE PRIME MINISTER said, that his generalcomment on the suggested approach to Signor Mussoliniwas that it implied that if we were prepared to giveGermany hack her colonies and to make certain concessions in the Mediterranean, it was possible for us to get outof our present difficulties0    He thought that no suchoption was open to us0    For example,  the terms offeredwould certainly prevent us from completing our re-armamcntTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that,  if so,, theterms would he refused9 hut he felt sure that signor mussolini must feel in a most uncomfortable position the PRIME MINISTER said that Herr Hitler thoughtthat he had the whip hand.-,    The only thing to do was toshow him that he could not conquer this country     If, onM. Reynaud&apos;s showing,, France could not continue,&quot;e mustpart company c    At the same time, he did not raise objection to some approach being made to Signor MussolinioTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY then read to the WarCabinet the draft which had been discussed that afternoc-..with Mo Reynaudo    Mo Reynaud had wished to add someprecise^ details, but had been willing to drop thissugge-stion0THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO thought that signor Mussolini would be out to get Malta, gibraltar and Suez0    He felt sure that the negotiations v/ould breakdown; but Herr Hitler would get to know of them,  and itmight ha*v:e a bad effect on our prestigeTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thought thathe would make some extra demands on us;    as, forexample, Somaliland, Kenya, or Uganda,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that this was agood argument against mentioning particular matters inthe approach^THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thought that signor Mussolini would say that he knew what he wanted,but was only.prepared to deal as part of a generalsettlementcTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that if we got tothe point of discussing the terms of a general settle-men t and found that we could obtain terms which did notpostulate the destruction of our independence, we shouldbe foolish if we did not accept them,THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that thediscussions contemplated would take some time.    Meanwhile,France would be getting into a worse position.    If Pariswas likely to be taken within a short time, was therereally any chance that negotiations would serve any purpose?

The War Cabinet:-Belgium:message from sir roger Keyes.information for theDominions.Eire:erehaven.Relations^fetwe en E irepid NorthernIreland.(l) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate to the War Cabinet, fordiscussion on the ensuing day, thedraft of a communication to Italy*,together with a record of the foreign secretary&apos;s discussion with SignorBastianini:(2) Agreed that the Secretary of Statefor Air, as head of the Liberal Party,should be invited to be present when this matter was discussed.During the latter part of this discussion the Prime Minister was called out of the room to speak to Sir Roger Keyes, who had a message from the King ofthe Belgians.    The King was determined to stay with his army.    There was, perhaps, a chance that he might be persuaded to leave at the last minute.    The Belgians were determined to act as the left flank to assist ourre-embarkation.    Sir Roger Keyes said there was stillnothing :ln Ostend to prevent it being taken.    The MeninGate was being shelled that afternoon.    He had been atLord Gorfs headquarters when orders had come to march to the coast.    It was clear that these orders had beenreceived with acclamation at G.H.Q., where it was held that the march to the South held out no prospect of success,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL asked what information should be given to the Dominions.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that nothing shouldbe said to them in regard to the discussions with M.Reynaud.    At the same time, they should be told thatwe had now obtained the formal assent of the FrenchGovernment to falling back on the coast, and that theposition was a serious one.In connection with the previous discussion, theLORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Chiefs ofStaff5 s Report on &quot;British Strategy in a CertainEventuality&quot;(W.P.(40) 168) had referred to the desirabilit:of getting hold of Berehaven.    He (the Lord President)was seeing the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs that afternoon, and he thought that Sir John Maffeyshould be told to see Mr.  de Valera in order to explain to him how serious the position was and how importantit was that we should be able to occupy Berehaven again in the near future.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY again raised the.questionof getting the Northern Ireland Government into some kind of relation with the Government of Eire.Circulated as W. (40) 170.

THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he had seenLord Craigavon, who had said that he would do whateverwas askedc     He had no objection to his people gettingtogether with the representatives of Eire and discussingmatters.      The difficulty was that defence was are served subject, and that discussions on local matters were already taking place between the Northern IrelandPolice and the Eire Police.      In these circumstances the Lord President said that he had found it difficultto know what further specific suggestion he could make to Lord Craigavon.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.

OUTWARD TELEGRAM 157[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bekept under Lock and Key.]SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION AND WAR CABINET.TO:      FRANCE.Cypher telegram to Sir R. Campbell, (Paris).Foreign Office.     24th Hay, 1940.     7o&apos;406p^moNo. 198.   DIPP.-------oOo--------HOST IMMEDIATE.Your telegrams Nos. 241 [of Hay 21st], 255 and 262 [both ofMay 25rd.   possible approach to Italy].The idea now put forward by the French Prime Minister and minister for Foreign Affairs viz. to approach Signor Mussolinithroughtthe President of the United States is welcome to HisMajesty s Government, who have themselves been contemplating thepossibility of taking action in this sense.   His Majesty s Govern-ment would see no objection to an enquiry being addressed to signor mussolini on the lines suggested in paragraph 2 of your telegram No.262, provided that this was done on the President!s own responsi-bility.2.     At the same time it would be useful, in the opinion of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, if President Roosevelt were to convey to signor mussolini the sense of the last two paragraphs of the statement wehad in mind to malce concerning Italy (see my telegram No. 406 to rome action on which has been suspended), omitting the question of contraband control which; as Your Excellency knows, is now being dealt with separately in&apos;Rome through the Master of the Rolls.   Inother words, we would suggest that the President might inform signor mussolini that &quot;he had reason to believe that the following repre-sented the attitude of the Allied Governments&quot;:-That the Allied Governments(a) were aware that the Italian Government entertains certaingrievances in regard to the Italian position in the Mediterranean,(b) were prepared to consider reasonable Italian claims at theend of the war,(c) would welcome Italy!s participation at the peace confer-ence with a status equal to that of the belligerents.3.     This offer would be more attractive to the Italian Govern-ment if the United States Government could not only sponsor butguarantee it, and His Majesty s Government would accordingly suggestthat the President should be asked to make the following statement in addition:-That the United States Government for their part would beprepared to guarantee the fulfilment of the Allied promise, but thatthey could only do so - thus ensuring that Italian claims would bedealt with as part of the general settlement of Europe - provided always that in the meantime Italy had not joined in the war againstthe Allies.

4.     Please endeavour to obtain the early concurrence of the French Government in these proposals,   So soon as Ihear that they are in agreement, I would propose to telegraph to Washington in this sense, and would suggest that theFrench Government should take similar action,,Addressed to Paris Noc 198 DIPP.Repeated to Rome No, 465 and Washington No. 869.

Sir E. Bridges.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTSECRET. -^^WS^-rMl N Copy No.[R 6198/G]Viscount Halifax to Si?&apos; P. Loraine (Rome).(No. 413.)Sir, Foreign Office, May 25, 1940.I ASKED the Italian Ambassador to call this afternoon.2. I told his Excellency that I wished to speak to him because I had reasonto think that a misunderstanding had arisen with regard to the possibility ofsome statement being made by His Majesty&apos;s Government about the political issues between our two countries. It was quite true that we had intended tomake an approach, in appropriate form, to certain political questions, following on the approach which we had made to questions concerning contraband control;and in any such approach we should have wished to make plain our desire that italy should naturally take her proper place at a peace conference by the sideof the belligerents. I had, however, hesitated to make the approach in questionbecause of the discouraging nature of the reply which Signor Mussolini had sent through Count Ciano to a personal communication from the Prime Minister,which had led me to doubt whether any useful purpose would be served by ourtrying to define our position more closely to the Italian Government. In view,however, of the misunderstanding which seemed to have arisen, I wished totake the opportunity of saying that, while we fully recognised the special relations in which Italy stood to Germany, we had always been quite willing to discussany questions between our two countries and to endeavour to reach solutionssatisfactory to both sides. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing at anytime to propose such a discussion to tihe Italian Government if we could have some assurance that we should not be rebuffed. If and when we should everreceive an indication that our approach might be received with due consideration,we should be prepared to carry the matter further and deal with it in greater detail. Personally I should hope, and I felt sure that this would be the viewof His Majesty&apos;s&quot; Government, that the measure of success which we were inthe way of achieving as regards the difficulties connected with contraband controlmight serve to open the way to the treatment of other questions, always providedthat we could approach these questions on the basis of the frankest recognitionof the rights and necessities of both parties.3. I told his Excellency that I had thought that I ought to give himthis message in order that I might feel, and perhaps his Excellency also, that,so far as we were concerned, nothing had been left undone that could help toavoid any misunderstanding, or something worse, between our two countries.4. Signor Bastianini thanked me very much for my communication. Hesaid that he had no knowledge of the exchange of letters between Signor Mussoliniand the Prime Minister, but that he would of course immediately pass on what i had said to his Government. It had, however, always been Signor Mussolini&apos;view that the settlement of problems between Italy and any other country shouldbe part of a general European settlement, and his Excellency asked me whether he might inform his Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered itopportune now to examine the questions at issue between our two countrieswithin the larger framework of a European settlement.5. I said that I had always thought, if any discussions were to be held witha view to solving European questions and building a peaceful Europe, that matters which caused anxiety to Italy must certainly be discussed as part of the generalEuropean settlement.6. Whether or not it might be possible to bring matters, which causedanxiety to Italy, to solution while the war was still in progress would no doubtdepend upon the nature of the issues raised, and upon the course which any discussions might take.7. Signor Bastianini then said that he would like to know whether HisMajesty&apos;s Government would consider it possible to discuss general questionsinvolving not only Great Britain and Italy, but other countries. On my saying10916-37   [21261-10]
that it was difficult to visualise such wide discussions while the war was still proceeding, the Ambassador replied that once such a discussion were begun, war would be pointless.8. Signor Mussolini, said the Ambassador, was interested in Europeanquestions the Ambassador mentioned Poland and was always concerned tobuild a European settlement, that would not merely be an armistice, but wouldprotect European peace for a century. I said that the purpose of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was the same, and they would never be unwilling to consider anyproposal made with authority that gave promise of the establishment of a secureand peaceful Europe. I added that I thought I could say that this would alsobe the attitude of the French Government.9. The Ambassador warmly agreed with an observation that I had madeto the effect that when we came to such discussions, Signor Mussolini would havean absolutely vital part to play. Signor Mussolini was always ready to help in securing a wider European settlement because he saw the solution of Italianproblems only within the framework of the solution of all the problems of allother European countries.10. His Excellency said that he would like to be able to inform signor mussolini that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not exclude the possibility of some discussion of the wider problems of Europe in the event of the opportunityarising. This I told his Excellency he could certainly do, for plainly the securepeace in Europe that both Signor Mussolini and we desired to see establishedcould only come by the finding through frank discussion of solutions that were generally acceptable and by the joint determination of the Great Powers tomaintain them.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.
