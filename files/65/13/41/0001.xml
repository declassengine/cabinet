(40)  165RD CONCLUSIONS... MINUTE..3.Confidential Annex.(12th.June,  1940 - 50 0 p.m. )THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had heena very melancholy Meeting of the Supreme War council at G.Q.G.      The French representatives had heenstudiously polite and dignified hut it was clear that france was near the end of organised resistance.GENERAL WEYGAND had first made his report and this had heen later corroborated by General Georgesin almost identical terms.    The main points of GeneralWeygandrs report had been as follows(i) The French armies had been fighting for six days,  night and day,  and were now almost completely exhausted.    In some place two divisionsv/ere holding 120 kilometres of front and somedivisions had been reduced to a strength of twobattalions0    The enemy seemed to have over-matched and outwitted them altogether.    The french had some 65 divisions in all,  of which 40 hadtaken the brunt of the enemy&apos;s attack into whichhe had put some 120 divisions in addition toarmoured forces.(ii) The enemy?s armoured forces had caused greatdisorganisation among the headquarters of theHigher formations.    General Weygand, himself,had been at Tenth Army Headquarters when, after receiving reports of the close approach of theenemy,  the headquarters had suddenly   come undershell fire.    These large formation headquarterswere very unwieldy to move and when on the movecould not exercise any proper control over lowerf orrnationsc(iii) The French army was now on its last line which had already been penetrated, but not decisively,in two or three places.    If the French had. twentyfresh divisions available for a counter attackthey might turn the scale, since the enemy forv/ardtroops v/ere at the end of their tether too.    Butthe Germans had fresh formations following onbehind whereas the Allies had no reserves at all.(iv) General Weygand expressed the opinion thatthe Allies had entered upon the war very lightlywithout making the necessary preparations.    Noproper estimate had been made of the enormousstrength of the enemy who had added some 55divisions and three to four thousand tanks to his forces since the outbreak of war.

2SS(v)    The present position of the French forces was the last on which he would attempt to offeran organised and co-ordinated resistance,    If itcollapsed he would not he responsible for anyattempt to carry on the struggle, hut would hewilling to serve under any other officer if required,.Continuing The Prime Minister said thatGeneral de Gaulle who was sitting with M,  Reynaud, wasall in favour of carrying on a guerilla warfare.    Hewas youn; and energetic and had made a very favourableimpression,,    He did not believe in a &quot;war of fronts&quot;and thought that new methods must be adopted.    it seemed probable that if the present line collapsed,M,  Reynaud would turn to General de Gaulle to takecommand,M,  Reynaud had said that Marshal Petain hadquite made up his mind that peace must be made with theGermans0    His view was that all France was beingsystematically destroyed by the Germans and that itwas his duty to save the rest of the country from thisfate.    He had gone so far as to write a memorandumon the subject which he had shown to M.  Reynaud but had not left it mwita-bin.. There could be no doubt that marshall Petain was a dangerous man at this juncture;he had always been a defeatist,  even in the last war.The Prime Minister said that he had putcertain questions to the French as follows(a) Would not the large built-up area of Parisform a good centre of resistance to the advance of the enemy&apos;s tanks, 3 ike Madrid.General Weygand had replied that he hadalready informed the Paris deputies that the citywould be declared an open town and that no attempt atresistance would be made in it.    It was full ofdefenceless people and he could not see it destroyedby German bombardment,(b) Was there not a chance of making a counter-attack across the lower Seine to cut in onto the German communications leadingtowards Paris?   We might be able to gathertogether some eight or nine divisions withina week or so,  if we put in the FrenchChasseurs Alpins and the British troops from Narvik,  the 52nd Division,  theCanadian Division and the 3rd Divisio,which would be ready in this country aboutthe 20th,    There were also two french divisions which were being reconstitutedin the area.General Weygand had replied that the conception was sound strategically, but the question was whether they could hold out long enough to collect the reserves for this counter-attack.    Heevidently had not thought so himself and it was onthese grounds that the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had been authorised to agree to put inthe British reinforcements piecemeal by brigadesas they arrived,.

(c)    If the period of co-ordinated defence came to an end, would it not he possible tocarry on a &quot;war of columns&quot;?      This wouldforce the Germans to expend a very largenumber of troops in combatting thesetactics, and might enable the French tohold out until the United States came intothe war on our side.General Weygand had replied that he did not himself feel that it would be possible for the french to hold out so long, but he had repeated that he wouldbe willing to serve under any other General who would undertake the task of commandoThe Prime Minister said that M, Reynaudseemed quite determined to fight on and Admiral Darlanhad declared emphatically that he would never surrenderthe French Navy to the enemy.      In the last resort hewould send it over to Canada.     Nevertheless,  there was of course the danger that he might be over-ruled bythe politicians.,The Prime Minister had emphasised to theFrench that if there was any grave deterioration inthe situation on which they felt they had to take decisions of great moment, we must be informedimmediately and given an opportunity to consult withthem before such decisions were taken.Some discussion then took place as to how the Germans managed to keep such a tremendous offensiveeffort going without relaxation.THE PRIME MINISTER said that for six yearsthey had been preparing their offensive war,  and thewhole Army was imbued with the spirit to press forward at all cost so the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that theFrench had explained to him that,  whereas in the last war an advance was carried out behind a barrage to acertain depth,  and then there had. to be a halt whilethe artillery was moved forward,  in this war-the actionof the dive-bombers and the tanks together enabled the momentum of the attack to be continuously sustained.It was this which had thrown into confusion the defensive plans of the French,The effect of the Prime Minister&apos;s visit tothe French Government had been remarkable:    and whereasthey had at first appeared as men who had&apos;abandonedhope, they were now inspired to bend their minds to see what could be done if their line were broken..     Thechief danger to the continuance of French resistancewas the fact that, apart from Marshal Peta;\n, whose attitude was defeatist,  there was no personality inM. Reynaud&apos;s Cabinet.      Thus the French politicians infavour of coming to an understanding with the germans might find themselves strong enough to overthrowM.- Reynaud,     Although no reproaches had been levelledat our heads, the French showed clearly that they regarded our military effort as small,  and  remarked that we had only put one-quarter to one-third of ourinto the battle.      Out of such thoughts an anti--

British feeling might easily be worked up,      On theother hand, General Howard Vyse was firmly of theopinion that the French would fight en,      Nevertheless,he (the Secretary of State) thought that the onefactor which might decide the French to continue tofight would he some decisive step by the UnitedStates of America;    such as the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Germany,      M. Reynaud had emphasised the importance of this,THE PRIS/E MINISTER said that he had premisedto send a further message to the President of theUnited States, placing before him clearly the present-situation.Continuing,  the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARsaid that the French would shortly be having a decisiveCabinet meeting, at which M, Reynaud&apos;s hand would be greatly strengthened if he could say that he had an assurance from the British War Cabinet that, however the war might develop, we would continue to stand byPrance;    that we should never desert her, and would goto the uttermost to recover all that France had lost.Discussion then turned upon the part played by the air in the battles in France:,     THE lord president OF iHE COUNCIL enquired whether,  if we hadthrown in the whole of our fighter resources regard1of our own safety,  the battle would thereby have beenwon,      THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF wasemphatic that this was not so,-      The disparity in numbers after the loss of the armies of the North,and the efforts of the German Armoured Divisions,would still have been too much for the French.    Therewas undoubtedly a feeling in the French Army that wehad not given them adequate support,  though a gooddeal of this feeling was in the nature of an excuseto cover themselves.      It, might, however, be easilyworked up.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR quotedextracts from the discussion which had taken place atthe meeting in France, in which M. Reynaud and general weygand had emphasised the decisive effect of airpower,  and had expressed the view that a great attack by the Allied air forces - which was the only reserveleft to the Allied Governments - might even now turn the scale,THE PRIMS MINISTER said that he could notbelieve that this was so, but he had neverthelesspromised that the War Cabinet would earnestly consider what:air support we could give, and would certainly not in any way lessen the amount which had hitherto been given.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR enquire whether a considerable psychological effect might notbe achieved if the Royal Air Force in some way could make their presence visible to the French troops onextensive areas of the front.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought that this could, at any rate he done hy action on the LowerSeine, from which the most dangerous attack v/asdeveloping, and where it would he worth while makingour greatest effort.    Summing up the position, hethought^that a chapter in the v/ar was now closing.The French might continue the struggle;    there might even he two French Governments, one which made peace,and one which organised resistance in the colonies and with the Fleet, and carried on a guertlla warfare -it was too early yet to tell;    hut effective resistanceas a great land power v/as coming to an end.    We must now concentrate everything on the defence of this island, though&apos;for a period we might still have to send a measure of support to France./ He viewed the newphase with confidence.    A declaration that v/e v/erefirmly resolved to continue the war in all circumstances would prove the best invitation to theUnited States of America to lend us their support.We should maintain the blockade, and win through,though at the cost of ruin and starvation throughout europe.    In the meanwhile,  the flow of our forces toFrance must continue, and the Air Staff must consider how great an effort v/e could put in during thefollowing two or three days to support the battle.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSenquired whether he should reveal the situation infull to the Dominion High Commissioners that evening.Some of them v/ere inclined to regard events from apessimistic angle, but we could correct any impressionthey might convey to their Governments by means of ourown messages to the Dominion Prime Ministers through our High Commissioners in the Dominions.It was generally agreed that in suchimportant matters  it was essential to make theDominions realise that v/e were taking them fully into our confidence, and that the situation should thereforebe frankly communicated to the High Commissioners.The War Cabinet -(i) Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to reinforce, through his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in France,the request made by the Prime Ministerto M-,  Reynaud, and accepted by him;namely, that if there v/ere a gravedeterioration in the situation and before the French Government tookany decisive action, theywould inform us,  so that frank and full consultation could take placec(ii)    Invited the Prime Minister to send a message to President Roosevelt,giving him a full picture of thepresent situation and possible developments.

(iii) Took note that the Prime Minister woulddraft a message for despatch to the FrenchGovernment, designed to sustain their determination, and to assure them of ourunwavering support in all circumstances,(iv) Invited the Secretary of State for Air toexamine the extent of air support whichcould he given to the land hattie in the ensuing days, and to inform the PrimeMinister who would communicate this information to the French Government,(v )     Invited the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to inform the Dominion HighCommissioner8 forthwith of the situation,and of possible developments,(V&apos;i)    Invited the Secretary of State for Air totake steps to secure the transfer ofGerman air crews captured by the french to safe custody in the United Kingdom,Richmond Terrace,  S.W.1,
