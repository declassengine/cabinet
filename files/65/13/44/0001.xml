THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 3 0 0lit is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.-   MOST    SECRET. COPY NO.  /VW.M.(40) 167th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 6;Confidential Annex.(15th June, 1940 - 10.0 a.m.)FRENCH NAVY. THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatmessages had passed between the British Naval liaison officer in France and the Admiralty which had animportant bearing on the French political reactionswhich might result from our decision to withdraw our forces from France.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF read the telegramfrom the British Naval Liaison Officer in France.    Thiswas to the effect that the French Government was atpresent extremely disorganised and that most of the ministries were en route for Bordeaux, the only oneremaining being the Admiralty, which was in goodheart.      In view of the possibility that a politicaldecision might forestall arrangements which could bemade to transfer French naval strength and material to the United Kingdom, immediate steps should be takento communicate proposals to the French Admiralty forsuch a transfer;    and, if possible, priority listsshould be drawn up for this purpose       Any encouragingadvice to the French Admiralty would, in the opinionof the Liaison Office, be much appreCiatediThe Chief of Naval Staff read the reply which he had sent, and which was to the following effect.M. Reynaud had stated that it was theintention of the French Government to continue fighting,even if this entailed the withdrawal of the FrenchGovernment to Africa.     Meanwhile, General Weygandhad reported that the military situation held out little hope of continued resistance, which would mean thatevents would move fast at Cherbourg and Brest.     Forthis reason it was desirable, irrespective of thepolitical situation, to take immediate action with aview to the transfer of the RICHELIEU and the JEAN BARTto the United Kingdom, for which the Admiralty wouldbe prepared to supply both escorts and tugs.     Further-more, as the Germans would undoubtedly endeavour toobtain possession of the French Battle cruisers itwas suggested that it would be a wise precaution tosend these to Gibraltar at once, ostensibly to be in readiness to cover the transfer of French troops from french Atlantic ports to Morocco.      Should it become necessary later to transfer other French ships to the

United Kingdom, Admiral Darlan could be sure that theywould receive a warm welcome and be given every facility.     With this in view, it was suggested thatall spare ammunition, torpedoes and other armamentstores should be embarked forthwith, particularly from Brest and Cherbourg, for v/hich purpose theAdmiralty would assist with ships.      The british naval Liaison Officer was instructed to use his discretion as to how much or how little of this message it would be desirable to convey to admiral darlan,     He was to end with a personal message to admiral Darlan and his Staff, assuring them of ouradmiration for their courage and determination andof the hope of our continued co-operation.The War Cabinet took note and approved of the action of the .Admiralty as reported above.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatsome 50 Northropp Bombers allocated to France wereto be shipped on H.M.S. FURIOUS which was now on its way to Halifax.      He asked if this arrangement should stand,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that asimilar problem arose in the case of 4,000 french troops who were now on their way back from the Clydeto Brest,THE PRIME MINISTER said that no immediate decision could be reached on these matters.    Theposition might be clearer after the interview whichhe would be having later that day with General de gaulle.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that, with events moving so fast in France,it was for consideration whether an invitation shouldnot be extended to M. Reynaud through our Ambassadoroffering the French Government asylum in this country if they chose to accept it.There was general agreement that thisproposal offered many advantages, and that it did not preclude the possibility that part of the FrenchGovernment should be established, if necessary, in north Africa at the same time.The War Cabinet agreed-To invite the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to draft a telegram to our Ambassador in France for submission to the Prime Ministermaking an offer to M. Reynaud forthe establishment of the FrenchGovernment in this country if thesituation in France should make this necessary.Later in the Meeting, the draft of this telegram was read out and approved.

At the conclusion of the Meeting of theWar Cabinet,  the LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCILreferred to the message which had been issued earlythe previous morning, proclaiming the indissolubleunion of the French and British peoples and of theFrench and British Empires.     A Memorandum had since been handed to him, which he believed had also been shown to other Ministers in the War Cabinet whichproposed a still greater degree of unity.The main points of the Memorandum were asfollows:-It was essential that -(a) France should continue as a belligerent:(b) That French resources should be saved tocontinue the struggle elsewhere:(c) The United States of America should enter as a belligerent:(d) The Germans should be debarred from a successful invasion and occupation ofthis country.     To achieve this, it was argued that the help of French resources in material and personnel was essential.To attain these objects, the indispensableconditions would be real unity between Great Britainand France, dramatically expressed, and fully realised by the two peoples.     This too would appealto the American people and make them realise thatdemocracy could be preserved.The Lord President read to the War Cabinetextracts from the Memorandum.     While there was much in the Memorandum with which he was in agreement,he thought that in certain places the Memorandum tooktoo gloomy a view, and that in other passages it was perhaps somewhat misleading.The main point in the Memorandum on which hediffered, was the suggestion that it would be possibleto evacuate from France to this country considerablearmed forces, complete with their equipment.    Havingregard to the present state of the military situation,and to our previous experiences, he gravely doubted whether it would be possible to bring any substantialforce to this country complete with its equipment.Further,  even if it was brought here, it was verydifficult to see how it could be maintained.   this applied both to the Army and to the Air Force.     Itmust be remembered that we had no shortage of man-power in this country at the present time,  and that our real difficulty was equipment.The proposals in the Memorandum in regard tothe form of unity which was proposed between the twocountries, namely, joint Parliaments and a jointCabinet, did not seem to be very fully thought out.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed thatthere was no chance of the French armies on the easternfrontiers of France being transported across Prance and being evacuated.     He agreed with the view that ourgrowing forces in this country should suffice to resist invasion.He thought that it would be better that suchFrench troops as could be got out of France should go to North Africa.The real question was, what action we could take to uphold the French.      If means were found toprepare a statement as to the British and French unity,-in a dramatic form which would make a big appeal tothe French, so much the better.,As regards the form of Government, if theFrench came here it v/ould be possible to have frequentmeetings of the Supreme War Council.      This surelywould meet the point which the authors of the memorandum had in mind.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out.thedifficulties of having any kind of joint Cabinet withthe French, having regard to the position of theDominions.      He also thought that it might be worthwhile considering whether Mr. de Valera would beprepared to receive in Eire some of the Polish troops which had come back from Narvik.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that itwas of the first importance to make sure that we keptthe French Fleet.,      As regards the Air Force, although there would, no doubt, be grave difficulties in main-taining French squadrons, he would much prefer that allthe available French aircraft were flown to thiscountry rather than that they should fall into thehands of the Germans.        If we could secure these objects by making a further declaration might it notbe worth while to do so?In discussion it was pointed out that thedeclaration we had already made went very far, andthat through the Supreme War Council we had themachinery for very close working between the twocountries.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the main point was to secure the French Fleet.     He thought that assoon as the French Government was established atBordeaux it would be necessary for him, and one or two members of the War Cabinet, to fly over to Bordeaux.He would take opportunity of consultation with theFrench Ministers in regard to such vitally important matters as the French Fleet.
