COPY NO.W.M.(40)  157TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(24th May,  1940.)KING OP THE THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSBELGIANS.said that just before the meeting he had seen the(previous reference: Belgian Ambassador who had been accompanied by aW.M.(40) 153rdConclusions, Belgian Minister.      They had brought an urgent messageMinute 2.)pointing out that it was imperative that the King ofthe Belgians should not be captured.     They suggestedthat the situation was such that arrangements shouldbe made, if necessary, to bring him and his staff,comprising 30 or 40 persons, to England that night.Before the King would consent to leave, however, itwould be necessary that a message should be sent tohim by the British Government.      They had suggestedthat his departure should be made either by boat orplane from Ostend, Nieuport, or I^llnkirk.       He (theForeign Secretary) was certainly of the opinion thatthe King of the Belgians should on no account run therisk of being taken prisoner.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that such a move would be premature.     The Belgian Army was still holding the line of the Scheldt, and it would beregrettable that the King should leave his Army at thisstage.     When the t;jrae -came, however, it would be perfectly possible to send a message which would clear the King&apos;s conscience.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFagreed.     There was no sign as yet of any break inthe-Belgian Army, and therefore no grounds forimmediate alarm.The War Cabinet agreed:-To invite the Foreign Secretary toinform the Belgian Ambassador thatin the opinion of His majesty&apos;s government the situation was not yetso critical as to justify the proposeddeparture of the King of the Belgians,but meanwhile, that close touch wouldbe kept with Sir Roger Keyes, andall arrangements would be made to evacuate the King of the Belgians andhis Staff at short notice should thisbecome necessary.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
