MINUTE 3.Confidential Annex.(12th June, 1940 - 11.30 a,m. )THE naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 161stConclus ions,limite 5. )THE FIRST SEA LORD said that H.M.S.DORSETSHIRE had been ordered from Gibraltar to reinforce the escort of the fast Australian troopconvoy, which would then have fhx*ee 8,f cruisers with it,      H. M. S.  HOOD would take over further to the north.With regard to the German naval forces inTrondhjern, which had been attacked by Coastal Commandyesterday, the Naval Staff felt that it would be worthwhile running considerable risks to put the twowarships out of action for good.    One of them was believed to be a battle-cruiser. &apos;  If these ships couldbe dealt with now, it would save us a great expenditureof effort later on, and probably much loss of life and shipping.    The Commander-in-Chief was now 450miles north of Scapa, covering the stores convoy from narvik, and his intention v/as to attack the german ships in Trondhjem harbour next morning if he could reach a position from which the Skuas could fly off from the carriers undetected.    He had been askedwhether he would consider sending in the Swordfishtorpedo bombers as well as the Skuas.    Experiencedofficers in the Admiralty thought that the risk wouldbe justifiable, provided the carriers could reachtheir flying-off position undetected and cloudconditions were favourable.    Once the aarriers hadbeen located,  of course, fighters would be sent upin anticipation of a raid.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the risk to Swordfish aircraft would certainly be verygreat..&apos;   The Coastal Command aircraft which had done the raid yesterday had encountered heavy opposition.The War Cabinet -Authorised the issue of instructionsto the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet,to despatch the Swordfish aircraftas well as Skuas from carriers againstthe German naval forces in Trondhjem if in his opinion the conditions v/erefavourable.

(40) 162nd CONCLUSIONS v MINUTE 9.Confidential Annex.(12th June, 1940 - 11.30 a.m. )THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the present report hy the Chiefs of Staff Committee (W.P.(40) 201)should he regarded as a continuation of their previous report (W.P.(40) 168), and was designed to show the directions in which action was necessary in order to preventthe Germans from gaining possession of vital assets ifFrench resistance came to an end.    The Chiefs of Staff had had the benefit of a discussion with the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster who had already taken action on anumber of the points raised,in continuation of the workwhich he had previously done in Holland and Belgium.    Theyhad gone somewhat outside their own province in making certain of the recommendations contained in the Report,but they were impressed with the vital importance of theeconomic factor, both in our own ability to continue thewar, and as a means of bringing about Germany&apos;s defeat.In paragraphs 50 to 56 of their previous Paper,they had made, on the advice of the Ministry of economic warfare, certain forecasts of the effects on Germany of a continuance of the blockade, but they felt that these should be further studied.    Similarly, the assistance whichwe should require in the economic field from the UnitedStates of America should be carefully thought out, so thatthe position could be put frankly before the AmericanGovernment when the time came.    Something in the nature ofan economic appreciation of the situation would be required.The Chiefs of Staff had given instructions for a militaryappreciation to be prepared for similar use.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that he was already engaged on a study of certain aspects of theproblem, but he would like to take charge of a widerinvestigation with a view to drawing up the economicappreciation required.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL agreed that thisshould be done.    He suggested that the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster should he invited to co-ordinate theaction of the various Departments concerned in carrying outthe recommendations contained in paragraph 26(a)(i) -(vii).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said he would be happy to undertake this work, and in anticipation of specific authority he had alreadyprogressed quite far in certain directions.    He thenexplained to the War Cabinet the present position, asfollows:-(1)   M Mii -es^ oj^PXev^ naval 2 miyt^ryj^andair equipment from t^2Ml^J^QjM^SUSS^S.-        &quot;Naval,The general lines of action had been agreed withthe Foreign Office and the First Sea Lord.-1-

Military.No specific action had yet been taken, huthe was ahout to get into touch with the War office on the subject.THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff undertook to place an officer in the War Office in contact with Lord Hankey for this work.Air.A special Staff Officer had been told offin the Air Ministry for work on this matter.    plans were being prepared to deal not only with the French air forces, but also with the material ordered inAmerica for France.(ii)    Shipping and Cables.He was in touch with the Ministry ofShipping, who were making the necessary arrangements,though there would undoubtedly be difficulties.    Hehad not yet taken action about cables, but would do soshortly.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thoughtthat there would be a desire on the part of the French that French shipping should continue to be used tofeed France.      He thought that this should be prevented if possible, so that our economic warfarewould be fully effective.     A similar situation would.arise regarding Norway.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that we should prevent French shipping being used for this purpose, but thought that in the caseof Norway it might be necessary to let&apos; a few shiploadsof food go through, in order to placate the norwegian government, and thus retain the use of Norwegianshipping for ourselves.(iii)    French and Swiss gold and negotiable securities.Action for the removal of French gold waswell in hand, and proceeding satisfactorily.      SomeSwiss gold had been got away,  and active steps werebeing taken to try and induce the Swiss to send awaythe rest,      The Treasury\ woro taldng aotipn about.,/negotiable securities..   ,7&quot;&quot;&quot;*  &apos;*ft7***c Li*o iLeuffi^^u**.eLu$Ui.ct iLgcf hJzj^L^bU    ^Lj^uSCut   U*&amp;lj- A^^r

(iv) Secret equipment ahd documents.A list of the documents which had been given...to the French, and which it would be essential to recover, had been prepared,  and he would shortly take action in regard to this matter.(v) Measures to organise intelligence in french territory.This was already in hand.(vi) Subversive activities and sabotage in french territory.This was in hand.(vii) Economic and industrial resources.Machine tools.Lists of those machine tools which it was particularly desirable to remove had been furnished by the Ministry of Supply,  and the Ministry of aircraft production.      It was a rather delicatematter to suggest to the French that they should handover such things, but they had been urged at anyrate to remove those from the threatened districts to parts of France farther from the enemy.     M. Dautry,to whom the Minister without Portfolio had spoken,was active in the matter.Raw materials.There were certain alloys which we required,and which should not be allowed to fall into thehands of the Germans.      We had managed to remove thecobalt and copper from Havre,,^ affirthe Treasury hadtaken certain1 nation rogarding^latinum and - similarmotnloj and iiiduA Lr iaL diaiuuuAsV ***** lU. h^JsL^ iOxl. su-cu^ -fLT^u^^a^ JJfT k ^W        XJT^tlfiftJg^Plans were being made, and carried out asthe need arose.      900,000 tons had been destroyed inthe Rouen area.      It was believed that the demolitionswe had carried out at the various places in Holland,Belgium and France had been successful; but a conference was being held that evening between the War OfficeEngineers,  the Civil Engineers responsible for such work at home, and a leading technical consultant, tomake certain that our methods were the best that couldbe devised.Continuing,  the CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY of lancaster said that a point had arisen over thedisposal of Belgian skilled labour.     There were anumber of very skilled men who had been rescued from belgium, and it was believed that the French wouldlike us to receive them,  so that they could work on important production in this country^   He believed^7L faby( &amp;*-6**y       ^^^L^

that the Ministry of Supply were anxious to havethese men.      It was necessary, however,  to considerthe views of the Minister of Labour,  and thesecurity aspect in the light of public opinion atthe present time.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thoughtthat this was a matter which should first beconsidered by the Minister of Supply, the Ministerof Aircraft production,   and the Minister of Labour,to establish whether the men were wanted, and,  if so,  in what numbers.      The Home Defence(Security)Executive should then be consulted.     He suggestedthat the Minister without Portfolio should initiatethe necessary action.The War Cabinet were informed that theChiefs of Staff, in consultation with the ForeignOffice, were examining the strategical aspect ofthe policy to be adopted towards French colonial possessions all over the world, and would reportlater on.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he was engaged in drafting a communication to the Dominion Governments, to indicate to them the broad lines of our policy in the event of theFrench collapse, and would obtain the advice of theChiefs of Staff as to its terms.The War Cabinet -(i) Approved the Report by theChiefs of Staffe(ii) Took note of the steps already taken by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster,  and invited him to co-ordinate action on therecommendations contained inparagraph 26(a)  (i)-(vii) -reporting as necessary to the war ab ine 10(iii) Invited the Minister without portfolio, on the assumption of a french collapse, to initiate a study in consultation with the other ministers concerned, of the following-(a) The resulting economic positionof the British Empire:(b) The probable effect on Germanyfspower of resistance of theeconomic war which we should beable to wage in those conditionsc(c) The assistance in the economic sphere which we should requirefrom the United States ofAmerica, and the other american states, to enable us to carry orthe war,  and to bring about the defeat of Germany:and to report at an early date tothe War CabinetQ
