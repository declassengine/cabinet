COPY NO. &apos;_W.M.(40)  119C CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.(12th May, 1940 - 10,  30 p.m. )R POLICY. SIR CYRIL NEWALL said that the Chiefs of staff had given further and careful consideration to thequestion of the employment of our heavy &quot;bombers and had reached the following conclusions:-&quot;(i) That it was desirable in principle, on military grounds, to attack the enemy in his vitals i. e.  the Ruhr, as soon aspossible, subject to (iii) below.xx     xx.(iii) That, when presenting the case to Ministers,the Chief of the Air Staff should pointout that moon conditions would not be favourable for attacking the oil refineriesuntil about 16th or 17th May. &quot;In his (Sir Cyril Newall&apos;s) view, we had now reached a vital stage in the war, and it had always beenaccepted that when that stage was reached we should beprepared to take decisive action.    We were not yet ableto forecast with precision the enemy&apos;s intentions, butit was possible that the land operations in Belgium and luxembourg were subsidiary to the operations in Hollandwhich country the Germans intended to seize at all costsso as to gain air bases from which they could launch an intensive air attack on Great Britain.Since the invasion of the Low Countries theAir Staff had been inundated with demands for assistance by fighters and bombers to operate in Holland andBelgium.    These demands had been met as far as possible,but the losses in medium bombers had been so heavy thatthe Commander-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France,had been instructed to use the remainder of his force with prudence.    The losses, which had been incurred inthe bomber force as a whole i.e. heavies and medium,had not,  in the view of the Air Staff, given an adequatedividend.Throughout the course of the war the enemy had so far seized the initiative every time, and we had been forced to follow his 3-ead.    From the psychological pointof view alone it was now important that we should wrestthe initiative from him.    If we did not, Germany would continue to isolate her enemies one by one, and defeat themin detail.    The prospect of denying Holland to the enemy was not great.    Once established there the enemy could

direct the full weight of air attack on this country withshort range bombers escorted by fighters, while at thesame time getting much needed depth, with warningdevices, anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, for hisvulnerable spot, i.e. the Ruhr.    It was estimated that about half the German bombers were now committed to theland battle.    If we now took the initiative and attacked the Ruhr and this was followed by an immediate retaliationon this country, we should, at one   and the same time, bestriking at the enemy&apos;s vital spot and drawing off hisbombers from the land battle to attacking targets inEngland where our air defences were ready to meet them.Moon conditions for starting the attack were becoming favourable in the near future, and the Chiefs ofStaff were of the opinion that the right moment had cometo put into operation the plan for attacking Germany in her most vital spots.In the viev; of the Commander-in-Chief, bomber command, the losses entailed in theso operations y;out&amp; not be such that the number of aircraft now coming from production\?ould be a limiting factor to the continuance of the operations at reduced intensity.In conclusion, Sir Cryil Newall outlined the plan of operations and stressed the importance of a decisionbeing taken at the earliest possible moment, since fromthe psychological point of view the air forces, whichwould have to carry out the operations should not be kept in suspense a day longer than was necessary.SIR EDMUND IRONSIDE said that he agreed, ingeneral, with the views put forward by the Chief of the AirStaff.    If the heavy bombers were unable to attack thevery difficult targets in the immediate rear of the land battle, he would prefer to see the Ruhr plan carried outrather than that these bombers should be held back and do nothing.    The Royal Air Force, by their operations duringthe previous 48 hours, had given our advancing troops amost valued respite.    In his view, the position shouldbe squarely faced, that a great land battle was about to commence and if our line cracked we might indeed lose ourall.    The Ruhr plan could not have an effect upon the courseof the land battle for a considerable period - which hadbeen given as three weeks - from the time the attackcommenced.-     Nevertheless, in all the circumstances he(Sir Edmund Ironside) agreed that the right policy was totake the initiative while we yet could.    If we did not use our heavy bomber force now, there was a grave danger that we might not be able to use it at all,SIR DUDLEY POUND expressed full agreement withthe viev/s put forward by his colleagues.In the course of further discussion there was general agreement that on moral grounds we had fulljustification for carrying the air war into the enemy1scountry.    In the light of events, neutral opinion and, inparticular, that of the U.S.A., would probably welcome such action rather than condemn it.    Nevertheless the decision was a most vital one and the arguments finely balancedbetween taking action immediately, and waiting till thesituation clarified as regards the land battle.   amongst other points, the constant drain on our fighter aircraft to france , the anti-aircraft situation in the United Kingdomand the new production figures for bombers and fighters, were discussed as directly relevant to the problem.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up,  said that wewere no longer hound by our previously held scruples asto initiating &quot;unrestricted&quot; air warfare.    The enemy hadalready given us ample justification for retaliation onhis country.    Opinion in the United States of America wouldnot now be adverse if we carried out the operationsproposed.    The Germans would attack us in this countrywhen, and where, it suited them.    Prom the argumentsput forward by the Chiefs of Staff it seemed that ourposition would be worse the longer we waited,    It was,,moreover, significant that the Germans had so far heldoff, and the reason for this could be interpreted asbeing because it was not in their interests to be attacked in their own country,After hearing all the arguments he (the PrimeMinister) agreed, in principle, with the view taken bythe Chiefs of Staff.    Nevertheless it would hardly be right for an immediate decision to be taken until theLord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfolio   hadbeen consulted, and put in possession of all the implications of the problem.      The three members of theWar Cabinet present were fully conversant with all aspectsof this question, and the best course would be for theChief of the Air Staff to explain the whole problem onthe following day to Mr. Attlee and,  if possible, toMr. Greenwood,  after which the matter could again bediscussed at a meeting of the War Cabinet in the evening.It was agreed:-(i)    That this question should again beconsidered at a meeting of the WarCabinet to be held at 6.30 plm.on 13th May.(ii)    To request the Chief of the Air staff to explain on Monday, 13th May,to the Lord Privy Seal and,  ifpossible, to the Minister without portfolio, in advance of the Meetingof the War Cabinet,  the main considera-tions involved in the question of theemployment of our heavy bomber force,,Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.
