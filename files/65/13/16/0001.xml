(40) 134thConclusions,iiihute 2. )W.M.(40)  155TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE  9/    &apos;Confidential Annex.(23rd May, 1940.)The War Cabinet had before them an appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on the Implications ofa   Complete    Withdrawal from Norway (W.P.(40) 165).THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that,  tosummarize the Appreciation in the briefest possibleterms, it recommended that we should capture Narvikand then withdraw from Norway.      A draft telegram toLord Cork was contained in Annex II, in which it was emphasised that it was impossible to give Lord Corkadequate forces to hold Northern Norway permanently.THE PRIME MINISTER deprecated asking troops to incur heavy losses in assaulting a town which itwas proposed to evacuate immediately afterwards.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatit was not proposed to tell Lord Cork to storm thetown.     At the moment, the primary objective was toestablish his aerodromes, with a view to holdingNorthern Norway permanently.      If, however, he knew that evacuation was contemplated, he might be able to accelerate the capture of Narvik.The Chiefs of Staff fully appreciated the political advantages of being able to say that we had capturedNarvik.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that these advantages had been considerably minimised by thesituation on the Western Front.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY hoped thatno decision would he taken at that meeting to abandonNorway-    He felt that there were grave political considerations which needed full consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not askfor an immediate decision.   Plans for evacuating Norwayshould, however, be worked out at once, both by theService Staffs in this country^ and by Lord Cork.    Hehad no doubt that this country would shortly be subjected to very heavy attack.    The guns, destroyers, aircraft carriers,  shipping and troops at present devoted to theNorwegian project were urgently needed for our own defence.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he shared thePrime Minister&apos;s views.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he was very much alive to the political disadvantages of leaving Norway.    He felt, however, thatif the situation in France became as grave as appearedonly too probable, it would be imperative to withdraw from Norway,    There would be considerable political advantages in capturing Narvik,  if this could be done without heavy losses,.   Once we had captured Narvik, itwould be a valuable lever in connection with the Dahlerusplan for the withdrawal of both Allied and enemy forces from Northern Norway.    On the other hand, the possessionof Narvik would be valueless as a lever if it was known that we intended to withdraw.    He asked for authorityto pursue enquiries with both the Swedes and Norwegiansas to the practicability of the Dahlerus plan.

120THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF thought thatthere would he no objection to this from themilitary point of view,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thoughtthat the situation was so bad on the Western Frontthat Hitler would not for a moment consider theDahlerus proposals,THE PRIME MINISTER said that, even if itwas decided at once to withdraw from Northern Norway,it would be some weeks before withdrawal could beeffected.     He hoped that in the interval we shouldtake every advantage of our position in northern norway to mine the approaches to Lulea to themaximum possible extent.     We should, on no account,mention withdrawal to the Norwegians until it had actually begun.     We should then offer the King of norway and his entourage asylum in this country.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that a roughappreciation of the implications of withdrawal hadbeen prepared,although the other members of theChiefs of Staff Committee had not yet had anopportunity of seeing the paper.     There were 13,000British and 13,000 French troops in Northern norway and large quantities of guns, motor transport and stores.It was estimated that about two months would be required for complete withdrawal.     A more rapid withdrawal could only be secured at the sacrifice of materials     He suggested that ininstructing Lord Cork to prepare plans for evacuation,-&apos;it was essential to tell him how much he could be permitted to sacrifice.     Apart from this, animmediate decision was required in connection withthe convoy containing 3,500 French and 3,000 Britishtroops about to sail from the Clyde.- 3 -

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR assumed that the squadron of Hurricanes would not now he sent to Narvik.THE MINISTER OP SHIPPING- said thatwithdrawal from Norway might make it extremelydifficult for us to retain control of thelarge amount of Norwegian tonnage, particularlytankers, which were already under charter to us ornominated for charter to us at a later date.The retention of this tonnage was vitally important to usc    If we contemplated withdrawal from the Narvik area plans should, he thought,at once he made to seize every possibleNorwegian ship.       Even so some loss of tonnagewould be inevitable and we would be faced with serious difficulties in manning the ships and,particularly,  in finding sufficient engineers.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that furtherconsideration should be given to the draft telegram to Lord Cork (Annex 2) at the ministerial meeting which was taking place later that dayo.

1 ? /1 L wThe War Cabinet agreed:-(l) That the Commander at Narvik and the ServiceStaffs in this country should at once heinstructed to prepare plans for a complete withdrawal from Northern Norway.,(2) That further consideration should he given,at the Meeting of Ministers to he held later that day, to the terms of the message to LordCork conveying this decisions(3) That, in regard to (2), it would he desirableto give Lord Cork some indication of theextent to which he would be justified inabandoning stores and equipment on withdrawal,(4) That the troop convoy now at the Clyde, anddestined for Narvik, should not proceed there.Arrangements should be made for the French troops to be sent to Brest, and for the British troops to be disembarked in this country.,(5) That the squadron of Hurricanes earmarked forNarvik should not leave this country.(6) That the Minister of Shipping, in consultationwith the Admiralty, should prepare plans toobtain effective control of the largest possible amount of Norwegian Shipping, inthe event of our withdrawal from Narvik leading to Norway going out of the war and seeking towithdraw ships from the service of this country.(7) That the utmost secrecy should be observed in regard to any suggestion that we mightwithdraw from Narvik,(8) That,  in view of (7) and of the unlikelihoodthat the proposal would be accepted, the foreign secretary should not take further soundingsin regard to the Dahlerus plan for the neutral-isation of Northern Norway,,Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,
