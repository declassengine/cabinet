THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.- MOST. SEQRET.COPY Mo.1/HILalls(4P). 183rd, CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.(June 26th, 1940s 11.30 a.m.)PRANCE.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M.(40)  182ndConclusions,Minute 2.)THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that theRICHELIEU had left Dakar at 2*15 the previous afternoon.    At that time the DORSETSHIRE had stillbeen on her voyage South to Dakar.    The two vesselsought to have met about midnight, but no signalconfirming this hac been received.    The HOOD andthe ARK ROYAL vere proceeding to the Canaries,while the VALIANT with two Cruisers had been sentdown to a point West of the coast of Spain.It had been necessary to send immediate ordersfor the interception of the RICHELIEU, and in thetime available it had not been possible to consult the Foreign Office.The Chief of the Naval Staff read the text ofthe orders which had been issued for the intercep-tion and capture of the RICHELIEU ..These orders met with approval, hut subject tothe point that it would be preferable to bring theRICHELIEU into a UoK. port and not into Gibraltar,on account of Spanish susceptibilities.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that it would be desirable to amplify the message to be conveyed to the Captain of theRICHELIEU by a statement to the effect that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had,  of course,  complete faith in the assurances given by Admiral Darlan that hehad no intention of allowing the ship to fall intothe hands of the enemy.    Under the terms of thearmistice which had been signed, however, everythingdepended on the good faith of Germany and Italy.We could place no trust in their good faith.    Weshould, of course, be ready to discuss the matter with the Bordeaux Government, and we should be glad if they could satisfy us that there was no danger that units of the French Navy v/ould fall into german hands .The question was raised whether we should undertake to hand back the RICHELIEU to france at the end of the war.   The view taken was that itwould be better not to raise this issue, but totake the line that we were temporarily detainingthe vessel until we were satisfied that she couldnot be used against us.

THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF referred to theposition at Oranc   He thought that, in view of theterms of the armistice between France and Italy,there was now a grave risk that the DUNKERQJUE andthe STRASBOURG would proceed to a French or Italianport on the North coast of the Mediterranean.    two british submarines from the Eastern Mediterraneanhad been ordered to proceed to Malta with a view to taking up station outside Oran.     The question arosewhether these two submarines should merely reportthe movements of the STRASBOURG and the DUNKERQUE,or whether they should be ordered to take actionagainst thenuThe War Cabinet:--(l)  Invited the Admiralty to consult withthe Foreign Office in regard to thefurther instructions to be sent to the vice--Admiral of the ARK ROYAL on thelines indicated by the Foreign Secretary:(2) Deferred to the ensuing day the orders to be given to the two submarines whichwere proceeding from the Eastern Medit-mediterranean to ta,ke station outside Oran.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1
