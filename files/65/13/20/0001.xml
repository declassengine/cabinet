COPY NO. /(cW.M. (40) 159th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE X.Confidential Annex.(26th May, 1940.)WESTERN FRONT. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet--- that the previous night he had received a letter fromProgress of General Spears, describing an interview he had had operations. v/ith what had been to all intents and purposes a WarCouncil of Prance, and also a message from M. Reynaud.(previous reference: He read these two documents to the war.iv.1. (40) lo8th    Cabinet.     The letter from General Spears may be conclusions, summarised as followsMinute 1.)(i)   The suggestion that Lord Gort had fallenback on the 24th May without warning   andwithout orders had been cleared up.General Weygand had apologised with goodgrace.(ii)   On the strength of a report brought in from General Blanchard by CommandantFauvel, General Weygand had been inclined to alter his instructions to general blanchard in the sense of inviting him to fall back to the Channel harbours, but inview of the fact that he had had later information from General Blanchard, he hadfinally determined to allow General Blanchard.to use his own discretion.(iii)   General Weygand did not consider thatattacks to the southward by the Blanchardgroup of armies could serve any other purpose than to gain breathing space to fall back to a line covering the harbours.(It had been the original intention to try and break through with a force of 3 Frenchand 2 British Divisions, but one of theBritish Divisions had since had to be putinto the line between Menin and Ypres to resist a thrust from the Bast,)(iv)   There seemed no chance whatever of any French attack from the south across the Sommeto disengage the Blanehard group.     Therewere only 8 Divisions spread over a very wide front.(v)   Commandant Pauvel had been extremelypessimistic.     The Blanchard group had lostall their heavy guns;   they had no armouredvehicles;    and movements were very muchhampered by refugees.- 1 -

The King ofthe Belgians.Position of.E.F.Visit ofM. Reynaud;France&apos;attitude.The message from M. Paul Reynaud set out theconclusions which had heen reached at the meeting which general Spears had attended.      The principal point wasthat discretion was given to General Blanchard as to his action.THE PRIME MINISTER also read a telegram received from Sir Rogers Keyes relating to theevacuation of the King of the Belgians, which could hesummarised as followsThe King was being urged by his Ministers to fly with them, but he was determined not todesert his army at a time when a stern battlewas in progress.      If the King were to leave,this would inevitably hasten the capitulationof the Belgian Army and endanger the B.E.F.King Leopold had written to King George VI toexplain his motive in remaining with his armyand people if the Belgian Army becameencircled and the capitulation of the Belgian Army became inevitable.The Prime Minister said that the abovecommunications and other information which had beenreceived had been considered at a meeting the previous night of the Service Ministers and Chiefs of Staff.General Karslake,who had seen General Swayne, reportedthat the latter thought that the French seemed unlikely to take any effective action from the south.     M. Reynaidhad telegraphed that he was arriving in this country that day and wished to meet the Prime Minister alone, or perhaps with one other Minister present only.      It seemedfrom all the evidence available that we might have to face a situation in which the French were going tocollapse, and that we must do out best to extricate theBritish Expeditionary Force from northern France.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinetthe conclusions which had been reached at the meetingof Ministers and Chiefs of Staff the previous night.(Copy attached to this Annex).    On the basis of these conclusions a telegram had been despatched to Lord Gort,warning him that he might be faced with a situation inwhich the safety of the British Expeditionary Force wou3dbe the predominant consideration, and that every en-deavour would be made to provide ships for the evacuation,and aircraft to cover it.     Preliminary plans were accordingly to be prepared at once.The Prime Minister expressed the opinion that,although we could not foresee the outcome of the battle,there was a good chance of getting off a considerable proportion of the British Expeditionary Force.     We must,however, be prepared for M. Reynaud in his interview that day   to   say that the French could not carry on the fight.     He would make every endeavour to induce M.Reynaud to carry on, and he would point out that theywere at least in honour bound required to provide, asfar as lay in their power, for the safe withdrawal ofthe British Expeditionary Force.     He asked the WarCabinet to be ready to meet again at 8.0 p.m. to receivehis report of his discussion with M. Reynaud,     He hopedthat M. Reynaud would be willing to meet the War CabinetThere was some indication that M. Reynaud might bringwith him a military expert, in which case the discussionsmight be extended in their scope.

In order to &quot;be prepared to meet alleventualities he had asked the Chiefs of Staff toconsider the situation which would arise if theFrench did drop out of the war, on the following termsof referencej-&quot;In the event of France being unable to continue in the war and becoming neutral, with the Germansholding their present position, and the Belgian Army being forced to capitulate after assisting the British Expeditionary Force to reach thecoast;    in the event of terras being offered to britain which would place her entirely at themercy of Germany through disarmament, cession of naval bases in the Orkneys etc;   what arethe prospects of our continuing the war aloneagainst Germany and probably Italy.    Can theNavy and the Air Force hold out reasonablehopes of preventing serious invasion, and could the forces gathered in this Island cope withraids from the air involving detachments notgreater than 10,000 men;    it being observedthat a prolongation of British resistancemight be very dangerous for Germany engaged in holding down the greater part of Europe,&quot;THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theChiefs of Staff had already prepared a paper, on this situation, but they /would have to review this in thelight of the new terms of reference remitted to them.Position in THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidCalais, that our forces were still holding out in Calais,where the situation that morning was quieter than ithad been the previous night.     It was proposed thatthe Canadians should be sent to occupy Dunkirk andLord Gort had been instructed to secure Ostend.THE FIRST SEA LORD said that the admiralty were putting in hand all preparations for the despatchof a fleet of shins, and small boats to evacuate theB.E..F.     H.M.S.- GALATEA was to bombard -Calais that -morning, and it was hoped under cover of this to putin two military officers from Dover in a motor torpedo boat who might be able to ascertain what the situation there was.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat General Karslake was returning by air to thesouthern front that morning with full instructions asto his action in the event of a French collapse,.   Wehad on that front the 51st Division and the 1stArmoured Division, together with 40.,000 men from the base and L.  of C. , of which 15,000 were fightingtroops.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that in the dark picture which had been presentedthere was one brighter spot,  in that the dispute onthe rights and wrongs of Lord Gort1s action in drawingback had now been satisfactorily cleared up and therewould be no recriminations on this    oint.    On the broader issue,   we had to face the fact that itwas not so much now a question of imposing a completedefeat upon Germany but of   safeguarding the irdependevee of

Attitude of our own Empire and if possible that of Prance.      in italy. this connection he informed the War Cabinet that hehad had an interview, with the Italian Ambassador the      ^previous evening,  in which Signor Bastianini had clearly made soundings as to the prospect of ouragreeing to a conference.     The Ambassador had saidthat   Signor Mussolini&apos;s principal wish was to securepeace in Europe.     The Foreign Secretary had repliedthat peace and security in Europe were equally our main object, and we should naturally be prepared toconsider any proposals which might lead to this,provided our liberty and independence were assured.The French had been informed of this approach by theItalian Ambassador.      Signor Bastianini had asked fora further interview that morning, and he might havefresh proposals to put forward.THE PRIME MINISTER said that peace and security might be achieved under a German domination of Europe.     That we could never accept.     We must ensure our complete liberty and independence.     Hewas opposed to any negotiations which might lead to aderogation of our rights and power.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thought it very probable that Tualy might send an ultimatum toFrance very shortly,  saying that unless  she  would agree to a conference, Italy would come in on Germany&apos;aside.     This would bring very heavy pressure to bearon the French.      It was clear from what M. Daladier hadbeen saying recently that the French were very anxious about such a development.     We should have to watch themvery carefully.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that Mussoliniwould be very nervous of Germany emerging as the predominant power in Europe.      We must now await the arrival of M. Reynaud and the report of the Chiefs ofStaff as to our prospects of holding out if the Frenchcollapsed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs pointed out that if the French intended to come to terms,they had a very strong card to play if they made itclear to Hitler that they were bound not to make aseparate peace.      They might use this as a powerfullever to obtain favourable terms which might be ofgreat value to us, if it was Hitler&apos;s object to breakup the alliance.Position if we Z?t this point the War Cabinet were handedhad to carry copies of an Aide-Memoire which had been on the war prepared by the Chiefs of Staff on the single-handed. subject of the visit of M. Reynaud on the26th May (Paper No. C.O.S.  (40) 391)^7THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thoughtthat the position of Italy was very important, sinceItaly&apos;s demands were likely to be largely at the expenseof France.      Was it possible to ask the French whetherItaly could be bought off?    This might at least keepmatters going.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this point was worth bearing in mind.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR FOREIGN affairs said that as he read the Chiefs  of Staff paper our ability to carry on the war single-handed againstGermany would depend in the main on our being ableto establish and maintain air superiority overthe Germans,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF interjected thatin so far as the air was concerned it would depend,not on our obtaining air superiority over theGermans, but on our preventing the Germans fromachieving such air superiority as v/ould enable themto invade this country.Accepting this view, THE SECRETARY OF STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggested that it had animportant bearing on paragraph 11 of the Aide-Memoire.If France collapsed he assumed that the germans would no longer need large land forces.    They v/ouldthen be free to switch the bulk of their effort to air production. &apos; What effect would that have onthe crucial question of the air?   He added thatGermany v/ould not now be hampered by lack of iron ore,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR suggestedthat Germany&apos;s ability to continue the air war would depend ultimately on her being able tomaintain adequate oil supplies,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatthe present Aide-memoire did not purport to coverthese points&quot;.    It had been drawn up simply forthe purpose of providing arguments to deter theFrench from capitulating and to strengthen theirwill to continue to fight.    The points raised bythe Foreign Secretary v/ould be dealt with in the strategic review which would be submitted to.theWar Cabinet on the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL considered that the strongest argument was contained in paragraph 4of the Aide-memoire, which pointed out that Frenchcapitulation would ultimately mean theirdestruction.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that in the last resort we should ask the French to put their factories out of gear.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL feltthat whatever undertakings of this character we might extract from the French v/ould be worthless,since the terms of peace v/hich the Germans v/ouldpropose would inevitably prevent their fulfilment.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.    It was tobe expected, moreover, that the Germans v/ould makethe terms of any peace offer as attractive as possibleto the French, and lay emphasis on the fact thattheir quarrel was not with France but with England,
