THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ^ 9 3TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.-MOST SECRET -COPY No. f  /W.M. (40)  174th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(21st June, 1940, 12 Noon.)AIR policy the LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said that he assumed that bombing targets in Prance were no longerselected on the advice of the French.   Had our bombingpolicy been reviewed in the light of recent events, andv/ere marshalling yards still profitable targets?THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said thatbombing programmes had recently been reviewed.   As ashort-term measure, attacks were now being directed against German aerodromes and aircraft industry, inorder to reduce the scale of attack on this country..The Germans were using aerodromes in Northern France-as starting-places for attacks on this country.Re-fuelling and servicing facilities were inadequate onthese advanced aerodromes, and congestion of aircraft was apt to occur late in the day, which afforded veryprofitable targets.As a second priority, attacks were being continued on oil targets and communications, particu-larly marshalling yards, having regard to the effectof these attacks in dislocating industry.    There wasalso the consideration that marshalling yards were relatively easy to identify, and were therefore given as alternative targets.In reply to a question, the Vice-Chief of theAir Staff said that attempts would be made to interferewith the installation of heavy guns reported to be in process of erection near Cap Grisnez.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs asked whether the Chiefs of Staff would consider whatW.M.(40) 171st   action could be taken to maintain bombing attacks on conclusions,       Italy.   Reports showed that Italian morale was low.Minute -1.) If the French Colonial Empire remained in the war,would it be possible to bomb Italy from aircraft basedon North Africa?    Italy was a weak point in the Axis,and it would be wise to concentrate on her.   It was very desirable to strike at Italy herself, as public opinion would not be much affected by air action on Libya.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that the R.A.P.servicing personnel and equipment, and the anti-aircraft guns from the South of France, might be transportedto North Africa to form advanced bases there.(previous reference:

THE VICE-CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF aaid that theChiefs of Staff would, certainly exanine how bombardmentof Italy could bo continued.   Air bombardment ofNorthern Italy could be carried out from Algeria.Bombing squadrons located in North Africa could not, ofcourse, be recalled to this country as easily as the squadrons located in the South of France.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that heavy bombers based on Tunis would be exposed to undue risk,although such risks would be reduced if French fighter aircraft became available.    It might be possible tomaintain squadrons established in North Africa with american aircraft flown in from Casablanca.    If attacks on Italy herself could not be carried out, there wouldbe considerable advantage in hitting hard at Libya and abyssinia..The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
