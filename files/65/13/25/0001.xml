COPY NO.   IW.M., (40) 146th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1,Oir.\ridential Annex.(29th May, 1940.)THE western front.Withdrawal ofthe british expeditionary force.(previous reference:15?. M.   (40)  144thConclusions,Minute 2.)THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR read atelegram that had been received from Lord Gort at,0 pom. on the 28th May,    (A copy of the telegramis attached as Appendix A.)THE CHIEF OP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that,  from a telephone conversation that he hadhaa the previous night with Lord Gort, he had formed the impression that Lord. Gort. wanted some more definiteguidance as to the action he should take in the last resort,.     He had soimded quite calm but was worriedabout his flanks, where pressure was greatest;    theBritish front had remained intacto      The French weredisinclined, to retire, hut Lord Gort was urging themto come oack as the British could not wait for thenuThe situation was changing hourly and he had arranged for a report every 5 hours as long as communicationslasted^THE PRIME MINISTER said that British troops should on no account delay their withdrawal to conform with the French, otherwise there would be^a danger of getting no troops off.     Any French troops thatarrived, at the coast should, of course, he embarkedwith our own.      Lord Gort had been sent an order tocontinue the struggle with the object of gaining timefor the evacuation   of as many troops as possible,and of inflicting the maximum amount of damage on theGermans.THE SECRERARY OF STATE FOR WAR read the telegram that had been sent to Lord Gort in reply tohis telegram.(A copy is attached as Appendix B.)In reply to a question on the condition andthe morale of the troops that had been brought off, heread a report that had. been received the previous day from General Lloyd.    (A copy is attached as Appendix C)Some discussion ensued on the shortage ofwater in the sand-duueSj and on the difficulty thatwas being experienced, in talcing men off from the openbeach in the heavy surf that was running.      Water and food had been landed at Dunkirk from lighters whichwould,   if necessary, be rxxn ashore on the beaches.The water shortage, while very serious along the coast,was not so serious inland along the Corunna Line, whichhad been established on inland waterways.      Troopsreaching the beaches East of Dunkirk were now moving-westwards,  as they appreciated that their chances ofbeing taken off were better nearer Dunkirk0

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, referring to the reply to Lord. Gort&apos; s telegram, said that he was not altogether happy over the very definite instructions that had been given.   He agreed that the grin struggle must continue, but he would like a message sent to Lord Gortexpressing the implicit trust that the Government placedin him and on any action that he would see fit to take in the last resort *    It would not be dishonourable to relinquish the struggle in order to save a handful of menfrom mas sacre.TEE PRIME MINISTER said that in a desperatesituation any brave man was entitled, in the absence ofprecise orders to the contrary, to use hi^ ov.rn discretion,and that therefore he would prefer not to modify theinstructions to Lord Gort.    Our object was to ensure theevacuation of every possible man, and then the inflictionof the maximum possible ds.na.ge on the enemy &amp;   A day gainednow night well mean a further 40,000 men taken off.    ACommander, in circumstances as desperate and distressingas those in which Lord Gort now found himself, should notbe offered the difficult  choice between resistance andcapitulation.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that lord Gort night well interpret the instructions sent himto mean that he was to resist to the last man, no matter in what circumstances he night find himself.    A breakdown in communications night prevent him appealing to theGovernment for final instructions.   He would prefer that lord Gort should be instructed to continue the struggleas long as he remained in touch with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, on whom the final decision would then rest.Lord Gort. should be told that if communications wereinterrupted,  then he was free to use his own judgment asto the degree of resistance he should continue to offer,and that the Government woul(? endorse his final decision,whatever it might be,THE CHIEF OF &quot;HE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF,  in   replyto a question, said that he thought Lord Gort wouldinterpret the telegram sent the previous night to mean that the Government, wished resistance continued to thebitter end;    but that a tine might cone when he would feel that further resistance could serve no good purpose.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that resistance would only serve a useful purpose so long as the embarkation oftroops and the infliction of material damage on theGermans continued..     Lord Gort could surely be allowed touse his own judgment if communications were severed and he found himself cut off from the sea and in circumstances in which further resistance would inflict no appreciabledamage on the Germans.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that he wasin favour of giving Lord Gort some such instructions asthose suggested by the Lord Privy Seal.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that theinstructions sent to Lord Gort had not &quot;been intended to convey the impression that troops which were cut off from hope of relief andwere without food or without water or v/ithoutammunition should attempt to continue thestruggle.       He would consider sending atelegram containing modified instructions onthe lines of the suggestion made by the lord privy Seal.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WARsuggested that the Prime Minister might liketo send, through Ministerial channels, a communication to the Allied Commander-in-Chiefon &quot;the lines of the communications which had^already passed between the French and british staff as to the future employment of Britishtroops in Prance.The War Cabinet -(i)    Took note that the PrimeMinister proposed to send afurther telegram to Lord Gortmodifying the instructionsalready sent in the light of theabove discussion.(ii)    Invited the Prime Minister tosend a telegram to M. Reynaud,for transmission to general weygand,as to the futureemployment of British troops in france.richmond Terrace, S.W.1.

Quantities of refugees french troops am? transport also Belgian troops in area..   Givenimmunity from sir attack troops coulfl gradually beeva.cua.ted provided food an-5 boats could be made availablein sufficient quantity.

(40) 144thConclusions,Minute 4. )Evacuation of narvik.THE SECRETARY OP STATE P0R FOREIGN affairs raised the question as to when and by what method weshould inform the Norwegian Government of our decision to evacuate Narvik,,    He suggested that we did not want to find ourselves in a similarposition vis-a-vis the King of Norway as the king of the Belgians had been in -^is-a-vis the Frenchand ourselves.      It was true that our moral positionas regards evacuation would be eased by the Belgiancapitulation.      This capitulation might enable us toinform the King and Government of Norway, throughSir Cecil Dormer,  that we could not maintain our effort in Norway,  at the same time binding them tosecrecy regarding our decision to withdraw.    If itwas not possible to give the Norwegian government at the moment he (the Foreignwhether it would not be possibleto be given to Lord Cork so to dispose the Norwegian troops that they would be inpositions from which it would be not too difficult to evacuate them should they wish to be evacuated.Alternatively9it might be arranged that theNorwegian troops should not be in positions wherethey could easily be attacked by the enemy whenevacuation took place.this informationSecretary) askedfor instructionsTHE PRIME MINISTER said that Lord Corkattached great importance to secrecy in regard towithdrawal and he (the Prime Minister) was infavour of waiting a few days before taking adecision.    We must, of course, offer to evacuateany Norwegian troops who wished to be taken away.The War Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the question of informing the Norwegian Government of our decision to evacuate Narvik shouldbe postponed for a few days.(b)    That the suggestion made by theForeign Secretary at &quot;A&quot; above should be brought to Lord Cork&apos;notice.
