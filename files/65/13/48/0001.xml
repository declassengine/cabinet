(40)  178TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE Jo.Confidential Annex.(24th June, 1940 - 12.0 noon.)PRANCE.The french fleet.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 177thConclusions,Minute 4.)THE FIRST SEA LORD gave the following information as to the present position with regard tothe French Fleet:-Portsmouth.(1)Plymouth.(2)A French Admiral had appeared at Portsmouthon the previous day, and after some discussionwith the Commander-in-Chief, had finallyassented to the French ships now at portsmouth and Southampton remaining there.A message had just come in from theCommander-in-Chief, however, that the morale of the French crews was deterioratingrapidly and it was doubtful whether their officers would be able to hold the position.The Commander-in-Chief urged that all the crews should be removed and sent back toFrance, with the exception of any whoexpressed a wish to stay and fight on our side.     He suggested that this would makethings easier for the French, who would beentitled to say to the Germane that theyhad had to give way to force majeure.The attitude of the French Admiral at plymouth had been very satisfactory, and hehad expressed a wish to take his ships outon patrol.     This would certainly have beendesirable in order to prevent the morale ofthe crews deteriorating through lying idlein harbour.     Admiral odend&apos;hal&apos;hal, however,who had been consulted, had sent instructions that they were not to proceed to sea.Eastern Mediterranean.(5)   The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, had had a long discussion with Admiral Godefroi,who at  the  time had not received officiallyeither the terms of the armistice, or any instructions from Admiral Darlan.     AdmiralGodefroi was all for continuing to fight,

(4)    Information had been received from theBritish Naval Liaison Officer that admiral darlan&apos;s orders to Admiral Estava were that the French ships must in no circum-stances fall into German or Italian hands,but that they must remain in French ports.In the last resort they were to be scuttled.It seemed probable that Admiral Estavawould obey any orders issued by the FrenchAdmiralty, short of handing over the ships to the enemy.       The British Admiral at gibraltar had &quot;been instructed to proceedto Oran and make contact with AdmiralEstava and the Admiral commanding Forcede Rade.    Admiral Estava, however, had gone on to Bizerta, and in view of theinformation received from the British NavalLiaison Officer it did not seem that any useful purpose would be served by followinghim up.       Accordingly the British Admiralhad been told not to go on to Bizerta, butto see the Admiral commanding the Force deRade, and also to obtain full informationas to the berthing positions of the french ships, in case it might be necessary totake drastic action against them.West Africa.(5)    The Commanding Officer of H..M.S. WATCHMANwhich had been sent down to watch JEAN BARTat Casablanca, reported that the senior officers were apathetic, but there was a goodspirit among the more junior officers.     Hethought that it might be possible to persuade some part of the crews to come withtheir ships to British ports.but realised that he would he placed in avery difficult position if he receiveddirect orders to the contrary from theFrench Admiralty.        In these circumstances the Commander-in-Chief had decided not tocarry out the operation in conjunction withthe French ships which had previously teenarranged hut temporarily postponed.A further telegram had now been receivedfrom the Commander-in-Chief to the effectthat Admiral Godefroi had receivedinstructions from the French Admiralty to cease all operations against the enemy andto take his ships to French ports in north africa.     The Commander-in-Chief had addedthat the French ships would not be allowedto leave Alexandria in any circumstances.Or an.

n 9 HS 3 *The senior naval officer at Dakar reportedthat after a consultation between the Consul and theBritish Liaison Officers ashore,  the French Admiralhad seen the Governor-General, hut had been unable to persuade him to accept the British offer containedin Foreign Office Telegram No. 32 Circular.       the consul-General, who had also seen the Governor, hadbeen no more successful.      The attitude of the captain, of RICHELIEU was one of deep depression andanxiety;      The position was very delicate, and theonly hope seemed to be a pronouncement from some formof recognised government in North Africa.It had been ascertained that RICHELIEU had only anti-aircraft ammunition on board and that themain armament was incomplete.     H.M.S. DORSETSHIREwould therefore be able to deal with her quite easilyin case of necessity.The War Cabinet reached no finaldecision as to the action to be taken inregard to the French Fleet generally;The general view was that we should do all we could to get hold of the fourbig ships, RICHELIEU, JEAN BARTi DUNKIRKand STRASBURG.        It we could not get them into our possession, we should make sure that they were scuttled.As to the crews, the best plan wouldprobably be to follow the recommendationof the Commander-in-Chief Portsmouth,as a general policy.     No reliancecould possibly be placed upon them, inview of the known Communist tendency ofthe French Navy before the war.The only immediate action called forwas for the First Sea Lord to informthe Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean,that his intention to ensure that theFrench ships now at Alexandria did notescape from British control was approved.
