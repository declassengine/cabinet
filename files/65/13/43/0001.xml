(40)165thConclusions,Minute 3.)COPY No(40)  166th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(14th June,  1940 - 12.30 p.m.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that while every effort should he made to keep alive French resistance, so longas it continued, by the despatch of fresh troops, wemust now go ahead with the wholesale withdrawal of ourLines of Communication personnel at the bases.    the indications were that the Germans were preparing toattack Le Mans and advance towards Nantes.    If theFrench defence should crumble, our position there wouldbe serious.    The situation would require to be very carefully watched.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat General Brooke proposed to retire on the CherbourgPeninsula, rather than to attempt to hold a bridgeheadin Brittany.   Reconnaissance had shown that a defensiveline could be formed on a front of not more than 20miles, with better chances of success than in Brittany.As regards the withdrawal of material and personnel from the bases, arrangements were in hand for large quantities of ammunition and stores to be with-drawn as rapidly as circumstances permitted.   A prioritylist had been drawn up for the removal of the mostimportant items of fighting equipment, including rifles and Bren guns, and the numbers of personnel (now about90,000) would be reduced so far as possible.    It would,however, be necessary to maintain for the present suchtroops as were required for loading and local guards.General Brooke had been instructed to continue with thewithdrawal of men and material, and it would be impressed upon him that there should be no slowing upof the measures already in hand, since it was possiblethat ho might not have ten days to complete theoperation.THE PRIME MINISTER asked that he should be furnished with a priority list of the material whichwas being withdrawn, and a time-table of the plans forthe evacuation of material and personnel.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF asked for authorityto take similar action in regard to British Air Forcesin France, by moving back to the ports all suchpersonnel and stores as were not required for theactual operation of the squadrons.
