(40)      142nd   conclusions.Confidential Annex.(27th May,1940 - 4.30 p.m. )ITALY. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the ForeignSecretary1s Note (W.P.(40) 170) set out the kind ofSuggested       approach to Signor Mussolini which M. Reynaud wantedapproach to   the French and British Governments to make.   While M.Signor Reynaud was prepared to fight on for honour&apos;s sake, he! Mussolini.     was afraid that France was in danger of collapsing.    if italy undertook to stay out of the war, the French couldremove ten Divisions from the Italian front.    An attack by Italy at this juncture would give the coup-de-graceto their existence.    If France collapsed, Germany wouldprobably give her good terms, but would expect the french to have the kind of Ministers who were acceptable to theGermans.The Prime Minister said that it might be argued that an approach on the lines proposed by M. Reynaudwas not unlike the approach which we had asked president roosevelt to make to Signor Mussolini.    There was,however, a good deal of difference between making the approach ourselves and allowing one to be made by president Roosevelt ostensibly on his own initiative.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, since his Memorandum had been circulated, therehad been two new developments.    First, President Roosevelthad now made an approach on the lines set out in theMemorandum.    Secondly, M. Corbin had been to see him that morning, on instructions from M. Reynaud.   He had beenasked to emphasise that he regarded it as a matter ofgreat urgency that the approach should give &quot;geographicalprecision&quot;.The Foreign Secretary said that he had thenshown M. Corbin the draft formula set out in theMemorandum, and had said that, while the War cabinet were doubtful as to the value of making a direct approachat all at this time, he thought that they would certainly be opposed to including geographical precision in theformula.    M. Corbin had then indicated that the presentmoment was one at which every opportunity should be tried;and he added that he would not like it to be thought that,if certain action had been taken, France might havebeen able to continue the struggle.    It rather looked as though the French were preparing to put the blame on us.The Foreign Secretary said that he had repliedthat the difference between a general approach and an approach including geographical precision could not possibly suffice to turn the scale.   He had added that many of his colleagues felt the strongest possibledifference between offering a general discussion and

saying that we were ready to make certain concessions.    &apos; &quot;The latter might have a lowering effect at a time whenmorale v/ould he of the utmost importance.The Foreign Secretary then referred to thepostscript to his Paper, containing a message conveyed to hjmby the Master of the Rolls from Sir Percy Loraine.    since he had added this postscript, he had had a cryptic message from Sir Percy Loraine cancelling this message, on theground that matters had now gone beyond the stage atwhich his (i.e. Sir Percy&apos;s) views counted for anything.The meaning of this seemed to be that nothing we could do would be of any value at this stage, so far assign or Mussolini was concerned.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that,since the matter had been discussed on the previous day,a telegram had been received from Sir Percy Lorainereporting that General von Epp, who was in Rome, had saidthat the Italian Government had been informed that herr Hitler did not want them to come into the war.   herr hitler thought that he could reach a satisfactory conclusion with the French on his own account, and wished to keep the Italians as an avenue of supply.M. Reynaud&apos;s original plan had been an offer to Italy in order to keep her out of the war.    If thisreport were true, it meant that we should make a concession and gain nothing.The Lord President referred to the foreign secretary^ talk with Signor Bastianini, v/hich stronglyconfirmed the view which he (the Lord President) had held for some time, that Signor Mussolini saw himselfcoming in as a peace-maker and disposer of benefits.   Hecited in this connection paragraph 9 of Despatch No.413to Rome&apos;?&apos;    The Lord President was convinced that anyattempt by President Roosevelt or M. Reynaud to getSignor Mussolini to make a separate bargain on Italianquestions would meet with a rebuff.    He was not ready tomake such a bargain.    But if he were invited to aConference, then he would be prepared to discuss Italianquestions.    He thought that Signor Mussolini might wellreply in this sense to President Roosevelt&apos;s message.The Lord President also thought that signor mussolini still had the idea that when the vital momentcame, he could play an important part and get a shareof the spoils.    But he did not think he would playany part in the game until Paris had been taken.   when that happened, Herr Hitler might say &quot;France has beenknocked outj I will now give the British a few hours to make up their mind before I turn on them&quot;.    signor mussolini at this stage, but not before, might saythat he would like to take a hand in the game.    Forall practical purposes, therefore, the Lord Presidentthought that the proposed French approach to signor mussolini would serve no useful purpose.

There remained, however, the attitude of theFrench.      The Lord President thought that the completelymisleading account of military operations in northern france, coupled with the share of praise which the french were claiming for themselves in connection with events in which they had taken no part, must have someexplanation.      Was it that they intended to say that theFrench had had a magnificent scheme, but that, owing tothe withdrawal of the B.E.F., they had been unable tocarry it out and the poor French had been let down bytheir allies and must take the best chance available tothem to get out of things.      It would be unfortunate ifthey were to add to this that we had been unwilling even to allow them the chance of negotiations with Italy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Lord President&apos;sargument amounted to this,  that nothing would come of the approach, but that it was worth doing to sweeten relationswith a failing ally.      He read the following telegram,which he had received from M. Reynaud that morning (No. 283    jDIPP. ) : -&quot;I thank you for your cordial welcome and for your telegram.      Your friendship is preciousto me.      As for Italy, that (?ultimate) argument which to my mind carries most weight is thatthe assistance given by your country to minethrough the approach we are making at thistragic hour will help to strengthen an allianceof hearts which I believe to be essential.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he was convinced of the futility of an approach to Italy at this time.      Being in a tight corner,  any weakness on our part would encourage the Germans and the Italians, and would tend to undermine morale both in this country and in theDominions.      The suggestion that we v/ere prepared to barteraway pieces of British territory would have a deplorableeffect and would make it difficult for us to continue thedesperate struggle which faced us.      Nevertheless, he wasimpressed with the importance of doing all we could dostrengthen the hands of the French.An approach to Italy through President Rooseveltwas obviously the best course.      He appreciated that theFrench were anxious to make a direct approach, but nevertheless he thought that this was a very dangerouscourse, and would prefer to await the result of president roosevelt&apos;s intervention.      If the French were so weakthat they could not await the result of President Roosevelt&apos;sintervention, was it wise to go further with them and weaken our own position?THE FOREIGN SECRETARY referred to paragraph 2 ofthe record of his discussion on 25th May with SignorBastianini  (Despatch No. 413 to Rome) in which he had saidthat we had always been willing to discuss the questionsbetween our two countries, and to endeavour to findsolutions satisfactory to both sides.      The French were not really proposing to go much further than this, except inthe direction of geographical precision, where he was notprepared to accept their views.      He doubted whether there

was very much force in the argument that we must do nothing which gave an appearance of weakness, sinceSignor Mussolini would know that President Roosevelt&apos;approach had &quot;been prompted by us.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the suggestedapproach would be of no practical effect and would bevery damaging to us.      In effect, the approach suggested would inevitably lead to our asking Signor Mussolini tointercede to obtain peace-terms for us.      If we acceptedthe French idea of geographical precision there was a danger that Signor Mussolini would at once ask for more,and we should still be in the same difficulty, that ifwe refused, we should be accused of letting the Frenchdown.      Even if we got Signor Mussolini to agree to standout of the war, it would not materially affect France&apos;position.        All that we could do was to prevent M. Reynaudfrom being turned out of office by those in France who did not favour the British alliance.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that he was of the same view as on the previous day.      He saw no wayof getting Prance out of her difficulty.     The approachnow suggested would put us in the wrong.    It was not certain that Herr Hitler wanted Signor Mussolini to comeinto the war.      Further, the time factor was important.If Herr Hitler was going to be in Paris in four days,there was not time for a talk with Signor Mussolini whichcould achieve anything useful.      If it got out that we hadsued for terms at the cost of ceding British territory,the consequences would be terrible.     Was France, aidedand abetted by us, to seek assistance from a country notin the war?      The Prime Minister and M. Reynaud had already made approaches to Italy which had not been well received.It would be heading for disaster to go any further withthose approaches.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was increasinglyoppressed with the futility of the suggested approach to signor Mussolini, which the latter would certainly regardwith contempt.      Such an approach would do M. Reynaud farless good than if he made a firm stand.       Further, the approach would ruin the integrity of our fighting positionin this country.      Even if we did not include geographicalprecision and mentioned no names,  everybody would know what we had in mind.      Personally he doubted whether france was so willing to give up the struggle as M. Reynaud had represented.      Anyway, let us not be dragged down with france.      If the French were not prepared to go on with thestruggle, let them give up, though he doubted whether theywould do so.      If this country was beaten, France became avassal State;    but if we won, we might save them.      The besthelp we could give to M. Reynaud was to let him feel that,whatever happened to France, we were going to fight it out to the end.      This manoeuvre was a suggestion to getFrance out of the difficulty that she might have to make aseparate peace, notwithstanding her bargain not to do so.At the moment our prestige in Europe was very low.The only way we could get it back was by showing the world that Germany had not beaten us.      If, after two or threemonths, we could show that we were still unbeaten, our prestige would return.      Even if we were beaten, we should

be no worse off than v/e should be if we were now to abandon the struggle.      Let us therefore avoid being dragged down the slippery slope with France.      The whole of thismanoeuvre was intended to get us so deeply involved in negotiations that v/e should be unable to turn back.      Wehad gone a long way already in our approach to Italy, butlet us not allow M. Reynaud to get us involved in aconfused situation.      The approach proposed was not onlyfutile, but involved us in a deadly danger.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL    said that,while he agreed that the proposed approach would notserve any useful purpose, he thought that we ought togo a little further with it, in order to keep the french in a good temper.     He thought that our reply should notbe a complete refusal.     V/e had a good argument in that,since the previous day, we had heard that president roosevelt had now made an approach on the lines indicated.It would only confuse the issue and might jeopardise our chances of getting a favourable reply from president roosevelt if we were now to barge in on our own.      Further,President Roosevelt might resent such action on our part.In the discussion which ensued, it was generally agreed that a reasoned reply on these lines was the best course to take.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought that itmight help matters if the Prime Minister were to go to paris and see other French Ministers.THE PRIME MINISTER said that General Spearswas in Paris.      France had got to settle this matter forherself.      It was a question of her word and her army&apos;shonour.      He had heard that day that there had been some change for the better in the fighting spirit of theFrench troops.    There might be some hope in this.    Other-wise everything would rest on us.      If the worst came tothe worst,  it would not be a bad thing for this country togo down fighting for the other countries which had been overcome by the Nazi tyranny.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he saw no particular difficulty in taking the linesuggested by the Lord President.      Nevertheless, he wasconscious of certain rather profound differences of points of view which he would like to make clear.In the first place, he would have thought that,if we could persuade them to do so,  there would have been some oositive value in getting the French Government to saythat they would fight to the end for their independence.In the second place, he could not recognise anyresemblance between the action which he proposed, and thesuggestion that we were suing for terms and following aline which would lead us to disaster.      In the discussion the previous day he had asked the Prime Minister whether,if he was satisfied that matters vital to the independence of this country were unaffected, he would be prepared todiscuss terms.      The Prime Minister had said that he would

be thankful to get out of our present difficulties onsuch terms, provided we retained the essentials and the elements of our vital strength, even at the cost of somecession of territory.      On the present occasion, however,the Prime Minister seemed to suggest that under noconditions would we contemplate any course except fightingto a finish.      The issue was probably academic, since wewere unlikely to receive any offer which would not come up against the fundamental conditions which were essentialto us.      If, however, it was possible to obtain a settlement which did not impair those conditions, he, for his part,doubted if he would be able to accept the view   now putforward by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister had said that two or three months would show whether we were able to stand up against the air risk.      This meant thatthe future of the country turned on whether the enemy&apos;sbombs happened to hit our aircraft factories.      He was prepared to take that risk if our independence was at stake;    but if it was not at stake he would think it right to accept an offer which would save the country from avoidable disaster.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought the issue which the War Cabinet was called upon to settle was difficult enough without getting involved in the discussionof an issue which was quite unreal and was most unlikely to arise.      If Herr Hitler was prepared to make peace onthe terms of the restoration of German colonies and theoverlordship of Central Europe, that was one thing.      Butit was quite unlikely that he would make any such offer.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thought thatif concrete proposals were put before the War Cabinet therewould be no difficulty in settling what were and what werenot essential.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he would like to put the following question.        Suppose the French Army collapsedand Herr Hitler made an offer of peace terms.      suppose the French Government said &quot;We are unable to deal with an offer made to France alone and you must deal with the Alliestogether.&quot;     Suppose Herr Hitler, being anxious to end thewar through knowledge of his own internal weaknesses,offered terms to France and England, would the PrimeMinister be prepared to discuss them?THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would not JoinFrance in asking for terms;    but if he were told what theterms offered were, he would be prepared to consider them.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thought that herr Hitler&apos;s tactics were likely to be that he wouldmake a definite offer to France, and when the French saidthat they had allies he would say &quot;I am here,  let themsend a delegate to Paris.&quot;The War Cabinet thought that the answer to suchan offer could only be &quot;No&quot;.

THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that theimmediate question was whether the French approach to signor Mussolini would stave off French capitulation.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed that it would nothave any material effect. Nevertheless, he did not wishto send a flat refusal.In further discussion it was agreed that a reply should he sent by the Prime Minister to M. Reynaud onthe lines suggested by the Lord President of the Council.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had now received a reply from Lord Lothian to the Prime Minister&apos;telegram referring to the British Fleet as a bargaining counter.    (Telegram No. 8S^-from Washington^.^&apos;Some discussion ensued on this telegram, and itwas agreed that it v/ould be necessary that a reply shouldbe sent to it.      President Roosevelt seemed to be takingthe view that it would be very nice of him to pick upthe bits of the British Empire    if this country was overrun.It was as well that he should realise that there was another aspect of the question.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought that itwas important to get it realised in the United Statesthat we meant to fight on.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.

PERSONAL AND SECRET.

I had a conversation with the President last night. He said he was merely thinking aloud and making no representations of any kind to His Majesty&apos;s Government. He said he had been thinking a great deal about our last conversation recorded in my telegram No. 759 and the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram to him about it. He thought that if things came to the worst it was essential that the British Navy, as many partially constructed warships as possible, war equipment including aeroplanes and merchant vessels should be treated not as British but as Empire possessions and transferred before they could be captured or surrendered to Canada or Australia; and partially built ships and stocks destroyed. British, French, Dutch and Belgian overseas possessions, if protected by sea, constituted very fomidable resources with which to prosecute the war. But if the navy was surrendered the whole edifice would collapse whatever promises Hitler might make. I asked the President whether the United states itself would be in the war on our side, if such a catastrophe impended, because that fact would probably exercise a profound influence on the British decision. He said that as the decision rested not with himself but with Congress, he could give no definite answer, but he thought it probable. As things were going, it seemed likely that Germany would challenge some vital American interest in the near future, which was the condition necessary to make the United states enter the war with the necessary popular support and that opinion was rapidly changing as to what United States vital interests were.

The President then made a curious observation in passing. If it became necessary to contemplate transferring the King and the Imperial as distinct from the home departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to Canada, it might be better if the temporary capital were at Bermuda and not in Canada itself.   Canada might feel a difficulty about the transfer of Downing Street to Toronto and the American republics may be restless at monarchy being based on the American continent.
