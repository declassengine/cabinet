The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Boniber Command had flown 1,714 sorties and dropped4,756 tons of bombs, of which 4,000 had been on Germany.United States bombers had flown 3,700 sorties and dropped8,000 tons of bombs, 6,000 tons of which had been on targets behind the hattle front.&quot;The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 9,400 sorties,attacking targets in the battle area. Eighty-seven A.F.Vs. and1,900 other vehicles were claimed to have been destroyed.Seventy-seven enemy aircraft (including 45 on the ground) were claimed to have been destroyed as against 29 British and35 American bombers, 8 bombers and 66 fighter-bombers of the tactical Air Force and 12 Coastal Command aircraft.- Bad weather had again&apos; interfered with air operations.6,300 sorties had been flown and 3,500 tons of bombs dropped.A record total of 7,400 sorties had been flown for the loss of  Allied aircraft. The targets had included railway centres and airfields.Super-Fortresses had dropped 1,000 tons of bombs on Formosaand 150 tons on the Japanese mainland.The Prime Minister referred to the suggestion made by theUnited States Chiefs of Staff that war-weary bomber aircraftloaded with explosive should be used against Germany: He would wish to have an opportunity of consulting the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security before any final decision was reached inthis matter.Shipping losses, from enemy action for the week amounted to24,271 tons. The total shipping losses from enemy action for january so far amounted to 62,065 tons.One U-boat had been sunk off Land&apos;s End on the 21st january and one had probably been sunk by American destroyers north ofthe Azores on the 16th January.. The Norwegian Submarine TJtsira claimed that while on patroloff the Norwegian coast she had left a merchant ship sinking on the11th January and had obtained two torpedo hits on a U-boat on the16th January. 1Two French cruisers had carried out a successful bombardmentof San Remo and Porto Maurizio harbours on the 15th January. an italian cruiser, two destroyers and a gunboat had been released fromthe Balearic Islands and had arrived at Malta.H.M. Submarine Porpoise was reported overdue from patrol inthe Malacca Straits and must be presumed lost.The assessed sinkings as a result of carrier strikes againstIndo-China on the 11th and 12th January were: 4 escort vessels,2 oilers, 11 transport and 13 cargo vessels. In addition, 1 light cruiser, 1 oiler and 7 cargo vessels were claimed to have been damaged.On the Western front the British attack, which aimed atpinching out the German salient in the angle between the Roer andthe Meuse, was making good progress.The German salient in the Ardennes had been still further reduced. In places there had been stiff fighting, but there were alsosigns of enemy withdrawal.Oh the Arakan coast our forces had landed on Ramree Island.The Japanese had counter-attacked unsuccessfully at Myebon. Ouradvance towards Mandalay continued, and further to the north theChinese had succeeded in capturing Nampkan and were now trying to clear Wanting.Very good progress was being made by United States forces onthe island of Luzon.In the north the German defensive position in East Prussiahad been pierced and Gumbinnen and Tilsit captured. east prussia was also threatened by Russians from the south, whereTannenberg had been taken. The . main Russian thrusts were directed towards Posen and Oppeln in Silesia.
At this stage it was impossible to say how far the russian advance would continue before it lost its impetus. But as and whenGerman territory was reached the difficulties of the advancingtroops would increase. Then they would encounter stronger localdefences, and would be hampered by the change of gauge on therailways.The War Cabinet-&apos;Took note of these statements. -Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.(previous reference:W.M.(45)6thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet were informed that during the previousweek there had been 48 incidents from long-range rockets : 19 inLondon, 19 in Essex, 5 in Hertfordshire, 4 in Kent and 1 in the seaoff Great Yarmouth.No flying-bomb incidents had been reported.The casualties for the week had been 92 killed and 238 seriously injured.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Head of 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theMilitary Head of our Military Mission in.Moscow had for some time&quot; pastMission, been anxious to visit the Eastern Front.   He had now been toldMoscow. that a visit could, be arranged to the sector of the front in whichQuestion of the troops organised by the Lublin Poles were fighting. the visit to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that, in view of theEastern Front, delicacy of our position in regard to Poland, the Head of our military Mission should reply that he was not anxious to visit this sector, but would be glad if arrangements could be made for him to visit some other sector.The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion. -ForeignAffairs.Greece.(previous reference:W.M.(45)5thConclusions,Minute 1.)Yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M.(45)6thConclusions,Minute 4.)Poland.(previous reference:W.M.(45)lstConclusions,Minute 6.)4. A general discussion took place on the latest developments in the Greek and Yugoslav situations and on the Polish problem.A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary^ Standard .File of War cabinet conclusions.Czechoslovakia.        5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the frontiers.        Secretary of State fOr Foreign Affairs (W.P- (45) 16) on the frontiers of Czechoslovakia. 1In connection with the surrender terms for Germany and hungary, the Czechoslovak Government had asked that, pendingthe Peace Treaty, they should resume control over all the areas taken
from Czechoslovakia at the time of Munich by Germany, hungary and Poland. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had accepted this proposal, subject to War Cabinet approval, but had also felt bound to make a reservation in respect of the position ofTeschen. On further reflection, he now recommended that he shouldbe authorised to include Tescheh within the scope of thearrangements.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet &apos;(1) Approved the proposals by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs as set out in W.P. (45) 16.(2) Invited &quot;the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the Dominions of the action proposed.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to postpone his communication to the Czechoslovak Govern-ment until the comments of the Dominion governments had been received, on the understanding that this wouldnot result in action being delayed beyond the end of thepresent week.repatriation of Prisonersof War fromthe BritishCommon-wealth andGermany. :6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the/Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor War (W.P. (45) 33) making certain proposals for the repatria-tion of able-bodied long-term prisoners of war from Germany.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that reports received by the Foreign Office and the War Office pointed to the increasingly harmful effects, both mental and physical, of theirprolonged captivity on the large number of British Commonwealthpersonnel who had been prisoners of war since the 1st July, 1940.Consequent on recent discussions with the Swiss authorities, there seemed a possibility of bringing about an exchange of long-termprisoners, and the Foreign Office had now elaborated a proposal withthe War Office foreshadowing the exchange of 3,000 Germans,mainly soldiers captured in the Middle East, who had been taken prisoner before the 1st July, 1943, against a similar number ofBritish prisoners captured before the 1st July, 1940. The selection of those to be repatriated would be left to the Detaining Power.Our own Service authorities insisted on. the exclusion of certainspecialist categories, such as U-boat crews. While the Germans whowould be repatriated had been prisoners of War for a far shortertime, than the British personnel, he did not think that thatobjection should be regarded as decisive.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he strongly supported the proposed arrangement.After further discussion, the War Cabinet Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for War in w.P. (45) 33; and agreed that the United States Govern-ment should be told of the proposal at once, and that theSoviet Government should be informed after the Germanreply had been received.Leave for the 7.   At their meeting a week earlier the War Cabinet hadR.A.P. considered a  proposal  by   the  Secretary  of  State  for  AirOverseas. (W.P. (45) 22) proposing the extension to R.A.F. personnel in(Previous        South-East Asia, the Middle East and the Central Mediterranean.Reference:       of the short-leave scheme recently approved for the Army and theW.M.(45)6th     Indian Army.  The War Cabinet had agreed that the Minister of conclusions,      War, Transport should further review the matter in consultationMinute 7.)       with the Ministers concerned, and should consider what special arrangements could be made to meet the Royal Air Force proposal,particularly in regard to Air Command, South-East Asia, and anycorresponding Royal Navy needs.
The War Cabinet were informed that the. matter had beendiscussed between the Departments concerned and that agreement had been reached between them.The Secretary of State for Air said that, while he gratefullyaccepted the agreement reached, this represented a severe curtail-ment of his original request, and that he reserved .the right to raisethe matter again at a later date.The Minister of War Transport said that, in view of thedifficulty in meeting shipping requirements, he ought also tostipulate that the arrangements made should be subject to review,should circumstances make this necessary.The War Cabinet-Took note that a settlement of this matter had been reached.The Bishop ofChiohester.proposed visit to theUnited States.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Information (W.P. (45) 39) seeking their guidance as tothe line to be taken on an application by the Bishop of Chichesterto be allowed to proceed to the United States during the spring, to fulfil an invitation from the Federal Churches of America, withwhich the presiding Bishop of the American Episcopal Church wasassociated. The Bishop had also received a letter from the archbishop of York approving his proposed journey.In discussion, several Ministers thought that the Bishop, in thecourse of his visit, would be likely to give expression to his views asan opponent of the bombing of German cities and in favour of a&apos;.&apos;soft &quot; peace. (He had advocated a &quot; negotiated peace&quot; in1939-40.) Such action in the United States on the part of the bishop might well give rise to embarrassment and misunder-standing. -After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of Information should approach the Bishop and seek from him an undertaking that, if he went to the United States, he would confine himself tofulfilling the invitation from the Federal Council ofChurches in America, and that he would not make anyspeeches at all on political subjects. If such an under-taking was given, the visit should be approved.House ofCommons.Plans for rebuilding.(previous reference:W.M. (43) 143rdConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Ministerof Works (W.P. (45) 42) regarding the rebuilding of the House ofCommons.The Minister of Works pointed out that the report of theSelect Committee would be debated on the 25th January. he proposed that the Select Committee should be reconstituted withthe restricted terms Of reference set out in paragraph 2 of w.P. (45) 42, in order to deal with any suggestions made in thecourse Of the debate. They should be able to complete this taskwithin a month to six weeks. Thereafter he would propose himself to approve any minor changes which might be found necessaryduring the course of the work, consulting the House only should thequestion of a major departure arise.If the House approved the Select Committee&apos;s proposals inprinciple on the 25th January, the architect would be instructedforthwith to proceed with the drawings, and, as soon as second-stagerepairs of bomb damage in London were completed, or nearlycompleted, the work of demolition would be started. Should the demolition be finished before the detailed drawings were ready, itwas proposed to go ahead with the preparation of the foundationson the basis of a schedule of prices, without waiting for the
completion of the drawings. By the time the foundations were completed, the more essential drawings should.be available and itwould be possible to place a lump-sum contract for the super-structure. If conditions were favourable at the time, double shiftswould be worked, and by this means it should be possible to complete the work some time during the first half of 1949. The Governmentshould indicate in the debate their acceptance of the proposal madeby the Select Committee that the allocation of Strangers&apos; seatsshould be undertaken by a committee, possibly presided over byMr. Speaker. This would include the allocation of an appropriateamount of accommodation for Members of the House of Lords.In discussion, stress was laid on the importance of providingsuitable accommodation for meetings of the House of Commons atthe earliest possible date. It was pointed out that there would be-more inconvenience in the use of the existing meeting-place in thexHouse of Lords in conditions of party Government, when thenumber of divisions would be greatly increased. In view of the relatively small labour force needed during the first year, and of thefact that the type of labour required was different from the typeemployed on the repair of war-damaged houses, it seemed hardlynecessary to delay a start because of any risk of public criticism ifit were undertaken before the completion of war-damage repairs.The Prime Minister said that he would speak in the debate onthe 25th January.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, if the Select Committee&apos;s proposals for the rebuilding of the House of Commons were generally approved in the debate on the 25th January, the SelectCommittee should be reconstituted with the terms of( reference set out in paragraph 2 of W.P. (45) 42.(2) Approved the proposals, in W.P. (45) 42 for the executionof the work, on the understanding that all possible steps would be taken to secure its completion at the earliestpossible date.(3) Agreed that in the debate it should be intimated that theGovernment accepted the proposal that the allocation ofStrangers&apos; seats should be entrusted to a Committee,possibly presided over by Mr. Speaker.(4) Took note that the Chief Whip would furnish the PrimeMinister with notes for his speech in the debate on the25th January.Parliament.modifications in Parlia-mentaryProcedure.(previous reference: &apos;W.M. (44)168thConclusions,Minute 4.)10. At their meeting on the 13th December, 1944, the WarCabinet had invited the Joint Parliamentary Secretaries to theTreasury to take soundings among Members of the House in orderto ascertain their views with regard to the appointment of a SelectCommittee on Parliamentary Procedure.The War Cabinet were now informed that 75 to 85 per cent,of Conservative Members appeared to be against the appointmentof a &quot;Select Committee for this purpose at this juncture. TheChancellor Of the Duchy of Lancaster had intimated that theLiberal National Members were of the same view, which was alsoshared by the Chief LiberaTWhip. On the other hand, labour members were generally in favour of taking any steps which might lead to the speeding up of the Parliamentary machine, and for thisreason would support the proposal for a Select Committee. It was clear, however, that the view of the majority of the House was thatthe matter should be left for consideration until after a generalelection.It was pointed out in discussion that, although the amount ofbusiness was increasing, it had not yet proved-sufficient to justifythe setting up of Standing Committees. Until this step had beentaken, it seemed premature to enquire into other methods of enabling the House to deal with a greater volume of business.
- The War Cabinet Agreed that, for the present, no steps should be taken witha view to the appointment of a Select Committee toexamine and report on the proposals of the Machineryof Government Committee, set out in the Annex toW.P. (44) 424, for modification of parliamentary procedure.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,22nd January, 1945.
