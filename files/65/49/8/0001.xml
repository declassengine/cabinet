49W.M. 8 (45).35Conclusions,Minute 2.)Civil Aviation. i. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFuture Minister for Qivil Aviation (W.P. (45) 38) submitting a plan forOrganisation,   the organisation of British civil aviation.(Previous Minister for Civil Aviation said that his plan was based^r^- on the principles which he had set forth in W.P. (44) 585. InrJw,i,,oi2L drawing it up he had not sought to safeguard vested interests butto get the best out of the experience and organisation of transport undertakings in other fields, and it was for this reason that he proposed to bring in the shipping companies, the railways and other bodies, such as travel agencies.Paragraphs 3-9 of W.P. (45) 38 contained his proposals withregard to the operation of air services. The main Empire routeswould be operated by B.O.A.C. in parallel with the Dominions andIndia; other overseas routes would be operated by companies inwhich B.O.A.C. and shipping lines would have joint interests in varying proportions. So far as internal services in the UnitedKingdom and services from the United Kingdom to the Continentwere concerned,. there would be a single company consisting of a combination of railways, shipping lines, pre-war air companies,possibly travel agencies and B.O.A.C. This company would be encouraged to form joint subsidiary operating companies with european countries. In accordance with the principles laid down inthe White Paper* on civil aviation, his plan avoided competition between British companies on the same route.It was an essential part of his plan that the Governmentshould decide how many operating companies should be established,should approve the interests to be embraced in these companies,should allot routes, and should have the right to approve membersof the boards of directors. It might be desirable to rename B.O.A.C.&quot;British Commonwealth Air Services.&quot;In paragraphs 10 and 11 of WP. (45) 38 he had set out his proposals for the formation of a central company, the capital ofwhich would be Government-owned and the directors of which wouldbe appointed by the Government. The functions of this company would be to buy, own and lease aircraft used by British operatingcompanies, and it would also be responsible for the training and welfare of air crews, for research work and, possibly, for theprovision of airports, navigational facilities, &amp;c, used by inter-national air services. .In paragraph 2 of WP. (45) 38 he had set out the reasons whya decision was called for urgently, and he hoped that the WarCabinet would give general approval to his p)lan in order that he might proceed with its detailed working out.The Secretary of State for Air said that he thought that theMinister&apos;s scheme afforded a basis on which agreement could bereached. He would, however, wish to record his view that are organised B.O.A.C. would be able to undertake the running of all british civil aviation services and doubted whether it was hecessaryto bring the private interests into association with B.O.A.C. inorder to get the advantage of their experience and organisation.He feared that the degree of control which it would be necessaryto exercise over the earnings and the operation of the private companies would lead to a loss of incentive and initiative. he agreed that it was preferable to have a single company covering allinternal air services in the United Kingdom. He hoped that thefact that this company would also run services to the Continentwould not be inconsistent with the scheme for setting up an inter-national civil air agency to run all the air services in Europe whichmight develop out of the single military organisation for air transport in Europe which was contemplated.&apos; The Minister of War Transport said that he was in full agreement with the plan of the Minister for Civil Aviation. If wewere to maintain our place in face of the competition from theUnited States, it was essential that we should draw on all our resources of experience and organisation, and for this purpose the[29193-1]* Cmd. 6561.b 2
association of shipping companies, the railways and other private interests with B.O.A.C. in this scheme-was necessary. In his view,there was no danger that the association of other transport interests would tend to stifle the development of air services.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he andhis colleagues in the Labour Party recognised that the matter wasone on which there was divergence&quot;of political view. They thought,however; that it was most important that the main lines of the plan should be decided during the lifetime of the present Government,and they were, in general; prepared to accept the proposals whichthe Minister for Civil Aviation had put forward. While he approved the proposal that there should be a separate Government-owned company to carry out the functions set out in paragraph 11of W.P. (45) 38, it should be recognised that any such company would almost certainly operate at a considerable loss. It was alsounlikely that the Empire routes, which were to be entrusted to be.O.A.C., would be run at a profit. His main difficulty had been over the proposals for the Continental services, which were likelyto be the most profitable. He was, however, satisfied with the scheme proposed by the Minister for Civil Aviation, provided that it was clear that the Government would have full power to approve the membership of the board of directors and would ensure thatdirectors with a real knowledge of transport matters were selected.He hoped that this company would enter into close relations with european countries, with a view to bringing together so far aspossible under a single organisation all the European air services.The association of railway, shipping and travel agency interestsshould save the operating company from having to open separatebranch Offices throughout the Continent and would secure themaximum degree of interchangeability of services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although he raisedno objection in principle to the proposals in W.P. (45) 38, he must point out that both the scheme for operating companies and thescheme for a Government-owned company to own aircraft, traincrews, &amp;c, raised a number of novel financial questions and might involve the Exchequer in very heavy obligations. For this reasonhe would like to have an opportunity of discussing the proposals inmore detail with the Minister for Civil Aviation before finalcommitments were entered into.The. Lord Privy Seal remained of opinion that the most effective method of securing the development of civil aviation was by giving the freest scope to private enterprise. Operating units in which B.O.A.C. and private companies had joint interests wouldnot work satisfactorily in practice and would not be able to stand upto the formidable competition from the United States.The Secretary of State for Dominion:Affairs warmly supported the plan, which would give great satisfaction in the Dominions.With reference to paragraph 6 (a) (vii) of W.P. (45) 38, he had beeninformed that an assurance had been given to the Canadian Govern-ment that they would have a monopoly of the Bermuda-Canadaroute, and he would like to go into this point in consultation withthe Minister for Civil Aviation and the Secretary of State for theColonies.After several other Ministers had expressed general approvalof the. scheme,, the Prime Minister said that the general view of theWar Cabinet was clearly -in favour of the plan which had been soably presented by the Minister for Civil Aviation. Doubtless whenthe plan was made public it would be criticised as partaking too much of a compromise, but in his view it represented a natural lineof development designed to secure the most effective mobilisation of our resources. It would be of enormous advantage to settle thefuture of civil aviation during the life of the present Government.The War Cabinet- .Gave general approval to the plan for the organisation ofBritish civil aviation set out in W.P.  (45) 38 and
authorised the Minister for Civil Aviation, subject to consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and anyother Ministers concerned, to proceed with &quot;the formulation of specific proposals to give effect to it.Civil Aviation.Proposal for aDAgreementbetween theUnited Statesand EireGovernments.2. In connection with the discussion on the previous item,attention was drawn to information which had been received thatthe United States Government were proposing to sign a civilaviation agreement with the Eire Government, covering the use ofFoynes Rineanna by American interests. These negotiations hadbeen carried out without any prior consultation with this country.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet agreed with thePrime Minister&apos;s suggestion that he should send a telegram to president Roosevelt (a copy being sent to the State Department inview of-the urgency of the matter), taking strong exception to theaction proposed, and asking that the conclusion of any such agree-ment should not be proceeded with. Attention would be drawn inthis connection to the way in which we had complied with theUnited States wishes in regard to our meat contracts with theArgentine.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs undertook to prepare a draft telegram on the above lines for the Prime Minister to send to the President.&quot;X &quot;Civil Aviation. 3. On Friday, the 26th January, a Supplementary EstimateSupplementary for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for CivilEstimate for Aviation was to be taken in Committee of Supply, and a Motionthe Vote for he had  been put down for a reduction of the Vote. It would beMinister for necessary that the Government spokesman should be in a positionCivil Aviation, to make a statement as to the Ministers powers and duties. It hadbeen stated, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that the Secretaryof State for Air remained responsible under statute for B.O.A.C.In discussion, it was suggested that the Government spokesman should explain the existing statutory position, namely, that theexercise of statutory powers remained with the Secretary of Statefor Air; but that he should state that the Minister for CivilAviation was the Minister of Cabinet rank charged with responsi-bility for the formation of policy on civil aviation matters, subject,to the approval of the War Cabinet, and for the measures necessaryto give effect to that policy. &apos; -It should also be stated that a Bill would be introduced in due course to carry out the necessary transfer of powers.Furthermore, it could be stated that steps would be taken before long to provide a Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister,who would be the spokesman for civil aviation matters in the Houseof Commons. &quot; &apos;The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President of the Council to open for theGovernment and the Minister of Aircraft production to wind up in the debate on Friday, the 26th January.(2) Agreed that the Lord President of the Council should makea statement as to the powers and duties of the Ministerfor Civil Aviation, on the lines indicated at &quot;X,&quot; theterms of this, statement being settled in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Air and the Minister for CivilAviation.
B.O.A.C. 4.   On the 15th January the War Cabinet had invited LordAllegations Swinton to carry out a private investigation with the assistance of by Mr. A. an Accountant, for the confidential information of His Majesty&apos;sHopkinson, Government, into the allegations made by Mr. Hopkinson, M.P., inM.P. regard to B.O.A.C. .(Previous The War Cabinet now had before them a report made by reference- Lord Swinton and Mr. Binder, the Accountant associated with himW.M,(45)6th (W.P. (45) 50).Conclusions, The War Cabinet thanked Lord Swinton for this investigation,Minute 9.) which showed there was no ground for the allegations made.Discussion ensued as to the answer to be given by the Prime- Minister to a Question by Mr. Moelwyn Hughes for answer on thefollowing day.The Prime Minister said that he would- like to reply on thefollowing lines :-That he had asked for further time before replying inorder to inform himself adequately on the matter; that he was. now satisfied that there was no ground for the allegations made against B.O.A.C., and could not, therefore, advise the house to set up a Select Committee. If the hon. and learned Memberwished to press for a debate on the. motion put down, theGovernment could not provide a special opportunity, but therewould be occasions in the normal course of business when sucha discussion would be in order.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the matter should be dealt with on these lines.Business 5.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theYoters&apos; Lord Privy Seal and the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeRegister. Security on the preparation of the Business Voters&apos; Register(Previous       (W.P. (45) 20 and 26).   .reference: It was explained that under the pre-war arrangements it was.M. (44) 148th the duty of the registration officer to ascertain what persons were conclusions,    entitled to be registered as business premises voters. In view of the minute 4.)      other burdens placed on registration officers by the Parliament(Elections and Meetings) Act, 1943, it had been decided to relievethem from this duty and to provide that voters must themselvesapply to be registered on the business premises register. *The Lord Privy Seal urged that this constituted an unfairdiscrimination against the business voter, and that the Represen-tation of the People Bill, which restored the practice of compilinga fixed register, should be amended so as to reimpose on registration officers the duty of ascertaining what persons were entitled to beput on the business voters&apos;register.Other arguments urged in favour of this proposal were (a) That the vote on an amendment to the 1943 Act making itcompulsory on the registration Officer to draw the attention ofbusiness voters to this new obligation by sending them copies of theapplication form had been defeated by only 146 votes to 112, andthat Conservative Party opinion was strongly opposed to the presentposition.(&amp;) That the rate books could be used for the preparation of the lists of business premises voters.The following arguments were put forward against theproposal: (c) Under the Representation of the People Bill the prepara-tion of the register would continue to depend on national registration machinery, which did not provide material for preparation of a business voters&apos; register.(d) The rate books did Jiot cover all business voters.
(e) There would be grave objection to any arrangements whichcould not be guaranteed to cover all business premises voters.(/) It would be possible by means of broadcasts and by postersin the constituencies to bring to the attention of business premisesvoters the steps which they had to take to secure registration.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that the representation of the- People Bill had now been passed by the commons and was due to be debated in the House of Lords. Inthe event of a Lords amendment, the effect of which was to vary theprocedure in regard to the business premises register, it would befor the War Cabinet to consider what attitude they should adopt.Unless this should happen, no question arose for the decision of theWar Cabinet.Long-Range 6.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidRockets. that Mr. A. Barnes, M.P., had asked whether Members representingconstituencies in the London area might have a meeting with him in regard to long-range rocket attacks. He was ready to have a. private meeting with the Members concerned, but thought that he ought not to give any indication to the Members as to the fall of shot.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the Home Secretary and Minister of home security, the Secretary of State for Air and the Ministerof Works should receive a deputation of Members ofParliament from London and certain neighbouring areasin private. The Home Secretary and Minister of home security was invited to settle the detailed arrangementsafter consultation with the Leader of the House.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,24dh January, 1945.
