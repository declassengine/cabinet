215W.M. 35 (4S).Anglo-PolishAgreement,1939;proposed publication-of Secret^Protocol.1. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the &quot;Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 177) regarding thepublication of the Secret Protocol to the Anglo-Polish Agreementof 1939.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that, whenhe had raised this question previously in the Memorandum(WP. (44) 438), which he had circulated in August, 1944,. he hadtaken the view that it would be preferable to postpone publicationof the Secret Protocol until we could see more clearly the future course of Polish-Soviet relations, our own relations with Poland,and the future of the Agreement. Since then, however, the existenceof the Protocol had been publicly disclosed in the debate on poland in the House of Commons on the 28th February.Mr. Petherick, M.P., had quoted Article 3, and he (the foreign secretary) had felt obliged to explain the effect of the Protocolin replying to the debate. In the changed circumstances he felt that,for the reasons explained in WP. (45) 177, the balance of advan-tage now lay on the side of publishing the full text of the Protocol.He therefore proposed to inform the Polish Government that, inview of the revelations in the debate on the 28th February, we desired, subject to their consent, to lay the Secret Protocol beforeParliament. If the Poles withheld consent, he would not proceedwith publication. If the Poles consented, he proposed that theGovernments of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Statesand the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics should be informed ofour intentions before publication took place.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals in WP. (45) 177 as summarised above.Italian Claims       2.   At their meeting on the 9th January the War Cabinet hadagainst invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to reconsider-Germany. the proposal of the United  States  Government  (set out  in(Previous W.P. (45)3) that Italy should be allowed to present her claimsReference: against Germany for scrutiny by the European Advisory Commis-&quot;W.M.(45)3rd sion; and to bring this proposal before the War Cabinet again ifConclusions, on further consideration he concluded that it should be acceptedMinute 1.) in the interests of our general relations with the United States.The War Cabinet now had before them a further Memorandum(W.P. (45) 168) in which the Foreign Secretary pointed out that wehad recently had to differ from the United States Government ona number of questions connected with our policy towards Italy, andto make this a further point of disagreement would tend to heightenthe impression already prevalent in Washington that there was a fundamental difference of view between.the two Governments on policy towards Italy. He therefore suggested that we might nowaccept this proposal, on the understanding that the Soviet Govern-ment and the French Provisional Government should be kept informed and that the latter should be included among the Govern-ments to which the views of the Italians would be communicated.In discussion it was made clear that we should undertake no obligation towards the Italians by accepting their claims for examination.  It would not follow that they would receive anythingfrom Germany by way of reparation : they would merely be added\ to the list of claimants and would figure low on that list.The War Cabinet-Agreed that the Italian Government might be invited tosubmit informally their views on the surrender arrange-mentsjfor Germany, on the basis suggested in WP. (45) 3,with 4 view to their claims being submitted for scrutinyby the European Advisory Commission.

(44) 172ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion of a^Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 146)on the problems of reparations and the dismemberment of Germany.No conclusions were reached. The discussion is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File Of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (W.P. (45) 178) covering the draft of a Bill toestablish a Local Government Boundary Commission.The Minister of Health explained that, when the House ofCommons debated on the 15th February the White Paper on LocalGovernment during the Period of Reconstruction, there was general support for the proposals in the White Paper for the establishmentof a Commission to review Local Government boundaries. The draftBill annexed to his Memorandum provided for the establishment ofsuch a Commission; and he was anxious to present the Bill to Parlia-ment before the Easter Recess.The War Cabinet (1) Took note that the detailed provisions of the Local Govern-ment (Boundary Commission) Bill annexed toW.P. (45) 178 would be examined by the legislation committee at their meeting on the 27th March.(2) Agreed that, subject to any drafting adjustments recom-mended by the Legislation Committee, the Bill shouldbe introduced in the House of Commons before the easter recess.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,22nd March, 1945.
NO circulation.M.(us) 35TH CONCLUSIONS(23rd March, I9L5 - 11*30 a.ra.)In the course of an informal discussionof the political situation, reference was made to a growing atmosphere of controversy about the continuanceof economic controls during the transition period.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL service said that the White Paper on Reallocaticn betweenCivilian Employment (Command 65I+8), when it was firstissued, had met with-a favourable reception and he thenhad good reason to hope that he would find no great difficulties in his conversations with representativesof Employers and Trade Unions,     The atmosphere had,however, been poisoned to such an extent by theintroduction of political controversy in recent weeksthat he now felt little hope of being able to secure agreement on his proposals for continued labour controlafter the end of hostilities in Europe.     The wholequestion of &quot;the controls&quot; seemed to have become amatter for political manoeuvre.THE MINISTER OP PRODUCTION said that thisdeterioration in the atmosphere of public discussion hadnot been caused by anything said by official leaders ofthe Conservative Party.THE MINISTER OP RECONSTRUCTION said that inhis talks with Industrialists he had found nodisposition to question the need for retaining themore important of the controls affecting employersduring the period of economic instability after the endof the war in Europe.
