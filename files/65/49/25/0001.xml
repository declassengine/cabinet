The high groundnear Calcar had been gained. 11,000 prisoners had been capturedsince the commencement of the attack by the First Canadian Army.The 9th Army attack was als6 making good progress and american forces were now fairly firmly established across the Boer.3,000 prisoners had been taken in this area since the attack hadbeen launched on the 23rd February. Further to the south, GeneralPatten&apos;s troops had straightened out the salient west of Saarburg,and had also made some progress in the area of Saarbrucken.Good progress had been made on the island of Luzon andManila was now clear of the enemy. There had been heavy fighting on Corregidor Island, where 2,000 Japanese had been killed. Thesouthern tip of the island of Twojima was in American hands.Although Russian progress during the previous week had notbeen spectacular, useful gains had been made by the elimination ofPoznan and Arnswald.

Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.(previous reference:W.M.(45)22ndConclusions,Minute 6.); 2. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home security informed the War Cabinet that during the previous week there hadbeen 49 incidents from Long-Range Rockets. -Of these, 25 had&apos;&apos;occurred in London, 20 in Essex, 1 in Kent, 1 in Suffolk, and&apos;2, inthe sea. v The casualties for the week had. been 69 killed, 160:seriously injured, and 503 slightly injured-the lowest figures forany week of this year.The War Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security.Poland.(previous reference:W.M.(45)23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)3r The Minister of State informed the War Cabinet that thePolish Military Attache hajd now informed the War Office that:General Anders, at present in command of the Polish Corps in italy, was to-day to be appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chiefunder General Bor (now a prisoner of the Germans) of all the polish forces. This would include the corps in Italy at present com-manded by General Anders, the Polish forces in France, and possibly also the Polish Underground Army to the extent that that was stillin being.The general view of the War Cabinet was that, given that theSoviet Government might well take exception to it, it was unfortunate that the Polish Government in London had decided to make this appointment, but that there was no action that could usefully be taken in respect of it.Sinking of 4.   The First Lord of the Admiralty acquainted the Wara Japanese Cabinet with the circumstances attending the recent sinking of a&quot;Coaster. Japanese coaster and the action taken in that connection.  A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Selebt 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed his colleaguesCommittee that   the   Chairman   of   the   Select   Committee   on   Nationalon National Expenditure proposed that a mission of six or seven membersExpenditure, should visit the Middle East to enquire into certain matters on the(Previous spot.  The enquiry would relate to a specified list of subjects which reference: would include the expenditure on a number of military depots andwm (aamimy, installations, and also certain matters connected with U.N.R.R.A.Conclusions,Minute 5.)and the activities of the British Council in the Middle East.After a short discussion the War Cabinet *Decided to defer further consideration of this matter until a meeting at which the Prime Minister was present.Civilian 6.   The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theRespirators. Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (45) 17)proposing that at the end of hostilities in Europe civilianrespirators should be collected and the best of them stored until such time as it could be decided whether hew, -and perhaps improved,types ought to be manufactured. It was accordingly suggested that:an announcement should now be made in order to Warn the public to preserve their respirators, and to inform the local authorities that collection would later be required. A draft announcement on.these lines was appended.   ;        .
149 W.M. 25 (45):/ a In discussion the view was expressed that an announcement on;the lines proposed would have a depressing effect. Moreover, doubt was expressed whether, given the shortage of. storage accomraoda-tioh,l it would be worthwhile calling in respirators after the endof the war for the purpose of storage.The War Cabinet-Decided that no action should be taken at the present stage, the matter being left over for further consideration at the end of the European war.Press.Tass Agency*8Request forAccreditingof AndrewRothstein to -S.H.A.E.F.as a War.Correspondentwith 21 ArmyGroup.7. The War Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretaryof State for War (W.P. (45) 107) and by the Minister of Informa-tion (W.P. (45) 115) about an application by the Tass Agency for mr. Andrew Rothstein to be accredited to S.H.A.E.F. for duty asa war correspondent with 21 Army Group.In favour of rejecting this application, it was argued thatMr. Rothstein was a foundation member of the British CommunistParty; and that the accrediting of Mr. Rothstein to S.H.A.E.F.would, therefore, be a serious embarrassment in defending thedecision not to accredit representatives of the Daily Worker, whichhad been reaffirmed at the meeting of the War Cabinet on the9th January (W.M. (45) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 5) and which hadbeen taken primarily on the grounds of the connection of therepresentatives of the Daily Worker with the British CommunistParty.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that Mr. Rothstein, whohad been an employee of the Tass Agency for many years and, until recently, had been head of their London bureau, had for two years been President of the Foreign Press Association and was widely known and respected among journalists in this country. Moreover,the rejection of the application would be likely to have the mostharmful effects upon British publicity work in the U.S.S.R.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Tass Agency wishedto send Mr. Rothstein to Brussels as their standing politicalcorrespondent, and that the request that he should be accredited toS.H.A.E.F. as a war correspondent arose solely from the fact that belgium was still under a measure of Allied military control.Would it not be possible for the application to be granted on thecondition that Mr. Rothstein would act * solely as a politicalcorrespondent and would not enjoy the privileges e.g., admission to Military press conferences of war correspondents accredited toS.H.A.E.E.?The Secretary of State for War said that, on his present information, he doubted whether a conditional accrediting on theselines would be practicable. He was, however, prepared, as a matterof urgency, to enquire further into the practicability of such anarrangement.The&quot; War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War to examine thepossibility of dealing with the matter on these lines.Daylight 8.   The War Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordSaving. President of the Council (W.P. (45) 112) concerning the policy to- be followed in&apos;regard to daylight saving during ,1945.This question had been considered by the Lord presidents committee at their meeting on the 23rd February, 1945 (LP. (45)10th Meeting, Minute 2) and they recommended that, in 1945, double, summer time should run from the 1st April to the 15th July. TheLord Presidents Committee also suggested that, in announcingtheir decision, the Government should indicate that the position
woulds tee-reviewed in the summer in the. light of the war situation at that time, and that they hoped that the situation&quot; might then be such that it would not toe necessary to exfendthe period of double summer time beyond the 15th July and that it might be possibleto revert to Greenwich Mean Time on the7th-Octobers-Points in discussion &apos;(a) It was pointed out in paragraph 6 of W.P. (45) 112 that the selection of the 1st April, which was Easter Sunday, asthe date on which double summer time should be intro-duced, was likely to give rise to objection on the part ofthe Ecclesiastical Authorities on the grounds that itwould cause hardship to members of congregations whoattended early Service on Easter morning. .1.-v-jThe general feeling of the War Cabinet was. that,whilst this should not be j regarded as a conclusive;argument against the 1st April, consideration should ikegiven to the possibility of introducing double summer:time on the 2nd April instead- -   1 &apos;f(&amp;) Under the proposal originally put forward by the HomeSecretary in paragraph 6 of L.P. (45) 44,-double summertime would have lasted for three, months, from; the29th April till the 29th July. There was likely to be considerable pressure in the House, particularly from members representing agricultural constituencies, forthe period of double summer time to be kept as short aspossible. Would it not, therefore, be advisable to returnto the original proposal for a period of three months,either by advancing the date of introduction to the15th April or by fixing the date of termination at the1st July?   - . r, .The general view of the War Cabinet, however, wasthat the recommendation of the Lord Presidents Com-mittee represented a fair compromise between thevarious interests concerned and, subject possibly to theslight modification proposed under (a) above, should therefore stand. ,, r(c) The Minister&apos; of Fuel and Power; said ltfiat reversion toGreenwich Mean Time on the 7th October would lead to increased fuel consumption during the winter months,and, in particular,&quot; would dangerously increase the&quot; electricity load in the late afternoons. He would prefer,therefore, that, on this point, the Government should not go further, in the proposed announcement, than to saythat the possibility of reverting to Greenwich MeanTime on the 7th October would be considered.It was pointed out, however, that the recommenda-tion of the Lord Presidents Committee in regard to thestatement to be made on this point involved no commit-ment; that the continuance of single: summer timethroughout the winter caused even more inconvenienceto the agricultural community than the introduction of double summer time during the summer months; andthat the acceptance of the Governments proposals inregard to double summer time might well be prejudiced,if the announcement proposed by the Lord presidents committee in regard to single summer time were madeeven more indefinite.The War Cabinet- x- xc%(1) Invited the Home Secretary to consider whether it would be* practicable for double summer time to be introduced onthe 2nd April. .*(2) Agreed that, in 1945, double summer time should run fromthe 2nd April (or, if this prove impracticable, from the1st April) to the 15th July.
151W.M. 25 (45).(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in announcing this decision,to make a statement in Parliament on the lines proposedin paragraph 5 of W.P. (45) 112.Future of 9.   The Minister of Fuel and Power said that Mr. Petherick,the Coal M.P., had put down the following Question for Answer by him on industry.        the following day : * &quot;To ask the Minister of Fuel and Power whether theGovernment intend to produce post-war plans for dealing withthe coal industry.&quot;After a short discussion, it was agreed that this question should be answered in the following terms : &apos;&apos; As my hon. Friend is aware, I am awaiting the reportof the Technical Advisory Committee which I appointed last october. I expect to receive this report early next month.When it has been considered I hope to be in a position to makea statement.&quot;Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,26th February, 1945.

-* NO CIRCULATION RECORDW.M. (45) 25TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2(26th February, 1945 - 5.30 p.m.)THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF informed the War Cabinetthat information had been received that the Germans wereexperimenting with a new form of flying bomb and thatthey were planning to use this weapon against London,possibly within a few days.     Fighter Command had beeninformed of this new threat. &apos;It might be significant in this connection thatthere had been little or no rocket activity in the past two days.The Prime Minister had been informed of thisintelligence and of the action proposed to meet it.
