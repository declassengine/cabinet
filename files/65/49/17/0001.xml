Conference of heads of governments.(previous reference:W.M.(45)16thConclusions.)munitions production.(previous reference:W.M.(45)9thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet resumed their discussion of the points referred to them by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs from the meeting of Heads of Governments.A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.2. At their meeting on the 25th January the War Cabinet had agreed that, for the purposes of planning production, it should beassumed that the earliest date at which the war with Germany was likely to end would be the 30th June, 1945, and the date beyond which it was unlikely to continue, the 1st November, 1945. Theyhad also approved the January aircraft programme set out in w.P. (45) 32, subject to certain adjustments.The War Cabinet were now informed that the Combined Chiefsof Staff had agreed to recommend to the Prime Minister and thePresident that the assumption in regard to the end of the german war to be made for production planning and man-power purposes should be that it would end not earlier than the 30th June, 1945,and not later than the 31st December, 1945.The War Cabinet were informed that the ministerial committee on Man-Power calculated that the effect of the decisions taken by the War Cabinet on the 25th January would be that thenet increases during the first half of 1945 in man-power allocations to all other industries and services other than munitions would haveto be reduced from 315,000 to 210,000, as against requirementsamounting to 532,000. In the case of the Board of Trade thereduction would be from 210,000 to 85,000 as against a requirement of 375,000. It would also be impossible to meet in full the approvedintakes to the Armed Forces for the first six months of 1945 (the deficiency might be about 5,000).It was the general view of the War Cabinet that reductions on anything like this scale could not be accepted and that the whole position would therefore have to be reviewed at an early date. Theywould not wish to raise any objection to the proposed new assump-tions in regard to the end of the German war, which could not in themselves make any material difference to our man-powercalculations. It was, however, clear that allocations to munitions(particularly the Ministry of Aircraft Production) would now haveto be reviewed in relation not so much to any assumption about theend of the war with Germany as to the essential requirements ofOther industries and services.The War Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as Chairman ofthe Ministerial Committee on Man-Power, to inform thePrime Minister of their views by telegram.family allowances,(previous reference:Minute 10.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum(W.P. (45) 85) in which the First&apos;Lord of the Admiralty, theSecretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air urgedreconsideration of the decision taken by the ReconstructionW.M. (44) 122nd Committee on the 22nd January, and reflected in Clause 13 (1) (a) of conclusions,. theEamily Allowances Bill, that the family allowance of 5s. a week,payable in respect of all children of British parents residing in theUnited- Kingdom except the elder or eldest child of the family,should not be issued in Conjunction with Service family allowances.The War Cabinet were informed that, subject to their decisionon this point and to further consideration of certain minor points,the Family Allowances Bill had been approved by the legislation committee (H.P.C. (45) 5th Meeting, Minute 1). It was proposedthat the Bill should be laid in dummy on Tuesday, the 13thFebruary, and should receive its Second Reading in the course ofthe following week. If passed by Parliament, it would come intoforce on an appointed day to be settled by Order in Council.
.;. In support of the Reconstruction Committee&apos;s decision it waspointed out that, in the White Paper on Social Insurance(Cmd. 6550), it had been stated, in connection with family allowances that there would be no duplication with allowancespayable under other schemes. Provisions to avoid duplication withallowances payable under all other schemes were accordinglyincluded in the Bill and, if an exception had to be made in the case ofService family allowances, the whole principle of the avoidance ofduplfcation might be jeopardised. Moreover, the practical effect would be to increase the allowances payable in respect of, the children of serving men other than the first child from 12s. Qd. a week to17s. Qd, a week; and this might lead to pressure being brought uponthe Government to accept the principle that something of the orderof 17s. Qd. per child corresponded with needs and to apply it in thecase of other schemes under which children&apos;s allowances werepayable.The First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State forWar and the Secretary of State for Air were unable to accept these arguments. In their view, the payment of universal family allowances concurrently with the children&apos;s element of Servicefamily allowances would not constitute a duplication in Stateallowances. Service family allowances were part of the wages of theOfficer or the man paid by the State as his employer and, as such,were not the same in kind as family allowances which the State paid under other schemes. Moreover, although the Government haddefended the rates of Service family allowances as being adequate for the needs of the serving man and his family without admittingthe validity of a comparison between total service remuneration and civilian emoluments of comparable classes, this comparison was, infact, made and Service family allowances had been freely criticised on that basis. In any case they were satisfied that there would be serious political difficulty if serving men were excluded from thebenefits of the family allowance scheme.In discussion attention was drawn to the fact that on the12th June, 1941, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir KingsleyWood) had stated in the House of Commons that it would appearto be impracticable to realise any saving on the estimated cost of ascheme of family allowances on account of family allowances paid in,the Services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this statement,which in any case did not amount to a commitment, had been madeat a time when the rates of Service family allowances were much lower than they were at present and when the question underdiscussion concerned the introduction of a general family allowance scheme during the war.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the time had come when consideration must be given to the while question of the structure of Service pay and allowances after the war. Pendingdecisions on this matter, it would be premature to decide whetheror not general family allowances should be payable in respectof the children of members of the Forces. The relevant provision ofthe Family Allowances Bill should therefore be redrafted in such away as to leave this question open, and a statement should be madeto the effect that the relationship between the general family allowances and Service family allowances would be taken intoaccount in a review of the whole structure of Service pay and allowances which the Government were undertaking and wouldcomplete before the Family Allowances Bill was brought into force.The War Cabinet-^Invited the Minister of National Insurance to prepare a revised draft of Clause 13 (1) (a) of the family allowances Bill and a draft statement on the lines proposed at &quot; X &quot; above, for consideration by the War Cabinet attheir meeting on Monday, the 12th February.of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,9th February, 1945.
