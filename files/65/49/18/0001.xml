These had been the firstlosses incurred in February.Sinkings of merchant ships by U-boats had taken place in theStraits of Dover, in the Channel and about 800 miles west ofFreemantle. A U-boat had probably been sunk on the 5th Februarynorth of Ireland. It was thought that about 11 U-boats were on patrol in our coastal waters, and there had probably been a consider-able increase in the number outward bound from Norway.A convoy bound for North Russia had been attacked by enemy aircraft on the 7th and 11th February. A total of 9 enemy aircraft had been destroyed without damage to the convoy or escort.H.M. Submarine Spirit, whilst on patrol off the north coast ofJava, had shelled and boarded a 200-ton Japanese coaster, whichhad been found to be an armed Q-ship. It had been sunk withdemolition charges. A further coaster of 600 tons had alsobeen sunk.French forces had now eliminated the Colmar pocket afterinflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. From the 20th january to the 10th February 17,460 German prisoners had been taken inthis area.In the Eifel area United States forces had widened the breachin the Siegfried Line by the capture of Pram on the 10th February.Fierce fighting was in progress for the control of the Roer dams.On the 8th February a British-Canadian force had made anattack on a five-divisional front east of Nijmegen, with the objectof destroying the enemy between the Meuse and the Rhine. Clevehad been captured and also an important bastion in the ReichswaldForest. 4,000 prisoners had so far been captured. Our owncasualties had been light.In response to a suggestion by the Minister of Information, theWar Cabinet invited the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General staff to communicate with Field-Marshal Montgomery with a view toa statement being issued from his Headquarters designed to bring out the predominantly British character of the forces operating under General Crerar in the First Canadian Army.In the north, General Cherniakovsky had made slight progress and had further reduced the area held by the Germans in east prussia. General Rokossovsky had prevented enemy efforts to breakout to the west from the East Prussian pocket. On GeneralZhukov&apos;s front gains already made had been consolidated. Themain Russian advance during the week had been in Silesia between[29485-3] - &apos; B 2Pacific.MilitaryOperations.North-west europe.Russia.

The Deputy Prime Minister said that Earl Winterton had referred in the House during the previous week in critical terms to conditions in the liberated areas. It was clear that public opinion was exercised on this question. He suggested that it Would be an advantage if a statement could be made in the House&apos;of Commonsearly in the present week.The Minister of State said that a number of questions had beenput down on this subject for Wednesday and that he would propose,after consultation with departments concerned, to make a statement on that day.,  The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Minister of State&apos;intention. &quot; - -Prisonersof WarCaptured in north-west europe.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 147thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (45) 89) on the disposal of thelarge number of German prisoners of war now on our hands or likelyto be captured in the next few months. An immediate decision was necessary on measures to meet the threatened outbreak of disease in the overcrowded prison camps across the Channel; whilethe recent operational developments of the war in Europe made it essential to frame plans for coping with the large numbers ofGerman prisoners of war we might expect to have to accommodatein the coming months. In these circumstances the approval of theWar Cabinet was invited to (i) The immediate acceptance in the United Kingdom of ,500 prisoners from 21 Army Group, and of a further20.000 if necessary, during the course of the present month.(ii) Negotiations with the Americans to replace the present agreement (under which captures in joint Anglo-American operations in any theatre are equally divided between the Americans and ourselves, after deductingany prisoners captured by a third Power, such as theFrench) by one whereby each nation would accept responsibility for its own captures.(iii) Subject  to  (ii)   above  being  satisfactorily  arranged,acceptance of a commitment to accommodate in thiscountry American prisoners liberated on the western front until they could be repatriated to the UnitedStates.(iv) Action in conjunction with the Foreign Office, dominions office, S.H.A.E.F. and others concerned designed toobtain the maximum acceptance of German prisoners ofwar in France, Belgium and Holland, in the UnitedStates and Canada, in North-West Africa, in theMiddle East and Southern Dominions, &amp;c, as oppor-tunity offered.The Secretary of State for War said that the position was fullyset out in his Memorandum. On the short-term problem, he askedfor approval to accept 7,500 men, and if necessary a further 20,000.While conditions in this country might in certain respects fallsomewhat short of those envisaged by the Geneva Convention, theywould be better, and the threat of disease less, than on the Continent.As regards the long-term problem, it would be impossible todeal with the number of prisoners of war likely in present circum-stances to fall to us under the 50-50 agreement with the Americans.He suggested that the terms of an approach to the Americans witha view to the modification of the agreement should be examined[29485-3] B 3
departmental^. He was advised by the Minister of War Transportthat, once it had been abrogated, shipping to North America wouldnot present serious difficulty, though there would be great difficultyin providing shipping to the Middle East and the southern dominions. So far as the feeding of prisoners of war was concerned,they were entitled to the standard applicable in the case of depottroops, which was the same as that applicable to the civilian popula-tion. It was possible that, consequent on the Crimean Conference^the French might be willing to accept a larger contingent than the50,000 to which (subject to our providing food, clothing and armsfor guards,-who might have to be coloured troops) they were atpresent ready to accept.The following points were made in discussion : -(a) There was reason to believe that the Nazi element in certainprison camps was at the moment bearing heavily on thenon-Nazi element. The Secretary of &quot;State for Warexplained that the conditions under which, owing toovercrowding, it was necessary to house prisoners made it almost impossible to segregate the Nazis from thenon-Nazis.(b) The Secretary of State for Dominion. Affairs said that,while the Canadian Government had recently rejected a request to increase the numbers of prisoners of war heldby them, the High Commissioner for Canada had suggested that a personal message from the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to the Prime Minister ofCanada might be of value. The Secretary of State forWar welcomed such an approach, but asked that it mightbe co-ordinated with any general demarche which mightbe made to other Governments in connection with theacceptance of prisoners. It was the case that at themoment Canada was accommodating only about half ofthe prisoners which had been captured by canadian troops.(c) The suggestion was made that Newfoundland might be ableto assist. It was pointed out, on the other hand, that supplies of food would have to be brought to Newfound-land from outside and that her population was too smallto enable her to provide the requisite guards.(d) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security drew attention to the provision on page 4, paragraph 2 (vi),of WP. (45) 89 that some 11,000 of the german prisoners from the Channel Islands when the Islandswere liberated would, on capture, be accommodated onAlderney. The population of Alderney was only 1,500, and he apprehended difficulty if so large a Germancontingent was to be located there. Surely 5,000 wouldbe a maximum number. The Secretary of State for Warthought that it was proposed to accommodate the 11,000in Alderney temporarily only. Any more permanentcommitment would clearly be open to discussion. Hesuggested, and the War Cabinet agreed, that the matter should be further considered at the official level betweenthe War Office and the Home Office.(e) It was suggested that additional accommodation could bemade available in this country if some of the italian prisoners of war now detained here were to be returnedto Italy. It was pointed out, on the other hand, that aserious shipping problem would be involved, and that account would have to be taken of the effect on thelabour force in this country.After further discussion, the War Cabinet -(1) Approved the proposal in paragraph 18 (a) of W.P. (45) 89that 7,500 prisoners of war should immediately beaccepted from 21 Army Group in the United Kingdom,
109W.M.18 (45).and if necessary a further 20,000 during the course ofthe present month.- (2) Invited the Secretary of State for War, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, to examine how best to approach the United States Government for the modifi-cation of the-existing 50-50 agreement on the lines proposed in paragraph 18 (&amp;) of W.P. (45) 89.8. The Deputy Prime Minister said that it was likely thatduring the course of the Debate on the Requisitioned Land and war Works Bill on Tuesday, the 13th February, the question of the bearing of this Bill on the large numbers of airfields constructedby the Air Ministry on requisitioned land would be raised. It wasnecessary to consider carefully what should be said on this matter by the Attorney-General, who would be replying to the Debate onbehalf of the Government. .     -The War Cabinet were reminded that airfields required by theR.A.F. after the war would be acquired not under the RequisitionedLand and War Works Bill but under the Defence Acts. As regardssuch of the airfields constructed by the Air Ministry on requisi-tioned land as would not be permanently required for the R.A.F.,the position under existing law was that the Air Ministry were obliged to allow the land in question to revert to its previousownership, and had the option either of reinstating the land in itscondition before it was requisitioned or of paying compensationfor damage up to a maximum of the total value of the land at thetime when it was requisitioned. If this were done, there would beno guarantee that the land would revert to its original use, since there would be no compulsion on the owner to use the compensation to restore the land and in many cases the cost of restoring the land would be greater than the total value of the land at the time atwhich it was requisitioned. Moreover, in some cases it would bein the national interest that the land should be used for some other purpose than that for which it had been used before the requisition.In such cases consideration by the Commission (with the decisionultimately resting with Ministers and Parliament) seemed to be theproper course; and for this the Bill provided, wherever the Govern-ment did not find it necessary to acquire under the Defence Act for defence reasons.In discussion, it was suggested that,, in the Debate, members might ask for information in regard both to the number of theseairfields which were likely to be permanently required for theR.A.F. and to the policy of the Government as regards airfieldswhich would not be required, either for defence or for civil aviationpurposes.It was pointed out that the number of these airfields which itwould be necessary to retain for the R.A.F., both to accommodate thepeace-time Royal Air Force and as a reserve against the possibleneeds of a future war, depended on such matters as the post-war strength of the R.A.F., which could not be settled until the time came to consider post-war security. As regards the remainder,each case would have to be considered on its merits. Some wouldbe required for other purposes (e.g., civil aviation) and decisions on the others would depend on such considerations as the quality of the soil and the cost of restoring the land to a condition in whichit would be suitable for agricultural use.In further discussion, it was suggested that Members might take the opportunity of this Debate to raise the more general question of the future of land-particularly of land of especial&quot;amenity&quot; value&quot; which had been taken over during the war for defence purposes.The view of the War Cabinet, Was that this general question,whilst it required consideration in the near future, did not arise onthe present Bill and should be considered separately.
The War Cabinet-        .Invited the Attorney-General to be guided by the courseof the above discussion to the extent that it might prove necessary to deal with the question of airfields in theforthcoming Debate.Family 9.   At their meeting on the 9th February the. War Cabinet hadAllowances.      agreed that the relevant provisions of the Family Allowances Bill(Previous        should be re-drafted in such a. way as to leave open the questionReference:       whether or not the general family allowance should be issued in w.M.(45)7th   respect of children of members of the Forces and that a statement;Conclusions,      should be made to the effect that the relationship between the minute 3.)       general family allowances and Service family allowances would betaken into account in a review of the whole structure of service pay and allowances which the Government were undertaking andwould complete before the Family Allowances Bill was brought into. force; and they had invited the Minister of National Insurance toprepare accordingly a draft Clause for insertion in the Bill and adraft statement.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of National Insurance (W.P. (45) 91) covering (i) A draft Clause empowering the Minister to make Regula-tions for the reduction or the withholding of an allowance in respect not only of the children of members of the. Forces and of police pensioners and firemen, who werecovered by the Bill as previously drafted, but also inrespect of children for whom allowances were being paid under the war pensions scheme, the civil injuries schemes and certain other miscellaneous schemes of a similarkind.(ii) A draft statement which also covered these other cases.The Minister of National Insurance said that, if the questionof allowances for the children of members of the Forces was dealtwith in the manner proposed by the War Cabinet, it would, in his view, be necessary to deal on the same lines with the other casescovered by his draft Clause and statement. In view of the natureof the Regulation-making power proposed, he suggested that theRegulations should be subject to confirmation by Affirmative Resolu-tion in Parliament.Points in discussion were : (a) There was general agreement that allowances paid underthe war pensions scheme, the civil injuries schemes andother miscellaneous schemes of a similar kind should be covered by the new provision; and that regulations made under that provision should be subject to confirma-tion by Affirmative Resolution in Parliament.(b) It was suggested  that the draft Clause attached toW.P. (45) 91 might be regarded as creating a presumption-tion that the general family allowance would be paid inrespect of the children of members of the Forces; andthat it might be preferable to frame the provision in sucha way as to indicate.that the children of members of theForces and other children covered by it would be excluded from the scope of the Bill unless Regulationswere made to include them. The general view of theWar Cabinet, however, was that a provision on theselines would give rise to the same political difficulties as would the exclusion of these classes from the scope of theBill; and that there should be no difficulty in framing the statement to be made in Parliament in such a way as to avoid creating a presumption that the generalallowance would be paid in these cases.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,12th February, 1945.(c) The Secretary of State for India pointed out that section 1 (a), of the draft Clause attached to W.P. (45) 91was so drawn as to exclude members of the Forcesserving in India, who were paid by the Government ofIndia.&apos;. &quot; -The Minister of National Insurance undertook toX &quot; arrange for this section to be redrafted so as to meet thispoint.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the draft statement attached to WP. (45) 91 laid too much stress on the proposed review of the whole structure ofService pay and allowances. It might not in fact bepossible to carry out this general review before the&apos; bill was&quot; brought into force; and it was, in any case,undesirable that the presentation of the Bill should bemade the occasion of a general Debate on the futurestructure of Service pay and allowances. In his view,the line to be taken in the proposed statement shouldbe that the enactment of this Bill would necessitate a review,of those cases in which family allowances were already provided from the Exchequer; that this reviewwould be carried out before the Bill came into force; andthat the relevant provisions of the Bill had accordingly been drawn in such a way as not to prejudge its result.In any case, he considered it essential that the general principle that there should be no duplication of allowances payable from the Exchequer should be clearlybrought out in the statement.The War Cabinet-(1) Subject to the point at &quot;X&quot;- above, approved the draftClause attached to WP. (45) 91.(2) Agreed that the Regulations referred to in this draftClause should be subject to confirmation by affirmative resolution in Parliament.(3) Invited the Minister of National Insurance to reconsider,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the terms of the draft statement attached toWP. (45) 91.
