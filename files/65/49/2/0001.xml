Reference was made to the arrangements for welcoming abatch of men recently arrived at a Northern port in this country onrepatriation from Eastern theatres of war after several years&apos;service overseas Comment had been made in the Press on somefeatures of the arrangements, and, in particular, that there had been no provision enabling the men&apos;s relatives to meet them, either on arrival at the port or at the London terminus.It was explained that three-quarters of the men were from theMiddle East theatre and that they had mtfstly been engaged in[29062-2] B 2
duties at the base. The arrangements for their reception in thiscountry were described to the War Cabinet.. The view generally expressed by the War Cabinet was that thismatter required careful handling if public criticism was to be avoided; and that the employment, on these occasions, of a small number of persons experienced in trayel arrangements would greatlyimprove the reception arrangements.The Secretary of State for War undertook to consider the suggestions made.Attacks by 3.

The Prime Minister said that, in view of the increasing number of incidents from long-range rockets and the improvedaccuracy, he thought it would be well that consideration should begiven to the question whether, when Parliament reassembled, theHouse of Commons should meet in Church House.He suggested that this matter should be considered by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as Leader of the House, theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security, and the Secretaryof State for Air.The War Cabinet-Approved this suggestion.Greece.(previous reference:W.M.(45)lstConclusions,Minute 6.)Yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M.

parliament. .Electoral     ,ReformVoting    &apos;   -Arrangementsfor Members, ofthe Forces.(Previous ..Reference:W.M. (44) 161stConclusions,Minute 11.)\ 7;( At their meeting on the 4th December the War Cabinet had invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to preside over a conference to devise a scheme.of postal voting for the Forces.; ? The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 9) covering the Report ofthe Conference.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the conference had unanimously agreed on a scheme under which, by postponing the count for nineteen days after the poll and allowing two days&quot;for the count, the bulk of Service voters in all important overseastheatres would be able to vote by post. If the period of postpone-ment were fourteen days instead ; of nineteen it would not bepossible to cover India, Burma, Ceylon, Iceland, East Africa andiSouth Africa; arid the Conference recommended that the longer period should be adopted. It was impossible to give an absoluteguarantee that any particular Service voter wOuld be able to voteby post, and the Conference had therefore recommended that anyproxy appointment made by a Service voter, who had applied for apostal ballot paper should stand, the proxy vote being cancelled ifa postal ballot paper had been returned in time.There might be some criticism of the fact that each Servicevoter would have to make an individual application for a postal ballot paper. The Conference were, however, satisfied that this was, an essential feature of the scheme.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe welcomed the proposals in the Report of the Conference and, ifthe War Cabinet agreed, proposed to put down amendments to the representation of the People Bill in order to give effect to thescheme. He would also present the Report of the Conference toParliament so that it might be available for consideration inrelation to the amendments.In discussion, reference was made to the point which had beenmade by some members of the Conference that at least part of theadditional time required to operate the postal voting scheme shouldbe found by extending the interval between nomination and the poll. This was not a necessary feature of the scheme. Nevertheless,in view of the difficulties of making the necessary arrangementsfor an election in the period immediately after the end of the warwith,Germany, and in order to give candidates serving in the Forcesample time to return, it was urged that there, was good ground for allowing a longer period between the dissolution and the poll.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that, if too long a period was allowed to elapse between the date when it became known thatan election was to be held and the poll, interest in the contestwould flag.The Prime Minister thanked the Chancellor of the exchequer for the work which he had done in presiding over the Conference.As to the interval between the dissolution and the poll, he had contemplated that, when it was clear that the war with germany was over, some three weeks&apos; notice would be given before the dateof the dissolution. Thus the fact that a general election was to takeplace would be known some thirty-eight days before the poll. Itwould be necessary to consult His Majesty about this proposal andhe would do so before the committee stage of the Representation ofthe People Bill was taken in order that the Government might bein a position to make a statement on the matter.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the scheme set out in the Report of theConference for postal voting for the Forces, seamen and war workers abroad, annexed to W.P. (45) 9.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of Home. Security and the Secretary of State for Scotland topresent the Report to Parliament and to put down thenecessary amendments to the Representation of thePeople Bill to give effect to the scheme.
(3) Took note that it was contemplated that some three weeks&apos;notice would be given of the dissolution, so that therewould be a period of about thirty-eight days in allbetween the announcement Of the-election and the poll,and agreed that there should be no extension of the time between nomination and the poll.travel facilities.Visit ofMembers ofParliamentto France.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 161stConclusions,Minute 6.J8. At their meeting on the 4th December the War Cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the HomeSecretary and Minister of Home Security to work out a planwhereby a representative party of Members of Parliament mightvisit France. It had subsequently been suggested by the PrimeMinister that, in addition, a limited number of Members of Parlia-ment, selected by ballot, should be allowed to visit Franceindividually.The War Cabinet now had before them a joint Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (45) 11) setting out a schemewhich they had drawn up in consultation with the&apos; Chief Whips.It was proposed that facilities should be given to any delega-tion of Members of any party who were.invited by a correspondingpolitical party in France to meet them, and also to any representa-tive body of Members whom either House desired to send to France,whether or not any express invitation had been, received. Inaddition, six Members of Parliament, selected by ballot, should beallowed to visit France each week for the purpose of makingthemselves familiar with conditions there.The War Cabinet-(1) ApProved the scheme proposed in W.P. (45) 11 for theprovision of facilities for travel to France by Membersof Parliament.. (2) Invited the Leader of the HouseAo work out the form ofthe ballot in consultation with the Chief Whips,reference being made, if necessary, to the Speaker.   *   &apos;parliamentary business.(see.M. (44) 171stConclusions,Minute 9.)9. The War Cabinet discussed the arrangements for Parlia-mentary Business when the House reassembled and reached thefollowing conclusions : (1) There should be no change in the business already announced for the week beginning the 14th January, butthe House should be informed as soon as it reassembledthat the Government proposed that there should be a debate on the War Situation in the week beginning the21st January, probably on Tuesday, the 23rd, andWednesday, the 24th.(2) It would be convenient to take the debate on the war situation on the Vote of Credit.(3) With regard to the promise given by the Leader of theHouse to try to arrange for an early discussion of thedecision to post members of the A.T.S. overseas, it wasagreed that it would be desirable, if possible, to avoidhaving to set aside a day for this, and that the best coursewould be for the Prime Minister to deal with the matter-in replying to the Parliamentary Question which sir Oliver Simmonds had put down-for Wednesday, the17th January, on the subject of ,the addition of250,000 men to the United Kingdom combatant troops.The Secretary of State for War undertook to submit adraft reply&quot; for consideration by the Prime Minister.Supplementary Questions indicated that Membersdesired more time to discuss the posting overseas ofmembers of the A.T.S., they might be informed that theywould have an opportunity of raising it in the debate on the War Situation.(4) HOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,8th January, 1945.
MO circulation.M. (us) 2ND CONCLUSIONS8th January, 19U5The War Cabinet alone (all Ministers being present)met at 5*30 p.m., half-an-hour before the main meeting.THE PRIMS MINISTER referred to the speech made to theBaptist Union by the Minister of Aircraft Production on the3rd January and reported in the papers of the hth January. under headlines referring to &quot;brotherhood with, the Germans&quot;.The Prime Minister quoted two sentences in thisspeech to which he took special exception.     He felt it wasnot the right time at which a Minister should give utteranceto these sentiments.Discussion showed general agreement that the speechwas unfortunate and untimely, and that it should not havebeen made without prior consultation with his colleagues.TEE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the Minister had beenmeticulous in consulting the Foreign Office about speeches on foreign affairs, but he had not done so on this occasion.It was pointed out that the speech had been made to theBaptist Union and was no doubt regarded as primarilyreligious.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was not^asking hiscolleagues to sit in judgment on the Minister of aircraft production.     He thought, however, that he should eitherwrite to him on the matter or speak to him (the latter course was favoured by the War Cabinet).     He would also have to tell him that if the matter were raised in theHouse of COinmons he would not be able to defend the speech.In some further discussion reference was made toan article by Reuter&apos;s Agency, freely reproduced in the sunday papers, which gave a very pessimistic appreciation of the military situation.

0*&apos;.iR*uField Marshal Montgomery&apos;s speech was also referredto.      THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE asked whythe Field Marshal need make public speeches.      The Prime: *   Minister admitted that he had known that Field Marshallip Montgomery intended to make a speech.The Prime Minister also expressed doubts as towhether in present circumstances it would not be better to have an Army Officer as second-in-Command to general eisenhower instead of Air Chief Marshal Tedder, who hadbeen placed in that post in view of the extreme importanceof the air weapon at the time of the original assault.The Prime Minister also undertook to circulate to the War Cabinet a paper by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff about operations in France, of which acopy had been sent to the United States Chiefs of Staff.
