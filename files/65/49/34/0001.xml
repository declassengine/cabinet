commercial policy.Views ofCanadianGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 153rdConclusions,Minute 4.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) A Note by the Secretary (W.P. (45) 142) covering copiesof telegrams from the Canadian Government. on thecontinuance of Mutual Aid in Stage II, and the furtherprospects for commercial relations between this countryand Canada; and an exchange of personal telegramson these subjects between the Prime Minister and thePrime Minister of Canada.(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (W.P. (45) 167) commenting on the views expressed in these telegrams from the canadian government.(iii) A Note by the Secretary (WP. (45) 182) covering draftreplies to the Canadian Government prepared by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs.The Prime Minister said that he had discussed the draftreplies at an informal meeting which he had held the previous evening. He thought that the drafts were on the right lines.While not committing His Majesty&apos;s Government at this stage,they recognised the generosity of the Canadian offer and invitedfurther discussion of the long-term problems.The War Cabinet-Approved the drafts annexed to WP. (45) 182, and invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toarrange for telegrams in these terms to be despatched tothe Canadian Government.Food.&quot;WorldSupplySituation.(previous reference:W.M.&apos;(45)31stConclusions,Minute 2.)UnitedKingdomStock Levels.ProposedDiscussionsinWashington.2. The Prime Minister said that at a Press Conference theprevious day the Minister of Food had commented on a statement,to which currency was being given in the United States, that thefood reserves in this country were of the order of 700 million tons.He had not, however, been at liberty to state the actual figure atwhich these reserves now stood, viz., only about 6 million tons.The Prime Minister said that at this stage of the war lessweight need be given to the security considerations which had hitherto precluded public reference to the exact amount of our foodreserves; and, in view of the difficulties to which the prospectiveworld shortage of food was likely to give rise in the next fewmonths, he thought it important that the exact level of thesereserves should now be made known to the public, both here andin the United States. He had verified that the Chiefs of Staff saw no objection to disclosure of the figure. He therefore proposed tomake a statement on this subject, in answer to a Private notice question in the House of Commons that day, in the course of whichhe would disclose, the true facts relating to the level of food reserves in this country. This statement would be so phrased as to encourage the agricultural community to continue their efforts to maintainhome food production.The War Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers inten-tion to make a statement on this question in the House ofCommons.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet the draft of a directive which he proposed to give to the Minister of Productionand the Minister of Food for the purpose of their forthcoming discussions in Washington on the world supply situation.The main points raised in discussion of this directive were : (a) One of our objects was to secure an enquiry into the levelof food consumption by the United States Forces.   It would be
211W.M. (34) 45.necessary to offer a corresponding enquiry into the ration scales of British troops. This offer should not, however, be made in such terms as might imply that reductions in British&apos; scales could beproportionate to those accepted for United States troops.(&amp;) Russia should not be exempt from the reductions requiredto bring estimates of food requirements down to the level ofsupplies. There was some risk that Russian requirements wouldbe assumed to have Protocol priority. Russia&apos;s position. as aclaimant for food supplies had been substantially altered by heroccupation of food-growing areas in Eastern Europe.(c) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggested thatthe Canadian authorities should be brought into the forthcoming discussions at Washington-both as partners in the CombinedBoard machinery and also because of the high level of foodconsumption in Canada.It was agreed that it might be left to the Minister of Produc-tion and the Minister of Food to make suitable arrangements, after their arrival in Washington, for Canadian participation in these discussions.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft directive, subject to amendments suggested in the discussion and to any further amend-ments of detail which .the Minister of Production might suggest to the Prime Minister.*(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform president roosevelt of the date on which the Ministers of Produc-tion and Food would leave this country for Washington.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W.1, ,21st March, 1945. -The Directive as finally approved by the Prime Minister was subsequently circulated as(45) 191. - &apos; &apos;&apos;
