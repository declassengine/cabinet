Crimea conference.(previous reference:W.M.(45)18thConclusions,Minute 3.)Parliament.Business ofthe House.Reallooationof Man-Power.Treatment ofSeamenon T. 124Agreement.(previous reference:W.M.(44)22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Deputy Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a message of thanks from the Prime Minister and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs for the War Cabinet&apos;s message con-gratulating them on the results of the Crimea Conference.2. The Deputy Prime Minister informed the War Cabinetthat the Prime Minister hoped to be able to make a statement onthe Crimea Conference in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the20th February. He was advised by the Chief Whip that there was likely to be a desire that any statement should be on an adjourn-ment motion, and that there might be pressure for a two-day debate.He would propose accordingly to announce the business for next week on Thursday, the 15th February, in the ordinary way, but to add, subject to the view of the War Cabinet and to consultationwith the Prime Minister, that it would be subject to alteration at short notice to provide for a two-day debate on the Crimea conference.The War Cabinet-Approved the Deputy Prime Minister&apos;s proposal.3. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (45) 79) proposing that men serving in auxiliary war vessels, which were commis-sioned as His Majesty&apos;s Ships under a special agreement known asthe T. 124 Agreement, should, on release after the end of theEuropean war, be granted release leave on the same scale as general service personnel, i.e., 56 days.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that thesemen could be clearly distinguished from men on mercantile marineengagements. It was not proposed that they should receive a wargratuity.The War Cabinet-.   Approved the proposal contained in W.P. (45) 79.War Gratuities.(previous reference:W.M.(45)3rdConclusions,Minute 3.)4.   The War Cabinet bad before them-(i) A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (45) 84) in regard to the grant of war gratuity towhole-time members of the Civil Defence Services; and(ii) Memoranda by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(W.P. (45) 88) and the Secretary of State for Scotland(W.P. (45) 93) in regard to the grant of war gratuities to the Women&apos;s Land Army.Civil Defence The-War Cabinet first considered the question whether whole-Services, time members of the Civil Defence Services should receive gratuitieson the general lines approved for the Armed Forces, and, if so, whatthe rates of gratuity should be.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatthe question of the grant of war gratuity to the whole-time membersof the Civil Defence Services had already been raised on his joint consultative Committee. Members of these Services receivedremuneration similar to that of a married private soldier with one child and at various times applications for increases in their payhad been resisted on the grounds that this basis could not be altered.He considered, therefore, that they had a very strong claim to a wargratuity; and, since they would not receive other benefits, such asthe resettlement leave with full pay which would be granted to menr29485-4J b 2
and women released from the Armed Forces, he hoped that the WarCabinet would agree that the rates of gratuity should be the sameas those for the Armed Forces.Points in discussion were :-(a) The cost of granting war gratuity to whole-time membersof the Civil Defence Services at the Armed Forces rates might beof the order of  10 million.(&amp;) If war gratuity were granted to whole-time members ofthe Civil Defence Services, would it be possible to refuse it to part-time members ?The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe would not support any claim which might be made for the grantof war gratuity to part-time members of the Civil Defence Services.(c) If war gratuity were granted to members of the Civil -Defence Services, there was likely to be a demand for the paymentof war gratuity to munition workers and others who had been subject to direction and exposed to risk.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, the element of risk could not be accepted as a criterion. The justifica-tion for granting war gratuity to whole-time members of the civil defence Services was that their rates of pay were based on Servicerates of pay. ;(d) Members of the Civil Defence Services had remained inthis country and were being released earlier than members of the armed Forces. They would therefore be at a great advantage, ascompared with the Armed Forces, in finding civilian employment.It was suggested that this was an argument in favour not somuch of refusing them war gratuity as of fixing the rate of gratuitysomewhat below that for the Armed Forces.(e) If war gratuity were granted to the Civil Defence services at the same rates as for the Armed Forces, there might well be strong pressure for an increase in the rates for the Armed Forces.(/) The Secretary of State for War said that it appeared fromAppendix I to W.P. (45) 84 that, in some cases, it was proposedthat, in calculating the rates of gratuity for members of the civil defence Services, account should be taken of an element in their pay representing recognition of special skill. In calculating therates for members of the Armed Forces, only the basic rate of pay for the rank had been taken into account.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security undertook to look into this point.Some Ministers felt doubt as to whether the case for the grantof war gratuity to whole-time members of the Civil Defence Services-had been made out and whether, if it were granted, it would eventually prove possible to resist claims from other quarters. Thegeneral view of the War Cabinet was, however, that war gratuityshould be granted, but at lower rates than those for the armed forces.The War Cabinet next considered the position of the royal observer&apos;Corps Officers, which was dealt with in paragraph 7 of w.P. (45) 84.The Secretary of State for Air said that these officers wereclassed as Civil Defence workers and were subject to statutory regulations and Orders. Their conditions and remuneration were very similar to those of officers of the National Fire Service, to whom it was proposed that war gratuity should be payable. It would bedifficult to justify the payment of war gratuity.to ordinary Observersand to Officer grades in the Civil Defence Services, but not to theofficers in the Royal Observer Corps.
117 WM, 19 (4-5).It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the Royal observer corps Officers were paid salaries on a civilian basis, attracting CivilService war bonus, and that their constitutional position was thatof. temporary Civil Servants. If they received war gratuity, itwould hardly be possible to refuse it in the case of other civilianswho wore Service uniforms with or without Service commissions,such as Army Audit staff, Land Agents, &amp;c.The War Cabinet felt that, before they could reach a decisionon this point, they required further information regarding theposition of Royal Observer Corps Officers and the probable reper-cussions of the grant to them of war gratuity.The Minister of Aircraft Production suggested that, if wargratuity was to be granted to whole-time members of the civil defence Services, consideration should be given to its grant to members of the Air Transport Auxiliary.The War Cabinet finally considered the question of the grantof war gratuity to the Women&apos;s Land Army.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that membersof the Women&apos;s Land Army were already suffering under a sense of injustice owing to their exclusion from a number of benefits whichwere to be extended to members of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services.The Women&apos;s Land Army had performed arduous duties atrelatively low rates of pay and, if war gratuity was to be grantedto the Civil Defence Services, he would press for it to be grantedalso to the Women&apos;s Land Army. Wastage was already exceedingrecruitment and the further disappointment which exclusion from both the resettlement grant scheme and war gratuity would arousewould make matters worse. A refusal to grant war gratuity might make it difficult to maintain, let alone increase, the present level offood production. -The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, thearguments in favour of doing something for the Land Army were strong. On the other hand, the remuneration of the Women&apos;s land army was based on the rates of pay in the agricultural &quot;industry andthe majority of its members were serving private employers. If thegrant of war gratuity were not to be very widely extended, it was essential to maintain the differentiation between those paid on industrial and those on Service rates of pay.&apos; He suggested, there-fore, that some special scheme of assistance might be worked out forthe Women&apos;s Land Army -for instance, the Government might makeitself responsible for a generous outfit allowance for those who were released and a special scheme of bonus, graded according to lengthof past service, for those who were prepared to remain in theWomen&apos;s Land Army.This suggestion met with general approval; and the Ministerof A griculture and Fisheries said that a scheme on these lines would go a considerable way towards allaying the present dissatisfaction,especially if it could be announced within a short time after any announcement made in regard to the grant of war gratuity to theCivil Defence Services.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that war gratuity should be paid to whole-time members of the Civil Defence Services and that the rates should be three-quarters of the rates payable in respectof the Armed Forces.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary and Minister of JJomeSecurity would discuss the matter on this basis with hisJoint Consultative Committee.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Air to consider further the position of royal observer Corps Officers and to submit a report setting
Ii QISout in greater detail the arguments for and against thegrant to them of war gratuity and its probable reper-cussions.(4) Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production to discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the first instance,the question of the grant of war gratuity to the air transport Auxiliary.(5) Approved in principle the proposal for a special scheme ofassistance for the Women&apos;s Land Army and invited theChancellor of. the Exchequer and the Minister of&apos; Agriculture and Fisheries to consider the possibility ofworking out a scheme on the lines proposed at &quot; X &quot;above.(6) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security- and the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries toconsider the practicability of co-ordinating the arrange-ments for the announcement of the payment of wargratuities to the Civil Defence Services and proposals under the special scheme for the Women&apos;s Land Army.BuildingLabourAllocation,January-March 1993.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 145thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (45) 90) on the Building LabourAllocation for the first quarter of 1945,The Minister of Production said that, subject to the reserva-tions noted in paragraph 3 of W.P. (45) 90, the proposals in his paper had been agreed with the Departments concerned, and that he recommonded them for approval on the basis proposed in his paper.It was suggested that there would be advantage in the generalallocation for April-June 1945 being reviewed in time to give ample opportunity to the Departments concerned to represent their position. The Minister of Labour and National Service agreed thatit would be desirable that Departments should work out their super-priorities as early as might be. If he could have early informationas to their demands, e.g., for housing and factories, every effort would be made to advise them as to What amount of labour was likelyto be available for them.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals in the Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (45) 90).The aircraft programme.(previous reference:W.M.(45)9thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production (W.P. (45) 92).The Minister of Production said that the January aircraft programme had been amended in accordance with the decisions taken by the War Cabinet on the 25th January and was now called the February Programme. He recommended that the War cabinet should now. authorise the issue of this February Programmeimmediately, without prejudice to any further reductions whichmight be agreed later.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Minister of Production asset out in W-P. (45) 92,Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,13*A February, 1945.
