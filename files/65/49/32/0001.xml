The confirmed shipping losses for March now amounted to 29,725 tons. &apos; .One U-boat had been so badly damaged that it had been scuttlednear Galley Head, Southern Ireland on the 12th March. Anotherhad probably been sunk by H.M. South African Frigate Natal offBerwick on the 14th March. During March two U-boats had been sunk, four probably sunk and promising attacks made on threeothers.On the night of 12th/13th March two Norwegian-mannedM.T.Bs. attacked two merchant ships of about 4,000 tons off theNorwegian coast.

The operation was supported by destroyers and sloops and a firm bridgehead&apos; was established!Organised, resistance on Iwojima Island had ceased on the16th March.At the request of the War Cabinet the First Sea Lord gave; thefollowing information about Midget submarines. These craft beganoperating in the Scheldt area on the 23rd December, 1944, and were based on Ymuiden and other Dutch ports. They normally operated in groups and their activities were largely dependent on the weather.They carried two torpedoes or mines and wero manned by a crew ofone or two. Since they started operating it was estimated that48 had been captured, sunk or probably sunk. In addition,promising attacks had been made on about 37 others; Our casualtiesdue to suspected attack by these craft were estimated at some sixships of varying sizes.United States forces were making good progress in the Remagenbridgehead, in spite of the large enemy forces concentrated against them. General Patton&apos;s thrust across the Moselle, begun on the14th March, had made excellent progress and had now reached Bad- Munster. To the north-east of this, United States forces wereclosing in along the Rhine. Coblenz was reported to be cleared ofthe enemy. The United States 3rd Army was also making thrustsin the direction, of Kaiserlauten and, further to the south-west,towards Birkenfeld, Nehfelden and Tholey.&apos; These latter movementsshould assist the United States 7th Army, which was closing up tothe Siegfried Line. The advances of the last week had been very satisfactory and it &quot;was possible that large German.forces would bebadly mauled in the area south of the Moselle and west of the Rhine.[29799-6] b 2East Indies.Pacific.MidgetSubmarines.MilitaryOperations.

The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theHolland. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 162) and theFood Minister of Food (W.P. (45) 175) on the despatch of relief suppliesSupplies.        to occupied Holland.(Previous The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in his Memorandum,Reference: asked the War Cabinet to agree to the institution of a regularW.M.(45)l4th scheme of relief to occupied Holland at the rate of about 5,000. tonsConclusions, of food a week, together with certain medical supplies, distributionMinute 6.) to be arranged by the Swedish Government or the International red cross, or both. He proposed, in consultation with the Admiralty,to negotiate with the German Government arrangements for a routeother than the Kiel Canal and, if possible, for an unloading pointnearer to the distribution area than the port of Delfzijl, where therelief supplies were at present being unloaded. If negotiationswith the Germans for a route other than the Kiel Canal should fail,the Chiefs of Staff would be given a further opportunity of consider-ing the position. As regards supplies, it would be difficult for thiscountry to provide the amounts required over any extended period;and the Dutch had approached the Governments of- the UnitedStates and Canada with a view to obtaining supplies from north america. The Foreign Secretary proposed, however, that mean-while we should do our best to meet the Dutch supply requirements from this country until North American supplies became available.Discussion turned on the question of providing supplies fromthis country during the interim period. The amounts required were set out in the Memorandum by the Minister of Food, viz. 16,000 tonsof flour, 3,000 tons of margarine and 1,000 tons of milk, infant food,sugar and other miscellaneous items.
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,19th March, 1945.199 W.M. 32 (45). -The Minister of Food said that he could ^provide the flour, ifhe could count it against his commitments to S.H.A.E.F. He held a reserve of 100,000 tons earmarked for S.H.A.E.F., but so farunallocated. 42,000 tons of this might be required by S.H.A.E.F.,in lieu of biscuits which he was unable to provide; but the16,000 tons for Holland might be drawn from the remaining58,000 tons.Margarine could be provided in the form pf refined oils or oil .seeds; it could be supplied as margarine only if additional labourcould be found for manufacture in this country.The miscellaneous items could be supplied against replacementby the Dutch at a later date. This could be arranged by divertingsupplies consigned to Holland from North America.In discussion it was suggested that, in view of the shortage ofman-power in this country, arrangements might be made for themargarine to be manufactured in Belgium. The materials mightbe provided from this country, and the finished product transportedfrom Belgium to Holland. The Minister of Food undertook to look into this suggestion in consultation with the Minister of war transport.The War Cabinet-, (1) Approved the proposals for the institution of a regularscheme of relief to occupied Holland, as set out inparagraphs (i) and (ii) of W.P. (45) 162;(2) Agreed that, until supplies for this purpose became avail-able from North America, arrangements should be madeto send supplies from this country on the lines indicatedin W.P. (45) 175, on the understanding that theMinister of Food would (i) seek the concurrence ofS.H.A.E.F. as regards flour; and (ii) discuss with theMinister of War Transport the possibility of arranging for the required supplies of margarine to be maiiu-&apos; factured in Belgium.
