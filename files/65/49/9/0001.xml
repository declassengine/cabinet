1.   The War Cabinet had before them-(i) a memorandum by the Minister of Production (W.P.(45) 34) about the assumed date of the end of the warwith Germany; and(ii) a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft Production (WP. (45) 32)regarding the aircraft programme.The Minister of Production explained that at present production-tion planning was governed by the instruction that departments should cover requirements which would arise if the German war were to continue until the middle of 1945, but that in certain cases,such as ammunition and tanks, decisions had been taken to increase production to levels which would cover requirements even if thewar continued after the 30th June, 1945. The choice appearedto lie between confirming the existing assumption and extending the date until the end of 1945, since an intermediate assumptionwould hardly make sufficient difference in planning to be justifiable.If the latter date were accepted there would be no change in theproduction of ammunition and tanks, but in many other casesincreases above present planning would probably be necessary, andthe. Ministry of Aircraft Production would presumably have to adhere to the October programme instead of adopting the January., programme, which had been drawn up on the basis of theassumption that the date of the end of the war with germany would be the 30th June, 1945.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that the Chiefsof Staff had advised that for planning purposes it should beassumed that the earliest date on which the war was likely to endwas the 30th June, 1945, and that the latest date beyond which thewar was unlikely to continue was the 1st November, 1945. Hethought that the Minister of Production, in consultation with theSupply Ministers, should plan production in such a way as to fit in with these dates, regard being had to the nature of each product.It would, for example, be essential to continue the production ofammunition at a level which assumed the continuance of the waruntil the 1st November, 1945; but on other items where there wasno danger of shortage, or where production could be quicklyincreased if necessary, it seemed justifiable to proceed on theassumption that the war would end at the 30th June, 1945. looking to the available supplies of aircraft and to the fact that the oppor-tunities of employing aircraft in the Japanese war were likely tobe limited, it seemed justifiable to accept the January programme set out in WP- (45) 32. It would, of course, be necessary to reviewany decisions taken at the present time within the next two months.The following points arose in discussion: (a) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that itwould be -useful if he could be supplied with estimates of the approximate numbers of labour which would be released by theSupply Departments, on the assumption that the German war endedon, say, the 1st April, 1st July and 1st October, 1945. This wouldenable him to plan for the early reabsorption into civil industry of the labour which would be released when the programmes were cut back to the level required for the Japanese war.(b)&apos; The Secretary of State for Air said that, if the german war continued after the 30th June, it would be essential to keep upthe supply of high-performance fighters. While, therefore, he was prepared to accept the January programme in general, he muststipulate for an adjustment of the programme -which would keep up the supply of this type of fighter.(c) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had just received notice that there might be a considerable reduction in&apos; thenumber of Corsair aircraft supplied from the United States. Ifthis were so, some addition would require to be made to the Ministryof Aircraft Production J anuary programme.[29193-2] B 2MunitionsProduction.(previous reference:W,M. (44) 138thConclusions,Minute 2.)
(d) The Minister of Aircraft Production confirmed that thfcacceptance of the January programme would involve placing., ahOrder for Mosquitoes and Lancasters from Canada.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, for the purposes of planning production, itshould be assumed that the earliest date on which theGerman war was likely to end was the 30th June, 1945,and the date beyond which it was unlikely tq continue,the 1st November, 1945; and invited the Minister ofProduction, in consultation with the Supply Ministers,to plan production to cover these dates, having regardto the nature and stocks of each type of Store and to theextent to which Output could be restored at short notice.(2) Approved the January aircraft programme set out in w.P. (45) 32, subject to any adjustments-which mightbe required (i) to meet the increased need for high-performance fighters in the event of the extension of theGerman war beyond the 30th June, 1945, and (ii) to make up any deficiency in the supply of Corsair aircraft should it prove impossible to secure delivery of thesupplies promised by the United States.(3) Agreed that the question of munitions production shouldbe reviewed within the next two months.2. The War Cabinet were informed by the Minister ofProduction and the Minister of Fuel and Power that owing to bad weather it was Urgently necessary- that there should be economies in the use of industrial power. It was accordingly proposed thata letter should be sent to all firms appealing to thdm to economisein the use of fuel or industrial power. It would be pointed out inthe letter that, if voluntary economies were not found to be effective, the Government would have to give directions by order for the carrying out of the necessary cuts. It was hoped that the appeal would be successful, but meanwhile arrangements would bemade by which it would be possible to give directions for thenecessary cuts without delay.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the action proposed by the Minister of Produc-tion and the Minister of Fuel and Power with a view to securing economies in the use of industrial power.3.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) a report by the Lord President of the Council, Chairmanof the India Committee (W.P. (45) 37), on Mr. Desai&apos;approach to the Viceroy; ,      ..(ii) a report by the Lord President of the Council, ChairmanOf the India Committee (W.P. (45) 54), oh the Viceroy&apos;s interview with Mr. Desai.       &apos;    fThe Lord President of the Council informed the War Cabinetthat the report in W-P. (45) 37, containing certain recommenda-tions as to the line to be taken with the Viceroy in respect of his proposed interview with Mr. Desai had been overtaken by events.Before the War Cabinet could consider it the Viceroy had reportedthat he was committed to seeing Mr. Desai. The India Committeehad therefore felt that it would be better to await the result of this &quot;interview; but the Viceroy had been informed of the anxiety ofthe War Cabinet that the interview should be conducted in a whollynon-committal manner. &quot;The India Committee had thereafter considered the Viceroy&apos;sreport of the interview contained in his telegram 157-S of the20th January, reproduced as Annex I to W.P. (45) 54.FdelEconomy.(previous reference:W.M,(44)43rdConclusions,Minute 7.)India.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 171stConclusions,Minute 6.)
That report to some extent clarified the position. But itincreased the doubts of the India Committee as to the authoritybehind Mr. Desai&apos;s proposals and as to the adequacy of those proposals.; The Committee had prepared two draft telegrams to theViceroy, (attached as Annex II and Annex III to W.P. (45) 54).Those telegrams were designed to draw, from the Viceroy an assurance that he was in agreement with the War Cabinet as tothe points, on which we must be satisfied before he had any furtherinterviews and before Mr. Desai&apos;s scheme could be seriouslyentertained.- That evening a press report had been received from which itappeared that Mr. Jinnah declined all responsibility for whatevertalks there might have been between Liaqat Ali Khan and Desai.Liaqat Ali Khan had also made a speech reiterating the demandsput forward on behalf of the Muslim League by Mr. Jinnah in theautumn of 194Q. The pressing of those demands was not consistent with the information given to the Viceroy by Mr, Desai. It was themore essential in these circumstances that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should know exactly where they stood before committing themselves and that the Viceroy, who might well not appreciate theimportance of certain of the points in issue, should be aware of thematters to which His Majesty&apos;s Government attached importance.The Lord Chancellor suggested that line 2 of paragraph (d) ofthe draft telegram appended as Annex III to W.P. (45) 54 shouldbe amended by the substitution for the words &quot; or Jinnah&quot; of thewords &quot; still less Jinnah-see his interview reported in the associated Press under date   1 v&apos;After a brief discussion, the War Cabinet Approved the telegrams appended to W.P. (45) 54 as annex II and Annex III, subject to the addition proposedby the Lord Chancellor, and invited the Secretary of Statefor India to arrange for their despatch.International 4.  The War-Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the monetary Chancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 40) reviewing the positionFund, regarding the proposals of the Brettom Woods Conference for(Previous       setting up an International Monetary Fund and an InternationalEeferenee:      Bank for Reconstruction and Development.   A message had been.M. (44) 132nd sent to Congress by President Roosevelt covering a financial.Conclusions,    programme which would include approval of both projects.  A BillMinute 3.)      was likely to be presented to Congress before the end of january and to be referred to the appropriate committees.   It was forconsideration in these circumstances whether opportunity shouldbe given for a further debate in the House of Commons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that, on balance,the wise course would be to face an early debate in the House on aGovernment resolution which would not commit us to final accept-ance of the Bretton Woods proposals, but would, secure approvalof the principles involved, so that we should have some limit ofaction in the event of Congressional amendments. It would beopen to the critics to put down an amendment. The Government^ had pledged themselves to take no further commitment without a debate. - If Congress were to accept the Bretton Woods proposals asthey stood we might be awkwardly placed, since it would bedifficult at that stage to give effect to any views subsequentlyexpressed by the House. If, on the other hand, Congress insisted on making amendments to the proposals, that would create a new situation, which would have to be considered when the time came.After a general discussion, of which a separate record is kept in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions,the Prime Minister said that he thought the general sense of theWar Cabinet was that the balance of advantage rested with
waiting upon developments in the United States. There hadalready been one debate on - this subject in Parliament on the10th May, 1944, when a resolution had been passed that the sta.te-ment of principles provided a suitable foundation for further international consultation with a view to improved monetaryco-operation after the war. The scheme had not so far beendiscussed in Congress, and we were entitled in those circumstances to reserve our position pending discussion in Congress and see howmatters developed. If pressed, we could remind the House that thiswas the position, and could undertake to bring the matter beforethe House in the light of developments in the United States.The War Cabinet-Accepted the Prime Ministers view.Civil Aviation.supplementary estimate ofthe Vote forthe Ministerfor CivilAviation.(previous reference:W.M.(45)8thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. At their meeting oh the previous day the War cabinet invited the Lord President of the Council to make a statement asto the powers and duties of the Minister for Civil Aviation, theterms of this statement being settled in consultation with theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister for Civil Aviation.The question had arisen whether it should be stated that theMinister for Civil Aviation was now in a position to give orders to B.O.A.C., and, if necessary, could make changes in the Board ofthe Corporation. These functions were, of course, at presentassigned by statute to the Secretary of State for Air.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the Lord President of the Council should makea statement to the effect that, pending the necessary legis-lation, these powers would, by a working arrangement, be delegated by the Secretary of State for Air to theMinister for Civil Aviation, subject to a proviso that in. matters affecting the conduct of the war the Secretary ofState for Air would continue to have the right to give directions. It should also be said that the necessary legislation would be introduced as soon as possible to giveeffect to this change.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,25th January, 1945.
