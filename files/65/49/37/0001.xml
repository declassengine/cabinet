channel islands.(previous reference erence:W.M.(45)26thConclusions,Minute 9.)1. At their meeting on the 6th March the War Cabinet&apos; had invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security to con-sider whether a warning should be given to the German commander in the Channel Islands that if he persisted in his proposal to neglecthis obligations towards the civil population he and any of his officers concerned would be liable to be added to the list of war criminals.The War Cabinet now had before them a joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security and theMinister of State (W.P. (45) 183) reporting the result of examina-tion of this question. The evidence as to the extent to which theGerman Commander could be regarded as having failed in hisobligations was conflicting and the effect of any further warningat this stage was doubtful. At the official level it had been agreedthat if it was decided, as a matter of policy, that some warning should be given for the purpose of ensuring that the civil populationreceived a fair share of the local supplies, the best course would bethat this should be conveyed privately to the German Commander inthe Islands.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatno further evidence was to hand as to the behaviour of the GermanCommander.After discussion the War Cabinet Decided that this should be left over for the time being.Asylum for 2.

South africa and New Zealand had approved the statement with slight amend-ments. The Canadian Government, on the other hand, favoured the omission from it of an Annex giving the number of refugees accom-accommodated in the Dominions, which they thought might give rise tomisunderstanding.In the meantime, conditions had so changed since the proposal was originally made that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in agreement with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, whowould be willing to explain the position to the Dominion Govern-ments, recommended that opportunity should be taken of the Cana-dian attitude to drop the whole project.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs that the project should be dropped, and invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toexplain the position to Dominion Governments.DoubleTaxation.ProposedAgreementwith.United StatesGovernment.3. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Ghan-cellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 1 and 189) on the progress of thediscussions between officials of His Majesty&apos;s Government and theUnited States Government with a view to the conclusion of an agree-ment on double taxation.These Memoranda indicated the scope of the proposed agree-ment and the main advantages which it would secure for thiscountry; and drew special attention to the provisions proposed forthe exchange of information.
225W.M. 37 (45) .16 3The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposed Con-vention would be of great value to British traders. With the present high rates of taxation, double taxation^ was a very serious obstacle to international trade, and the trading community would be strongly in favour of a Convention on the lines proposed.Further, the draft Convention provided for three points ofgreat importance, namely : (a) reciprocal exemption of air transport profits; these wouldbe treated in the same way as shipping profits;(6) reciprocal treatment of industrial literary and filmroyalties;(c) the United States withholding tax would in future only be levied at 15 per cent, instead of the normal rate of30 per cent, on United States dividends and rents coming to the United Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also explained that under theterms of the draft Treaty the taxation authorities of each country would be required to exchange such information, available to them under their taxation laws, as was necessary for carrying out theprovisions of the Agreement, or for preventing fraud or avoidance.Information so exchanged would be treated as secret and would notbe disclosed to any persons other than those concerned in the assess-ment and collection of taxes. No information would be exchangedwhich would disclose any trade secret or trade process. Theexchange of information might extend to cases of avoidance whereindividuals in either country entered into,, artificial transactionsdesigned to reduce their tax liability.In discussion, it was&quot; suggested that the proposed convention was likely to be of more value to the United States than to thiscountry, owing to the balance of investments held by each countryin the other country.It was also urged that the arrangements for exchange ofinformation would interfere seriously with the operation of theinternational money market in Europe and that many people who now arranged for their balances to be kept in London would infuture keep them elsewhere. Removal of this &quot; hot money.&quot; wouldmean some loss of employment in the City and also would diminish the capacity of the City to earn profits which constituted a valuableelement in our balance of foreign exchange.The question was raised as to how the proposed convention would be viewed by responsible authorities in the City.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Bank ofEngland strongly favoured the scheme. As the scheme was still inthe stage of a draft under confidential discussion with the UnitedStates authorities, he had not hitherto felt able to have consulta-tions on the details of the proposals with the Chairmen of the JointStock Banks.After further discussion, the Prime Minister said that it was clear that the balance of opinion in the War Cabinet was in. favourof the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals. Nevertheless, hethought that, before a final decision was reached, it would be aswell that the War Cabinet should have before them such particularsas could be made available, giving , (a) the approximate total of United States investments in theUnited Kingdom and of British investments in theUnited States;(6) an estimate as to be probable effect of the scheme on tradingprofits;(c) an estimate of the amount of &quot;hot money &quot; which mieht beremoved from London if adversely affected by thescheme.[29831-5] B 2
The Prime Minister also thought that there was no objectionto the Chancellor of the Exchequer haying confidential discussions with a small number of leading Bankers, to whom details of theproposed scheme might now be communicated,- in order to ascertain the views of the banking community.The War Cabinet-Approved the Prime Ministers suggestions.world organisation.Trades UnionRepresentation(previous reference:W.M. (45) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4.)4. At.their meeting on the 19th March the War Cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the lord president of the Council to see Sir Walter Citrine about tradesunion representation at the San Francisco Conference.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 199) reporting the outcome of the discussion with Sir Walter Citrine. Sir Walterhad urged that a representative of the T.U.C. should be officiallyattached to the British delegation as an observer, particularly todeal with matters concerning the Economic and Social Council,and had again pressed that the Joint International Trades union organisation should be allowed to make representations to thefour major Powers at San Francisco.The Memorandum also explained that the United States were contemplating issuing invitations (subject to the unanimous consentof the sponsoring Governments) to the International LabourOrganisation and one or two other international organisations tosend representatives as observers. If the Russian Governmentshould oppose the suggestion that the I.L.O. should send an observer, we should have to acquiesce. The United States Govern-ment took the view, however, that they could not prevent anyonefrom sending representatives to San Francisco provided suchrepresentatives made their own arrangements, but that no facilities would be granted to them.The War Cabinet first discussed whether the representativesof the T.U.C. should be officially attached to the British delegation.It was pointed out that the Conference had been convened to draw up a constitution and ought, therefore, to be confined to representa-tives of Governments; and that a decision to admit representativesof the T.U.C. Would give rise to other and embarrassing claims.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toinform Sir Walter Citrine that a T.U.C. representativecould not be officially attached to the British Delegation.The War Cabinet then considered the suggestion that theI.L.O. should send an observer.The Minister of Labour and National Service pointed out thatthe I.L.O. was an international organisation set up by Governments,and he suggested that it should, therefore, be invited to send a delegation to be available for consultation. It was true that russia was no longer a member of the I.L.O. But if the I.L.O. wasassociated with the new organisation, no question of Russia&apos;sformal readmittance to the I.L.O. would arise.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theproposals in the Memorandum represented an attempt on the partof the United States to get round the difficulty arising from thepresent relations between the I.L.O. and Russia. He would readilytake the matter up with the United States on the lines suggested,if the Minister of Labour and National Service would furnish him with a note elaborating his suggestion at &quot; X.&quot;

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar -Cabinet of the position regarding the representation of Polandat the San Franseiseo Conference.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard Pile of War Cabinet Conclusions.Poland. 6.

The War Cabinet had agreed that the views of the Dominion(Previous Governments should be ascertained; and in a statement made in the reference: House of Commons on the 27th February the Prime Minister had.M.(45)23rd indicated that this question was under discussion with DominionConclusions, Governments.Minute 2.) The War Cabinet now had. before them the following Memo-randa on this subject: -W.P. (45) 113 by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, covering a report by the Committee on. the reception and Accommodation of Refugees on the possibility of offering apermanent home in the British Empire to men of the PolishArmed Forces who might not wish to return to Poland after/     the war.W.P. (45)141 by the Home Secretary and Minister of home security, on the question of conferring British nationalityon such members of the Polish Forces by the grant ofnaturalisation.W.P. (45) 196 by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, covering copies of the replies received from DominionGovernments on the questions of naturalisation and settlement.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said that,for the reasons indicated in his Memorandum, he would be con-cerned about the effects of any general offer of British nationalityto Poles who had found their way to this country after the collapse of Poland. Many of the Poles who had gone through the formof volunteering for military service were undeserving people andhad never had any serious intention of taking an active share in thefighting. The numbers involved might represent a substantialaddition to our foreign-born population; and the replies receivedfrom Dominion Governments offered little prospect of our being ableto settle any substantial proportion in other parts of the Empire.Moreover, any general concession to Poles might well lead to demands for the naturalisation of persons of other nationalities,including Germans and Austrians, who had served in the armed forces. Large numbers of these were Jews; and the consequent increase in our Jewish population might increase the dangers ofcivil disturbances after the war. There was a strong undercurrentof anti-Semitism in some parts of this country, and the positionneeded careful watching.On the other side, it was pointed out that the proposal to whichthe Prime Minister had referred in the House of Commons hadbeen limited to Polish troops who had actually fought under british command. It had never been intended that these facilities forBritish naturalisation should be afforded to all persons of Polishnationality who had come to this country after the fall of Poland.Nor was it necessary that the same facilities should be accorded, on equal terms, to persons of all nationalities who had rendered assist-ance to the British cause during the war.  Their claims were not to
be compared with those which the Poles would have if, in spite ofour efforts, conditions in Poland after the war were such that theycould not be expected to return there.Discussion showed the general view of the War Cabinet to bethat, provided the Concession was limited (as envisaged in the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement in the House of Commons on the 27th February)to the Poles who had taken an active part in fighting under british command, there was no reason why it should weaken us in resistingclaims for naturalisation from nersons of other nationalities. Theproblem was, in the main, one of finding a satisfactory definition.This was a matter which would have to be examined by the Depart-ments concerned.The War Cabinet-- (1) Agreed that, if the political settlement in Poland proved to be such that Polish troops who had served and foughtunder British Command in France or Italy felt that theycould not return to Poland under the new conditions, we -should accept the obligation to provide facilities forthem, if they so desired, to become British citizens, inaccordance with the pledge given by the Prime minister in the House of Commons on the 27th February, 1945.(2) Agreed that this pledge did not commit His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to afford the same facilities to persons ofother nationalities, even though they had served in or with British Forces in the field, or to Poles other thanthose referred to in (1) above.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,28th March, 1945.    .,
