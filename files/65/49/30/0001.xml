Food. 1.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) Memoranda by the Minister of Food (W.P. (45) 109, 130and&apos;158) on the prospective world shortage of food&quot;   in1945. &apos;(ii) A Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport (W.P.(45) 145) on *v proposed Anglo-American survey of thelevel of United Kingdom stocks of food and rawmaterials.(iii) Telegrams* which had passed between President Rooseveltand the Prime Minister about the supply of food for liberated; areas in North-West Europe.(iv) A Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Minister of Food (W.P. (45) 36) onthe post-war contribution of British agriculture to the-   saving of foreign exchange.World Supply The War Cabinet first discussed the prospective generalSituation.       shortage of food supplies.The Minister of Food said that, for the reasons stated in his.     Memoranda, 1945 would be a critical year for food.  Of the chieffoods only wheat would be available in abundance; and the diffi-culties of the supply situation could be illustrated by the position, in regard to meat.  There was a prospective deficit of 1,800,000 tonsbetween world requirements and supplies of meat. yA&apos; few weeks ago he had hoped that this deficit could be bridged, in agreementwith the United States authorities, by some reduction in-standards of consumption in the United States and some reductionin UnitedKingdom stocks. The most recent information, however, suggestedthat the War Food Administration were unwiRing to contemplate any further cuts in United States consumption, and had recom-mended to the Combined Food Board that during the second quarterof 1945 no meat whatever should be exported from the UnitedStates, either for the United Kingdom or for the liberated areas.Points made in discussion were :-(d) The Prime Minister said that, in the circumstances disclosedby the Minister of Food, we should defer fulfilment of our recent1 offer to supply 25,000 tons of corned beef to Russia.(b) Australia and New Zealand were supplying substantial quantities of meat to United States Forces in the Pacific. It was true that the meat supplies which we were now obtaining from theUnited States were about one-third more than those which they weredrawing from the Southern Dominions: but this need hot prevent us from making full use of the argument that, if the United Statesmaintained their view that they could supply no meat to thiscountry in the second quarter of the year, we could not continueto go without the meat supplies which they were now drawing from australia and New Zealand. &apos;(c) The United States authorities should be pressed to review their current rates of food consumption both for the Armed forces and for the civil population. The supplies per head for UnitedStates troops were far in excess of British scales. It was estimated that the annual meat supplies for the United states forces Would provide 450 lbs. per, head as compared with about300 lbs. for British troops. In terms of calories per day the averagefigures for total civilian food consumption in the United States was,200 as compared with 3,000 for the; civilian population in thiscountry.-t The Prime Minister, in summing up this part of the discussion,said that at this stage of the war the maintenance of minimumscales of food supply should, if need be, take priority over the needsof military operations. It was clear that we were facing a situation of grave shortage, which would be aggravated if the Americans* Nos. 710 m4rX12 from President Roosevelt.No. 902 from the Prime Minister^

There were indications that the state department and the Foreign Economic Administration were dis-posed to take a different view of this matter from the War FoodA*huinistratibn in United States; and it was desirable that an approach should now be made to the United States government at the highest level to impress on them the seriousness of the situationand the need for early economies in their levels of food consumption.Discussion then turned on the proposal, which had been putforward at the Crimea Conference, for an Anglo-American enquiry into the level of stocks of food and raw materials in the UnitedKingdom.The Minister of War Transport said that the position had changed since his memorandum (W.P. (45) 145) was circulated tothe War Cabinet. The Americans now recognised that, so far asfood was concerned, the problem had become one of supply ratherthan shipping; and within the last few days a committee had beenappointed, in Washington to consider, at a high level, whatreductions could be made in current rates of food consumption andto study the food supply situation as a whole. It would also dealwith the question of United Kingdom stocks. In these circumstances the Americans were no longer proposing to send a representative to this country to hold a preliminary investigation into UnitedKingdom stock levels in consultation with the interested Depart-ments of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Prime Minister said that this change in the situation would affect the arrangements which we should make for co-operation in this enquiry. As it was now recognised that theproblem was mainly one of supply, not of shipping, he thoughtit would be more appropriate that the matter should be handled by the Minister of Production and the Minister of Food. The most convenient course would be for these two Ministers, possiblyaccompanied by the Paymaster-General, to pay an early visit to washington.The War Cabinet then discussed the supply of food-stuffs for liberated areas in North-Western Europe.The Secretary of State for War said that deliveries of civil affairs supplies to North-Western Europe were likely to fall behindschedule. Supplies were already about three weeks late in reachingUnited States ports for shipment. If shortages developed, theywould have to be met either by reducing the ration for these areasor by further inroads into United Kingdom stocks. For June and july a total of 772,000 tons had been allocated, as against total requirements for that period of 1,245,000 tons; and there couldbe no certainty that even the reduced allocation would be delivered in accordance with schedule.In discussion it was pointed out that the estimate of total requirements included substantial provision for the supply of food-stuffs to Germany; and the suggestion was made that this provisionmight be reduced. On the other hand, it was emphasised that partof these supplies for Germany were required for feeding allied nationals who had been transferred into Germany from occupied territories.There was general agreement that it would be impracticable to meet from United Kingdom stocks any substantial part of the deficit between requirements and supplies for liberated areas.Stocks of food-stuffs in this country were nearing the point agreed between ourselves and the Americans as the minimum level requiredto maintain efficient distribution. Even if we were prepared toaccept the risk, of reducing our stocks, say, 10 per cent, below that level, the supplies thus obtained would make no appreciablecontribution towards the needs of the liberated areas. It must bebrought home to the United States Government that, unless there[29799-4] B 2
were some reduction in the level of food consumption in the UnitedStates, the situation could be met only by reducing supplies for theUnited States Forces or for the liberated areas.      -The War Cabinet were reminded that arrangements had beenmade for a debate to be held in the House of Commons early inthe following week on the supply position in the liberated areas.The Lord President of the Council said that, in replying to this debate, he could not give an assurance, as he had hoped to be ableto do, that the prospects for supplies over the next few months werereasonably satisfactory if, as the Secretary of State for War had said, we believed that even in this early period supplies from theUnited States would, in fact, fall behind schedule. Further, it seemed desirable that a clear public warning should be given thatserious shortages of food were likely to develop during the summer months. If, however, the Prime Minister was proposing tocommunicate with President Roosevelt about the food supply position as a whole, it might be inexpedient that a public statementof this kind should be made in the House of Commons untilPresident Roosevelt had had a reasonable opportunity for considering the Prime Ministers communication.It was agreed that the Leader of the House of Commons shouldexplore the possibility of deferring for a few days the forthcoming debate on supplies for liberated areas.The conclusions of the War Cabinet were as follows: -(1) The Minister of Production and the Minister of food should submit, in the light of the discussion, materialon which the Prime Minister might base a telegram to president Roosevelt. This, while related to the specificquestion of meeting S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s requirements for civil affairs supplies in liberated areas, would express theviews of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the general questions which had been dealt with in the WarCabinets discussion of the prospective world shortageof food.(2) The Minister of Production and the Minister of food should proceed .to Washington at an early stage todiscuss means of meeting the threatened shortage offood; and it should be arranged that these discussions would cover the enquiry into United Kingdom stocklevels which had been suggested by the Americans at the crimea Conference.The Prime Minister would consider whether the paymaster-General should be associated with these discussions in Washington. The Minister of war transport could go out at a later stage if shippingquestions arose.(3) The Lord President of the Council should take the oppor-tunity afforded by the forthcoming debate on supplies to liberated areas to make a statement in the House ofCommons about the gravity of the food situationgenerally.(4) The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was authorisedto communicate&apos; the main facts of the situation to county War Agricultural Executive Committees;, andalso to stress the need for maintaining food productionin this country in the appeal which he was proposing to make for volunteers to help in this year&apos;s harvest.(5) A decision regarding the suggested communication to dominion Governments of the information containedin WP. (45) 109 should be deferred until a reply hadbeen received to the telegram which the Prime minister proposed to send to President Roosevelt (conclusion (1)above).
Germany. 2.   The Prime Minister read out to the War Cabinet the draftSuggested       of a telegram which he was proposing to send to PresidentDeclaration     Roosevelt on the possibility of issuing a warning to the German.tp the German people about the effects of continued resistance.People. The object of this declaration was to make it clear to the(Previous       German people that prolonged resistance would increase the riskReference:      of widespread famine in Germany after their final surrender.  TheW.M.(45)26th  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had pointed out that such a conclusions,    declaration might increase the risk that the Germans would seekMinute 3.)      to conserve their existing supplies of food by reducing the rationsof prisoners of war and other Allied nationals now in Germany.There was also some danger that,such a declaration might appeafto imply that, if the Germans surrendered at an early date, theUnited Nations would see to it that no serious food shortagedeveloped&apos;in Germany.  This last point might be met by amending the declaration so as to make it clear that Germany must in any event suffer a very grave food shortage, which would develop intofamine conditions if resistance were prolonged.The Prime Minister said that, in sending the draft declaration to President Roosevelt, he would make clear the disadvantages aswell as the advantages of issuing such a declaration.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,14th March, 1945.

M CIRCULATION&apos;  W.M.(us) 30TH CONCLUSIONSlhth March, 19U5PARLIAMENT. THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the remarks madeReflation on by Mr. R.R. Stokes, M.P. in the course of a speech onthe Prime minister by the previous day in the debate on the Army Estimates.Mr.R.R.Stokes, MJ*.Mr. Stokes had said that the Prime Minister and theMinister of Production had consistently &quot;lied&quot; to theHouse about the tank programme.   Mr. Speaker, when his attention was called to the point of order involved,had said that he had not heard this remark, and had added (in the Prime Minister&apos;s view injudiciously)that he was not sorry when Mr. Stokes&apos; speech had cometo an end.   This had given rise to some further protestsby Mr. Aneurin Bevan, M.P.The Prime Minister said that he was not preparedto let Mr. Stokes&apos; remark pass without challenge; , andhe had asked the Chief Whip to enquire when it wouldbe convenient that he should&apos;refer to the matter in thecourse of that day&apos;s proceedings in the House of Commons.Later in the meeting a message was received fromthe Chief Whip to the effect that it would be convenient if the Prime Minister made his statement immediatelyafter Questions that day.The Prime Minister indicated that he would make astrong protest and invite Mr.&apos; Stokes&apos; to withdraw his remarks^   Other Ministers said that they would -1^ make a special point of being on the front bench atthe time when the Prime Minister was proposing tomake his statement.

,N0 circulation.M. (us) 30TH CONCLUSIONS.11+th March, 1945THE PRIME MINISTER said, that he had seen reportsof a strike among members of the Women&apos;s Land army as a result of the decision that they must be excludedfrom the arrangements for the grant of war gratuities to members of the Civil Defence Services.    Such action was not likely to enlist public sympathy for their claims.The War Cabinet were informed that the numbers involved in this strike were very small.The Prime Minister said that he would not exclude the possibility of making some concessions to theWomen&apos;s Land Army, once the public interest in gratuitiefor the Civil Defence Services had decreased.   what he had in mind were such concessions as a specialallowance of clothing coupons on discharge, andpermission to retain articles of uniform.
