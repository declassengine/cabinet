Europe.Russia.[29426. 1. The Vice-Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events ofthe previous week.Bomber Command had flown 4,100 sorties and had attacked by day Krefeld marshalling yards, communications at Munchen-Gladbach and the submarine pens at Maaslouis and Ijmuiden. by night, attacks had been made on various communication, industrial and oil targets.  Mosquitoes had attacked Berlin on two nights.United States bombers had flown 3,730 sorties. Their targetsincluded Berlin (on which 2,020 tons had been dropped), railwaystations and oil targets.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 11,900 sorties.They claimed to have destroyed 1,250 motor transport vehicles,91 locomotives, 920 road and rail cars and 60 tanks.Enemy losses for the week had been 86 aircraft destroyed(including 38 on the ground). Allied losses had been 86 bombers,53 fighters and 2 Coastal Command aircraft.Bad weather had again interfered with air operations. 7,500sorties had been flown and 1,860 tons of bombs had been dropped.Targets included an oil refinery in Austria and enemy communica-tions behind the line.Super-Fortresses had attacked Singapore naval base and haddamaged the floating dock.; Super-Fortresses had dropped 172 tons of bombs on Tokyo onthe 27th January.There had been no shipping losses from enemy action duringthe previous week. The total shipping losses from enemy action for January now amounted to 74,619 tons.There had been a temporary lull in U-boat activity duringthe week.Aircraft operating from escort carriers Mairana and Campaniahad carried out an attack on enemy shipping off the norwegian coast on the night of the 28th/29th January. Two merchant vessels of 1,500 tons and one of 2,500 tons had been hit.Aircraft from four Fleet carriers operating off Sumatra had carried out a further attack on oil refineries at Palembang on the29th January., Photographs showed direct hits on many of theprincipal installations, some of which had afterwards been burnt byoil fires from adjacent oil refineries. Eight Japanese planes hadbeen shot down by the escort and 4 destroyed on the ground. SevenJapanese aircraft got through to the Fleet and 6 of these had been shot down. Fifteen of. our aircraft were missing, but 8 of the crewshad been saved. None of our ships had sustained damage from enemy action and our casualties had been light.During recent patrols in the Malacca Straits the submarinesStygian and Thrasher had sunk 16 junks and 1 tanker.In the south, successful attacks had been made towards Colmarand Mulhouse. These two separate thrusts had now succeeded injoining hands, and it was probable that the enemy was withdrawingin this area. In the Haguenau district the enemy had gone on tothe defensive. In the Ardennes the Germans had retired to the siegfried defences whilst fighting strong rearguard actions. It was probable that they would now endeavour to make a stand onthis line.A thaw had set in on the 31st January. The muddy conditionsincreased German resistance and a strained administrative situation had slowed down the Russian advance. In the north, Konigsbergwas now invested from north, east and south and the area held bythe Germans had been appreciably reduced. East Prussia wasisolated and strong enemy efforts to break out to the west had been repulsed. Marshal Zhukov had reached the middle Oder at anumber of places between a point 15 miles east of Kustrin andGlogau. He was within 9 miles of Frankfurt and had alsoadvanced the north-west flank of his salient. Posen continued tooffer stubborn resistance. There had been very little news from thefront south-west of Cracow. German reports suggested that therehad been exceptionally heavy fighting on the Oder between Glogau-3] b 2
and Ratibor, but the Russians did not claim to have crossed the riverin this sector. The Russians had made some slight progress in the difficult mountain country of Slovakia. mThe following had been the maximum advance in miles of theRussian Generals commanding the different sectors during the first two weeks and the third week since the offensive began : - first two Weeks.

On the island of Luzon the United States forces had made two more landings, the first on the west coast and the second south ofManila. Both had been unopposed. According to a press report,Manila had been entered from the east. On the left flank Roserlohad been captured after heavy fighting.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Recent Losses 2.

The War Cabinet-Took note &quot;of the statement by the Home Secretary and, Minister of Home Security.TransportSituation inFrance.-4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 75), to which was attached a Note on the Transport Situation in France by the french minister of Labour and Social Security. The Note urged that theassistance being given by the Allied military authorities was completely inadequate in view of the extremely critical situation of the French railways, and that it would be necessary, in the viewof the French Government, for the Allies to make a greater effort to bring to France trucks and, above all, locomotives. A certainnumber of tugs for inland navigation should also be madeavailable, and the barges and tugs at present used on the Seine formilitary transport released.The Minister of State said that it was of the greatest importance in the view of the Foreign Office that we should spareno effort to help the French in this matter. Unless the transportposition could be improved at a very early date, there was no hopeof any long-term political improvement. He had spoken toM. Massigli and explained that our main difficulty was with theUnited States Chiefs of Staff. ,
The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of War Transport,said a special Mission sent to Paris by the Ministry of war transport had now returned after discussions with- the FrenchMinistry of; Labour and with S.H.A.E.F. He agreed as to the vitalimportance of helping the French over internal transport. not much more could be done directly over locomotives. Seven hundredwere under order from the United States in the second half of theyear, and we were sending 950 from here to S.H.A.E.F. We had also put into service some 30 to 60 English locomotives stored atDieppe. These, and the locomotives sent to S.H.A.E.F., should set free an equivalent number of French locomotives. The wagonposition was more urgent still. Repairs to 80,000 wagons out ofaction were called for. We could probably best help in this respectby the provision of machine tools, though there might be some that could only be got from our own railway workshops. As regardswaterways, tugs were the bottleneck, and the Ministry of War -Transport mission thought that the French had more barges at their disposal than they could use with the tugs available. We had been trying to assist the French to obtain bridging material, while thegreatest assistance of all could be given by the provision ofreconditioned or unreconditioned second-hand lorries.The general sense of the War Cabinet was that it was of greatimportance to help the French to re-establish their transport arrangements. In discussion, the following suggestions weremade : (a) Civil Defence and National Fire Service organisations inthis country might be combed for old vehicles, which would perhaps be transported to France in tank-landing craft and so spareshipping.(b) The possibility of releasing some of the bridging material,maintained in this country as a reserve in connection with the blitz,which would not be of operational value, might be considered ifS.H.A.E.F. would allocate transport to get it over.(c) The possibility of sparing machine tools and spare toolsshould be investigated.(d) Would it be possible to divert some of the lorries which wehave been building for the Turks to France ?The following points were made in discussion: -(i) The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after conversation withthe French Minister of Finance, felt that the chance of a satisfac-tory financial and monetary agreement with France, which was sodesirable from our point of view, would depend very largely on animprovement in the supply situation, since concessions, which weshould be anxious to secure from the French, could be made accept-able to French public opinion only if the negotiators could give theimpression that they had improved a desperate transport position.(ii) Assistance of this nature to the French should not beregarded as charity to the destitute, but rather as an insurance against the development of a situation that might at any momentbecome of great military importance.(iii) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the greater theimprovement in internal transport, the greater the increase in french coal production, with all its advantages to the internalposition in France. ...(iv) The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that many of the suggestions made were new to the Chiefs of Staff andmight have serious military implications. He suggested that theCivil Departments concerned should say what, in their judgment,was desirable with a view to examination of their proposals by theChiefs of Staff and the submission of a combined report to theCabinet. *After further discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Took note of W.P. (45) 75 and of the suggestions that hadbeen made at&quot; X &quot; above for easing the transportsituation in France.
(2) Invited the Minister of Production, the Minister of war transport and the Minister of State to formulatesuggestions as a matter of urgency in the light of thediscussion for examination by the Chiefs of Staff witha view to a combined report being submitted to the WarCabinet.Food Situation 5.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thein Belgium Minister of Food (W.P. (45) 73), to which was attached a report by.and the Sir Jack Drummond on food conditions in Belgium and theNetherlands.      Netherlands.(Previous In Belgium the town populations appeared to be in better shapeReference:        than in October, but the very serious rise in unemployment figuresW.M. (44) 171st   meant that the poorer families, as compared with the pre-liberationConclusions,      period, were no longer able to purchase food in the black market.Minute 3.)       In Sir Jack Drummond&apos;s view, the economic crisis that was rapidlyapproaching in Belgium would be  associated with a serious deterioration in the food situation as it affects the poorer people,even if the official ration scale was maintained or improved.In the Netherlands the food situation in the towns in the liberated areas was considerably improved since November and earlyDecember and the available supplies were being handled in anadmirable manner. Health appeared to be reasonably good. Inthe occupied Netherlands there did not appear to be difficulties about food supplies in the North-Eastern provinces, which were largely agricultural and where there are few towns of any size; butthe position in the West and North-West was critical. We were,in Sir Jack Drummond&apos;s view, faced by a position in which it was quite impossible for the Germans to bring in sufficient food to feedthe populations of the large towns in the West and North-Westreasonably well, even if they wished to do it, and an extremely serious situation might be expected when this area was liberated.If the position of these people was not alleviated materially andsoon, many thousands would die directly or indirectly of starvation.I. Holland.The Minister of Food said that the situation in the West and north-West of occupied Holland, as described in paragraphs and 10 of Sir Jack Drummond&apos;s Report, emphasised the need for planning ahead. Certain provision had already been made for these areas by 21 Army Group. But, failing early relief, it would benecessary to arrange for supplies&apos;of pre-digested proteins, glucoseand similar foods which could be easily assimilated by a starvingpopulation. A conference at Brussels bad been suggested and theMedical Research Council were prepared to assist in this. while a small quantity of medicated foods\of the types he had mentionedwere available, they would not he nearly sufficient for &quot;a populationso large as was affected, and replanning in consultation with thoseable to advise technically would be called for.After discussion, the War Cabinet Invited the Minister of Food to arrange, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for War, to take up with21 Army Group and S.H.A.E.F. the question of thereplanning and provision of supplies for West and North-West occupied Holland in the light of the discussion.II. Belgium.The following points were made in discussion : (i) Might we not be extending the military period too long?Would there not be- advantage in putting more direct responsibility on the Belgian Government and giving it a little more elbow-room,perhaps West of a particular line ? A great strain was in presentcircumstances falling on the military administration. If more ofthis burden fell directly on the Belgian Government, that Govern-ment might make a better showing than at present.
OccupiedHolland.Food Supplies.Publication of west IndiaRoyalCommissionReport.(PreviousEeferep.ee:W.M.(40)27thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Minister of State said that in December last it hadbeen agreed that 5,000 tons of foodstuffs should be imported intoHolland from Sweden through the blockade, on the understandingthat.no further consignment would be approved until we saw how the first consignment had been distributed. Of the 5,000 tons inquestion, some 3,000 had now arrived and 2,000 were still to come.The Swedes had now asked to be allowed to send in a further4,000 tons. He enquired whether, in view of the situation disclosedby Sir Jack Drummond&apos;s Report circulated as W.P. (45) 73, theWar Cabinet would agree, subject to consultation with the Ministerof Economic Warfare, and to the Chiefs of Staff confirming thatthere was no operational objection, that we should accept thisproposal, without waiting for confirmation as to the distributionarrangements in respect of the first consignment.After discussion, the War Cabinet -Approved the proposal of the Minister of State, subject tothe concurrence of the Minister of Economic Warfare andto the Chiefs of Staff being satisfied that no operationalobjection existed, and invited him to arrange accordingly.7. At their meeting on the 30th January, 1940, the WarCabinet decided to withhold approval to the publication of theReport of the Royal Commission on the West Indies, since therewas a danger that some Of the criticisms which it contained ofBritish administration in the West Indies could be used by german propaganda, especially in the United States, with serious damage to our war effort.They now had before them a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies (W.P. (45) 66) recommending (in agree-ment with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister of Information) that the Report be published early thisyear, and expressing the view that under the very different conditions obtaining to-day there was no reason to suppose thatcriticism would be more damaging if the report were published now than it would be at a later date; rather, indeed, the contrary. Ifpublication was approved a White Paper setting out the steps takento carry out the Commission^ recommendations would be publishedsimultaneously, and the Report of the Comptroller for Development(ii) It was pointed out, on the other hand, that, even acceptingthat there might be arguments for an earlier termination of themilitary period, inclusion in the military programme afforded thebest present chance of getting foodstuffs quickly into Belgium.(iii) It was suggested that requisitioning by S.H.A.E.F. hadbeen on too large a scale. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinet, however, that certain of the instances to which attention had been drawn had proved to be exaggerated.(iv) The Minister of State&apos;s recent discussions in. Washingtonhad resulted in the provision of some shipping to carry supplies,but the general calorie level was still low, and a breakdown in belgium would have serious repercussions here as well as in Belgium.(v) A situation was developing which might endanger thesuccessful conduct of operations. We ought not to be put in aposition of primary responsibility, seeing that the United States have at least an equal responsibility and an equal concern in maintainingstable economic and political conditions in countries from which their forces are operating.   The War Cabinet should in these cir-: ^,, j cumstances invite the Prime Minister to consider broaching thematter with the President during the meeting of the Heads of governments.After further discussion, the War Cabinet Invited the Deputy Prime Minister to communicate withthe Prime Minister on their behalf on the lines suggested at. &quot;X.&quot;
and Welfare in the West Indies for 1942/44 would be publishedearly this year^ and would be cast in such a form as to cover theRoyal Commission^ recommendations without referring in terms to them.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said, he had little to add to his paper. He doubted if any harm could at this stage comefrom publication. He was under some pressure to publish in theHouse of Commons, while non-publication was causing considerabledifficulty in the West Indies, since it was holding up action onvaluable recommendations made in the Report. The Report was walready in print, so no appreciable extra consumption of paper or use of labour would be involved.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for theColonies as set out in paragraph 4 of W.P. (45) 66, and invited him to proceed accordingly.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,5th February, 1945.
