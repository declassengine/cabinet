The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious five days.Bomber Command had flown 3,250 sorties and dropped9,100 tons of bombs. Their targets had included Dessau, Cassel andan oil refinery at Harburg.United States bombers had flown 4,780 sorties and dropped12,800 tons of bombs.. The Tactical Air Force had flown 8,600 sorties and dropped3,600 tons of bombs.Total Allied losses for the week had been 53 bombers,43 aircraft by the Tactical Air Force and 6 Coastal command aircraft.In the Mediterranean 11,000 sorties had been flown and,500 tons of bombs dropped for the loss of 66 aircraft. successful attacks had been made on railway communications in Austria,Hungary and Yugoslavia. Many rail cuts had been made on the brenner route and in the Pp valley.Super-Fortresses had dropped 437 tons of bombs on Tokyo.This total excluded the heavy attack made on the previous day,when 1,100 tons of incendiaries had been dropped on the city.Confirmed shipping losses for the period, due to enemy action,had been 5,725 tons. The confirmed shipping losses for March now amounted to 20,641 tons.A merchant ship had been torpedoed off Beachy Head and atrawler off the east coast of Scotland. One U-boat had been sunk by aircraft off the Scillies and two other U-boats had probably been sunk in St. George&apos;s Channel and off Beachy Head. there appeared to have been no great change in the number of U-boatsoperating in our coastal waters.There had been considerable activity by midget U-boats,particularly off the Scheldt approaches. Three had been sunk, one had been captured intact and 4 had been beached and abandoned.On the 9th March a small enemy force, consisting of about100 men in landing craft, had carried out a raid on Granville onthe west coast of the Cherbourg Peninsula. Damage had been caused to harbour installations and to coasters in the harbour.HM. Submarine Thorough had recently returned from patroloff the Burma coast, during which she sank or destroyed 2 T.L.Cs.,2 junks and 16 native craft.The enemy bridgehead at Wesel had now been eliminated; and allied troops were holding the west bank pf the Rhine fromNijmegen to the junction with the Moselle. Rapid progress hadbeen made during the week by the United States 1st and 3rd Armiesoperating south of Cologne. A bridgehead on the east bank of the rhine had been established at Remagen; and substantial german forces had been cut off north of the Moselle. The enemy would behard put to it to find sufficient troops to hold the Moselle, defend the Remagen bridgehead and meet possible Allied threats further north.The total number of prisoners known to have been taken sincethe beginning of this drive to the Rhine was about 98,000; andmany had still to be counted. Total Allied casualties had been36,000.The Russians continued to advance in the north, had capturedLeba and were exerting considerable pressure on Danzig andStettin. There had been rumours of German counter-attacks north of Budapest, but no confirmation had been received from Russiansources.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.(previous reference:W.M.(45)26thConclusions,Minute 4.)Disclosure ofScientificInformation.proposed visit ofFrench AirMission.Relief forOccupiedFrenchTerritory.3. The Home Secretary and Minister of &apos;Home security informed the War Cabinet that during the previous week therehad been 68 incidents from long-range rockets. Of these, 41 had occurred in London, 18 in Essex, 3 in Kent, 2 in Hertfordshire,1 in Norfolk and 3 in the sea. Casualties had &quot;been 304 killed,552 seriously injured and 1,060 slightly injured.These figures represented an average of 11-3 rockets a day,the highest rate of fire yet attained, and the percentage falling inLondon was also above the average.Of 10 flying bombs launched during the period, 5 had crossed the coast but none had reached London. Casualties had been3 seriously injured and 5 slightly injured.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Production and the Paymaster-General (W.P. (45) 153)asking for guidance on the extent to which scientific and technical information should be disclosed to members of a Mission which theFrench were anxious to send to this country and to the United states to survey the field of aircraft production and development.Decisions on this question were held over for a meeting at whichthe Prime Minister could be present, but the War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion for the purpose of ascertaining the viewsof the Chiefs of Staff.The Chief of the Air Staff said that, in the telegram to theJoint Staff Mission at Washington, reproduced in the Annex toW.P. (45) 153, the Chiefs of Staff had given a broad indication of the types of information which should in their view be disclosed to, or withheld from, this French Mission. They thought it likely that the United States authorities would be disposed to go further than we ourselves would wish to go in the direction of full dis-closure to the French; and for this reason they thought it essentialthat a firm agreement oh.what could and what could not be disclosed should be reached with the United States Chiefs of Staffbefore any discussions with the French Mission began. It shouldbe&apos; borne in mind from the outset that any information given to thisFrench Mission would have to be disclosed, on demand, to theRussians; and it was important that this point should be broughtclearly to the notice of the United States authorities.The War Cabinet Took note of the views expressed on behalf of the Chiefs ofStaff.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of State (W.P. (45) 149) reporting that the german authorities had agreed that supplies might be sent to the civil popu-lation of La Rochelle, Oleron and Re by a Red Cross ship.S.H.A.E.F. had agreed that relief supplies should be sent to these areas; and, on the understanding that the International Red Crossassumed responsibility for distribution, no objection had been raisedby the interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Supplies by sea would involve a technical breach of theblockade; but supplies sent to these places could not benefit theGerman economy as a whole, and food had already been going tothem by land. In these circumstances it was recommended that,once the French had made their arrangements with the Inter-national Red Cross, we should agree in principle to grant a safe-conduct for all future voyages of the ship to be employed for thispurpose.The War Cabinet-Approved the recommendation made in W.P. (45) 149.
i7iW;M. 28 (45).ThirdSession ofthe Council of u.N.R.R.A.(previous reference:W.M.(44)142ndConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of State (W.P. (45) 133) reporting that theDirector-General of U.N.R.R.A. had asked whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would agree that the next meeting of his Council shouldbe held in London.The Minister of State said that by the terms of the U.N.R.R.A.agreement a meeting of the Council would have to be held in May orJune of this year; that it was expedient that this meeting shouldbe held in Europe; and that since difficulties of transport and accom-modation made it impossible to* meet in France, as had originally been hoped, he was in favour of holding the meeting in London.It was unlikely now that the meeting could take place before June.The War Cabinet were informed that there would be difficultiesin finding accommodation and staff for such a meeting in London;but it was agreed that every effort should be made to overcome these difficulties.The War Cabinet- .Authorised the Minister of State to suggest, as proposed in w.P.(45) 133, that the next meeting of the Council of u.N.R.R.A. should be held in London in June, 1945.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,12th March, 1945.
