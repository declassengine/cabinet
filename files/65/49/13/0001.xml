Prisoners ofWar andCiviliansLiberated bythe soviet forces and bythe allied forces in north-western and SouthernEurope.1. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 68) which statedthat the Soviet Government, whilst prepared to conclude a reciprocalagreement to cover prisoners of war liberated in the pre-surrenderperiod on lines which we had proposed, considered that it should beextended to all liberated Soviet and British subjects.The Soviet Government had communicated to His Majesty&apos;charge d&apos;Affaires at Moscow a draft of such a wider agreement,which seemed to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to be generally acceptable, with the possible exception of Article V- whichread as follows : &quot; Ex-prisoners of war (with the exception of officers) and civilians of each of the parties may, until their repatriation,be employed on work in furtherance of the common war efforf-.in accordance with agreements to be reached between thecompetent Soviet and British authorities. The question of payment and conditions of work shall be determined by agree-ment between those authorities.&quot;If we agreed that our ex-prisoners of war should, pending theirrepatriation, be made to work for the Russians in Russia, there might, in certain circumstances, be public criticism. We had,however, already laid down, in our proposals in regard to Sovietnationals in the United Kingdom, the principle that liberated Sovietnationals might be put to work in this country, and the SovietGovernment would certainly insist on strict reciprocity. In thesecircumstances it seemed best to concentrate upon protecting our menfrom abuses by ensuring that the conditions of work were tolerableand upon taking all practical steps to bring about their repatriationwith the least possible delay.The Minister of State said that the conditions of work for Sovietnationals in the United Kingdom were approved by the soviet military Mission, and suggested that it should be laid down that theconditions of work for British subjects in the Soviet Union shouldbe approved by the British Military Mission in Moscow.The following points were made : (a) If we t?ere to accept Article V of the Soviet draft the result might be to delay the repatriation of British subjects, includingex-prisoners of war, and their removal to Russia for the purpose ofbeing put to work there. That would lead to considerable public criticism.(&amp;) It was explained, on the other hand, that while Article Vof the draft agreement was open to objection, the remaining articlesof the agreement were so framed as to protect the position of theex-prisoners of war. In particular, there was provision that each party should use all means at its disposal to ensure the quickestpossible repatriation of nationals of the other party. There wasprovision further for Soviet and British repatriation representa-tives to enter the concentration camps where their citizens werelocated; while the internal administration and the removal of camps,as well as transfer from one camp to another of liberated prisoners,would be the subject of agreement.After discussion, the general view of the War Cabinet was thatthe Soviet draft should be accepted, subject to provisions to ensure (i) That British ex-prisoners of war liberated by the russians would, on release, automatically resume their status as members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces under the command ofBritish officers, and to the extent that pending repatria-tion they might be employed on work for the war effort,would be so employed only on that basis and in theenvirons of the camps where they were situated,(ii) That arrangements would be made in the case of Stalagswhere there were no officer prisoners for the despatch ofofficers to take command of the prisoners of war onliberation.[29426-2] b2;X&quot;
(iii) That the repatriation at the earliest possible moment ofall British subjects liberated by the russians would be&apos;X&quot; I the sole consideration to be taken into account in decidingtheir subsequent movements, and they should not be moved, e.g., to suit labour requirements.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theDominion Governments had not as yet been consulted on this matterand that, as a considerable number of Dominion prisoners of war might be involved, it would be necessary to obtain their views before any reply was returned to the Soviet Government.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (after discussion as might be necessary with the Secretary of:.&apos; State for War and the Minister of State) to consult theDominion Governments as a matter of urgency,informing them of the general view of the War cabinet as recorded at &quot; X &quot; above, and requesting their observa-tions by the end of the week.(2) Invited the Minister of State to inform the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs of the general view of the WarCabinet, but to ask that he should take no action untilthe views of the Dominion Governments had beenreceived.Parliament.Productionof theParliamentaryRegister.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 148thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The War Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security, and the Secretary of State for Scotland (W.P.(45) 62), describing certain difficulties which had arisen in theproduction of the Parliamentary Register which, in accordance withthe decision taken by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the8th November, 1944, and with the terms of the Representation ofthe People Bill at present before Parliament, had to be published on the 7th May, 1945.The memorandum explained the importance of completing the electoral register by the date approved &apos;by the War Cabinet and thedifficulties, technical and other, that had arisen in connection withthe provision of the requisite man-power for it. As matters stoodthere was a grave risk that printing work covering the registration of some 15 million electors might not be carried out in time owing to shortage of labour. The Newspaper Proprietors Association andthe Newspaper Society had offered assistance, but even if the newspaper resources were used to the full the Ministers were satisfied that the necessary labour for the production of a Registeron the 7th May would not be forthcoming under the present arrange-ments. They accordingly proposed : (i) that the Ministry of Labour and National Service shouldhave specific War Cabinet authority to overrideforthwith any objections by the controlling departments to the temporary release of printing operatives atpresent engaged on work for those departments;(ii) that the Ministry of Labour and National Service shouldbe empowered to direct ex-printing operatives to take upwork in areas other than the areas where they workedprior to being engaged on war work, where the necessarysupply of labour could not be made available by other means;(iii) that the War Cabinet should instruct the Service Depart-ments to give sympathetic consideration to applicationsfor the release, temporarily, of printing operatives whowere members of the Forces stationed in this country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the view of the stationery Office was that, unless drastic measures on the lines ofthose proposed in W.P. (45) 62 were taken, a breakdown in the
arrangements for the production of the Register by the 7th May was inevitable.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatsuch a breakdown would be a very serious matter. The printingindustry were doing their best; and the Ministry of Labour and national Service were making every effort, within the framework of the present voluntary scheme, - to obtain the additional labour required. It was, however, clear that more drastic measures were required if the situation was to be met.- The Minister of Labour and National Service said that manyof the operatives nominated by the printing industry were engaged on vital war work. The course proposed in (i) above would to- that extent conflict with the policy that had been laid down by the WarCabinet as regards man-power. It did not seem to him to be possibleto lay down that all these men should be released, however essentialthe work which they were at present doing, and he would certainly not wish to take this responsibility.Points raised in discussion were :- (a) The Stationery Office were already, taking steps to ensurethat the printing of the Register was given priority over privateprinting and non-essential Government printing. It was not,however, within their competence to allot priorities as between different forms of essential Government printing. Moreover,electoral printing was specialised work which could only be under-taken by a limited number of printing firms.(b) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, if the presentvoluntary arrangements were inadequate, he would be prepared, sofar as the Admiralty were concerned, to agree that ex-printingoperatives should be released from all Admiralty work other thanthat included in Lists A and B, i.e., really vital work.(c) The Minister of Production said that, subject to theapproval of the War Cabinet, he would be prepared to put electoralprinting for the time being on the designated list. This step was,however, unlikely to lead to substantial results, unless labour otherthan ex-printing operatives nominated by the industry -would be suitable for the work.(d) The Service Ministers said that they would give sympathetic consideration to applications for the temporary release of ex-printing operatives who were members of the Forces stationed inthis country. It was probable, however, that the number involvedwas very small, and in certain cases their release might not bepossible.(e) If it&apos;proved impossible to produce the Register by the7th May, it might, in the last resort, be necessary to consider anamending Bill to the Representation of the People Act if it hadbeen passed. Every effort should, however, be made to avoid suchan eventuality; and in any case it would be necessary, before suchan amending Bill could be presented, to know the date by which theRegister could, in fact, be produced.The War Cabinet-.(1) Recorded the view that every effort should be made toproduce the Parliamentary Register by the 7th May,1945.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service andthe Minister of Production ^to consider as a matter of urgency, in consultation with the Supply Ministers, what steps could best be taken to make available the additionalprinting labour required for this purpose. In thisconnection, the Minister of Production was authorised,if necessary, to place electoral printing on the designated list.
Local 3.   The Minister of Reconstruction recalled that, in accordanceGovernment.    with the decision of the War Cabinet at their meeting on the(Previous       20th December, 1944, the White Paper (Cmd. 6579) on LocalReference:      Government in England and Wales during the Period of Recon-W.M. (44) 172nd struction had included a passage to the effect that the proposalsConclusions,    contained therein were not to be regarded as decisions, but were minute 3.)      made public in the hope that it would be possible, in the light ofthe discussion of them both. in Parliament and elsewhere, tointroduce early legislation which would be largely agreed.    Hesuggested, in agreement with the Minister of Health, that time should be found for a one-day debate on the White Paper during february; and that, at the appropriate time, the Minister of health should put down a Motion in the following terms: -&quot; That this House welcomes the intention of the Govern-ment to preserve the existing framework of the county and county borough system of local government and the proposalsfor the establishment of a Local Government boundary commission outlined in the White Paper presented toParliament.&quot;The War Cabinet-Approved this proposal.Coal.distribution in London.(previous reference:WM. (45) 12thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Minister of Fuel and Power informed the War Cabinetthat there had been a very great improvement in the distributionof coal in London, thanks partly to the clearance of the roads dueto the improvement in the weather. Outside London the transportposition, especially in the North-East, was still very bad and this might be reflected in short deliveries the following week. The coaloutput in the previous week had amounted to 3,275,000 tons, which,given the weather conditions, was remarkably good.The War Cabinet-Took note with satisfaction of the statement by theMinister of Fuel and Power.Negotiationswith Sweden.5.   The War Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministryof Economic Warfare (W.P. &quot; (45) 67), asking for authority to include in the Anglo-United States-SwedishWar Trade Agreement, now under negotiation, anundertaking either-(a) that we and the Americans would make 3^ million tons of coal available to Sweden during the first12 months after the end of hostilities in Europe, or(6) that we and the Americans would use our best endeavours up to the limits imposed by the supply position to see that goods were made availableto Sweden in quantities sufficient to maintain hereconomy on a reasonable basis. This would constitute a general assurance regarding coal supplies. At the same time we ourselves should give the Swedes informally a more definite com-commitment that we would see to it that they obtain from some source a minimum of 1 million tonsof coal during the first 12 months after the end ofEuropean hostilities.(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power(W.P. (45) 72) explaining the reasons for his inability to agree, so far as coal was concerned, to either of the alternatives proposed in W.P. (45) 67.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Economic Warfare,briefly explained the proposals put forward in his paper. It wouldbe difficult to obtain all our requirements from the Swedes unless
we could promise either a certain volume of United kingdom exports or a minimum ration of coal in the first twelve months afterthe end of the war in Europe. As regards the first alternativetherein referred to, the Department of Overseas Trade could not guarantee any final figure of United Kingdom exports. As regardsthe second, the coal, if it came from anywhere, would have to comefrom Germany.and not from the United Kingdom. If we could give the undertaking proposed we could hope to secure all ourdesiderata from the Swedes.The Minister of Fuel and Power felt bound to object to any-hypothecation of coal supplies, while the disposal of coal after thewar fell to be settled in consultation with France, the United Statesand the U.S.S.R.   - &apos;The following points were made in discussion : -(a) The case of Sweden could not be dealt with in isolationfrom that of other countries. There were objections, therefore, toany specific assurances to them because of the reaction on other cases. .&apos;(6) Now that we were committed to the establishment of a european coal organisation, it would be difficult to enter into anyparticular arrangement with an individual country, or to give itany priority before that organisation was established.(c) Nearly one-half of Swedish exports went to Germany in1943, and Sweden would be anxious to maintain her export trade.Her own internal position would bring great pressure to bear uponthe Swedish Government-and there was no reason why we should give them undertakings to which in any event there were other objections. -After further discussion the Deputy Prime Minister said thatthe general sense of the War Cabinet was that we should not go inthis matter beyond an assurance in general terms that we would do our best to send goods to Sweden, an assurance which it wouldbe our concern to implement.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Economic Warfareasked whether, in these circumstances &apos;(i) there would be objection to explaining confidentially to the swedes the proposals for a European coal organisation:(ii) we could undertake to sponsor a proposal from them before. the Organisation for getting a ration of coal, subject tosupply considerations, of the magnitude mentioned in w.P. (45) 67.After discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Swedes might be informed confidentially ofthe position as regards the proposed European coalorganisation.(2) Agreed that it would not be possible to give any under-taking to sponsor a proposal from them for a particularration.A discussion followed on the question whether the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare should be authorised to conclude the new war trade Agreement.  The following points were made :-(d) The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of economic warfare, said that the War Trade Agreement was of considerable importance to Sweden, since it was under it that they derived their basic rations from the Combined Boards. We, on the other hand,stood to gain an embargo on all exports to Japan, control of certaintraffic by courier bags, and the implementation by the Swedes of the bretton Woods resolution about loot. Apart from this the UnitedStates Government attached importance to the conclusion of anagreement, and it would be difficult in these circumstances to drop the negotiations.(e) The effect of the War Trade Agreement would be topulverise Swedish trade and make them dependent on trade withthis country.   It was therefore to our interest to conclude it.
Relief for the 6.   The  War  Cabinet  had  before   them  a memorandumChannel (W.P. (45) 71) in which the Home Secretary and Minister of HomeIslands. Security recommended that the following- supplies should be(Previous       despatched to the Channel Islands : Reference: (a) 3,000 tons of gas coal and 200 tons of coke monthly;W.M. (44) 164th       (ft) a single consignment of footwear and clothing, especiallyConclusions, for agricultural workers;Minute 4.) (c) 60,000 candles, boxes of matches and flints for lighters.(d) 1,400 litres of petrol for hospital ambulances and doctors&apos;cars.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had recentlyundertaken to the Prime Minister that no further commitments forthe export of coal from this country would be made for the present.We were already committed to supply 1-9 million tons of coal(including 110,000 tons of gas coal) to S.H.A.E.F. during the period up to the 30th April, 1945. Provided that the necessary arrange-ments could be made with S.H.A.E.F., he was prepared to do his best to provide 3,000 tons of gas coal for the Channel Islands. Whetheror not he could do so would, however, depend on the precise effects on coal supplies of the recent bad weather, which would not be known for about a week. He enquired whether kerosene would beof value to the islanders. The Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security undertook to look into this point.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of War Transport, saidthat the necessary arrangements could be made, though not without difficulty. The ship would have to be based on Lisbon, with theresult that two trips covering 38 days would be necessary to convey the figure of 3,000 tons that had been mentioned. The possibility of delay over securing German consent to the despatch of the ship couldnot be overlooked.After further discussion, the War Cabinet (1) Agreed that the items, other than coal, recommended by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security, shouldbe supplied to the Channel Islands.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to do his best toreach an arrangement with S.H.A.E.F. under which a first instalment of 3,000 tons of coal should be shippedto the Channel Islands as a matter of urgency.Offices of the War Cabinet, S. W. 1,31st January, 1945.(/) It was argued, on the other hand, that, given the turn in. thewar situation, the Swedish position was much-weaker than before.It was, in any event, of extreme importance to them to secure their basic ration from the Combined Boards. It should not be impossibleto make the necessary explanations to the United &quot;States, and thecase, in the circumstances, for postponing the signature of the &quot;war trade Agreement as long as possible was strong. -After further discussion, the Deputy Prime Minister said thatthe general sense of the War Cabinet was that we should delay aslong as possible the signature of the War Trade Agreement. If andwhen further delay proved impossible, we should sign it, but weshould not go beyond a general assurance to the Swedes on the lines set out in the first sentence of paragraph 5 (&amp;) of WP. (45) 67,coupled with a confidential explanation of the position as regardsthe European coal organisation and a statement that we would do our best for them.The War Cabinet-(3) Approved the course of action proposed by the deputy prime Minister at &quot; X &quot; and invited the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Economic Warfare, to proceed accordingly. -
