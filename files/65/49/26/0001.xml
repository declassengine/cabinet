The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious eight days.   .i Bomber Command had flown 6,150 sorties and dropped.16,240 tons of bombs. Their main targets had been oil plants.The Dortmund-Ems Canal had been cut for the fourth time.Mosquitoes had dropped 820 tons in eight attacks on Berlin.United States bombers had flown 8,600 sorties and dropped18,000 tons of bombs. Their-main targets had been railway com-munications, including the railway stations at Berlin and Leipzig.The Tactical Air Force had flown 26,000 sorties and dropped10,000 tons of bombs on communications and enemy troops.Total Allied losses for the week had been 120 bombers,123 fighters and 4 Coastal Command aircraft.Attacks on long-range rocket and flying-bomb sites had increased and a number of railway and road targets in the area had also been attacked.14,000 sorties had been flown and 11,000 tons of bombs dropped.Targets had included oil plants and railways in Southern Germanyand Austria. The Brenner route had been heavily attacked. Alliedlosses had been 104 aircraft, including 58 bombers, as against13 enemy aircraft.Super Fortresses had attacked Singapore and dropped 540 tonsof bombs on Tokyo.Confirmed shipping losses for the period, due to enemy action,had been 36,072 tons. The confirmed losses for February now amounted to 94,143 tons.There had been considerable U-boat activity in St. George&apos;s channel and off Cornwall, a number of ships having been sunk inthese areas. It was thought that a fairly large number of U-boats were outward bound from Norway and an increase in-enemy effort in home waters must be expected.Three U-boats had been sunk and three probably sunk during february.There had been considerable E-boat activity in the North sea on the night of the 28th February/1st March. One E-boat hadbeen sunk by patrol and prisoners taken.A raiding force of about 500 strong, supported by H.M.S.Liddesdale and R.A.F; Beaufighters, had captured Piscopi Islandnear Rhodes.H.M. Submarine Statesman had returned from a patrol in theMalacca Strait during which she had attacked two coastal convoys and sunk or severely damaged all nine ships in them.During the attacks by carrier-borne aircraft on Tokyo on the25th February it was claimed that 47 enemy aircraft had been shot down and 111 destroyed on the ground. Photographs showed thata large area of the city had been devastated.United States carrier forces had attacked Loochoo Islands. Anumber of small enemy vessels had been sunk or damaged and49 aircraft destroyed on the ground.In the north the attack by General Crerar&apos;s Army had attractedseveral German formations and had thus facilitated the task ofthe United States 9th. Army, who had made good progress north-east of the main road from Aachen to Krefeld. Further southUnited States forces were now in Cologne and were closing in onthe Rhine between Cologne and dusseldorf. Within the nextfew days Allied troops would probably have reached the Rhine fromNijmegen to Cologne. Further south the United States 3rd army had captured Trier and was making good progress.Casualties up to the 3rd March had been as follows: British     ............      ...      7,781Canadian ...      ... ...      3,024Total    ...United States 9th Army .United States 1st ArmyTotal    ...[29792-6]10,8055,4074,87910,286b 2
In the area of An, British forces had.thrust forward towardsKywegu. They had also crossed the Irrawaddy and had reachedMeiktila and were now working up towards Myingyan, south of Mandalay. Heavy casualties had been inflicted on the Japanese.The Chinese were making good progress towards Lashio.The island of Corregidor had been cleared. The Americansclaimed that during the operations in the Philippine Islands some55,000 Japanese had been killed.The Russians had made very good progress in the north andhad now cut off Danzig and were near to Stettin. They had statedthat, although the Germans were evacuating some troops by sea,there were still some 25 German divisions in Latvia, 25 inKonigsberg and 10 in the Danzig area. The Russians had lost some ground north of Budapest.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.The 1st 2.   The Prime Minister said that he was seriously concernedCanadian at the failure to present adequately to the public the extent of theArmy. contribution made by British arms to the victories on the Western(Previous       Front.   In spite of Field-Marshal Montgomery&apos;s undertaking toEeference:      make the facts known to war correspondents at the front, it was.M.(45)22nd still not generally recognised that the major part of general conclusions,    Crerar&apos;s Army consisted of British troops.  During his recent visitMinute 5.)      to France he had also raised with Field-Marshal Montgomery andGeneral Eisenhower the related question of disclosing the names of units engaged in the fighting. Neither had seen any objection toBritish divisions and regiments being named when once they had become engaged with the enemy. If a general impression was createdthat British units were doing very little fighting (an impressionquite contrary to the real state of affairs), this might well have serious results on the British contribution to the peace settlement.The Secretary of State for War said that afternoon he had stated, in answer to a Parliamentary Question, that the strength ofGeneral Crerar&apos;s Army was two-thirds British.There was general agreement with the suggestion that thePrime Minister might deal more fully with these points in an early statement in the House of Commons on the military situation.Burma.Pacific.Eussia.Germany. 3.   The Prime Minister said that he was considering the suggested possibility of issuing a warning to the German people (perhaps indeclaration conjunction with President Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin) about theto the effects of continued resistance.  This could make it clear that if theGerman Germans prolonged their resistance, particularly past the time of people. the spring sowing, they would increase the risk of widespreadfamine in Germany after their final surrender. In those circum-stances they could not rely on the Allies to feed those who, by their continued resistance, had brought famine upon themselves.Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.(previous reference:W.M.(45)25thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home security informed the War Cabinet that during the previous week there hadbeen 71 incidents from long-range rockets. Of these, 37 had been inLondon, 21 in Essex, 5 in Kent, 1 in Hertfordshire, 1 in Surreyand 6 in the sea. Casualties were : 104 killed, 346 seriously injuredand 1,011 slightly injured.During the same period there had been a resumption of flying-bomb attacks. Of 35 launched, 14 had crossed the coast and 8 had fallen in the London area. Casualties were : 7 killed, 21 seriously injured and 34 slightly injured. The evidence so .far availablesuggested that these flying-bombs were launched from land, and

This appeared to have been primarily an intruder opera-tion designed to intercept Allied bombers returning to base; butenemy aircraft which had not found their primary targets had made widespread attacks on civilian objectives. There had been 75separate incidents; but of these only 5 were caused by high explosive bombs, the remainder being due to machine gun and&apos; cannon fire, and a few anti-personnel and incendiary bombs.Civilian casualties had totalled 17 killed, 12 seriously injured and slightly injured.The War Cabinet-Took note Of this statement.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet of the latest developments in the Polish and roumanian situations. The discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet;Conclusions.PaymentsAgreementwith Sweden.(previous reference erence:W.M.(45.)21stConclusions,Minute 2.).(previous reference erence:W.M. (44) 171stConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Chancellor of the Escheqtier. informed the WarCabinet that he had concluded a payments agreement with Sweden.The firm line which the War Cabinet had authorised him to adopthad produced very satisfactory results. Under the agreement which the Swedes had now signed our gold liability had disappearedand the Swedes had agreed to hold sterling. They had expressedthe hope that they would receive increasing quantities of supplies from us in the ordinary course of trade. They had further agreedto help Norway by accepting some of the sterling which we had paidher for ships lost during the war to assist in the building of ships in sweden.As regards timber houses, the Swedish Government had pointedout that the numbers which they could supply would be limited: fortheir shortage of coal had resulted in an increased consumption of timber for fuel. They had advised that we should begin by orderinga limited number of houses, say a thousand, partly because of their supply difficulties and partly to accustom our labour to the special problems of erecting this type of house. The conclusion of thisagreement had, however, removed the financial obstacles to theimportation of these timber houses from Sweden.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the statement by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer.Family . 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the allowances.     War Cabinet that the Minister of Social Insurance and he had(Previous        received that day a deputation representing all political Parties,Eef erence:      which had pressed very strongly that the Family Allowances BillW.M.(45)18th  should be amended so as to provide that the allowances should conclusions,     &quot; belong &quot; to the mother.  There was reason to think that this claimMinute 9.) &apos;    would be widely supported in the forthcoming Debate in the Houseof Commons. The deputation had suggested that this was a questionwhich might properly be left for decision by a free vote of theHouse.[29792-6]b 3
In discussion the following points were made :-(a) The Reconstruction Committee had considered this question at length, and had decided that either parent should beable to cash the allowance. The White Paper had pro-ceeded on this basis; but the Committee had been advised that for purposes of legal title it was necessary to provide in the Bill that the allowance &quot; belonged &quot; either to thefather or to the mother. They had decided that the legaltitle should be with the father. In reaching this decisionthey had been influenced mainly by two considerations.First, under the general law, the father was responsiblefor the maintenance of the child; and there would begrave difficulties in reconciling with this general principle of the law a provision giving the mother thelegal title to this particular allowance. Secondly, the allowance was intended to supplement the family income, not to provide in full for the needs of the child.To give the legal title to the mother might imply a recognition that she was responsible for the child&apos;smaintenance, and might thus provide a demand for anincrease in the allowance sufficient to enable her to dis-charge that responsibility in full.(6) It was argued, on the other hand, that in practice the mother was normally responsible for the householdbudget and the welfare of the children, and that on this account she should have control of the allowance. Thegeneral sense of public opinion would be sympathetictowards giving the mother a right to the allowance.(c) The War Cabinet were informed that the Labour party were likely to move an amendment to substitute&quot;woman&quot; for &quot;man&quot; in the relevant Clause of theBill. It was generally agreed that it would be unfor-unfortunate if this question became an issue, between the two main political Parties.The general view of the War Cabinet was that on a matter ofthis kind, where public sentiment was so closely engaged, theGovernment should not insist on a particular solution in face ofany strong view expressed in Parliament. At the same time, theHouse should be clearly advised on the legal issues involved.The War Cabinet- .Agreed that in the Debate on the Second Reading of the family Allowances Bill the Government spokesman should announce that on this point the decision would be left toa free vote of the House, but that at the appropriate stage the Attorney-General would advise the House on the legalissues involved before the question was put to the vote.Relaxation ofLightingand GlareRestrictionsin the, london area.(previous reference:W.M.(45)3rd.Conclusions,Minute 6.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (45) 126) and a Memorandum by the Home secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (45) 139) on the relaxation of lighting and glare restrictions in the London area.The Chiefs of Staff advised that additional lighting restricted to gas-lit lamps in London itself would not materially assist theenemy in directing air-launched flying bombs on London. Asregards glare, selected relaxations which offered valuable industrialdividends were acceptable from the military point of view. they recommended, however, that in view of the complex issues involved the War Cabinet should set up an inter-departmental Committee towhich questions of relaxation of the black-out could be referred asthey arose for detailed examination and report; and further that,in view of the recent increased activity by German piloted aircraft,no actual increase in the amount of lighting permitted should forthe present take place without further reference to them.
159 W.M. 26 (45).The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security in his memorandum suggested that, as owing to man-power shortages fullstreet lighting could not be completely installed before the longersummer days or adequately maintained when installed, it would be preferable to look forward to its installation after the summerperiod if the Chiefs of Staff then agreed. He recommended thatlighting authorities should be asked to prepare for full lighting atthe end of the Double, British Summer Time period, namely, the15th July, though the assurance that it would be possible to make this relaxation then could only be provisional.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thatin face of the renewal of German air attack he questioned whetherit was reasonably safe oh security grounds to make a changeimmediately. Public opinion as a whole would not welcome it, andin any event it would take some weeks to do the necessary work, evenif the requisite material and labour could be fpund. In thesecircumstances he thought it would be sufficient if, as proposed inhis Memorandum, we prepared to make the change at the end of double Summer Time on the 15th July. If the war ended earlier,he would of course be ready to consider an earlier date.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Fuel and Power,said that his Minister was disturbed at the increased fuel con-sumption involved by these relaxations of street lighting, even if their introduction were postponed until July. His minister suggested that a final decision should be deferred until the WarCabinet had.considered the coal budget for next year.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security, as set out in paragraph 5 of w.P. (45) 139, and took note that he would confer withthe Minister of Fuel and Power before communicating with the local lighting authorities.112Supplies.for 9. The War Cabinet considered a Joint Memorandum by thethe Channel Home Secretary and the Minister of State (W.P.(45) 132) on SuppliesIslands. for the Channel Islands. This reported the views of the Delegates(Previous of the International Red Cross who had visited the Channel IslandsReference: at the end of December as to the minimum monthly needs of theW.M.(45)l3th Islands in food-stuffs, and sought the approval of the War cabinet conclusions, for the despatch of certain additional food-stuffs, fuel and mis-Minute 6.) ,  cellaneous supplies.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Fuel and Power,said that it was not the case (as might be implied by paragraph 5of WP. (45.) 132) that fuel at the rate of 3,000 tons of gas coalper month could be made available in addition to a single consign-ment of 200 tons of coke. His Ministry would make available asingle consignment of 3,000 tons of gas coal, in addition to the200 tons of coke; but they could not guarantee further supplies at that rate, though they would do their best to meet the continuingneeds of the Islands.The Prime Minister drew attention to the statement in para-graph 2 of WP. (45) 132 from which it appeared that the GermanCommander in the Islands was: proposing to neglect his obligations towards the civil population. Should it not be made clear to theCommander that if he persisted in his attitude he and any of hisofficers concerned would, be liable to. be added to the list of war criminals?The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals of the Home Secretary and theMinister of State as set out in W.P. (45) 132.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to consider thepoint noted at &quot; X &quot; above.
PolishGovernmentsQonumihioa-tlohs with poland.(previous reference:W.M.(45)23rdConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 185) inviting adecision on the general principles to be observed in exercisingcensorship of the Polish Governments messages to Poland. As wehad allowed the Polish Government to communicate with their people in Poland, it might be thought difficult for us to dispute their right to inform their Delegate in Poland of their views: On theother hand. His Majesty&apos;s Government, by allowing messages topass through our censorship; which were highly critical of the declared policy of the three major Allies, might be held responsiblefor permitting the dissemination of such views in Poland. If wepassed such messages there was serious, risk that our attitude wouldbe misunderstood by the Russian Government, and possibly also by our American allies.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that on balancehe thought we should refuse to allow any telegrams which wouldhave the effect of building up opposition in Poland to the policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government as set out in the Conclusions of the crimea Conference.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.WasGratuities.Women&apos;s,Land Armyand CivilNursingEeserve.(previous reference:W.M.(45)24thConclusions,Minute 3.)11. The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on schemes for post-war assistance to members of theWomen&apos;s Land Army and the civil Nursing Reserve&apos; W.P. (45) 120 and 131: by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries. .W.P. (45) 123: by the Minister of Labour and National.    Service.W.P. (45) 129 : by the Minister of Health.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries described,, in W.P.(45) 120, a scheme which he had worked out, with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, by which any person released from the W,L,A-after satisfactory service of not less than six months would receive an outfit allowance of  12 10s.; and those who undertook to remainin the Land Army for not less than one year after the defeat ofGermany would receive on release a cash bonus of As. a month foreach month of service, subject to a minimum of six months&apos; service.The draft of a public announcement about this scheme was set out at the end of W.P. (45) 131.The Minister of Health proposed to announce simultaneously an identical scheme for the Civil Nursing Reserve in the terms set out at the end of W.P. (45) 129.    &apos;The Minister of Labour and National Service recalled that attheir meeting.on the 22nd February the War Cabinet had recordedthe. view that any such scheme should be approached with thegreatest caution and its possible repercussions carefully scrutinised..While he did not wish to object on the merits to the schemes nowproposed, he feared that they would &quot;provoke demands for similar concessions to other classes of war workers, sueh as women railway workers, omnibus conductresses and industrial workers who hadbeen subject to war-time control by labour direction or by theEssential Work Order. The proposed scheme for the Civil NursingReserve would also, in his view, make it difficult to deny similar concessions to student nurses and student midwives. If these two schemes were introduced, he believed that the repercussions wouldquickly reach unmanageable proportions.The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that in his view the W.L.A. was a special case which could be clearly differentiatedfrom the other classes of war-worker mentioned by the Minister of
161W.M. 26 (45).&apos;Labour and National Service. Apart from the fact that the land army was a uniformed service, for whose recruitment the Govern-ment had taken direct responsibility, the average level of earnings of the other classes mentioned had been appreciably higher thanthose of the Land Army. Thus, the average weekly wage of a busconductress was 77s., as compared with only 48s. for women inagriculture; and the corresponding figure in the chemical industrieswas 60s., and in engineering from 65s. to 82s.The Minister added that, in addition to the strong case whichcould be made out for this scheme on the merits, there was thefurther consideration that unless some such measure was introduced it would be impossible to maintain the strength of theW.L.A. and the programme of food production in this country would be seriously jeopardised. The scheme was put forward, notmerely to reward past service, but to provide an incentive to.continued service in the Land Army.The Minister of Health said that pf 23,000 women in the CivilNursing Reserve, 3,000 had been made available for whole-time service in Civil Defence. These would receive the gratuity payable to members of the Civil Defence Services. The remainder, thoughpaid on the same basis, would receive no help towards their post-war resettlement unless this scheme was approved. This was ananomaly which he would find it difficult tp justify. He was also concerned with the future of the Civil Nursing Reserve, which he wished to keep in being in view of the prospective shortage ofnurses. Recruitment had been falling off for some time, and this tendency would be increased if members of the Reserve were left with a sense of grievance about their treatment as compared with members of the Civil Defence Services.Discussion showed that the general view of the War cabinet was against any further extension of the principle of gratuities,whether by way of outfit allowances or otherwise. It was felt, inparticular, that the application of any such scheme to persons whohad been engaged and paid by private employers would open the door to claims for similar concessions by industrial workers of allclasses, and that it would be difficult to resist such claims. On theother hand, it was recognised that it would be useful if some incen-tive could be provided, which was not open to these objections, to induce members of the W.L.A. to continue their services after theend of the war in Europe. Consideration might be given to thepossibility of devising such an incentive in the form of increasedremuneration for those who undertook to give a substantial further period of service. If such a system could be devised, it could take account of past service.The War Cabinets-Decided that, in view of the risk of provoking claims for similar concessions to various classes of industrial worker,they must withhold approval of the proposals in W.P. (45)120, 129 and 131 for special schemes of post-war assistanceto members of the Women&apos;s Land Army and the CivilNursing Reserve.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,6th March, 1945.
