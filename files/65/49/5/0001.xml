1. The War Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in the&apos;Greek situation, and of the conclusion between General Soobieand E.L.A.S* of a truce which, while inother respects satisfactory,did not provide for the return of the hostages held by E.L.A.S.The War Cabinet-(i) settled the terms of a statement to be issued fromNo. 10 Downing Street in regard to hostages; and(ii) agreed the instructions to be sent by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to our representatives in Athens asto how this matter should be handled.A record of the discussion and the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.2. Reference was made to the request from the national executive Committee of the Labour Party that the Prime minister should receive a deputation. It was explained that the object of thedeputation was to present a resolution, dealing with the situationin Greece, adopted at the recent Annual Conference of the Party,and that the Prime Minister would not be expected to discuss thematter in detail with the deputation, more particularly in view ofthe forthcoming debate in the House.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet- &apos;Agreed with the Prime Minister^ suggestion that heshould receive the deputation, on the understanding thathe would not be expected to discuss the position with them at length.3. Following on the discussion held in the War Cabinet on thismatter on the previous day, the Prime Minister informed the.WarCabinet of the action which he proposed to take in regard to thismatter.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. On the 20th December the Prime Minister had stated inthe House that the allegations made by Mr. Hopkinson, M.P. (asregards B.O.A.C., General Critchley and the regent&apos;s  Park Farmcase), would receive, as they had already received, the directattention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that when the Housereassembled a precise statement would be made.The following Question had now been put down by Mr. MoelwynHughes for answer on the 16th January: ,&quot; To ask the Prime Minister if his attention has been called to the Motion (Irregularities: in Administration of AirMinistry) standing in the Order Book in the name of thehonourable and learned Member for Carmarthen and otherMembers; and if he is prepared to give time for a discussion ofthis Motion.&quot;The terms of the Motion were as follows :-&quot; That a Select Committee be appointed to investigate the allegations made in this House on the 19th December, 1944, bythe honourable Member for Mossley concerning irregularitiesin the Administration of the Air Ministry.&quot; ,.
A Committee consisting of the-Lord President of the Council,the Lord Chancellor and the Minister of Production had been invited by the Prime Minister to advise what action should be taken .to carry out the undertaking given on the 20th December. TheCommittee had submitted a report to the Prime Minister, in whichit was pointed out that the Regent&apos;s Park Farm case had alreadybeen fully examined and a decision reached by the competentmilitary authority, and that there would be grave disadvantage in asking a Tribunal to enquire into the decision reached. No suchenquiry had, however, been carried out into the allegations madeas regards B.O.A.C., and it was suggested that this matter shouldbe enquired into by a Tribunal. The appointment was suggestedof a Tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.The War Cabinet, after considering in detail the various methods by which this matter could be handled, reached thefollowing conclusions: (1) The Prime Minister, in answer to Mr. MOelwyn Hughes&apos;question on the 16th January, would say that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were making enquiries into the allegations as regards B.O.A.C. When, however, theresults of these enquiries had been received (and this might take a few weeks), His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be ready to give a day for the discussion of theproposed Motion.(2) The Prime Minister would forthwith appoint a Committee,consisting of a Judge of the High Court, a business man and an Accountant nominated by the Treasury, to enquire into the allegations made by Mr. Hopkinson inregard to B.O.A.C.This Committee would sit in private and would report to His Majesty&apos;s Government for their own infor-mation. It was contemplated that, for the present atany rate, neither the composition of the Committee, its terms of reference, nor its report would be made public.(It followed that the Committee would not have thepowers of a Tribunal appointed under the Tribunals of inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.)(3) When the matter was debated in the House, it was contem-plated that a reasoned Government amendment to the motion would be put down, to the effect that the matters in question had been fully examined, and that the /appointment of a Select Committee was not called for.It was also contemplated that a very full and frankstatement should be made to the House, based on theenquiry already carried out into the regent&apos;s  Park Farmcase, and on the enquiry of the Committee referred to in(2) above.In this way it should be possible to satisfy Parlia-ment that all the allegations in question had been fullyexamined and the facts disclosed, without the difficultiesinseparable from the appointment of a public tribunal of Inquiry.Parliamentary 5.   At their meeting on Monday, the 8th January, it had beenBusiness. decided that there should be no change in the business already(Previous announced for the week beginning the 14th January, and that the reference: debate on the war situation should take place in the week beginningW.M,(45)2nd the 21st January. An announcement to this effect had already been conclusions, made.
Having regard to the development in the situation, the PrimeMinister thought that it would be desirable that the debate on the war situation should be brought forward and should now take place onThursday and Friday, the 18th and 19th January; although thiswould involve some delay in the passage of the Representation ofthe People Bill. This would make it necessary to alter the arrange-ments which had been notified, but justification for the change couldbe found in the development of the situation.The War Cabinet-Agreed to this change in the business already announced.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,12th January, 1945.
