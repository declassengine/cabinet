M 125 W.M. 21 (45)..Women&apos;s .1.   The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that,Land Amy. subject to the views of the War Cabinet, he would propose to reply(Previous as follows to a Parliamentary Question in regard to Lady Denman&apos;reference: resignation as Honorary Director of the Women&apos;s Land Army in w.M.(45)l9th England and Wales, which Mr. J. Henderson-Stewart, M.P., had conclusions,    put down for Tuesday, the 20th February : minute 4.) - &quot; Lady Denman&apos;s resignation, which I very greatly regret,was based on the fact that members of the W.L.A. have notbeen included in the schemes, in particular the Business grants scheme, which have been announced for financial assistance to members of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and Civil defence services.As indicated in the statement made on the 14thFebruary, the Government consider that while members of theWL.A. have rendered national service of the highest value and often at great personal sacrifice, the differences in conditions of recruitment and service that exist between the W.L.A. and theother Services preclude treatment on a uniform basis. The caseof the W.L.A. has been under separate and, I can assure hon.members, sympathetic consideration, and I hope to be able tomake an early announcement on the matter.&quot;At the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer it wasagreed that the last three words of the penultimate sentence of this draft reply should be amended to read &quot;the same basis.&quot;Subject to this amendment, the War Cabinet- Approved the draft reply proposed by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries.Negotiationswith Sweden.(previous reference:W.M. (45) 13thConclusions,Minute 5.)X&quot;2; At their meeting on Wednesday, the 31st January, the WarCabinet had felt that, in order to bring pressure to bear on the swedes, we should delay as long as possible the signature of theproposed War Trade Agreement with Sweden.The Chancellor of the Exchequer now informed the War-Cabinet that the Swedes were proving even more uncompromisingthan had been expected. Although they had agreed in principle to conclude a Payments Agreement before the end of 1944, they had first asked that the signature, due on the 31st December, 1944,should be postponed to the 15th February, 1945, and had nowrequested a further postponement. While much depended on a goodagreement with Sweden at this stage, he felt no doubt &quot;that the swedes regarded the moment as a crucial one from their point ofview, and were anxious to make the most favourable bargainpossible. But, while we could not carry on without considerablesupplies from Sweden, equally we could not pay gold for them; thatwould, however, be the effect of the continuance of the existingtemporary payments agreement. If the Swedes0 were really asfriendly towards us as they suggested, now was the time for themto show it. His own view, with which the Foreign Office and theMinister of Economic Warfare agreed, was that we must standquite firm on our points, and must refuse to sign the War trade agreement until a satisfactory settlement had been reached over thematter,of payments. He realised that the United States wereparties to the War Trade Agreement and might try to bring pressure upon us, but he trusted that they would, in fact, realise our difficulties. .The War Cabinet-.   Approved the course of action proposed by the Chancellor,of the Exchequer at &quot;X.&quot;[29792-1]b 2
j 126&apos;Policy towards 3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSiam. Deputy Prime Minister (W.P. (45) 102) regarding policy towards(Previous Siam. The discussion on this matter and the conclusions reachedReference: are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet.M. (44) 127th Conclusions. -  -Conclusions, - ,      *Minute 6.)--      * -The channel islands.evacuation of SickCivilians.(previous reference:W.M.(45)13thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security and the Ministerof State (W.P. (45) 100) in which it was reported that the GermanGovernment had proposed that 1,000 seriously-ill civilians shouldbe evacuated from the Channel Islands to the United Kingdom.The German Government had also expressed a desire that200 wounded German soldiers should be evacuated at the same time as the civilians, but did not appear to have made this a condition ofthe evacuation of the civilians.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe was advised that the hospital and curative facilities available inthe Channel Islands were very limited. He hoped, therefore, thatthe War Cabinet would agree that arrangements should be made onthe lines proposed in paragraph 2 of W.P. (45) 100 to evacuate anycivilians who were so seriously ill that removal was imperative for reasons of health. The International Red Cross Committee had asked the German Government for further details in regard to theproposal for the simultaneous evacuation of 200 wounded Germansoldiers; and this proposal would require further considerationwhen it was known more clearly what the Germans had in mind.The Minister of War Transport said that he understood that two suitable Swedish ships, each with accommodation for 100 lyingand 200 sitting cases, could be made available. It would not,therefore, be necessary to use one of the ships specially built for theChannel Islands&apos; traffic, which were at present allocated toS.H.A.E.F. It was, however, important that the ships should comedirect to this country, and we should therefore resist any proposal that the evacuated civilians should be taken to a neutral port fortranshipment.The War Cabinet agreed that arrangements should be made forthe evacuation from the Channel Islands of civilians so seriously illthat removal was imperative for reasons of health. Should iteventually prove necessary to agree to the simultaneous evacuation of the 200 wounded German soldiers, it would be for consideration whether we should not insist that a corresponding number ofBritish sick or wounded prisoners of war should be transferred toa neutral country in exchange.The War Cabinet-(1) Subject to the alterations proposed by the Minister of war transport as regards shipping arrangements, approved the proposals contained in W.P. (45) 100 for the evacua-tion of sick civilians from the Channel Islands.(2) Deferred consideration of the proposal for the simul-taneous evacuation of 200 wounded German soldierspending receipt of further information regarding thedetails of this proposal.AlliedPrisonersof War.(previous reference:W.M.(45)18thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Deputy Prime Minister said there was increasingevidence of public anxiety regarding British prisoners of war inGermany.The Secretary of State for War said that the Soviet Govern-ment had not yet issued visas, for which application had been madeon the 25th January, for the liaison officers whom the War Officewished to appoint to deal with the Russian authorities on matters affecting British prisoners of war liberated by the Soviet Forces.
127W.M. 21 (45).        89He had no information regarding the numbers of British prisonersof war so liberated. Unless the arrangements for implementing theagreement concluded at the Crimea Conference could be expedited,it might hot be possible to take advantage of the opportunity for there patriation of British prisoners which would be offered by the arrival at Odessa of a number of ships which were at present ontheir way to that port with 7,000 Russians who were beingrepatriated. He understood that the Foreign Office had sent atelegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow&apos; on the16th February asking him to take these matters up with the SovietGovernment. ;* Points in discussion were :    -(a) Further opportunities for the repatriation pf british prisoners of war would occur in the near future, as there were alarge number of Russians who still remained to be repatriated.(6) The War Cabinet were informed that General Eisenhowerhad recently suggested that, to obviate the great hardship tp allied prisoners of war involved in moving them from Eastern Germany inpresent conditions, the United States and United Kingdom Govern-ments should propose to the German Government, through the protecting Power, that, where the evacuation of United States and united Kingdom prisoners of war involved greater hazard than thedanger involved by leaving them where&apos; they were, they should,subject to suitable conditions, be released on the withdrawal of theGerman Forces. This proposal, together with another proposal putforward by the International Red Cross Committee that a numberof lorries should be made available to that Committee for thepurpose of carrying supplies to Allied prisoners, was underconsideration by the Chiefs of Staff.(c) Reference was made to a report that the German Govern-ment were moving British prisoners of war of prominent socialposition to Southern Germany, possibly with the ultimate intentionof using them as hostages.The War Cabinet- .Took note of the points made in the above discussion.Committee , 6.   The War Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Homeon the Secretary (WP. (45) 101) on the question whether Miss MyraTreatment Curtis, formerly Director of  Women&apos;s Establishment  at  theof Children Treasury and now Principal of Newnham College, Cambridge,Deprived of should be appointed as Chairman of the Committee on the Treatmenta Normal of Children Deprived of a Normal Home Life which was beingHome Life. set up by the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health and theMinister of Education.The Home Secretary said that he was satisfied that Miss Curtishad the ability and the experience which would enable her to carryout successfully the duties of Chairman of the proposed Committee.She was, however, one of the two persons who had recently presented the report on the London Remand Home question which was the.subject of considerable controversy; and she had herself raised thequestion whether, in these circumstances, it might not be better- if someone else were appointed as Chairman.  His own feeling wasthat it would not be- advisable for his colleagues and himself to givethe impression that they were influenced by the criticisms whichhad been directed against the report on the London Remand Homequestion-criticisms which, in his view, were unjustified.. The Minister of Health said that, whilst he had not wished topress his views, he had never been satisfied that Miss Curtis wouldbe an altogether suitable Chairman for the Committee. It was now clear, in view of the controversy which had arisen over thereport on the London Remand Home question, that her appointmentwould not be well received. He himself would therefore be disposed to favour some other appointment.      -
The Minister of Education said that, whilst he had no doubtMiss Curtis had the ability and experience necessary for the appoint-ment, he too felt that in the present circumstances some otherappointment might be advisable.After discussion, the general view of the War Cabinet was,however, that having regard to Miss Curtis&apos;s record and qualifica-tions, and to the danger that a decision to look elsewhere for a chairman might be interpreted as implying that the Governmentwere impressed with the criticisms which had been directed againstheraas joint author of the report on the London Remand Homequestion, her selection should stand. &apos;The War Cabinet accordingly Agreed that Miss Curtis should be appointed as Chairmanof the Committee on the Treatment of Children Deprived,     of a Normal Home Life.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,19th February, 1945.
