At their meeting on Monday, the 8th January, the WarCabinet had agreed that the question whether, when parliament reassembled, the House of Commons should meet in Church house should be considered by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as Leader of the House, the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Secretary of State for Air.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security read tothe War Cabinet a technical report as to how the buildings inquestion would stand up to rocket attack.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that no change should be made in the meeting-placeof the House of Commons in the current week, but that thequestion &quot;should be reviewed at frequent intervals.Foreign Affairs. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theSpain. War Cabinet of the present position in regard to visits to this(Previous        country by exiled Spanish political leaders. .  .Reference: The Trade Union Congress had invited the Republican Leaders,W.M. (44) 171st Senor Indalecio Prieto and Senor Toma, to come from Mexico to conclusions, attend the forthcoming Trade Union conference, on the under-Minutes 4 standing that they would leave this country immediately theand 5.) conference was concluded.   The Spanish monarchist leader, GilRobles, now in Portugal, was anxious to go to Switzerland and hisonly convenient route was via the United Kingdom. Finally ^ the woman Communist leader known as La Passionaria, now in Russia,wished, en route to France, to cross territory under British control in Palestine.      .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that noobjection should be raised to any of the visits and felt, in particularthat by granting permission to Senor Robles to transit the UnitedKingdom we should be assisting to keep the balance in terms of visits between Left and Right. He recognised that there might be some criticism of the visit of Senor Prieto, but thought that couldbe faced.The Prime Minister suggested that, in the interests of good relations with countries with which we were in diplomatic relations,&apos; it should be clearly understood that there would be no question ofany transgression on the part of any of these visitors of the normallimits of decorum, or any attempt to raise a violent quarrel with another country, during the visit here of the exiled leaders fromMexico.      - -After further discussion, the War Cabinet -Approved the proposal of the Secretary of. State for- Foreign Affairs to agree to the visits which he had indicated. .
Yugoslavia.(previous reference;W.M,(45)4thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet of the latest developments in the Yugoslav situation.A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Greece. 5.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, asDeputation agreed at their meeting on the 12th January, he had received from the deputation from the Labour Party Executive.  The discussion hadLabour Party been very friendly and it was clear that the deputation felt that theExecutive. situation had altered materially  since the resolution of the(Previous 13th December was passed.   The points on-which they had been reference: anxious for reassurance were very minor, and he had been at painsW.M.(45)5th tP make it clear that a free election in Greece was the goal of his conclusions, Majesty&apos;s Government.,Minute 2.) A short discussion followed on the general situation in Greece,in the course of which the following points were raised : (a) The Prime Minister suggested that there might be advantage in a plebiscite in the liberated areas, even though this might lead E.L.A.S. to attempt to hold a plebiscite in the areasunder their control. It was suggested, on the other hand, that itwould be better that the present negotiations over the return of the-    hostages held by E.L.A.S. should be concluded before the matter was further considered.(b) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had telegraphed to Mr. Leeper asking for further information as to thestanding of the Trade Union leaders whose message (Athenstelegram No. 134 of the 10th January) had been published in thePress.The War Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.Greece.Visit by TradeUnion Leaders.6. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he had spoken to Sir Walter Citrine informally on the 12th January abouta possible Trade Union visit to Greece. Sir Walter&quot; had been greatlyattracted by the idea and had now proposed a delegation selected by the General Purposes Committee of the Trade Union congress and consisting of Sir Walter Citrine himself and four other repre-sentatives. The deputation would not be political, but representativeof the Trade Union movement, and none of its members were members of Parliament. He saw no objection to the proposal andgreat advantage in it. No exception could be taken to the composition of the delegation.       *The following points were made in discussion : (a) Care should be exercised in settling the form of theannouncement of this visit. It was suggested that it should be made clear that a request for such a visit had been made by. the GreekTrade Unionists to our Ambassador.(b) -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs enquire whether it was the wish of the War Cabinet that the six M.Ps. ofall parties who were now in Italy should be encouraged to proceedthereafter to Greece. The general feeling was that it would not bedesirable that this party should be in Greece simultaneously withthe Trade Union delegation, and that no action should be taken toencourage them to proceed here. If, however, a request for a visit by a party of Members of Parliament, representative of all parties,was made in the forthcoming debate, this would have much to commend it, and might well be accepted.
The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed to the proposed visit to Greece of the Trade union representatives proposed by Sir Walter Citrine.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to settle- the terms of the announcement in consultation with theMinister of Labour and National Service.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (W.P. (45) 22) proposing the extension to R.A.F. personnel in South-East Asia, the Middle East and theCentral Mediterranean of the short-leave schemes recently approved for the Army and the Indian Army (W.P. (44) 150th Conclusions,Minute 3).   -The following points were made in discussion :-(a) The Army had for a considerable time been at a dis-advantage in the length of its tour overseas as compared with theR.A.F. The leave concessions recently made had been designed todo something to redress the balance, but were regarded by the army as inadequate. Moreover, given the feeling on the subject in theHouse, diminution of the Army leave allotment in favour of R.A.F.personnel would provoke sharp criticism.(b) The First Lord of the Admiralty urged that the navy should receive the benefit of any concession now made to the R.A.F.Substantial numbers of naval personnel had long periods of service in the Indian Ocean or the Mediterranean in shore establishmentsor in ships which were refitted locally because of pressure here.(c) The Minister of War Transport pointed out the difficultiesin carrying any additional numbers. There were no additionaltroop-ships available and the difficulties of carrying personnel inordinary cargo ships were, he thought, insuperable.. After further discussion, the Prime Minister said that thegeneral sense of the War Cabinet was clearly that no reduction couldbe contemplated in the numbers of military personnel to benefit bythe short-leave scheme. As regards the Navy, every effort should be&apos;made to take Naval personnel on short leave in Naval-vesselsreturning to this country in the ordinary course. The position ofthe R.A.F. must also be considered. .The Prime Minister suggested, and the. War Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of War Transport should further review the matter in consultation with the ministers concerned, and consider what special arrangements couldbe made to meet the Royal Air Force proposal, particularly. in regard to Air Command, South-East Asia, and anycorresponding Royal Navy needs (to the extent that these could not be met by transport in His Majesty&apos;s Ships), even at the cost of some small impingement on requirements ofan operational character.8. The Prime Minister said that a number of important questions were now under consideration in connection with relief for liberated Europe. Some of these questions arose in respect ofthe military period, whereas others fell Within the scope of theCommittee On Supplies for Liberated Areas,
The Prime Minister thought that it would be an advantage ifa small, ad hoc committee of senior Ministers were to be appointedto review the issues of major importance in this field and to reportto the War Cabinet. He suggested that this Committee, should consist of-The Deputy Prime Minister (in the Chair),The Minister of Production (Chairman of the S.L.A. Com-mittee),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Minister of War Transport,The Minister of Food,An official nominated by the Foreign Office, andAn official nominated by the War Office.: - The question was raised whether this arrangement wouldinvolve duplication of the work of the Committee on Supplies toLiberated Areas.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet-^Approved the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal at &quot; X &quot; above for the appointment of a Committee, as an ad hoc arrange-ment, to deal with the group of questions referred to bythe Prime Minister, on the understanding that this wouldbe without prejudice to the work of the Committees&quot;   normally operating in this field.Allegationsby Mr. A.Hopkinsbn,M.P.(previous reference:WJil(45)5thConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The War Cabinet gave further consideration to the con-elusion reached at their meeting on the 12th January that thePrime Minister should appoint a Committee, consisting of a judge of the High Court, a business man and an Accountant nominated by the Treasury, to enquire into the -allegations made byMr; Hopkinson in regard to B.O.A.C.It was pointed out that it would be impossible to hold an enquiry of a judicial nature without making the enquiry a publicone and giving Mr. Hopkinson an opportunity of substantiating hischarges. If, however, what was required at the present stage wasnot a judicial enquiry, but merely an investigation for the con-fidential information of the Government, with a view to assuringthem that they would be on safe ground in informing parliament that they were satisfied that Mr. Hopkinson&apos;s charges were withoutfoundation and that there was no case for the appointment of a select Committee, then it would be more appropriate to&quot; invitesomeone other than a judge to undertake the investigation.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that what was required at this stage was a privateinvestigation for the confidential information of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to prepare and submit to thePrime Minister a note setting out the matters in regardto B.O.A.C; to be covered by this investigation.(3) Agreed that the Minister for Civil Aviation should beinvited to carry out this investigation with the assistanceof an Accountant.Parliament. 10.   The War Cabinet gave further consideration to theNotice of suggestion made at their meeting on the 8th January that on the dissolution. committee stage of the Representation of the People Bill a statement(Previous should be made with regard to the length of notice which would be reference: given before a dissolution after the end of the war with Germany.W.M.(45)2nd It was pointed out that it would be necessary to make theConclusions, statement in the House of Commons on the 17th January.
Mk - 38 -       .The Prime Minister said that there were precedents in 1918and 1929 for making an advance announcement of the date whenthe Royal Proclamation would be issued. It was not clear, however,whether there was any precedent for intimating several months before the general election that advance notice of the date of the proclamation would be given. In any event, he-would have to consult His Majesty with regard to the proposed statement.The War Cabinet-(1) Favoured the proposal that a statement on the lines indicated should be made in the House of Commons onthe 17th January.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary and Minister of home security would submit a draft statement to the PrimeMinister, who would submit it to His Majesty The King.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,15th January, 1945.
