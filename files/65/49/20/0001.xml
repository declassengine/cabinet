121 -     W.M. 20 (45).1. The Minister&apos;of War Transport made a statement to theWar Cabinet on his negotiations at. the Crimea Conference.. a record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.2. A discussion took place on the question of supplies for liberated areas in Europe. A record of the discussion and of theconclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.3. The. War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (W.P. (45) 95).The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, for the period the1st May to the 31st August, 1945, the demand for S.Ff .A.E.F. wasabout 1 million tons. In addition, 280,000 tons per month would berequired by S.H.A.E.F. for Norway and Denmark from a date tobe determined. If stocks in the United Kingdom were to be built up by the 31st October, 1945, to a leyel of 17^ million tons, theUnited Kingdom could only meet the demand during the period, the1st May to the 31st August for 450,000 tons of very low-grade coals.He accordingly suggested that the War Cabinet should authorise him to ask the United States Authorities to take over theresponsibility for the balance of S.H.A.E.F. and Mediterraneanrequirements. This would amount to 200,000 tons per month plusall supplies required for Norway and Denmark, over and above thetonnages which the United States were at present supplying.The Minister of War Transport pointed out that the supplyof such large quantities of coal from the United States would represent a most wasteful use of shipping and would have serious repercussions on the whole shipping situation. Moreover, it was difficult to see where the deep-water ships which would be requiredto carry this coal could be unloaded. The capacity of Antwerp was already fully taken,up with priority cargo, and, if the coal wereunloaded at Marseilles, the question of onward transport would present an almost insuperable problem.The War Cabinet were informed that, at a meeting of theLord Presidents Committee held earlier in the morning, theMinister of Fuel and Power and the Minister of War transport had been asked to consider, as a matter of urgency, what steps could be taken-e.g., by way of a rearrangement of the coal distri-bution and utilisation programme-to make it possible to meet therequirements from the United Kingdom for S.H.A.E.F. and theMediterranean area up to the 30th April, 1945. It might be thatthe two Ministers would find it possible to reoommend measureswhich would also have an effect on our ability to meet the S.H.A.E.F.requirements during the following period the 1st May to the31st August, 1945.The Deputy Prime Minister said that the difficulties being experienced in meeting these operational requirements seemed tohim to be a symptom of the general difficulties of the ooal positionand that.it might be that the time would shortly come when a WarCabinet Committee should be set up to look into it.
In discussion, attention was drawn to the importance of doing everything possible to increase indigenous Coal production in belgium; and it was suggested that the two Ministers should coverthis point also in the report which they would be preparing for theLord Presidents Committee.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Ministerof War Transport to deal with the points at &quot; X &quot; and&quot; Y&quot; above in the report which they would be sub-mitting to the Lord Presidents Committee.(2) Agreed that, in the meantime, no communication should bemade to the United States Authorities on the lines proposed in W.P. (45) 95.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,16th February, 1945.
