A record of the discussion and of the(Previous conclusions reached is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofReference: War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet had before them A note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence(W.P. (45) 103) circulating the text of two letters from president Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin to himself, andof his reply to President Roosevelt, about the repre-sentation of the United States in the assembly of theWorld Organisation;A memorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (W.P. (45) 99) about World Organisation inrelation to the Dominions;A note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(W.P. (45) 104) about the position of Southern Ireland.The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account of thediscussions at the Crimea Conference as to representation in theWorld Organisation of the Soviet Government and the UnitedStates.The War Cabinet then discussed the proposals in thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(W.P. (45) 99) about the arrangements to be made for a BritishCommonwealth meeting in advance of the World Conference.The War Cabinet authorised the Secretary of State forDominions Affairs to issue invitations for a commonwealth conference in London to be held about the 15th March.The invitation should suggest that the Conference mightbe held on a ministerial level, on the understanding thatif any Government found it impracticable to send a minister, it could be represented by appropriate officials,including, of course, High Commissioners or diplomatic representatives.The War Cabinet also agreed that the Government ofIndia should be invited to send a representative to theConference, and that the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should preside.The War Cabinet then considered the memorandum about theposition of Southern Ireland (W.P. (45) 104).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the agree-ment reached at the Crimea Conference had been that those of the associated Nations who declared war before the 1st March shouldbe invited to attend the San Francisco Conference. It had alsobeen agreed that one or two other countries, although not specificallyincluded in the list of Associated Nations, should also receiveinvitations if they declared war before the 1st March. It was not,however, the case that if Southern Ireland declared war on Germanybefore the 1st March she would thereby become entitled to be invitedto the United Nations Conference at San Francisco. The first paragraph of the memorandum required some amendment in thisrespect.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he didnot himself suggest that Southern Ireland should be invited to theUnited Nations Conference. On the other hand, it was clear thatsome of the Dominion Governments took a different view to ourselvesof Southern Ireland&apos;s behaviour in the war, and he had thoughtit right that he should bring this fact to the notice of his colleagues.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.W.M.(45)17thDonclusioira,Minute 2.)World 2.Organisation. ^(previous reference:W.M.(45)4th &quot;Conclusions,Minute 4.)m[29792-^]
WaxGratuities.Civil defence services, &amp;c.(previous reference:W.M.(45)22ndConclusions,Minute 3.)3, At their meeting on the 13th February the War Cabinet(W.M. (45) 19th Conclusions, Minute 4) agreed that war gratuitiesshould be paid to whole-time, members of the Civil Defence services at three-quarters of the rates admissible to the Armed Forces; andhad invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries to consider the possibility of working out a special scheme of recognition, not being a gratuity, for theWomen&apos;s Land Army.The Prime Minister said that in view of the importance ofthe issue he thought some further discussion was desirable. he feared that the scheme might open the way to demands from other classes of worker who fell outside its scope, such as the.regular police, or the Mercantile Marine.The Lord President of the Council said that the discussion onthe 13th February had revealed a considerable difference of view.The arrangements then approved represented a compromise. any extension to conditions of total war of the principle of gratuitiesfor combatant personnel produced problems of great difficulty.The War Cabinet first considered the question of gratuitiesfor the Civil Defence Services! The following points were made : (a) The Civil Defence Services had not been allowed tonegotiate wages on an industrial basis, and their payhad been fixed on the basis of the emoluments of aprivate soldier with a wife and one child. While theyhad&apos;benefited as the pay of the soldier had been progres-sively improved, they would have benefited still more had they been free to go into industry. Even so, on the basisaccepted by the War Cabinet, the soldier would bemarkedly better off than the Civil Defence worker.(6) The Civil Defence Services had done invaluable work during the period of the blitz. They should not be leftto feel that, once the need had passed, their services were no longer appreciated.(c) Not only had the Civil Defence Services been employed athome, but they would be at a great advantage in obtain-ing employment after the war, partly for that reasonand partly because they would be demobilised much earlier than the members of the Fighting Services.(d) Reference was made to the &quot; Bevin Boys &quot; directed to the mines. A general undertaking had been given that theywould be treated very similarly to the Army. Might theynot claim to receive gratuities ? But if this claim was granted, would not the door be opened to claims from theMiners generally and from other classes ?There was agreement that any claim on behalf of the &quot; BevinBoys &quot; should be rejected.(e) The Chancellor of the Exchequer estimated the cost of the concessions proposed for the Civil Defence workers atY&quot; I approximately  !7\ million.    He had no intention of going beyond that figure and could not justify anywidening of the concessions which it represented.The War Cabinet next discussed the concessions proposed to begiven to the Women&apos;s Land Army: The following points were made in discussion (/) The Minister of A griculture and Fisheries said that, con-sequent on the discussion in the War Cabinet of the13th February, he no longer pressed for a gratuity.There was, however, a strong case for some concession of a different character. It was now proposed that anoutfit allowance should be given to women leavingptheWomen&apos;s Land Army, and that those who remained in the service should, as an inducement, receive a bonusbased on the number of years&apos; service rendered.  It was
143W.M. 24 (45). -important to keep the,Service at a certain strength, andthe extra bonus involved could be justified on thatground. The amount involved in these proposals was of the order of  1 million.(g) It was suggested that a concession even of this limitedcharacter would be dangerous. It would be difficult tojustify different treatment for industrial and agrjcul-tural workers. The principle that persons employed by-private individuals like the Women&apos;s Land Army and paid by them, though at rates fixed by the Government,should, because they were in uniform, receive a clothingallowance on leaving the Service, might have unfortunatereactions on other individuals who had had to wear out their own clothes in occupations to which they had been directed.(h) The Minister of Health urged that the Civil NursingReserve had a strong claim to the same concessions as were proposed for the Women&apos;s Land Army. Hesuggested that he should be allowed to discuss their position with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(*) The Minister of Labour and National Service said that, ifany grants were made to the Women&apos;s Land Army or anyworkpeople who had been receiving the recognised ratesof wages in the industry in which they worked, therewould Undoubtedly be claims for similar grants not onlyon behalf of the &quot; Bevin boys,&quot; but from thousands ofother workers which, in his opinion, it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to resist.After further discussion the War Cabinet (1) Endorsed the arrangements already approved for gratuitiesfor Civil Defence workers, and agreed that the arrange-ments proposed should be justified, and any extensionthereof refused, on the grounds that members of these services had been paid at the equivalent of Army ratesand had had no right of negotiating for industrial ratesof wages.(2) Recorded the view that any proposals for the grant ofspecial clothing allowances, bonuses, or similar conces-sions to the Women&apos;s Land Army or any similar bodiesshould be approached with the greatest caution, andmost carefully scrutinised in view of their possible repercussions.(3) Took note with approval of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer at &quot; Y.&quot;policy had been considered and approved by the War Cabinet. he asked his colleagues to make sure that this principle was adhered toin future.The War Cabinet-Took note with approval of the principle enunciated bythe Prime Minister.oOffices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1945
