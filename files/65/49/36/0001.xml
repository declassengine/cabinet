219W.M. 36 (45).Naval, Military 1. The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theand Air previous week.Operations. On the Western front, air operations had been on a larger scale(Previous than in any previous week during the war. They had surpassedEeference: the figures for the week of the Normandy landings by 15 per cent, in w.M.(45)32nd sorties and 33 per cent, in tonnage of bombs dropped. During theConclusions, period, a total of 69,000 sorties had been flown and 58,000 tons of minute 1.)      bombs dropped. .       &apos; .Air Operations. In preparation for the crossing of the Rhine by 21st ArmyGroup, the main, objectives of the Allied Air Force had been (i) dis-ruption of enemy communications, (ii) attacks on enemy fighters and airfields, (iii) bombing of troop concentrations, (iv) anti-tankpatrols, (v) operations behind the enemy lines, and (vi) the airborneoperation itself. In addition, a number of oil targets had been attacked.Total Allied losses had been 447 aircraft as against 545 lost bythe enemy.Bomber Command had carried out 5,900 sorties and dropped19,000 tons of bombs. Their main targets had been the oil plants ofBohlen, Hamburg, Dortmund and Bremen. In addition, five out of seven important bridges and viaducts attacked were known to havebeen destroyed.Mosquitoes had bombed Berlin each night.United States bombers had flown 9,600 sorties and dropped19,000 tons of bombs. Their main targets had been enemy airfields;but 2,800 tons of bombs had also been dropped on Berlin.The Tactical Air Force had flown 50,000 sorties and dropped19,000 tons of bombs.In the British and American airborne operations on the24th March some 1*300 gliders had been employed and 52 aircraft had been lost during the operation. The opposition met by theBritish Airborne Division had been heavier than that met by theAmerican Division, and casualties had been fairly heavy.Mediterranean. In the Mediterranean 16,700 sorties had been flown and 13,200tons of bombs dropped for the loss of 99 aircraft. considerable damage had been caused to rail communications iii Austria, SouthGermany and Hungary. Attacks on enemy communications in thePo Valley and the Brenner Pass had been continued.Pacific. Super Fortresses had made successful attacks on Kobi andNagoya, dropping some 3,700 tons of bombs, mostly incendiaries.Naval Confirmed shipping losses for the week, due to enemy action, had operations. been 43,988 tons. The confirmed shipping losses for March now amounted to 77,369 tons.Two U-boats had been sunk during the week, bringing theU-boat sinkings in March to 4 sunk and 4 probably sunk.A convoy of 22 ships had arrived in North Russia.

United States losses in aircraft had been light, but several ships had been damaged by air attack.Military The War Cabinet were given the latest information about theOperations. . operation of 21st Army Group in crossing the Rhine on the23rd/24th March. Footholds across the river had been quicklygained by both British and United States forces, and good initialprogress had been made except in the Rees area, where there hadbeen stiff fighting. In general, the British forces had met with moreopposition than the Americans. Field-Marshal Montgomery- expected stiff resistance in the early stages, and there was likelyto be some heavy fighting before any substantial advance wasmade from the east bank of the river. So far 10,500 prisoners had been captured and large numbers of the enemy had been killed.[29831-4] b 2
The United States 3rd. Army continued to make striking pro-gress and American troops were reported tohave entered Darmstadtand Frankfurt. All enemy resistance west of the Rhine had nowceased; and of 250,000 enemy troops estimated to;have been in that area about 150,000 had been either captured or killed.Burma. In the Arakan area troops had landed north of Taungup.  the capture of Mandalay had been completed on the 20th March, andour troops to-the south had joined forces with those advancing fromthe west at Kyaukse. Myingyan had been captured.Russia. Russian forces had now reached the coast between Danzig andGdynia. At Stettin the last German bridgehead east of the Oderhad been eliminated. To the south the Russians were attacking inthe area of Kustrin. In Upper Silesia, in the neighbourhood ofOppeln, the Russians had advanced and claimed 30,000 Germanskilled and 30,000 prisoners. West of Budapest and north of LakeBalaton Marshal Tolbukhin and General Malinovsky had made aconsiderable advance.The War Cabinet Took note of these statements.Attacks by 2.   The Home Secretary and Minister of Home SecurityRockets and informed the War Cabinet that during the previous week there hadFlying Bombs, been 51 incidents due to long-range rockets. Of these, 20 had(Previous occurred in London, 22 in Essex, 2 in Kent, one each in Bedford-Reference: shire, Berkshire and Hertfordshire, and 4 in the sea. CasualtiesW.M.(45)32nd had been 70 killed, 277 seriously injured, 570 slightly injured and conclusions,     n unclassified.Minute 2.) Of 49 flying bombs launched during the period, 20 had crossed the coast, but only two had reached London; 23 had been destroyed,16 over the sea and 7 over land. Casualties had been 33 seriously injured and 68 slightly injured.On the night of the 20th/21st March, some 20 enemy aircraft had carried out an intruder operation mainly over Norfolk. Severalattacks had been made on civilian objectives, but there had been no casualties and little damage.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Northern 3.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the rhodesia. Secretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (45) 187) regarding aMr. Maybank. proposal, made by Sir Waiter Citrine and the President of the(Previous Northern Rhodesia Mineworkers&apos; Union, that Mr. Maybank should reference: now be allowed to return to Northern Rhodesia, having recentlyW.M.(43)94th been reappointed as General Secretary of the Union.Conclusions, Mr. Maybank had been deported from Northern Rhodesia in minute 3.) 1942 on the ground of his subversive activities directed against thewar effort; and when in 1943 the Governor&apos;s action in deportingMr. Maybank had been called in question by the General Councilof the Trades Union Congress, the War Cabinet had agreed that sir Walter Citrine should be informed that there was no ground forreconsidering the decision taken. So long as the war with Germanycontinued, it was imperative that the production of copper inNorthern Rhodesia should be maintained, and there was good reason for adhering to the decision taken in 1943. When the warwith Germany ended, however, there would be less ground foropposing Mr. Maybank&apos;s return; and it was probable that theDefence Regulation under which he was deported and was prevented from returning would be revoked. It was therefore proposed (inparagraph 4 of WP. (45) 187) that Sir Walter Citrine should beinformed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies was notprepared to ask the Governor to allow Mr. Maybank to return to northern Rhodesia at the present time, but that no objection wouldbe raised to his return after the end of the war with Germany.
221W.M. 30 (45).In discussion some doubt was expressed whether it wasnecessary to go so far at present as to indicate that no objectionwould be raised to Mr. Maybank&apos;s return after the end of the warwith Germany. It was pointed out, however, that there was certain to be agitation for Mr. Maybank&apos;s return as soon as the war withGermany was over; and, as he would then be allowed to return, itwas preferable to say so &quot;now and thus avoid appearing to havegiven way to pressure..The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary, of State for the Colonies to replyto the representations made by Sir Walter Citrine on thelines suggested in paragraph 4 of W.P. (45) 187.GeneralElection.Eelease ofStaff for -ElectoralEegistrationOfficers andEeturningOfficers.(previous reference:W.M.(45)12thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland(W.P. (45) 185) regarding the provision of staff for registration officers and returning officers.The Home Secretary recalled that the War Cabinet hadalready approved arrangements for the early release from theForces, the Civil Defence Services and industry of staff requiredby the political Parties in connection with the General Election.If the election was to be conducted efficiently, it was equallynecessary to release staff for electoral registration officers andreturning officers, and urgent representations had been received onthis matter from the County Councils Association, the Society ofClerks of the Peace and the Society of Town Clerks. The totalnumber of key men required would certainly not exceed 2,000 andmight well be considerably less. It was proposed that the HomeOffice ^rid the Scottish Office should invite registration and returning officers to submit applications for the release of key men and, after examining the applications, should forward to the Ministry ofLabour and National Service those which they felt able to support.In the case of persons in the Forces, the Ministry of Labour and national Service would invite the Service Departments to arrangefor immediate release subject only to overriding military considera-tions. In the case of persons in industry, the Ministry of Labourand National Service would arrange for release in the absence of exceptional considerations.. In addition to the release of key men, it would be necessary to reinforce the existing clerical staffs of registration and returning officers, and it was suggested that the Ministry of Labour and national Service should be authorised to make all necessary arrange-ments to ensure that extra clerical assistance was forthcoming when required.Discussion centred on the proposed release of men from theForces. It was pointed out that there would be serious difficulty inreleasing persons serving overseas. Although the numbers involved were relatively small, this proposal could not be considered in isolation from the other demands which were being made for therelease of men from the Forces for various civil purposes. Therewas a real danger that these special releases would cause seriousdiscontent in the Forces unless they were kept within very narrowlimits. It was therefore urged that, in the first instance, releases from the Forces for this purpose should be confined to personsstationed in this country.The Home Secretary said that, while he appreciated thedifficulty of releasing men&apos; serving overseas, he could not take responsibility for ensuring that there was no breakdown in thearrangements for the General Election unless registration officersand returning officers had the experienced staff required; and hewas advised that these would not be forthcoming in sufficient numbers if releases from the Forces were confined to men stationed in this country.
5. The War Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister&apos;proposed, subject to their views, to invite President Roosevelt to]oin him in sending a personal message to Marshal Stalin aboutthe course of the discussions at Moscow on the reorganisation ofthe Polish Government. Copies of a draft telegram to the Presidentwere handed round at the meeting.There was general agreement that it would be expedient, atthis stage of the discussions, that President Roosevelt and thePrime Minister should send a joint message to Marshal Stalin;and that this suggestion should be put to the President on, the lines indicated in the draft telegram. It was, however, suggested thatthe Prime Minister might wish to consider whether it would be preferable that the suggestion should be put to President Rooseveltthrough His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, who couldexplain, at greater length than was possible in a telegram, thereasons why we favoured this course. Alternatively, the draft telegram could be divided, the substance of the proposed message to Marshal Stalin being incorporated in a subsequent telegram.It was agreed that these suggestions on procedure should besubmitted to the Prime Minister for his consideration later that evening.Poland.(previous reference:W.M. (45) 33rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,26th March, 1945.Further points in discussion were;- &quot;(a) The Secretary of State for Air. pointed out that the man-power allocations for 1945 provided no fresh intake for the RoyalAir Force; and, if men were to be withdrawn from the Royal AirForce under this scheme, he must ask for a corresponding replace-ment. The Minister of Labour and&apos; National Service said that hehad no reserve of man-power from which such replacements couldbe found.(b) It was suggested that a certain number of people with thenecessary experience might be obtained! by the release of persons at present employed in Government Departments, and thepossibility of releasing such persons should also be considered.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the procedure proposed in paragraph 3 of w.P. (45) 185 should be applied forthwith for thepurpose of securing the temporary release of personsserving in the Armed Forces in this country, on theunderstanding that the Service Departments would not,save in exceptional cases, object to such releases on theground of overriding military considerations.(2) Approved the proposal made in paragraph 3 (&amp;) of W.P.(45) 185 for the release Of persons in industry, and invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to consider, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, whether additionalpersons with the necessary experience could not also befound among the existing staffs of GovernmentDepartments.. (3) Agreed that if, when it was possible to estimate thenumbers likely to be secured by releases under conclu-sions (1) and (2) above, it appeared that the shortageof experienced staffs was such as to involve a risk of a breakdown in the arrangements for the &quot; GeneralElection, the matter should again be brought before theWar Cabinet.
