Rumania. 1.   The War Cabinet were informed of further developments(Previous in the Rumanian situation.   The discussion is contained in the reference: Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M.(45)26th &apos; &quot;    &apos;Conclusions,Minute 5.)CivilAviation.future organisation.(previous reference:W.M,(45)8thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet considered the following Memoranda onthe organisation of British civil aviation: W.P. (45) 118-by the. Minister for Civil Aviation.W.P. (45) 136-by the Minister of Information.WP. (45) 137-by the Lord Privy Seal.At their meeting on the 24th January the War Cabinet had given general approval to the plan set out in W.P. (45) 38 and had authorised the Minister for Civil Aviation, subject to consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and any other ministers concerned, to proceed with the formulation of specific proposals togive effect to it. In W.P. (45) 118 the Minister for Civil Aviationreported that he had reached agreement with the Chancellor of theExchequer on all the points then outstanding, and that his discus-sions with the various parties whom it was proposed to bring intothe operating companies had been carried to a point at which astatement of Government policy could be made. He submitted, as appendix I of his Memorandum, the draft of a White paper setting out the main features of the plan. The only material change from the proposals which he had previously put to the War Cabinetin WP. (45) 38 was that, after consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, he had abandoned the proposal for a centralGovernment-owned company to undertake certain common servicefunctions. For the reasons set out in Appendix II of his memorandum, he now proposed that these functions should becarried out through the various existing agencies available to under-take this work.The Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Information, in theirMemoranda, took exception to the plan put forward by the Ministerfor Civil Aviation on the ground that it would eliminate competi--tion and the spirit of commercial rivalry. In their view a plan ofregulated competition for civil aviation was more likely to secure an efficient and expanding service. The Minister of Informationsuggested a system of regulated competition based on licences-granted after according a public hearing to all interests wishing to operate British air services.Discussion centred round the following points(i) the principle underlying the proposals of the Minister for civil Aviation;(ii) the question whether those proposals gave an exclusiveright of operation on the routes assigned&apos;to the B.O.A.C.or to the companies;(iii) the right of operators to purchase aircraft themselves andthe channels through which purchase should be made;(iv) the  desirability  of  including  railway  and  shipping companies in the proposed air transport corporations;(v) the inclusion-of tramp owners in the proposed air trans-port corporations; .(vi) specific amendments of the White Paper.(i) The Principle underlying the Proposals of the Minister for- Civil A aviation.The Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Informationamplified the arguments outlined in their Memoranda for a plan ofregulated competition through a Civil Aviation Bureau empoweredto grant licences. - Such a,scheme, which was similar to that already in operation in the United States, would give the civil aviationcompanies, which had performed valuable services before the war,an opporunity which they would be denied by the present plan.
165W.M. 27 (45).On the other side, it was pointed out that-the principle under-lying- the proposals of the Minister for Civil Aviation had alreadybeen accepted by the War Cabinet after full consideration of theobjections now put forward. The scheme as it stood was a compromise between nationalisation on the one hand and unlimitedcompetition on the other. Either of these extreme solutions would meet with substantial political opposition; and in present circum-stances the middle course proposed in the White Paper was themost likely to win general acceptance as a basis for practical actionin the immediate future. It might well be that some modifications&apos; of this scheme would have to be made as time went on. But noequally practicable scheme had been put (forward, or could be worked out in time to secure that we should not be placed at a gravedisadvantage by the delay that would be involved.(ii) Rights of Operation on the Routes assigned to the Companies.It was suggested that the proposals in the White Paper wouldgive to the three organisations now contemplated exclusive rightsof operation on all routes.The Minister for Civil A aviation explained that exclusive rightsof operation would be assigned in the scheduled routes on which itwas desired to operate services at once. But no commitment of any kind was proposed in respect of any additional routes other thanthose covered by the schedule of immediate routes now putforward. The Government in power at the time would be free to assign such routes either to the existing companies or to newundertakings as they might think fit.(iii) Right of operators to purchase aircraft.It was suggested that under the new policy the manufacture ofcivil aircraft in Great Britain would depend in future on a singlesource of demand through the B.O.A.C., and that operatingcompanies would be precluded from purchasing direct frommanufacturers.The Minister for Civil A aviation explained that this was notthe intention. For the reasons explained in paragraph 39 of theWhite Paper it would be necessary in the initial stages to canalisepurchases through the Minister for Civil Aviation and the Ministerof Aircraft Production. But once the war was over and transport aircraft were available, the companies concerned would be at liberty to buy aircraft direct from the manufacturing firm. Paragraph 40of the White Paper would be amended to make this clear.(iv) Inclusion of railway and shipping companies in the proposedair transport corporations.it was urged that the railway companies should be excludedfrom the proposed air transport corporations, since their interestslay in protecting their rail services from loss of traffic to competitiveair lines. By tying air rates to those of road and rail transport,fares would be kept high and progress restricted. shipping companies equally might seek to strangle competition with their shipping interests. In this connection reference was made to thepurchase and suppression of canals by railways in the last century.The Minister for Civil Aviation said that he was satisfied, inthe light of his discussions with them, that the railway and shipping companies were ready and anxious to give all the assistance theycould to the successful development of civil aviation. they recognised that competition in the air must be met in the air.Without their experience in traffic organisation we should be at a grave disadvantage. Our position was quite different in thisrespect from that of the United States. There was not a multitudeof companies ready and able to take part in civil aviation. Therewere in the United Kingdom only three small aviation companiesoutside railways and shipping.
The Boards of Directors of the proposed Air TransportCorporations, while they would contain a proportion of railway orshipping directors, would be primarily and effectively civil aviationboards, and the directors appointed from railway or shipping companies would be appointed strictly for civil aviation purposes.It was also pointed out that the railways had had statutory powers even before the Avar to run air lines. The present proposalsgave them power to develop as before the war but did not give them the right to control any of the companies now proposed. Admittedlythe United States and Canada had excluded railways and shipping from any share in civil aviation. But there was some reason tobelieve that this decision might be reconsidered certainly in the caseof railways. In any event, it was only by the means proposed inthe White Paper and by bringing in all the elements that couldassist, including the railway and shipping companies, that we could hold oUr own against the predominant position of United Statescivil aviation and the advantage that the United States had derivedfrom their war-time monopoly in the construction of transport aircraft.(v) Inclusion of tramp owners in the proposed air transport services.The Minister for Civil Aviation invited the views of the War .Cabinet on the question, discussed in paragraph 3 (c) of W.P.(45) 118, whether tramp owners should be included in the proposedaircraft corporations.The general sense of the War Cabinet was that tramp ownersshould not be so included.(vi) Specific amendments of the White Paper.The Secretary of State for Air urged and the Minister for CivilAviation agreed that the second sentence of paragraph 39 of thedraft White Paper should be amended by the omission of the words&quot;in anticipation of civil requirements&quot; which were likely, ifretained, to give rise to misunderstanding with the Americans inconnection with Lend-Lease.After further discussion the War Cabinet--(1) Reaffirmed their acceptance of the principles underlying the scheme outlined in W.P. (45) 118.(2) Agreed that tramp ship owners should not be included inthe proposed civil aviation corporations.(3) Invited the Minister for Civil Aviation to arrange for thedraft White Paper annexed to W.P. (45) 118 to be amended so as to meet the points noted at (iii), (v)and (vi) above and any points of detail arising from thediscussion.(4) Authorised the Minister for Civil Aviation to present theWhite Paper, as so amended, to Parliament on Tuesday,the 13th March, with a view to its being debated in theHouse of Lords on Thursday the 15th March.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,8th March, 1945.
