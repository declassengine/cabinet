At their meeting on the 13th December, 1944, the War-Cabinet had authorised the drafting of a Bill to carry out theproposals contained in W.P. (44) 640, subject to the modificationsindicated in their discussion, and had invited the President of theBoard of Trade to bring this Bill before the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet now had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (W.P. (45) 78), to which was attached a draft Distribution of Industry Bill..The War Cabinet discussed the draft Bill clause by clause andthe following points were made : (a) In Clause 1 the power to build and to acquire land was limited to the Development Areas, in accordance with the views expressed at the War Cabinet on the 13th December; 1944.(6) It was pointed out that under Clause 1 of the Bill, as atpresent drafted, the Board of Trade would have power to buildhouses on a large scale; and it was suggested that the existence ofthis power might in some cases deter Local Authorities frominitiating housing schemes under the normal machinery.The War Cabinet were informed that it was not in fact theintention that the Board of Trade should exercise this power exceptin cases in which it was the only way by which houses could beprovided for the key workers of industrial undertakings who were willing to establish themselves in the Development Areas; and thePresident of the Board of Trade was invited to consider, in consul-tation with the Minister of Health, whether the drafting of theClause could be amended in such a way as to make this clear.(c) The definition of the term &apos;&apos; basic service &apos;&apos; in Clause 3 (2)of the Bill should be so amended as to enable grants or loans to bemade towards the improvement of such services as hospitals,schools, &amp;c. This might perhaps be done by amending the words&quot;the requirements of persons employed in such undertakings&quot; to read &apos;&apos; the needs of persons employed in such undertakings and their dependants.&quot;(d) It was suggested that the financial assistance which theTreasury should be empowered, under Clause 4, to give to industrial undertakings in the Development Areas should be confined to themaking of loans and should not be extended to cover the making of grants towards the cost of paying interest or dividends, or subscriptions-tion to share capital.In favour of such a limitation, it was argued that it was undesirable that the Government should become equity holders in private undertakings or guarantee, the interest or dividends(particularly the latter) of such undertakings; and that this formof assistance would not, in any case, be necessary in order to induceindustrialists to establish undertakings in the Development Areasduring the post-war years.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the Government hadpossessed such powers under the arrangements for assisting thespecial areas before the war and, in particular, under the SpecialAreas Acts which would be repealed by the present Bill; and thatit had, in fact, often proved preferable for the Government to assistundertakings by making temporary grants towards the cost of paying interest or dividends rather than by making loans.The general view of the War Cabinet was that power shouldnot be taken to subscribe to share capital and that the power tomake grants towards the cost of paying interest or dividends shouldbe limited to a period not exceeding five years in the case of any oneundertaking; The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook toconsider the desirability of excluding the power to make grants towards the cost of paying dividends on share capital and to informthe President of the Board of Trade of his conclusion on this point.
(e) Tinder Clause 4 (1) of the Bill, as at present drafted, thepower to give financial assistance would be exercised by the Treasury&quot;after consultation with an Advisory Committee appointed bythem.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would prefer that the Treasury, while remaining free not to carry out the recom-mendations of the Advisory Committee, should have power to givefinancial assistance only on the recommendation of the AdvisoryCommittee. He understood that this would correspond with theposition under the Special Areas Acts.The War Cabinet agreed that, in this matter, the Distributionof Industry Bill should follow the same lines as the Special AreasActs, and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to suggest to the. President of the Board of Trade what amendments should be madeto the Clause for this purpose.(/) The President of the Board of Trade said that,, in &quot;accordance with the views expressed by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 13th December, 1944, he had not stipulated, in clause 8 of the Bill, that any specified period must elapse betweenthe notification to the Board of Trade of the intended erection orextension of industrial buildings and the date on which the workmight be begun. He doubted, however, whether in its present formthe Clause would be of any real value; and, as he understood thatthe information sought could be obtained by the Board of Trade,through the Ministry of Town and Country Planning, from theLocal Planning Authorities, lie would be prepared, if the WarCabinet agreed, to drop the Clause altogether.In discussion, it was pointed out that, if proposals for new industrial development were not brought to the notice of the Boardof Trade before they had come to the attention of the local planning Authorities, the Board of Trade would be less likely tobe successful in any attempt ^ which they might feel justified inmaking to secure that the development took place in some otherarea which was preferable from the point of view of the distributionof industry.On the other hand, it was felt that, at any rate in the ease 0:fextensions of existing buildings, an obligation to give separate notice to the Board of Trade three months before the work could beginwould hamper enterprise and discourage desirable new developments. &apos;The War Cabinet accordingly decided to limit the scope ofthis Clause to the erection of new buildings on land not alreadyoccupied by other buildings in use by the undertaking for industrial purposes; and that, in respeGt of such new buildings, a period ofthree months should be required to elapse between notification to theBoard of Trade and the beginning of the work, unless, as was very desirable in cases of urgency, permission to proceed were grantedearlier. The President of the Board of Trade was invited toprepare a redraft of the Clause, in consultation with the Ministryof Production, for consideration in the Legislation Committee.(g) Clause 9 of the Bill empowered the Board of Trade todetermine by order (subject to an affirmative resolution by bothHouses of Parliament) areas in which the erection or extension ofany industrial building should be prohibited except under licencefrom the Board of Trade.The War Cabinet were reminded that the undertaking givenin the White Paper on Employment Policy (Cmd. 6527) was that power would be taken to. prohibit the establishment of a factory in a district where serious disadvantage would arise, from furtherindustrial development. It was suggested that, in the discussions which had preceded&quot;the publication of the White Paper and whichhad subsequently taken place in the Distribution of IndustryCommittee, it had been contemplated that the power to be takenwould be not to declare &apos;&apos; restricted areas &apos;&apos; -a power which would[29426-4] &quot; B 2
perhaps be more appropriate to planning legislation than to legis-lation &quot;concerned with the distribution of industry but to vetospecific proposals for industrial development in&apos;any area in which,from the distribution of industry point of view, further industrialdevelopment of that particular kind was undesirable.The general view of the War Cabinet was, however, that theprinciple embodied in Clause 9 of the draft Bill, whereby powersof restriction would be applicable, only in specified areas determined with the approval of Parliament, was preferable; and that thepresent Clause 9 should therefore stand.(h) In connection with Clause 9 (3) of the Bill, it was suggestedthat it was objectionable that the High Court should be empoweredto overrule an administrative decision taken by the Board of Tradein the exercise of powers conferred by Parliament. The properremedy in the case of persons who had previously entered intocommitments in respect of the erection or extension of a building and were subsequently prevented from carrying out the proposederection or extension owing to the application of Clause 9 to thearea in question, was by way of compensation. The Clause should therefore be amended to provide for the payment of appropriatecompensation by the Board of Trade in such cases, and there shouldbe provision for recourse to the Courts only where the applicantwas dissatisfied with the amount of such compensation.(i) At the suggestion of the President of the Board of Trade,the War Cabinet agreed that the list of Development Areas to appear as the first schedule to the Bill should be the list annexed toW.P. (45) 78, which had been approved by the Distribution ofIndustry Committee at their meeting on the 3rd October, 1944.The War Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor the draft Bill attached to W.P. (45) 78 to be revisedso as to meet the points made in discussion and to submit the revised draft Bill to the Legislation Committee at their meeting on Tuesday, the 13th February, 1945.Selling Price 3.   The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by theof Houses.       Lord President of the Council (W.P. (45) $1 and W.P. (45) 83) onthe question of the control of the selling price of houses.The Lord President of the Council said that, for the reason explained in W.P. (45) 81, the Lord Presidents committee considered that the Government would be well advised to agree toan enquiry, but that it could more appropriately be carried out bya mixed Committee, including experts, than by a Select Committee.Proposals which had been put forward by the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for Scotland in regard to the terms ofreference and constitution of such a mixed committee were set outin W.P. (45) 83.The War Cabinet agreed that the case for the establishmentof a mixed committee, including experts, as proposed by the lord president of the Council, was decisive; and, after discussion (1) Approved the proposals in W.P. (45) 83 for the termsof reference of the Committee and its constitution,subject, however, to further consultation in regard tothe selection of the Parliamentary representation and its size, with a view to securing a proper political balance.(2) Invited the Minister of Health, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, to arrange for the settingup of the committee.The War Cabinet were informed that notice had been given byMr. Thorneycroft, M.P., to raise this subject on the Adjournmenton Friday, the 9th February. After discussion, they decided thatMr. Thorneycroft should be invited to consider substituting a
Question to the Prime Minister on Tuesday, the 13th February, inreply to which an announcement of the Government&apos;s decision couldbe made.United 4.   The Minister of- Production informed the War CabinetKingdom . that, consequent on discussions in Washington, a proposal had nowStocks. been put forward on behalf of the United States Government fora- further cut of 1 - 8 million tons, in the first six months of 1945,in United Kingdom stocks of food and raw materials. , It would be&apos; quite impossible to consider a reduction of this order, which clearlymust endanger consumption levels; and correspondence that hadalready passed with the Prime Minister had made it clear that overthe first six months of 1945 we were, already below the danger-levelin respect both of food and raw materials. He suggested that, ifthe War Cabinet accepted his view, they might wish to invite the deputy Prime Minister to represent the position to the PrimeMinister.The War Cabinet- ,Accepted the view of the Minister of Production and invited him to settle with the Deputy Prime Minister theterms of a telegram to the Prime Minister.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7th February, 1945.
