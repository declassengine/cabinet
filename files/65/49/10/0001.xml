The Prime Minister drew the attention of the War Cabinet(Previous to the reports in the Press of the interviews which Sir WalterReference: Citrine had had with members of the British forces in Athens. TheW.M.(45)6th troops in question had made very clear to Sir Walter their strongConclusions, sense of the one-sided presentation of the Greek situation in certainMinute 6.) quarters in the Press at home.The suggestion was made, and met with approval, that therewould be advantage if it could be arranged that Sir Walter Citrineand possibly another member or members of his deputation shouldbroadcast soon after their return to this country.House ofCommonsDisqualified-tion(temporary provisions)Aot, 1951.(previous reference:W.M.(42)7thConclusions,Minute 2.)- 4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (WP, (45) 43) raising the questionwhether the House of Commons Disqualification (temporary provisions) Act, 1941, which was due to expire on the6th March, 1945, should be extended for a further period.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that,when this Act had last been renewed, considerable feeling had been expressed against it and that he had undertaken that, before afurther renewal was asked for, the Government would consider carefully whether it was necessary.It was also explained that, if the Bill was now allowed to expire, any Member of the House holding an Office in respect ofwhich a certificate had been issued in his favour by the PrimeMinister under the Act, might continue to hold that Office andretain his Seat in the Commons, notwithstanding the expiry ofthe Act.It was also pointed out that with the approach of a GeneralElection, if any Member of the House were now to be &quot;appointed toan Office he would have to choose between accepting that Office orstanding as a candidate in the General Election.&apos; It was thus afair assumption that any person accepting Office hereafter would apply for the Chiltern Hundreds. In these circumstances the needfor a further extension of the Act no longer arose.Attention was also drawn to the legal opinion which had been expressed that it would be unsafe to regard office holders who were entitled to retain their Seats by virtue of the Act of 1941 as beingfree to seek re-election while holding those offices, unless the servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order, 1927,was amended.
* 63 W.M. 10 (45).The War Cabinet decided (1) That the House of Commons (Temporary Provisions) act of 1941 should not be renewed when it expired on the6th March, 1945.(2) That the necessary amendments should be made to the servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature)Order of 1927 to make it clear that office holders whowere entitled to retain their Seats by virtue of the act of 1941 were free to seek re-election while holding thoseoffices.lb--       Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2%th January, 1945.m

NO CIRCULATION RECORD.   &quot;W..M. (k5) 10th Conclusions.FRIDAY. 26th JANUARY. 19h-5 - at 12.30 P.tn,On the previous day (Thursday, 25th January), thePrime Minister, after answering Mr. Hughes1 question aooutB.O.A.C., had &quot;become involved in a slightly stormyexchange of questions with Lord Winterton.He had a long conversation with Lord Wintertonlater on Thursday night when he (Lord Winterton) made itclear that he did not wish to associate himself with any suggestions against the Secretary of State for Air, andhad &quot;been, anxious merely to protect what he conceived to hethe constitutional position and the right of the House torequire a Select Committee in cases in which there werecharges affecting the personal conduct or dereliction of duty &quot;by a Minister.The Prime Minister said that Lord Winterton&apos;sconception of the procedure was wrong.     Before the settingup of a Select Committee could be justified in such circumstances, there must &quot;be precise charges of apriraa facie case oxuia substantial &quot;body in the House insupport of an enquiry.     None of those conditions were satisfied in the present case.In discussion it was pointed out that at one timethe practice had &quot;been that the test should &quot;be the attitudeof a political party;   &quot;but if a party ieader demanded a select Committee in circumstances such as those underdiscussion, it was normally granted.     Reference was also made to 192k when the labour Government had gone out of office consequent on their defeat on the technical motion in favour of the appointment of a Select Committee inthe Camphell case.

A &quot;brief discussion followed as to themost convenient date for consideration ofLord Winterton*a Adjournment Motion.     The PrimeMinister was anxious to take this Motion himself.The Secretary of the War Cahinet was invited tocommunicate on this matter with the Chief Whip.
