Housing. l.   The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Minister(Previous of Reconstruction (W.P. (45) 161) suggesting that, before the debateReference: on Housing which was to take place in the House of Commons in w.M.(44)l38th the following week, it might be expedient to publish a factualConclusions, statement on the Government housing programme and the organisa-Minute 1.)      tion for giving effect to it.The Minister of Reconstruction said that in the coming debatethere were likely to be criticisms of uncertainty as to the programme and confusion as to the allocation of functions between the various departments concerned. To some extent these criticisms would bedue to ignorance or misunderstanding of the true position, and itmight be helpful if the Government published a factual statement on the lines of the draft annexed to his Note. He recalled that thePrime Minister had followed a similar procedure in 1942^ in presenting as a White Paper a factual description of the Organisa-tion for Joint Planning (Command 6351 of 1942) in connectionwith debates on the functions of the Minister of Defence.Discussion first turned on the expediency of publishing a state-ment of the respective functions of the various Departments ofGovernment concerned with housing.On the one hand, the view was expressed that such a statement would only serve to invite attention to the large number of Depart-ments concerned with this problem and would provoke criticisms ofdivided responsibility. Paragraphs 10-16 of the draft annexed to W.P. (45) 161 certainly gave the impression of a confused complex of responsibilities and would invite suggestions for alternative forms of organisation. On the other hand, it was argued that therewould in any event be a good deal of discussion in the debate on theexisting division of responsibility; and it was preferable that this discussion should be based on knowledge of the facts. It wascontended that those who criticised the existing organisation had no alternative to suggest except a single Ministry of Housing; that this alternative would be quite unacceptable to local authorities; andthat there was much to be said for compelling these critics to face the facts of the situation.At the same time, it was felt that the salient features of thepresent organisation could be presented much more shortly and con-vincingly than in the draft annexed to W.P. (45) 161. Thus, the description should begin with a clear statement that primary responsibility for housing rested with two Departments-the health&quot;Department (one in England and Wales and one inScotland)&apos; and the Ministry of Works.  Their functions were complementary,not overlapping; the Health Department being responsible for co-. . ordinating demand, and the functions of the Ministry.&apos;of Worksbeing confined to the field of supply.  Other Departments naturallyhad their contribution to make towards the task of mobilising thenational resources for a great building programme, and the Minister&quot; of Reconstruction had a function of co-ordination in this field as inother aspects of post-war planning. But the references to otherDepartments should be so phrased as not to blur the functions of thetwo main Departments with which primary responsibility lay. Itwas also a matter fOr consideration whether this description of theDepartmental organisation should be included at the beginning ofthe proposed White Paper, as in the present draft, or whether itshould take its place at the end as a description of the organisation for carrying out the programme described in the main part of thePaper.The general view of the War Cabinet was that it would be expedient to include in the White Paper a short statement on the existing allocation of Departmental responsibilities in connection with housing.The War Cabinet then turned to a discussion of the housing programme, and in particular the plans for applying the technique of prefabrication to the construction of permanent houses.The Minister of Works said that in his view there could be noquestion of depriving the local authorities of their responsibilityfor the provision of permanent houses. At the same time, it was important that, especially in the period of acute shortage in the
193 W.M. 31 (45).years immediately following the end of the war in Europe, full advantage should be taken of the economies to be secured byapplyingto house building the methods of mass production. The &quot;WarCabinet had already agreed in principle that his Department shouldhave recourse to bulk purchase or production agreements if thatproved necessary in order to secure mass production of components and fitments for houses. He now wished to carry the same principlefurther and to organise centrally the large-scale production of pre-fabricated types of permanent houses. A number of experimentaltypes were now being built, involving a considerable element ofprefabrication. He was about to discuss these experiments withrepresentatives of the local authority architects, and he hopedshortly to be in a position to invite local authorities to place firmorders for specified numbers of houses of these types. Large-scale production would, however, be necessary and this must be organisedcentrally. He must be in a position to give firm orders to the manufacturers. He was glad, therefore, that the Health Depart-ments had now felt able to agree that, in approving schemes submitted by local authorities under the Housing Acts, they wouldgive priority to methods of construction which represented asubstantial saving in man hours.The Minister of Health, while not dissenting from theseproposals about the new types of prefabricated permanent house,thought it would be premature at this stage to make any public statement on this subject which went beyond what was said in para-graphs 34-36 of the draft annexed to W.P. (45) 161. In particular,e suggested that it would be better that the local authorities shouldbe left to buy these houses from the manufacturers. The transactionmust, in his view, be on the basis that the local authorities wouldbe told of the arrangements made by the Government for the manu-facture of these houses and given the opportunity to place ordersfor the numbers they required. He had little doubt that, if the experiments proved satisfactory, the local authorities would, in fact,wish to take these houses in substantial numbers.Other Ministers felt that production of this type of house wouldhave to be organised- centrally.     j &apos;There Was, however, support for the view that it would be inexpedient to make any detailed statement at this stage about the plans for the production of prefabricated permanent houses.Experimental types had not yet been fully tested; and. it was thought undesirable to make any detailed statement while the policy was still in the experimental stage. Full details of the plan could best be disclosed in public when it was possible to invite localauthorities to inspect prototypes of the various designs.The Home Secretary said that the draft annexed toW.P. (45) 161 did not cover a number of matters which were likelyto be raised in the course of the coming debate. Points which hehad in mind were measures to increase the efficiency of the buildingindustry; price control and, in particular, the prevention of pricerings; the probable level of post-war building costs; the need forgiving fuller information to the public about the arrangementsfor licensing building; and, finally, the need for rationalising thenormal trade channels for the purchase of components and fitments.He suggested that, the Government spokesmen in the debate shouldbe prepared to deal with such of these matters as could not eon-veniently be covered in the proposed &quot;White Paper.The War Cabinet-&apos; .(1) Agreed that, for the purpose of the forthcoming debate inthe House of Commons, the Government should publishas a White Paper a factual statement of the Govern-ment housing programme and the organisation forgiving effect to it.(2) Invited the Minister of Reconstruction, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister ofHealth and the Minister of Works, to prepare in thelight of the discusssion a revised draft of the statement annexed to W.P. (45) 161.
(3) Asked that other Ministers wishing to suggest amendments;of the draft annexed to W.P. (45) 161 should send their suggestions to the Minister of Reconstruction before-12 noon on Friday, the 16th March.(4) Invited the Minister of Reconstruction to submit the revised draft to the Prime Minister, who would give final approval on behalf of the War Cabinet in time to enablethe White Paper to be presented to Parliament not later than the 20th March.Food.World supply situation.:;(Previous; .Reference:W.M.(45)30thConclusions,Minute 1.)Parliament.Debate onCivilAviation.2.   At their Meeting on the previous day, the War Cabinet.had invited the Ministers pf Production and Food to submitmaterial on which the Prime Minister might base a telegram to president Roosevelt on world food supplies.A draft had accordingly been prepared by the Ministers eon-cerned on the following lines :-It was proposed that the world&apos;s food supply position should be considered in Washington; that the Ministers of.Production and of Food would be ready to go there as soon aspossible to join with United States representatives in deter-mining what steps should be taken to cut consumption down to-the level of supplies; and that this examination should includethe question of possible reductions in United Kingdom stocks which it had previously been suggested should be dealt with as-&apos;  a separate enquiry.-In discussion reference was made to the fact that a telegramabout the handling of discussions on the world food supply.situation was expected shortly from the Minister Resident for Supply in washington. It was suggested that the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram should not be despatched until this had been received^;In discussion of the draft, attention was drawn to the fact thatthe requirements of the United Kingdom Armed Forces for meatwere substantially in excess of those of the previous year.The Secretary of State for War explained some of the factors which accounted for this increase. Thus, we had a million moresoldiers overseas than a year ago. Moreover, the Army authoritieswerev responsible for the rationing, of a considerable number of greek troops and Belgian and Dutch forces, and had also to make provision for the increasing number of German prisoners of war.The question was raised whether it was desirable to include inthe telegram to President Roosevelt, or in an accompanying tele-gram, figures comparing the level of consumption of a number ofimportant commodities in this country and in the United States.The general conclusion was that, on balance, it would be better forarguments based on such comparisons to be reserved for use by theMinisters of Production and Food when they reached Washington.The War Cabinet-Approved the draft telegram, subject to a number of amendments made in discussion, and authorised the PrimeMinister to arrange for its despatch, subject to &quot;X&quot;above.3. The Chief Whip asked what arrangements were contem-plated for the debate on Civil Aviation which waste take place in.the House of Commons on the 20th March.The War Cabinet Invited the Minister of Aircraft Production to take chargeof this debate. It would be convenient if he would himselfmake the opening speech, the reply to the debate beingmade by the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Air-craft Production.Offices of the War Cabinet,.S.W. 1,tSth March, 1945.
