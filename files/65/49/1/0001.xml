The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious six days.Bomber Command had flown 4,450 sorties and dropped14,500 tons of bombs, 13,500 of which had been on Germany. the targets had included railway centres affecting the battle area, andthe Dortmund-Ems Canal, which had again been breached just asthe Germans had restored it to working order.United States bombers had dropped 14,000 tons of bombs andflown 6,000 sorties. Their targets had included railway- centres inthe battle area, oil targets and the U-boat yards at Hamburg, whereit was thought that 2 U-boats had been sunk and 1 damaged.During the month of December 46,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on Germany by the R.A.F. and 37,000 tons by UnitedStates aircraft.The Allied Expeditionary Air Force had flown 16,000 sorties and dropped 3,000 tons of bombs, mostly on troop concentrations.3,400 enemy vehicles were claimed to have been destroyed.401 enemy aircraft were claimed to have been destroyed asagainst 244 Allied aircraft in combat and 168 on the ground. Onthe previous day the German Air Force had carried out its firstbig-scale operation since D-Day, using between 400 and 500 fighters.They had attacked several airfields which had been heavily crowdedwith aircraft. The German losses had been heavy. Final figures were not yet available, but at least 125 had been1 destroyed.Casualties to R.A.F. personnel in this attack had been light.13,000 sorties had been flown and 8,300 tons of bombs dropped,mostly on oil targets and in the battle area. Enemy losses amountedto 36 aircraft as against 83 Allied (including 45 United Statesheavy bombers).Shipping losses due to enemy action for the month of December-amounted to 92,550 tons. Seven ships had been sunk by U-boat in home waters and 4 by mine in the Scheldt area. The December total was the highest since August 1944, when losses had amounted to110,524 tons, but was the seventh lowest, monthly figure of the war.Escorts of a North Atlantic convoy had sunk a U-boat on the27th December, the&apos; entire crew being taken prisoner. The total ofassessed U-boat sinkings for December were 2 sunk and 2 probably sunk.Referring to the report made to the War Cabinet the previousweek of a transport with some 2,500 American troops on board which had been torpedoed in the Channel, the First Sea Lord saidthat 900 lives had been lost. There had been an ample escort of4 British destroyers. The crew had been negroes from the belgian congo under American orders. An enquiry into the incident wasbeing made by the United States Flag Officer at Cherbourg and also by our own Naval authorities at Portsmouth. The First Sea Lordundertook to mention the matter to the War Cabinet again whenfurther details were available.Japanese warships had bombarded United States positions atMindoro Island during the night of the 27th December. A UnitedStates Liberty Ship and a Japanese destroyer had been sunk.There had been three outstanding features in the recent german offensive : first, the defence of Bastogne by the 101st United StatesAirborne Division; second, General Patton&apos;s offensive in the South,which had opened up a passage to Bastogne; and, third, the holding of the northern flank of the German penetration. (The War Cabinetwarmly endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion that we shouldtake an opportunity of expressing our admiration of the fightingqualities displayed by the 101st United States Airborne Division.)The situation now was that General Patton was still attacking from[29062-1]   ; b 2
Greece.Burma.the South towards Houffalize, and an attempt would be made shortly to narrow still further the enemy salient. &quot;-; Further south the Germans had attacked in the area ofSarreguemines, where they had achieved a minor penetration of1 mile on a 6-mile front, and also in the area of Bannstein.The Chief af the Imperial General Staff added that it was estimated that the total German strength on the Western. Front was80 divisions (equivalent to, say, 44 divisions) and 25 divisions onthe Italian Front.  On the Eastern Front they had 149 divisions.The passage between the Piraeus and the town had beenwidened and the road.to the aerodrome cleared.In the advance towards Akyab our troops had reached Dombiak,Foul Point and Rathedaung. -Further north the line had beenstraightened out in the advance towards Ye-U. It was thoughtthat the Japanese would retire on to the Mandalay-Lashio line,where they would put up a stiff resistance,.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Tanks. 3.   The Prime Minister said &quot;that when he had been atProduction. Washington in May 1943 tjta United States had been faced with over-production of Sherman &apos; tanks. Under pressure from the americans, and after consultation with the authorities at home, hehad agreed to take a larger supply of Shermans so as tp make useof the large American production. In consequence, we had cutdown our own tank production.It now appeared that the Americans had greatly reduced their&apos;    production and had used up more tanks than they expected.   Inconsequence, they had cancelled our assignment of tanks for November and December 1944.The Prime Minister said, that he thought that any short-fallshould be shared between the Allies and should not fall on us alone.He had drafted a telegram to the President drawing his attentionto the difficulties with which we were faced as a result of their action. He suggested that this draft should be considered at ameeting which had been summoned by the Minister of production for the following day to deal with the tank position.The War Cabinet-Agreed to the procedure proposed by the Prime Minister.Man-power.(previous reference:4. At the request of the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState for War gave the War Cabinet. a summary of &quot;the measureswhich wer.e being taken to add 250,000 fighting men to theW.M..(44) 173rd fighting line.Conclusions, . jn this connection the Prime Minister said that it was of them mute 4.) utmost importance that all men who wore The King&apos;s Uniformshould have arms and should be trained to use them against theenemy in an emergency, even if they were normally employed in asedentary or non-combatant role.The War Cabinet-,        Took note, With approval, of this statement.&apos;Attacks by rockets and flying Bombs.(previous reference:W.M. (44) 174thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat in the previous six days 27 incidents from long-range rocketshad been reported : 8 in London, 13 in Essex, 4 in Kent, 1 inHertfordshire and 1 in the Thames Estuary. Only in one incidenthad casualties exceeded 10 persons killed. This had been in Islingtonon Sunday night.    -There had been no attacks by flying-bombs during the period.
5W.M. 1.(45)..   *The casualties during the period had been 29 killed and122 seriously injured-all in London.The total casualties in the incident at Islington, which had occurred on the 26th December, and bad been covered by theprevious report, were now known to have been 68 persons killed and99 seriously injured.The War Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Foreign Affairs.Greece and poland.(previous reference:,W.M. (44) 176thConclusions,Minute 1.)6, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet of the latest developments in the Greek situation andin regard to Russo-Polish relations. A full record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of.War Cabinet Conclusions.B.B.C. Controlof ForeignServices.(previous reference:.W.M. (44) 171stConclusions,Minute 2.).7. At their meeting on the 18th December the War cabinet considered the circumstances in which a broadcast by the B.B.C.about a demonstration in Trafalgar Square had been relayed abroad.The Minister of Information reminded the War Cabinet that,at the outbreak of the war, the then Government had made anarrangement whereby the Ministry of Information had exerciseda virtual control over the B.B.C. in time of war. Early in 1941 thisarrangement had been revised by the present Government. Whilethe Government had retained direct control of services to enemy orenemy-c-ccupied territories, responsibility for Home news and talkshad been restored to the Governors of the B.B.C., subject only to theparliamentary responsibility of the Minister of Information forall the B.B.C.&apos;s actions. In effect, since 1941 the Governors of theB.B.C. had had authority to deal with home news on the same basis as the Press, and was subject to censorship to the same degree.Because of the amount of material given out it was impossible toavoid all errors, but the work of the Corporation during the war had been of first-class quality. Moreover,&quot; it was the business of theB.B.C. to report news, and if it adopted too restrictive a view of its functions it would lose credit for impartiality.When a territory was liberated the arrangement wherebydirect control of broadcasts to that territory was exercised by thePolitical Warfare Executive ceased; but the Governments indirectconnection with the B.B.&apos;C.&apos;s services to that country was maintainedthrough the Ministry of Information. The relations between theMinistry and the B.B.C. were such as to ensure, by persuasion and negotiation, that the Government could secure due regard to itsviews;In regard to programmes given out to countries with which wewere still at war, or where hostilities were still taking place, controlof programmes continued with Political Warfare Executive.The Prime Minister said that, since statements broadcast bythe B.B.C. carried so great authority, he thought it was essentialthat we should retain full control of all statements broadcast to countries or areas where hostilities were still being conducted and where the lives of British soldiers were at risk.The War Cabinet-     .Took note of these statements.
Reuter&apos;service.(Previous ... -,Ref erence:W.M. (44) 176thConclusions,Minute 2.)&quot;X&quot;l8. At their meeting on the 30th December the War cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to report tothem on the circumstances in which a particular message had beensent by Reuter&apos;s Agency to Athens and circulated to the troops.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he andthe Prime Minister, when in Greece, had been shown a Reuter&apos;message which had been distributed to the troops by a body knownas the Anglo-Greek Information Service and which purported to reproduce an article by Mr. A. J. Cummings, described as Reuter&apos;political Correspondent. The article was highly critical of theGreek policy of His. Majesty&apos;s Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the message as handed in for transmission had described the article asbeing by Mr. A. J. Cummirigs, Political Correspondent&apos;of the news Chronicle. By an accident the words News Chronicle wereomitted in transmission, thereby giving the impression thatMr. Cummings was ReuterVPolitical Correspondent. That he wasnot and, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs understood, neverhad been. He was, on the other hand, the Political Correspondentof the News Chronicle, and Reuter&apos;s had now undertaken not to quote him in the future. It appeared, further, that Reuter&apos;s localcorrespondent was not, in fact, of the highest quality, but themilitary authorities had not been prepared, when the point was raised at an earlier stage, to agree to a second correspondent, whowould have been more experienced in dealing with this class ofmatter.The Minister of Information said that Reuter&apos;s received a feeof  2,000 a year for the provision of news for the troops, and had undertaken to consult the military authorities as regards messagesfor despatch. He understood that the offending article had, in fact,been approved by the competent authority at the War Office.Reuter&apos;s, which was owned under a trust by various leading news-papers, was not under Government control save through the censorship, nor could he as Minister of Information give directions to it. Reuter&apos;s had recently indicated that they would prefer to dispense with the subsidy of  80,000 which they received from theGovernment, because of the suggestion it carried that they were aGovernment agency. We should not, therefore, over-estimate the degree of pressure that could be brought to bear upon Reuter&apos;s by its withdrawal. On the facts, as reported, Reuter&apos;s did not appearto have been resp6nsible for what might have happened in thepresent case.After further discussion, the Prime Minister said that itwould be well to establish the facts about the source of the messageunder discussion and the circumstances in which, and the approvalsubject to which, it had been transmitted to Athens and,theredistributed to the troops.. He suggested that a small committee consisting of the Minister of Labour (Chairman), the Minister ofProduction and the Minister of Aircraft Production shouldinvestigate accordingly and report to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-Approved the Prime Ministers proposal atX.- - &apos; -       mUnder-River 9.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theTubes. Lord President of the Council (WP. (44) 765) about a proposal thatarrangements should be made for a warning which would enable theflood-gates of the under-river tubes to be closed when a rocket was approaching.It was explained that the flooding of the tubes might cause avery serious loss of life and put the central area of the tube systemout of action for as much as two years. A radar warning system could be installed, giving about ninety seconds in which to close the
flood-gates.. The gates would be closed only for about three minutesat each warning and the passengers need not leave the trains.The proposal had been considered by the Lord President&apos;sCommittee (L.P. (44) 58th Meeting, Minute 2), who had agreed thatthe installation of the proposed radar warning system should proceed, but that its operation should be deferred pending considera-tion of a report by the Paymaster-General on the question whether,if a rocket fell in the river near one of the tubes; the explosion was likely to breach the tube.Annexed to W.P. (44) 765 was a report, by the Paymaster-General to the effect that there was little risk in the case of a rocketfalling at high tide, that experiments were being carried out toshow what the risk would be at low tide, and that the provision ofa bursting layer would eliminate all risk.The following points were raised in discussion: (a) About 4,500 shelterers used those tube stations which were liable to be flooded in fifteen minutes in the event of a major breach. If they were transferred to other accommodation considerable difficulties might follow.(&amp;) If it became known that a special warning was being givento the London Passenger Transport Board, there was likely to be a demand for a general public warning. Anysuch general public warning of the approach of rocketswould be impracticable.(c) The London Passenger Transport Board had already begun to install klaxons in the tubes. It was explained,however, that the intention of the London passenger transport Board was to use the klaxons only in the eventof flooding.The general feeling of the &quot;War,Cabinet was that the suggestionthat the risk of damage to the under-river tubes could be eliminatedby the provision of a bursting layer should be explored further, butthat, pending this, the proposed warning system should b broughtinto operation. -The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of War Transport, in consultationwith the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Paymaster-General, to investigate the possibility of providing abursting layer over the under-river tubes.(2) Agreed that in the meantime the warning system proposedby the Minister of War Transport should be broughtinto operation.(3) Took note that the klaxons installed by the london passenger Transport Board in the tubes would be used only in the event of flooding.(4) Agreed that it was unnecessary to move to other accommo-dation the shelterers now using tube stations which were liable to flooding.(5) Invited the Minister of Information to take steps to preventthe publication of any information in the Press withregard to the warning system or the provision of abursting layer.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary and Minister of Home Security (W.P. (44) 660)about the future of Civil Defence.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security explainedthat the Civil Defence Services were being steadily reduced and bythe end of the European war would cease to have any active role to perform. Unless action were taken now, the Services woulddisintegrate and it might prove extremely difficult to revive them.The Civil Defence Services would play an essential part in any
future war and they should be so organised in peace time as toenable them to be mobilised at very short notice. Under his proposals the Home Office would take over the functions of theMinistry of Home Security and, in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned^ exercise the central responsibility for civil defence. The regional organisation of the Ministry of home security would come to an end, but plans would be made for itsre-establishment in the event of war. The local authorities should remain responsible for the Civil Defence Services and shoulddesignate officers, either full- or part-time, who would form askeleton organisation which could be rapidly expanded. If the War ACabinet agreed, he would propose to discuss with the local Oauthorities the detailed application of his proposals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not dissent from the general scheme outlined by the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security. It had to be borne in mind, however, -that the finance of Civil Defence had been worked out in emergency conditions, with the result that the Exchequer bore a very high proportion of the burden. If Civil Defence Services were to -be maintained in peace time, he hoped that the Home Secretary and minister of Home Security would be able to agree with the localauthorities on a system of grants which would be more in accord with the financial relations between the Exchequer and localauthorities in respect of normal peace-time services.&quot; The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security said thathe would consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before hemet the representatives of the local authorities.The War Cabinet- &apos;(1) Gave general approval to the proposals for the future ofCivil Defence set out in W.P. (44) 660 and authorised the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security todiscuss them with the local authorities.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and Minister of Home security to submit a further memorandum reporting the resultsof his consultations with the local authorities, and, inparticular, making proposals as to the finance of thepeace-time Civil Defence Services. Pending considera-tion by the War Cabinet of this report (which should contain an estimate of the annual peace-time expenditurecontemplated), no commitment with regard to financeshould be entered into with the local authorities.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2nd January, 1945.
