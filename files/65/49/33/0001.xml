France.Anglo-FrenchFinancialAgreement,2. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (45) 169) on the draft Anglo-French Financial Agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this draft agree-ment resulted from discussions in December 1944 between representatives of the British and the French Treasuries, and theFrench Cabinet had considered and were willing to accept it,subject to one technical point which was outstanding. It was notmerely a technical Monetary Agreement. It would also serve tosecure that we obtained a substantial amount of gold from France,under two heads. First, it provided that, if we were able to handover military material, equipment and installations which weresurplus to our requirements, France would pay for them in gold,on the basis of original cost less depreciation, up to a maximum ofthe amount which we had credited to a French account in respectof the French munitions contracts in the United States in 1940.The amount involved was f 158 millions or  39 millions. Secondly,if British exports to France exceeded French exports to thiscountry, part of the difference would be settled in gold; and weshould be entitled to receive under this head in gold one-third ofthe value of the payments made to us by France for currentsupplies. By this means we might hope to secure some  20 millions of gold.The Agreement provided for the cancellation of all claims on. both sides arising out of the war other than those specifically dealtwith by it. As regards exchange, the Agreement provided only that &quot; the official rate (at present 200 frs. -  1) may only be modifiedafter mutual consultation.&quot;   That represented no concession.The Agreement would result in a clean slate as between theFrench and ourselves, and Would give us up to  59 millions in gold,and the comprehensive general settlement which this representedwas very satisfactory from our point of view. There would be noquestion of our owing the French a great sum at the end of the war.The following were the main comments made on the draft agreement in the course of the discussion :-(a) It was suggested that the payments made in 1940 in respect- of French munitions contracts had yielded us no return of value:Our main purpose in purchasing this war material had been toprevent its passing into the control of the Vichy Government, who might have used it against our interests. It was represented that,by this Agreement, we were acknowledging a debt, amounting to 39 millions, Which ought to be cancelled, and in addition were giving France  45 millions worth of war materials.As against this, it was pointed out that much depended onthe real value of the nominal  45 millions worth of surplus equip-ment. If it was in fact unsaleable elsewhere, that was a materialconsideration.  .&apos;(&amp;.). It was argued that the agreement that the existing rate ofexchange with France would be modified only after mutual consulta-tibii was tantamount to fixing that as a permanent rate.It was pointed out on the other hand that any alteration of the franc-sterling rate of exchange affected countries other than ourown and in particular the United States, and could not be the subjectof a bilateral agreement.(c) It was suggested that the provisions of the draft Agreement,under which information about balances held by French subjects inthis country would be made available to the French Government,were inconsistent with the long-established principle that bankersshould not be required to disclose details of their clients1 accounts;and were likely to prejudice the reputation of the British bankingsystem.[29831-1] b 2203 W.M. 33 (43) -Foreign - 1.   The War Cabinet had a short discussion on foreign affairs,Affair?. which is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.
The Chancellor of- the Exchequer said that after the capitula-tion of France in 1940 these balances had passed out of the controlof the Banks in this country and into the custody of the Custodianof Enemy Property. He had agreed that details of these, amountsmight be communicated to the French Government, as the informa-tion was in the possession of His Majesty&apos;s Government and not of the Banks. He had declined to accept a much more extensiveproposition put to him by the French, which would have had theeffect of obliging us to exchange information furnished in con-nexion with taxation. The provisions of the present draft Agree-ment, however, would not in any way affect the traditional rela-tion of confidence between banker and client. They had the full support of the Governor of the Bank of England; and, while therehad, at first, been some criticism from the Joint Stock Banks, theGovernor had not been prepared to.associate himself with this,and nothing further had been heard from the Joint Stock Bankssince they had had a reasoned explanation of the proposals.In summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said thatthe general sense of the War Cabinet was that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had made a good bargain, and was to be congratulate-lated on the terms of the draft Agreement. In view of the explana-tions given by the Chancellor in the course of the discussion, there seemed to be no good grounds for apprehension that the reputation of the British banking system would be prejudiced in any way bythe provisions of the draft Agreement regarding the disclosure ofinformation about balances held by French subjects in this country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the French Govern-ment had invited him to go over to Paris to sign the agreement.He would consult with the Prime Minister as to the expediency of acceding to this request.The War Cabinet-Approved    the   Anglo-French    Financial   Agreementdescribed in WP. (45) 169, and authorised the Chancellor&apos;of the Exchequer to arrange for it to be formally concluded.Finance of 3.   The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Chan-Relief, cellor of the Exchequer (WP. (45) 163) on the Finance of Relief.(Previous It was explained in this Memorandum that, in view of the corn-Reference:      commitments we had already undertaken, it would be difficult for usW.M. (44) 128th to assume further obligations for relief, not only because of theConclusions,    financial burden, but because of the limits on our capacity to makeMinute 6.)      supplies available.  In these circumstances it should be our policy to establish U.N.R.R.A. as the effective channel for all relief and thesuggestion might now be made to Mr. Stettinius that at the nextCouncil Meeting of U.N.R.R.A. the representatives of the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom should seek to ensure that the scopeof U.N.R.R.A. was extended to enable it to undertake relief and rehabilitation in Italy and Austria, and that the provision of anyfurther supplies (once U.N.R.R.A. had exhausted the $400 million for which responsibility had already been accepted) should be financed on a basis more in accordance with the respective financial strength of the United Kingdom and the United States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we were at presentpaying for relief to Italy under the Military Agreement on a basis which represented a quarter of the cost; as compared with one-eighth of the cost under an U.N.R.R.A. administration, and thesame situation might shortly arise in Austria. Acceptance of. his proposals would involve a substantial financial saving to thiscountry.. - -Points in discussion were : -    &apos;(a) The Secretary of State for.Dominion Affairs asked whetherCanada, which at present paid an 8 per cent, contribution^to relief,
205 W.M. 38 (45)7would also benefit from the arrangement- proposed ?    The Chan-celior of the Exchequer confirmed that this would be the case and agreed that the Canadian Government should be consulted before.      any approach was made to the United States.(b) U.N.R.E.A. could not undertake fresh obligations withoutfurther financial assistance.   It would not be possible for.us toprovide this, but it was hoped that the United States Governmentwould be ready to do so.. (c) The suggestion was made that a report ought now to be furnished.on the operations and finances of U.N.R.R.A.\ The War Cabinet were informed that Governor Lehman hoped. to produce a statement of accounts in a few weeks&apos; time, and theMinister of State, undertook to arrange for a report to be madeavailable to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to (2) below, the course of action recom-mended in paragraph 8 of W.P. (45) 163.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs toinform the Canadian Government of the line proposedto be adopted before any communication was made to theUnited States Government.,world organisation.San FranciscoConference.(previous reference:W.M.(45)&apos;24thConclusions,Minute 2.)Trade UnionEepresenta-tion.composition of british delegation.4. The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 173) on thequestion of Trade Union representation at the San FranciscoConference.The World Trade Union Conference had resolved &quot; to seekfrom the three Allied Governments an undertaking that accreditedrepresentatives of the Trade Union movement will be received into their councils at the forthcoming San Francisco Conference in an advisory and consultative capacity.&quot; Sir Walter Citrine inter-preted this to mean that there should be Trade Union representation on the delegations of the three Allied Governments and had made it plain that the inclusion of a political representative of labour assuch on the British delegation would not suffice.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that theline to be taken in reply to Sir Walter Citrine was that this was aConference of Governments; that we should be very glad to hear the views of the Trade Union Movement,-either before the british delegation left or at San Francisco, and that there was no reason why they should not put their views to the Conference in writing.We should not; however, support a request that any representatives from the Trade Union Movement should address the Conference.Further points which might be put to Sir Walter Citrine were summarised in paragraph 5 of his Memorandum.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 5 of W-P- (45) 173 asamplified by the Foreign Secretary in the discussion;(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Lord.President ofthe Council to see Sir Walter Citrine and to convey tohim on these lines the views of the War Cabinet on thequestion of Trade Union representation at the san francisco Conference.A discussion followed on the composition of the british delegation to the Conference.The Prime Minister said that the delegation should be broadlybased and representative of the political Parties included in theGovernment. He would discuss its composition further with someof his colleagues/ and hoped to be able to make an announcement inthe House of Commons on the 21st or 22nd March.
Mandated xhe Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, if the questionTerritories.     of colonial trusteeship were raised at the Conference, it would be(Previous       desirable that a representative of the Colonial Office should be reference:-      present.W.M.(45)23rdConclusions, The Prime Minister said that it was important to bear in mindMinute 5.) that the conception of &quot;territorial trusteeship &quot; had been intendedto apply only to mandated territories, to territory taken from theenemy, and to countries which volunteered to submit themselves to international trusteeship.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought it would bedesirable to indicate to the United States in advance that we did not contemplate any exhaustive examination of the mandate situation at San Francisco. It would be enough if the Conference took note of the position arising from the disappearance of the League ofNations, and recorded the view that this was a matter that wouldhave to be considered later through the appropriate channels.The War Cabinet-(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would suggest to theUnited States Government that efforts should be made toprevent any detailed discussion of the question of&quot;territorial trusteeship&quot; at the San FranciscoConference.The foreign service.Admissionof Women.(previous reference:W.M.,(42)2ndConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (45) 165) proposing the appointment of a Committee on the admission of women to theForeign Service. ,The Secretary of State for/Foreign Affairs said that inFebruary 1942, he had let it be known that he would consider theappointment of such a Committee after the war; but it had nowbeen represented to him that, if examination &quot;of this question were so deferred, women who had served in the war would be debarred from competing in the reconstruction examinations. He thought there was force in this point; and he, therefore, proposed that aCommittee should be appointed forthwith consisting of two women,two members with experience of Foreign Service work abroad, anda Judge of the High Court as Chairman.Some Ministers felt that the principle of admitting women tothe Foreign Service might be conceded at once, without any enquiry by a Committee. It was pointed out, however, in discussion, thatthere were difficult practical problems to be considered. If women were admitted to the Foreign Service, would they be allowed tocontinue in the Service after marriage--particularly if theymarried foreigners or other members of the Foreign Service? these points called for careful consideration, as they would have animportant bearing on the staffing and efficiency of the Service.The general view of the War Cabinet was that it would be expedient to appoint a Committee, on the lines suggested.in W.P.(45) 165; but that a Judge of the High Court might not be the most appropriate Chairman for an enquiry of this kind.The War Cabinet-Agreed that a Committee should be appointed to considerthe question of admitting women to the Foreign Service,but invited the Foreign Secretary to reconsider his sug-gestion that the Chairman should be selected from amongthe Judges of the High Court
207W.M. 33 (45).Press.Daily Worker&apos;8Request for.Accreditingof a Corres-correspondent to&apos;british forces.deputation from T.U1C.(previous reference:      .W.M.(45)3rdConclusions,Minute 5.)6. At their meeting on the 9th January the War Cabinet hadreaffirmed their decision that the Daily Worker&quot; should not be permitted to have accredited correspondents with His Majesty&apos;forces, and had taken note that the T.U.C. had asked that ministers should receive a deputation on this subject.&apos;, The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he hadreceived this deputation on the 16th March, accompanied by. theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor War. He had explained to the deputation the reasons whythe War Cabinet felt unable to agree that a member of the BritishCommunist Party should be accredited &quot;as a war correspondent.The deputation had then asked whether the War Cabinet wouldtake a different view if the Daily Worker agreed to appoint as their representative a journalist who was not a member of the Communist.Party and was a.person whose integrity was established to the satis-faction of the Government; and if it were also made clear that hewould be placed under no obligation to disclose to the management of the newspaper information conveyed to him in confidence in thecourse of his duties as a war correspondent.The Prime Minister said that he had undertaken to put thissuggestion to the War Cabinet.In discussion, the view was expressed that, as the Governmenthad maintained their original decision in spite of continued protests. on behalf of the Daily Worker, it might be taken as a sign of weak-ness if a concession were made at this late stage when the causeof the newspaper had been taken up by the T.TJ.C. As the Govern-ment had stood out for so long&apos;against these protests, there was much to be said for maintaining the same attitude until the endof hostilities in Europe. The reply to the T.U.C. might take theline that- the Government did not consider that this was ah apprb-priate moment at which to modify their previous decision in thismatter.The War Cabinet- -(1) Reaffirmed their previous decision, and took note that thePrime Minister would reply to the T.U.C. on the lines indicated above.Tass. Agency&apos;s At their meeting on the 26th February, the War CabinetRequest for had invited the Secretary of State for War to consider whetherAccrediting Mr. Andrew Rothstein could be accredited to S.H.A.E.F. in such Andrew a way that he would not en joy the full priviliges of an accreditedRothstein to    war correspondent.S.H.A.B.F. The War Cabinet now had before them a further memorandum as a War        (WP. (45) 155) in which the Secretary of State for War reportedCorrespondent, that General Eisenhower&apos;s Chief of Staff, to whom he had put this(Previous        suggestion, proposed that Mr. Rothstein should be appointed as a reference:       &quot; recognised &quot; correspondent to the S.H.A.E.F. mission to Belgium;W.M.(45)25th that he should not be allowed to wear uniform or to have access to conclusions,     all the Press Conferences to which accredited press correspondentsMinute 7;)      were invited; and that his messages should rank, for transmission,below those of accredited war Correspondents.   The Secretary ofState for War pointed but in his Memorandum that, while thiswould afford a solution .of the problem on the lines previously sug-gested by the War Cabinet, difficulties would arise if Mr. Rothsteins  pressed for the privileges of a fully accredited war correspondent;for, by giving him any facilities, we should have compromised tosome extent the principle on which we had based the refusal toaccredit a representative of the Daily Worker.  He hoped that on&quot; further consideration the War Cabinet would decide jto refuseMr. Rothstein&apos;s application outright.In discussion, the view was expressed that there would be great difficulty in refusing outright the application of the TassAgency. Mr. Rothstein had been employed by the Agency for manyyears : it was natural that this Agency should employ a Communistas their representative,  and  it was only an  accident  that
Parliamentary        7.   The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the review of       Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (W.P. (45) 151) covering a ministerial     draft of the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Bill.Orders. It was explained in the Memorandum that this Bill wasStatutory designed to give effect to the announcement, made by the PrimeOrders Minister in the House of Commons on the 20th June, 1944, of the(Special Governments intention to propose modifications of the existingProcedure) procedure for the Parliamentary review of Ministerial Orders of aBill. local character involving interference with private rights.   TheBill had been prepared by a Sub-Committee of the Machinery ofGovernment Committee under the Chairmanship of the Solicitor-General. In the course of its preparation there had beenconsultations with officials of the two Houses of Parliament andwith the Lord Chairman of Committees and the Chairman of Ways,and Means. Some of the suggestions made in the course of these consultations had been incorporated in the draft Bill; and, whileit could not be said that all the apprehensions expressed by theauthorities of the two Houses had been wholly met, it was Relievedthat the two Chairmen fully recognised the need for modificationof the existing procedure and agreed with the general principles... of the Bill. The terms of the draft Bill.had been approved by theLegislation Committee.    . .The War Cabinet- .  -Authorised the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toarrange for the Statutory Orders (Special Procedure) Bill. &apos; ; to be introduced into the House of Commons in the termsof the draft annexed to W.P. (45) 151.Offices of the War Cabinet, .S..W;.1,19th March, 1945.Mr. Rothstein happened to be a British Communist. The rejectionorchis application was likely to prejudice British publicity workin the. U.S.S.R. There was little to be said for the compromise solution, by which he would be allowed to proceed to Belgium withoutthe privileges of an accredited war correspondent. Particularobjection was taken to the suggestion that his messages should rank,for transmission, below those of accredited war correspondents, andthat he was likely to be forced to rely on the Air Despatch LetterService.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, on the merits,Mr. Rothstein should be allowed to proceed to Belgium as the repre-sentative of the Tass Agency, and that he should be accorded betterfacilities for the transmission of messages than would be available under the arrangements outlined in W.P. (45) 155. At the sametime, it was recognised that the Secretary of State for War mustbe able, if challenged, to reconcile the facilities accorded toMr. Rothstein with the decision that the Daily Worker could notbe permitted to have accredited correspondents with His Majesty&apos;forces.The War Cabinet-(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forWar to consider, and report to the War Cabinet, what arrangements could be made for Mr. Rothstein toproceed to Belgium as the representative of the TassAgency, consistently with the decision that the daily worker should not be allowed to have accreditedcorrespondents with His Majesty&apos;s Forces.
(Copies sent to F.O. and. No. 10)NO circulation.M.CU5) 35RD CONCLUSIONSMonday. 19th March, 19U5.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it hadbeen agreed that His majesty&apos;s Government should berepresented at the- San Francisco Conference by theForeign Secretary, the Lord President of theCouncil and the Secretary of State for the DominionsThe Deputy Prime Minister had suggested that Mr. Toralinson, Parliamentary Secretary.Ministry of Labour, should also attend.     ThePrime Minister thought there would be great advantage in this.     He also thought it preferable that the British delegation should not be without-women representatives, and he suggested thatMiss Wilkinson and Miss Horsbrugh, who were bothPrivy Councillors, might be included.     TheNational Liberal Party might be represented byMr. Mabane.The following points arose in discussion: -(a)    THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said thatMr. Stettinius had suggested that Lord Halifaxmight be appointed a delegate.     The United StatesGovernment would not wish to exclude Lord Halifaxfrom the Conference;    and, if he attended as a delegate,  it would be easier to prevent all theother Ambassadors in Washington from pressing their claims to be invited.THE PRIME MINISTER said that hethought other means might be found of surmountingthis difficulty.

(b)    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR saidthat, if Mr, Mabane were to be included in the delegation, the Liberal Party should also berepresented, possibly by Mr, Dingle Foot.The Prime Minister undertook todiscuss this point with the Secretary of Statefor Air.THE PRIME MINISTER undertook toconsider these questions further, in consultationwith some of his colleagues, and said that he hoped to make an announcement in the House ofCommons on either 21st or 22nd March.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1
