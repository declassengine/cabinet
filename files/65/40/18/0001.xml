First:    as the time was shortGeneral before the President and the Prime Minister hod to go to staff Teheran, it had not been possible to adhere to the usual practice of having full Staff discussions of the various(Previous      Problems for decision before these came to the highesti f level.      Second;    the war against Japan had had to be takenW M ?4/5?1fl9H as the, first item on the Agenda, before any decision hadvv.m, v4to; xoytn fteen reached upon operations in Europe.      The U. S. and conclusions, British Chiefs of Staff thus had to go to Teheran beforeMinute they had reached a satisfactory agreement among them-selves on matters of the highest importance.In the discussions with the Generalissimo, thePresident had committed himself to an operation next spring against the Andaman Islands - an operation whichwould have to be carried out mainly by the British, andwhich the British Chiefs of Staff were not in favour of doing.      An attempt was made to discuss with the ChineseGenerals the various plans in the South-East Asia and chinese theatres but without any success,.     It was clear thatthey had no power to make proposals or express opinions.The Conference then moved to Teheran, where againdiscussions proceeded from the start on the highest level.Marshal Stalin had pressed for an early OVERLORD, and had also been much in favour of a simultaneous operation inthe South of France (ANVIL).      The Combined Chiefs of staff had had a meeting with Marshal Voroshilov, and had fully discussed OVERLORD and the date at which it should becarried out;    and an agreement had eventually been reached on this operations and on the South of Franoe operation -the Russians promising to carry out a Spring offensive tosynchronize.Marshal Stalin had given a useful guarantee that hewould declare war on Bulgaria if the latter acted againstTurkey, should Turkey come into the war, but he displayedlittle interest in the Balkan situation or in the openingof the Straits.      The Russians did not appear to  grasp themilitary advantages to be gained in that part of the world,though their apparent lack of interest might have sprungfrom other motives.On returning to Cairo?  the Combined Chiefs of staff had resolved the difficulty in which they had been placed by the President,      The amphibious operation which he had promised to the Generalissimo could not be carried out with-out fatally compromising OVERLORD and ANVIL. -    The U. S.Chiefs of Staff were in favour of the amphibious operation-1-

in the Indian Ocean,  perhaps as a diversion to draw QOJapanese forces away from the Pacific, hut they had VUeventually agreed to ask the President to withdraw hispromise., and this was done.      This cleared the way forthe bringing of amphibious resources back to the Medlter-rean from the Indian Ocean,  without which the requisitelift for. the ANVIL assault could not be provided.Unless ANVIL were mounted on a reasonably strong scale,it might well be a costly failure.In the course of the discussions,  it was agreedto do everything possible to increase the supplies toTito, and one General Officer was to be placed in chargeof the whole operation.      Discussion also took place of apossible operation for the capture of Rhodes,  and certainpreparations were set on foot.      Its execution would depend upon the use of Turkish landing grounds, and onthe employment of the amphibious resources returning fromthe Indian Ocean for ANVIL.      Further study seemed toshow that it would not be possible to fit this operation in between now and ANVIL&apos; without prejudicing the latter^Of the other matters discussed,  the most importantwas the unification of command in the Mediterranean.The U.S.  Chiefs of Staff had put forward a plan for astill greater unification, which would have entailed theappointment of a Super Supreme Commander over the whole of operations in Europe and the Mediterranean.      The BritishChiefs of Staff felt strongly that this was an impract-impracticable scheme, and it had been withdrawn.      The U. S.Chiefs of Staff had then agreed to the unification in theMediterranean,  and this was now an accomplished fact.The U.S. Chiefs of Staff had also decided toplace under one command their strategic air forces  in theUnited Kingdom and the Mediterranean.      The Chief of theAir Staff had urged them to reconsider this decision,which he did not feel would achieve the results which they hoped to get from it, but he had not been able to convince them.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF then gave the War Cabinet a description of his tour of the italian front.He had first visited Bari, where a second nightair raid had taken place, without doing any damage,      Hehad then gone to the e th Army front, and had seen the commanders of the Canadian, New Zealand,  and 8th indian divisions.      The country was-extremely hilly.      Everymountain stream e-ut a deep gorge with sheer sides.      Theroads were narrow,  steep and winding, and the Germans had destroyed every bridge.      The sudden floods which camedown the rivers made the bridge problem very difficult,and the mud in the fields made it necessary to park vehiclesalong the edges of the roads.      Transport was head to tailthroughout the area,, but fortunately we had completecommand of the air.      The Germans,  too, must have their difficulties, but they were on the defensive, and werebusbanding their ammunition.After leaving the 8th -Army Front,  he had visited.Naples where a fine job of work had been done in develop-&apos;ing the facilities of the port.      There were, however,still a number of landing craft and DUKWS being used forunloading vehicles and stores.      He had then gone to the10th Corns front,  and had seen the Mignano gap and MonteCamino.      This was a large and precipitous mountain,reminiscent of the North West Frontier of India.      It hadbeen necessary to put in an attack by three divisionssupported by 500 guns to capture it,  although it was probable

that the Germans had. only had six battalions holding it.The nature of the country was such th .t the situation onthe whole front was developing into a slow and costlyadv-advance which could - only be accelerated if we&apos; made use ofour amphibious power to outflank the enemy1s position.He had gone. into, this carefully with General Alexanderand General Clark,  and he hoped that it would be possibleto mount an operation in the ueriod between now andANVIL.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR suggested that, it would-be worth while making great efforts to put in a seaborneattack on both flanks simultaneously.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF agreedthat there was much to be said for this propos aL bub painted outthat the limitations of landing craft were severe.In reply to an enquiry by the Minister of home security, he said that all the evidence pointed to thefact that General Mihailovic was collaborating with theGermans and that,, from the military point of view,  thebest results would be obtained by supporting Tito.      Thesituation in Greece was at present somewhat disappointing,and the Germans might be able to withdraw more formations.Nevertheless, viewing the war as a whole,  theposition was encouraging,  especially as the Russians hadbeen able to withstand the German counter-offensive inthe Kiev Salient, and would, shortly be entering thewinter period in which they had always shown theirsuperiority.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
