(45) 148TH CONCLUS IONS,  MINUTE confidential Annex(1st November, 1943 - 5,30 p.m. )THE PRIME MINISTER said that one of thematters dealt with in the Moscow Conference had he enwhether we and the Russians should now combine in anattempt to make Turkey declare war on Germany.      Thismatter was,  of course, connected with our position inthe Aegean which was one of great difficulty.      Atthe time of the Italian surrender, we had occupiedKos and Leros, but we had lost the former which contained the airfield upon which the latter depended.As a result,  owing to the absence of air cover, wehad suffered vexatious naval losses.      This situation would bo remedied if we could have the use of landingstrips which we had constructed in Turkey.The use of these strips would be of great value to us.      On the other hand, if we were now tobring pressure on Turkey to declare war, Turkey would ask for the support of some 25 air squadrons, whichwe had promised to make available when Turkey came into the war on our side.      Conditions, however, had now changed, and we could not make so many squadronsavailable to Turkey at this juncture,      Mr.  Eden had therefore told M0.   Molotov that, while we agreed inprinciple that it was desirable that Turkey should now come into the War, the real question at issue was how this should be brought about and that, inour view,  the right course would be to persuadeTurkey to grant us the landing facilities as a first step.we required,M.    Molotov had reacted unfavourably to this line of approach and had said that,  if the three great powers really thought that Turkey should now come intothe war, Turkey would have no option, and that we should bring this about,      Mr. Eden had replied that, while we agreed entirely that Turkey should enter the Warbefore the end of the year, the difference was that we wanted to bring this about in two stages, and to avoid a formal demarche to Turkey to enter the War.THE PRIME MINISTER added that this matter was to be the subject of a further discussion between mr, Eden and M.,    Molotov.      It was also likely thatMr.   Eden would see the Turkish Foreign Minister in cairo, on his return journey,  and would put to himour request for the use of the landing strips in Turkey.It looked, however, as though this  request would haveto be put forward without Russian support.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Offices of the War Cabinet,.
