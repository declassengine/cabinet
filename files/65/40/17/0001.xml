Yugoslavia*(previous reference:W.M.(I0)l69tIiConclusions,Minute 2)for compensation in the West,   They had saidthat a settlement on the lines proposed would not result in a satisfactory permanent relationship between Russia and Poland.&quot;.    THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had informed the Polish representatives that the personal view of both the Prime Minister and himself was that they would be wise to make asettlement on the lines suggested, if they could get it.    The question arose whether,  at hisnext interview, the Foreign Secretary should saythat this view was held by the War Cabinet?-MR, BRUCE said that the Australian government took this view most strongly and he strongly urged Pthat it should be endorsed.THE WAR CABINET authorised the foreign secretary, to make it clear to the representativesof the Polish Government that the view which hehad expressed had their approval.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.said that he had that morning received from theRussian Ambassador a corranunication fromM. Molotov about policy towards Yugoslavia^This communication stated that the SovietGovernment shared our view that an effort shouldbe made to find a basis for collaboration betweenMarshal Tito and the National Committee of liberation of Yugoslavia on the one hand, and king Peter and his Government on the otherhand.    The Soviet Government, hov/ever,appreciated the extreme difficulty of this task*THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it seemed clear that, in present circumstances, there wasnot much to be gained out of working withGeneral Mihailovic.    On the other hand, it was difficult for us to say to the King of yugoslavia that he should at once transfersupport from General Mihailovie&apos; to Titoand the partisans*THE FOREIGN SECRETARY had come to theconclusion that the best course would be that weshould suggest to the King of Yugoslavia that heshould agree to our making an approach to Tito.If this approach was well received, the king should then go himself to Tito&apos;s headquarters&apos;andshould fight for his people.    Under this plan,weshould leave the rest of the position to workitself out and should not worry very much forthe present about the position of General Mihailovicor the present Yugoslav Government.The War Cabinet expressed general approval ofthis course of action, and authorised the foreign secretary to proceed on these lineseOffices of the &quot;War Cabinet, S.W.I.
