CairoConferenceProposedCommunique$H^eyiousReference:W.M.(43)  163rdConclusions,Minute 2),THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS gave an account of the chief political matters dealt with at&quot; the Conferences.At the conclusion of the Cairo Conference the americans had prepared a draft which they had shown toChiang Kai-shek before they had shown it to us.     this draft communique had made it clear that the Chinesewould recover all their territory when Japan had boondefeated, but left entirely uncertain the position ofthe British an 1 Dutch possessions in the Far East.This,  of course, was quite unacceptable to usj    butthe Chinese,  having seen the draft,  had been veryunwilling to agree to have it modified in any way.Finally, however, tho Prime Minister had produced adraft which we could .just accept, and which hadbeen agreed upon and issuedeThe Foreign Secretary said he thought, that president Roosevelt had at the back of his mind theidea that Indo-China should not be handed back toFranco, but should be put under some kind ofinternational control.The Foreign Secretary said that the PrimeMinister had on several occasions said that we aslcodfor no increase of territory-y for ourselves at theend of the war,  but likewise wo were not going togive any up.RussianAttitudeto FrancoPoland,Previous? ra? 56thinclusions,whnute 2)Yugoslavia(previous reference:W,M. (43) 114thConclusions,Minute 3),At the Teheran Conference one point ofinterest had emerged, namely, that Field Marshad been extremely critical of the French,been very unfavourably impressed by M. Bergerhad been French Ambassador at Moscow earlierwar, He said that the French had not reallyhard in this war, and he obviously regarded tof France as rotten. He and President Roosobeen rather of the same- mind in thinking that should not have all her possessions restoredThus President Roosevelt seemed to have in his idea that the United States might take over Dthat it would be a good thing if wo took overgreathal StalinHe hadet whoon in thetriedhe statevolt hadFranceto her,mind theakar, andBizorta.THE SECRETARY.OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thengave an account of the discussions about the boundaries of Poland.The Fopeign Secretary said that Field marshal stalin had stated that the Russians wished to send a mission to Tito;    and had even suggested that it mightbe desirable to send one to General Mihailovich.      Theywere anxious to find out the true position, but made it clear that they wished to work with us in thismatter.      Apparently the Russians had not so far hadan accredited representative with Tito;    there had,however, been wireless communication,  and there hadbeen some escaped Russian prisoners with Tito&apos;s forces.The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed inthe House of Commons on the following day to stay thatthe Government must be allowed to handle Balkan questionswith our Allies,  as they thought right;    and that an impossible situation would arise if full play was allowed to personal preferences and sympathies for particular leaders or Balkan parties.

Turkey(previous reference:W.M. (43)l51stConclusions,Minute 3).The Poreign Secretary said that M. Numan had made the worst possible impression on him.     He hadnot thought that Turkey meant business, until thelast meeting, when President Inonu had taken more partin the discussion, and matters had looked more promising.    Later telegrams, received sinco the Confer-once had, however, again created a rather unfavourableimpression.      The arrangement which had been arrivedat, which was entirely due to the Prime Minister&apos;spatience and persistence, had one strong advantage,&apos;namely,  that by a given date (15th February)  theTurks   must definitely declare themselves.      On thatdate they would have to decide that they were willingto come into the war on our side, failing which weshould cease to send them any further supplies.Meanwhile a start had been made by sending techniciansinto Turkey in mufti.The Foreign Secretary proposed that Sir alexander cadogan should meet the Chiefs of Staff on thefollowing day and should examine various telegrams which had been received about the Turkish situationand prepare draft replies.Gree ce(previous reference:W.ivi.(43) 160thConclusions,Minute 2).This was agreod to.The Poreign Secretary said that the plan of actionin regard to Greece   which had been approved by tineWar Cabinet, had been submitted to the Prime Minister,who had agreed to it.The Poreign Secretary said that ho had then had an interview with the King of Greece, who had not reactedtoo unfavourably to the suggestion that he should make adeclaration on the lines proposed, namely,  that hewould not return to Greece until invited to do so by a properly constituted   and     representative Governmenton Greek soil after the liberation of Greece.Lebanon(previous reference:W.M.(43) 160thConclusions,Minute 4)*I imp 0 r t P r o gr amme(previous reference:W,M,(43)120thConclusions,lute 5) *PrcBidont Roosevelt had then seen tho King of greece and advised him not to agree to this proposal;:Later, however, tho King had agreed to write a letter tohis Prime Minister stating that at tho moment of liber-ation ho would reconsider the date of his return to greece in tho light of the conditions then prevailing)and that hi:; decision would bo taken in agreement withhis Governments     This letter, of course, foil far short of the declaration.which wp^had contemplated, and tho.Foreign Secretary feared this, woula^have 5 ycry injuriouserf oelf on the ^Teral plan which the Cabinet had approved for dealing with tho Greek situation^,     The^Secretary of Stato for Foreign.Affairs,saidthat some discussion had taKcn place about the situationin tho Lebanon, and it had boon agreed that wo should now bring pressure to ^ear on the Lebanese to be moreaccommodating.      This, however, would not be too easy,as the Lebanese were in a very cock-a-hoop frame of mind.Some reference was made to the import programme.THE MINISTER OF WAR TRANSPORT said that, before he left for the Conference, he had been proceeding on the basis of an import programme in 1944 of26 million tons.      While at Cairo he had received atelegram to say that Departments concerned thought that

our requirements would amount to million tons.He had felt sure that it was impossible to carryon   negotiations with the U.S. authorities on thebasis of so high a figure.      It had been left thatthe 1944 programmes would go through on the basisof a U.K.  import programme in 1944 of 26 million tons,  but that he would see whether he could noteffect a reduction to 25 million tons.      His own view was that we should not have any particular difficulty in managing on the basis of the latter figure.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.1,,
