The special ground of anxiety was landing ships and craft.     We had given orders that no further Britishlanding ships and craft should be sent back to this country from the Mediterranean and had recommended that theyshould be put unreservedly at General Eisenhower&apos;s disposal for the present-,     No instructions had, however, as yetbeen sent to General Eisenhower from the Combined Chiefsof Staff which would enable him to make use of therm      ThePrime Minister said that he thought that matters on thispoint had now reached a point at which  intervention on thepart of the War Cabinet was necessary.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that atelegram had been despatched by General Eisenhower on theprevious day to the Combined Chiefs of Staff and theBritish Chiefs of ^taff (NAF 498),  in which he stated thatthe continued withdrawal of landing ships and craft accord-ing to schedule would make it impossible for him to carryout amphibious outflanking attacks 0     The result would be thatwe should have to depend on a series of frontal attacks;and if we had to rely on these methods we should not get to the desired line covering Rome and its airfields until some time during January, and should not secure it until some time during February.      General Eisenhower askedauthority to retain sufficient landing ships and craft toenable him to make amphibious outflanking assaults.Tho Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a tele-gram from the British Chiefs of Staff sent to the U.SCChiefs of Staff through the Joint Staff Mission (C.S.0o(43)924) urging that immediate decisions must be taken in thismatter which could not await the SEXTANT Conference, andthat General Eisenhower should be empowered to put intouse forthwith such landing ships and craft as he requiredfor the vigorous prosecution of his offensive in Italy -This was not a matter for bargaining about the precisenumbers of American and British landing craft requiredoTHE PRIME MINISTER then read a telegram which he pro-posed to send to the President, asking in the name of theWar Cabinet that the request in the Chiefs of Staff telegram should be given full consideration.The War Cabinet -Endorsed the line of action proposed by the PrimeMinister in his draft telegram to the President,^Note:-   The Prime Minister&apos;s telegram to the president was subsequently despatched as telegram Not.490.2./Offices of the War Cabinet,  S.W.1.

The War Cabinet resumed their discussion of president roosevelt&apos;s proposal to send a communication to Mr.  de(Previous        Valera regarding the continued neutrality of Eire.      The-Reference:       War Cabinet had before them the following further documents;W.M.(43)130thConclusions, W.P.(43)456 - Memorandum by the Secretary of StateMinute 3) . for Dominion ilffairs.W,P,(43)500 - Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion affairs, setting out his views as to the reply to be sent tothe State Department.Y/.P.(43)501 - An analysis of the differences between the first draft of the pro-posed United States communication toMr* de Valera,  as shown to the PrimeMinister at Hyde Park (W.-P. (43) 387)and the later draft forwarded fromthe United States ambassador (^annex B.in W.P.(43)408).THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had now studied the later draft of the proposed communication to Mr.  de Valera.It had clearly been whittled down by the State Department.He thought that this later draft would not achiove any useful purpose, and that a reply should be sent,&apos;, broadly on thelines proposed by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, deprecating the despatch of the communicationari nor: orooosod by the United States Ambassador,The War Cabinet -agreed in principle that a reply should be sent tothe State Department deprecating the dospatchtoMr. de Valera of a communication on the lines pro-posed, and agreed that the terms of this despatchshould be settled by the Prime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it remained to considerwhether any attempt should be made to deal with the irish situation.     He did not agree with the view that we should leave matters as they now stood,  so that Sire would have ablank hand whon peace came.     No doubt the Irish peoplehad behavod very badly and it would be easy to be content with allowing the score of misdeeds to pile up against them,But he was not prepared to write the position off as hope-less without making some attempt to see whether we couldnot get a united Ireland within the British commonwealth and Empire.The Prime Minister added that he was not impressed with the argument that the offers which we had made^in 1940had been rejected.     At that time we had faced the worldalone, and it was perhaps not to be wondered at that theIrish had refused those offers.     He would like to haveliberty to take soundings and see whether it would not be

possible to make a start on the lines which he had in mind.He would, of course,&apos; report progress from time-to time to theWar Cabinet,     There was no reason why anything need be saidto President Roosevelt at this stage,THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said that he thoughtthat our position in Ireland was now considerably better thanit had been     The Irish appreciated the attitLide which wehad adopted towards them during the war,  and to-day theyliked us better than they liked the Americans,     He also thought that, owing to a kind of perverted logic,  the Irishwould be all the more determined not to enter the war on our side now that tho stage had been reached when it was clear. that we v/ere going to win,THE SECRETARY OP STiiTE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said thathe had certain strong convictions on the Irish situation.There were two problems to be faced - partition and neutrality.The difficulty which he saw was that any attempt to link thesetwo problems would only set back a solution of th^ Irishdifficulties.     He was convinced that it was impossible toshift Mr,  de Valora on tho question of neutrality. Tho latterTsi&amp;iolc purpose had ilaroughcut boon to separata Ireland as far aspossible from Great Britain,  and in his Constitution of 1937he had broken almost the last links between Ireland   -andGreat Britain from the Irish point of view.     He had abolishedthe Appeal to the Privy Council and the Oath of Allegiance,and     the     only remaining mention of Tho King&apos;s name was inthe Letters of Credence to diplomats going abroad - whereit was, presumably, retained on the grounds that it was of practical   value in these matters not to. be entirely cut off from the British Empire^In Mr. de Valera&apos;s eyes neutrality was now a symbolof Irish independence.      It had become an act of faith andde Valera could not be moved on this point.     The Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs read an extract from an observer in Ireland (Miss Elizabeth Bowen),  dated 12thOctober, which recorded a hardening of the atmosphere inIreland in favour of neutrality.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Dominionaffairs said that if it was impossible to shift the Irish onneutrality during the war, It was clearly out of the question to make any kind of concession to them in regard to part-ition.     After the war, however, he thought the position might be considerably easier to handle.      The Irish people,strangely enough, would feel that they had been well treated by us in being allowed to stay out of the war;    and they had now a greatly increased respect for the British people andfor the justice of our attitude towards them.He therefore favoured not making any approach until after the war, and ho feared that any approach now wouldrevive tho eld bitterness and distrust.     Lorsovor, many people :&apos;ui this country would be opposed to negotiations withniro   -t tne present time.He Thiow* however- that, gone Ministers held.andiffernitview;    am. if it was a question of some unofficial emissarymaking enquiries on his own initiative as to nr, doValeraTsframe of wind tow\rdn neutrality,.- ho did not thirds: this-could do any harm, vhil-. it might help to clarify the position.THE LORD -PliliS-IDEITT OP THE COUNCIL  expressed generalagreement with.tho Secretary of State for Dominion   Affairs&apos;views as to opinion in Ireland,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT saidthat at tho prosont stage he had not, of course, thought it right to make any contacts on this mattor with the PrimeMinister of Northern Iroland.     Ho did not, however, imagine that the Government of Northern Ireland had in mind thopossibility of any arrangement being come to at the present&apos;-2-

time..      He thought that    if the issue of neutrality was raised. Mr. de Valera would inevitably switch on to the partition question,     For his own part, while he wouldlike to see a united Ireland, he thought that we could onlyagree to this on-the condition that the defence of theUnited Ireland was made a responsibility of tho UnitedKingdom.      If this was not done, there would be a risk that,  in another war, we might find ourselves faced.with a United Ireland which was neutral.     This would be intolerable   from the defence point of view.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was,  of course,clear that the loyal North had saved us from having toconquer the rest of Ireland with British arms.     If wehad needed tho Irish ports as a matter of life and death,he had no doubt that we should have gone and taken them;and that we would have been right to have done so.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE saidthat 5,000 Irish a month were now coming to this country,and he was very reluctant to see any action taken whichmight start up an   agitation among the large numbers of irish people now working over here.      The main issue was,he thought,  one of timing;    and on the whole he would prefer that no action should be taken until (a) theeducation controversy had been settled and (b) we had captured Rome.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was not afraid of the results of a public appeal in this matter.     Oneplan might be that he should make a speech in which hewould appeal to the rank and file of the Irish people overthe heads of their leaders.     There were many elementswho would be glad to come in on the winning side and, more-over, would be glad to be on our side in a quarrel inwhich we were in the right.     He added that,   in hisapproach to this question ho was influenced less by reportsof public opinion   than by a great urge to find a remedyto the present state of affairs, notwithstanding the risks and difficulties involved.      It was, of course, clear thatwe should never bring pressure to bear on Northern Ireland.As regards timing, he feared that, if we left mattersuntil.the end of the war,  it would bo very much harderto get a solution.     He did not see what we should gain by not raising the issue until after the war.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE saidthat he thought that after the war, when the large volumeof employment for Irish labourers in this country came toan end, Mr.  de Valera would have economic troubles whichwould make him more likely to want to come to an agreementwith us.THE MINISTER OF nIRCRAFT PRODUCTION said that he wasin favour of doing all that could be done to find asolution of the Irish question.      But it was important tosettle what sort of approach was going to be made.     Hethought that while the Irish would not give up neutrality,which was now a sort of myth for them,  they might be pre-pared to take some friendly steps towards us.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wanted to see some action to lift the matter on to a higher plane.     nothing could be worse than a continuance of the present position.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he favouredsoundings being taken,    .THE MINISTER OF STATE said he would like to seepartition ended, and as soon as possible.     We   were,     ,

however, faced with a considerable &amp;il&quot;emraa. He thought itwas true that if we allowed the Southern IMsh to remain neutraluntil the end of the war they would realise that they werein our debt on this account, that they were dependent onus, and would be more ready on that account to accepta reasonable settlement;    on the other hand it would thenbe more difficult to get Northern Ireland to agree to anychange in their position if Southern Ireland had remainedneutral throughout the war,THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thought that our best opportunity might come after the war when thoseIrishmen who had fought with us in this war returned toIreland.     ii Government which contained many of those whohad fought for us in the war would be more likely to help us.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR aIR said that ho shared the Prime Minister&apos;s urge to try and deal with the irish situation, notwithstanding the difficulties involved.    Onthe question whether anything effective could bo done atthe present time, he thought that nothing could be doneby negotiating with de   Valera.      But there were othersbehind him and he would like to know what were the viewsof Mr. Dillon and of the leaders of the Church.      Hethought that the matter should be explored and soundingsmadeiTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that nearly everything whichhad been said that evening reminded him of what had been said in comparable discussions in 1917?&quot;.      The only newpoint raised had been what Mr. Bevin had said   as to the fear of industrial unrest, but he thought that if negotiating-negotiations were started the Minister of Labour would be ableto handle this side of the matter.The Lord Privy Seal said that he favoured an attemptbeing made now to deaj, with the Irish question.      It wasin our favour that we were now much stronger than in 1940;while Mr,  de Valera&apos;s position had weakened;    and the farmers&apos; party was now strongly hostile to him.      Itwould be a tragedy if Ireland was to continue to the end ofthe war to pursue a separate policy to that of GreatBritain.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hoped that theWar.Cabinet would agree that he might make careful soundingHe would, of course, exercise great caution in any stepshe took.      In particular, ho would have to watch there actions of the Conservative Party;    but he thought thatthe Northern Ireland people knew that he would never bringcoercion to bear upon them.      He-would also bear in mind the differences of view which had been expressed in theCabinet on the matter.This course was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS asked thathe might bo consulted by tho Prime Minister as to thenature of the sounding which he proposed to take.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he regretted that hecould not agree to this course-.      It had been laid down atthe Imperial Conference of 1918 that the Prime minister had the absolute right to correspond direct with the PrimeMinisters of the Dominions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said that,as the Minister responsible for the Department which dealtwith relations with Eire, he would be held responsible by-4-

Parliament for the policy pursued in regard to eire*     If therefore, action was to be taken of which he was to be kept in ignorance, hewould have to consider his position.THE PRIME MINISTER said that everyonewas free to do that.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.
