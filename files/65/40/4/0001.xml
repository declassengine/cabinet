The War Cabinet considered two Memoranda by the plans Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Labour and NationalService and the Home Secretary (W.P.(43)255 and 324) and aNote by the Prime Minister (W.P.(43)308;  covering a Memo-randum by the late Chancellor of the Exchequer,     ThoseMemoranda dealt with the stage at which decisions shouldbo reached on reconstruction plans;    and in particular withthe question whether such decisions must bo deferred (iffinancial commitments were involved) until our post-warfinancial position was definitely known.9^THE LORD PRESIDENT said that we wore noaring, if wohad not already reached, a point at which the formulation of post-war policy would be hold up if it wore necessary that,before final decisions were  oaken, we should wait until wo knewwhen, and in what conditions, the war would endc     reports were now becoming available on many of the&apos; matters.     Theperiod for preparing plans was coming to an end;    and if further progress was to be made,  decisions on those reportsmust now be taken.     Decisions could and ought to be taken onthe basis of the best assumptions we could make about con-ditions at the end of the war.     There wore many subjects onwhich the formulation of policy could not await the end ofthe war:    if decisions had not been taken and preparatoryaction put in hand, the end of the war would find usunprepared.     Wo should then have    lost the power to influence the course of events.It had sometimes been argued that it would be inexped-ient to try to go too far in the&apos; formulation of post-war policy for fear of raising political controversy on Partylines.     He believed, however, that on many of these questionsthere would be a large measure of agreement between ministers of different political Parties.     The discussions in cabinet committees had so far disclosed relatively little     difference of view on Party linos, and the Government could now, withoutrisk of serious Party controversy, proceed to make certain assumptions on which decisions regarding post-war policy-could be based.      This would enable us to advance, and in somecases complete,  our preparations for meeting the immediate needsof the post-war period; and, where this course was necessary,we oould proceed to pass during the war legislation to giveeffect to those plans which would come into operation onappointed days.THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OP HOME SECURITY&apos;endorsed these views.     Much of the preparatory work was nowreaching a point at which decisions by the War Cabinet worerequired^     The  question was whether the War Cabinet would boprepared to take decisions on these matters, or whetherdecisions were to be deferred, either because the V/ar   cabinet was too much preoccupied with the conduct of the war or because they considered they had no mandate from the electorate.

to roach decisions on those matterso      There wore no doubtsome questions on which the Government would not be justifiedin taking a final decision without further reference to theelectorates     But there wore   many others on which decisions would have to bo taken before the end of the &quot;war if we wereto bo ready with measures to bridge the transition from war to peace and to meet the grave difficulties of the transitionalpcriodo      In the international field, we had already made a start in the discussion of post-war economic policy      Gouldwe not make similar progress on domestic issues?     We shouldnot be procludod from discussing these questions on their merits merely because seme of them had been the subject ofpolitical controversy in tho paste      On some of them indeed    iit was not possible tc delay decisionso      Thus, when the-promised White Paper on the comprehensive scheme of social insurance was presented to Parliament? it would bo essential for the Government to say whether or not they meant tointroduce legislation on this subject before the end of thowar0     Again the prospect of a world shortage of food wouldforce the Government to commit themselves to a statement on agricultural policy in the throe or four years following thewar0      Should we not therefore take tho opportunity of seeinghow far agreement could bo reached on some of the other questions which would bo of cardinal importance in tho trans-itional periods      If such an attempt were made, he believedthat there would be a large measure of agreement between ministers,;    and it would be a matter for very great regret iftho present opportunity for formulating a common policy duvi-vthose years were lostoTHE PRIME,MINISTER recalled that the Memoranda whichthe War Cabinet now had before them had been written more than three months previouslyo      In the interval there had been a labour Party Conference at which it had been made clear that,if the Party called on tho Labour Ministers to withdraw fromthe Government after the war these Ministers would resignofficeo      This was a new factor in the situation,,      There wereobvious objections to formulating post-war policies, and stillmore to giving effect to them in legislation, if there were no assurance of tho continued co-oporation of the LabourMinisters after the warQTho Prime Minister also referred to the great uncortaln-ty about tho course of the war.     He recalled tho dangers ofthe campaigns on which we should bo required to ombark in 1944oWe were approaching the grimmest climax of the war o     In thesecircumstances he found the greatest difficulty In giving thatclose attention which he would like to be able to give to thogroat social changes which were involved in the discussion of post-war policy^     While preparations should be made,  includ-ing   whore necessary legislative preparations, ho found itdifficult to formulate at this stage policies more precise thanthose which he had outlined in tho four-year plan which hehad announced in his broadcast on 22nd MarchoHe would, however, bo prepared to consider any matters in which it could bo shown that necessary preparations were Infact being held up for lack of decisions by the War    CabinotoHo referred to post-war agricultural policy (to bo discussed by tho War Cabinet on the following day)  and to the assurance,which he had given in the House of Commons on the previous day,that tho coal-raining industry would not bo left unprotectedimmediately tho war was ovor*-    Preparations were being madefor a substantial building programme;    plans could be made forprogrammes of public works;    and there  was   ample scope forovertaking arrears In the manufacture of consumer goods0     Oneof our most urgont tasks after the war would be to recapture our export markets and,  if possible, restore our shipping trade; buthe was not aware that the necessary preparations in these fieldsv/ere being held up for lack of decisions by tho War Cabineto

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AHD NATIONAL service said that if discussions could proceed concurrently onsuch questions as Agriculture and the Coal Industry,it would be easier to reach decisions without gettinginvolved in political controversy.     For example, he himself would be prepared to roach an agreement on thescheme put up by the agricultural Departments, althoughit was not fully in accord with his views, providedthat a proper plan was also made for dealing with someof the basic industries like the coal industry.     Hewas not by any moans committed to a scheme of nationalisation but regarded it as essential that the basic industries should be so organised that theywould be able to meet efficiently the difficulties withwhich they would be faced after the War.      Apart from coal,  electricity and water supply were services whichin the national interest ought to be brought under some form of national control;    and he would have thought that this could be done without giving rise-to any political diff iculiiy.The Minister referred to the statements whichhad been made on behalf of the Government on theSeveridge Scheme,  to the effect that it was impossibleto reach a final decision at that time,.     He thoughtthat if the same doctrine had been strictly appliedto the Education Bill,  it might have been decided thatthat Bill could not be introduced at the present time that view, however, he was glad to say, had not beentaken.The Minister said that he was at the presentmoment trying to got the Trades Union Congress toagree to the continuance of certain, labour controlsfor a period after the end of the war.      It would bedifficult to get the T..U.C. to accept this, but hewould do his best to got them to see that it wasnecessary in the national interest.      Ho thought that other political Fartius should,  similarly, be preparedto make concessions in&apos; the national interest.Reference was,  at this stage, made to&apos;- theamendment of the Trade Disputes Act,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  if agreement wasreached after the war by the Government on theintroduction of a concerted programme of half a dozenmeasures,  it might well be that the amendment to theTrade Disputes Act could be Included among them.     Asthe.. V/ar Cabinet knew, he had been anxious that -thereshould be an examination, into the question whetherindustrial, as opposud to political;, affiliation ofCivil Service Trade Unions, could be allowed,  since this he believed would improve relations with theTrades Unions;    but any proposals to amend the Act metstrong resistance from the Conservative Party.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICEthen said that he was afraid that, if all these questio2lswere left for decision until the end of the war,  itwould bp impossible to get the necessary action takenin time.      For example, one of the first needs would beto prevent the home market from absorbing too much ofour production at the expense of the export trade.If this occurred, we should miss our opportunity ofrecovering our export markets.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL agreeI, anasaid that there wore many questions affecting trade andindustry which were&apos; urgent and raised no Party issues-,THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that demobilisationwas of the utmost importance and -urgency, as were the plans for the expansion of the building industry.These, he agreed,  involved no Party issuo.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP Tifi COUNCIL&apos; said that thebuilding programme could not be finally settled untildecisions had been reached on the- location of industry,.This involved very far-reaching issues.THE MINISTER Of PRODUCTION drew a distinctionbetween -preparations for the restarting of industry,in particular the export trade.    He saw no particular difficulty in reaching decisions on this group of questionsduring the war;    and questions which involved expenditure ofsome proportion of our available resources,as for example the Severidge Plan.      Itwas, he thought, far more difficult toreach decisions at this stage .on questions in this second category.THE PRIME MlnlofjR mentioned the aircraft industry as one of those which would be faced with most difficult problems after the wain      NotwibhStandingall the plans which were now being made with regardto civil aviation,  it was clear that the aircraft industry would not Pe able to support more than asmall proportion of the highly skilled personnel whohad been drawn into it.      This was a serious problem.Plans ought to be made for the rapid transfer of labour from war production to peace production.THE PAYMASTER GIELIRAL thought that a distinction should be drawn between those reconstruction plans which we must carry out and those which wore desirableprovided that we could find the means to carry them outV/o should concentrate,  in the first instance, on thefirst class.     -as regards the second,  the Chancellorof the Exchequer might prepare a draft post-war Budget,THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said thatthe two classes mentioned by the Paymaster Generalwere in fact inseparably connected.      Thus, housing was largely dependent, not only on the location of industry but also on the distribution of purchasing power, whichin turn was dependent upon the scheme of social service this had been prominently brought out in the economic discussions at Washington,  in which the need had been emphasised for an adequate and effective demand for goods.(i)(ii)

TEC&apos;! HOME SSCRT/EARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITYsaid that tho improvement of social services was all-important,  as providing a cushion to deal with thediffico.lt transition stage which.wo would have to faceafter the war.      Unless the Government went ahead withcompleting post-war schemes, he thought that a situation would arise at the end of the war in which theGovernment of the day would be faced with a great number of difficult problems which they would be unableto solve.      For example, what was to be the positionin the mining industry?     He had an open mind on theposition, but he felt certain that plans must be pushedahead now,  if we were to avoid a period of dislocationat the end of the war.Tile PRIME MINISTER thought it would be helpful if the War Cabinet could be informed rather morespecifically of the problems in regard to which decisions ought to be reached and what prevented such decisions from being reached.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL referred tothe third paragraph of W.P.(43)  255, which referredto the following:-The use of land;Development rights and compensation;Water supply;The financing of the building programme;Reorganisation of transport, heatand power.The Budgetary implications of these and similar matters.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he thoughtthat the rate of progress already made in the field of reconstruction plans, taken as a whole, was very substantial!..      On the Bcveridge Report, much progress had been made and he hoped shortly to be in a positionto report to the Cabinet.      On planning,  he wasdisturbed at the absence of substantial progress.    Forhis&apos;own part, he thought that the scheme put forward in the Uthwatt Report was not a practicable one, andthe Government were faced in this matter with a veryintractable problem.     As regards agriculture, he-thought that the Government would be forced to make adecision quite soon.      The prospective world shortageof food would compel us to place long-term contracts for overseas supplies in order to safeguard our food supplies.      As a corollary to this, we should have togive some assurance to our own agricultural industryover a similar period.TBU PRIME MINISTER said he regretted that it wasnot possible to continue the discussion further on that day,    He proposed that it should be resumed on thefollowing Thursday at 5.30 p.m., and on succeedingThursdays until decisions had been reached.    lie thoughtthat it would bo helpful if the &apos;War Cabinet could begiven a list of four or five major projects on which,in the view of the Ministers concerned,  decisions were called for but were at present being delayed.Offices of tho War Cabinet,
