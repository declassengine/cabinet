Eden at Cairo and that it was hoped they would botharrive in Moscow that night.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the russians had now demanded that the Mediterranean commission should be given administrative powers over the control commission in Italy.      This was entirely contrary towhat we had said at the time when proposals for theestablishment of. a Commission had first been made.It was clearly out of the question for us, havingregard to the interests of our troops fighting in italy, to agree that the powers of control should boremoved from the person of the Commander-in-Chief.The State Department viewed with favour requestswhich had been received from the Chinese and BrazilianGovernments to bo represented on the MediterraneanCommission..      This suggestion however wouldcloarlymake the Commission an ineffective body.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the War cabinet had seen the answer received from Premier Stalin inreply to his telegram (T. 1464/3) announcing oursend four convoysto North Russia and intention toasking for better treatment for our personnel in north Russia.      This answer (T.  1625/3) was couched in an unhelpful and grudging tone and he (the PrimeMinister) had been sorely tempted to send a reply, tothe effect that, if the Russians would not mitigate the ill-treatment of our personnel in North Russia,&quot;we should not send the convoys. But&apos; it was clearly ri&amp;Irthat we should send the convoys,  in the interests ofthe war effort,  if we could possibly manage to do so,and he had accordingly asked the Foreign Secretary to handle the matter in Moscow.      In the meantime, hehad seen the newly appointed Russian Ambassador,Mr. Gusev, and had handed back to him Premier Stalin&apos;telegram, saying that he was not prepared to receiveit and that Mr. Eden would deal with the matter orallyin Moscow.    (Sec Tt 1660/3 from the Prime Minister tothe Foreign Secretary).In further discussion, the Prime ministers aid that he thought it would be a great advantage ifthe Russians delivered their messages in Russian and let us arrange for their translation.     He felt sure that thetranslations made were often very crude and that the toneof the original was often lost in the process oftranslation.offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,
