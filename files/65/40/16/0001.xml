The War Cabinet had before them telegram FROZEN 479from the Prime Minister setting out the proposed arrangementsfor the remodelling of commands, which the Prime minister had in view and which he intended to suggest to the Presidentin the near future.      The arrangements proposed were asfollows:OVERLORD(l) General Eisenhower to be Supreme Commander.(2) Air Marshal Tedder to be Deputy Supreme Commanderto General Eisenhower..(3) General Alexander or General Montgomery to beCommander of the allied Armies.(4) Admiral Ramsey to be Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief,    ana(5) Air Marshal Leigh Mallory  to be .Commander-in-Chiefof the All lea Expeditionary j^ir Force.MEDITERRANEAN(l) General Maitland Wilson to be Supreme Commandervice General Eisenhower.      The following would serve under him; -(2) U,S.Canmrdtag General ^lgiors, possible General Devors,(3) Coramander-in-Chief of the armies in Italy,General Montgomery or General Alexander.(4) A General charged with the preparation of-   operation ANVIL, possibly General Clark.(5) A Major-General in charge of Yugoslav assistancemeasures,(6) A Commander-in-Chief, Mideast for operationalpurposes within the Mediterranean theatre,and in charge of Turkish operations.      Forthis General Paget was proposed.t c

O 90 h)(7) The telegram also stated that the Prime minister thought that it would be necessary to give the americans one of the Service commands (in theMediterranean), and that this would evidentlybe the air in which alone they were- the stronger.They would nominate either Brereton or possiblySaker.      Sholto Douglas would be his deputy andalso Commander-in-Chief of all the Royal AirPorce in the Mediterranean theatre.      Park could go to Cairo for the Turkish business.      The PrimeMinister also hoped that General Bedell Smithwould continue Chief of Staff to the supreme commander, Mediterranean theatre,  to tide over   .the  changes.  The Office of Deputy supreme commander now held by Alexander would eitherlapse or be absorbed in that of the Chief of theStaff.      It would have to be held by an American.The !far Cabinet had considerable discussion on theseproposals.      The main point touched on was whether general alexander or General Montgomery should command the OVERLORDExpeditionary Army.      The general opinion of Mindsters wasin favour of General Montgomery, both on merits and fromthe point of view of its reception by public opinion.      some ministers, however, favoured General Alexander havingregard, not merely to his achievements, but also to the capacity which he has shown to work smoothly with the americans.Some uneasiness was also expressed at the proposal that the Chief of Staff in both theatres should be an american.      The view was generally expressed that,  ifpossible, an effort should be made to secure that a british officer held one of these appointments, probably the post of Chief of Staff to General Wilson, although this would very likely mean retaining the post of Deputy SupremeComma nder.The War Cabinet&apos;s decision was that a telegram should be sent expressing general agreement with the PrimeMinister&apos;s proposals, but drawing attention to the views expressed on the question whether General Montgomeryrather than General Alexander would be the better choice forcommand of the OVERLORD Expeditionary Porce, and alsoexpressing the hope that the Chief   of Staff in boththeatres would not be AmericanoThe War Cabinet also agreed that having regard tothe Prime Minister1 s illness their comments should besent,  in the first instance to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff./Note:    See GRAND Nos.   600* and 609*17of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.

GRAND NO. 60915th December, 1943.For MartinPlease hand following to G.I.G.S. on return.     from secretary of State for War.1. War Cabinet tonight discussed proposals in FROZEN 479.In the circumstances now prevailing they asked me to send you their reactions to them.2. The War Cabinet are in general agreement with theseproposals but would like you to know their views on thefollowing points.3. The decision must, of course, be taken on military grounds.     But it was the view of the War Cabinet that publicopinion here will be surprised and rather uneasy at thesubstitution of, Eisenhower1 for Marshall,,     From this pointof view they are disposed to think that Montgomery wouldbe a better choice than Alexander for OVERLORD.      some ministers, including myself, also prefer Montgomery toAlexander on out nhidgment of their military merits for this.job.4. They assume that Bedell Smith will come as Eisenhower&apos;Chief of Staff after six or eight weeks, and that thereafter the Chiefs of Staff in both theatres will be American,,    Itis not clear vrtiether this qtzestion is still open.     If it is,the War Cabinet would like to see the balance redressed.One way of doing thus would be by leaving a Depiity supreme commander in the Mediterranean who could be American.     TheChief of Staff would then be British,5, War Cabinet do not propose to send these comments tothe Prime Minister for the present at any rate.     They arecontent to leave these matters in your hands, if you find that decision has to be taken before you return to thiscountry.TOO 152332ZCirculationDeputy Prime minister foreign SecretaryFirst Sea LordC . 1.

I had previously told him thiswould be an acceptable alternative to us.Marshall, it&apos; appears, cannot leave the unitedStates for political reasons as he is a pillar ofthe Administration.2. Naturally I have given much thought tothe extensive remodelling of the commands whichmust follow and have discussed the matter with theOIGS.     I should be glad if you would mention the following arrangements to the Cabinet, as i must also suggest to the president with the least possible delay,3. I have always thought that Alexanderwould succeed Eisenhower, but am convined by thearguments of the OIGS. Eisenhower and others thatit would be impossible for hirn or Montgomery toact as supreme Commander and at the same timefight the battles which will take place in Italyafter the conquest of Rome.     Alexander by himselfsaw this.     i therefore propose General MaitlandWilson as Supreme Commander vice Eisenhower, havingsatisfied myself that this is supported by the bestopinion and will be agreeable to the president andwin the approval of General Marshall./Para 4,   Under him

Park from Malta, formerlyof no.11 Group, -could .go to Cairo for the Turkishbusiness^?6,. Political assistance will be provided for&quot;the supreme commander   .(a) By Messrs. Macmillan and Murphy who workhand in hand.(b) From the French angle by Duff cooper and &apos;(c) From the Middle Eastern area by the Ministeiof state or his successor.7,. Hope that General Bedell-smith will continueChief of the staff at any rate for the first 2 months ormore so as to tide over the changes.    The office ofDeputy supreme commander now held by Alexander willeither lapse or be absorbed in that of chief of the staf:It must be held by an American,/8.    You will,.

/American .&quot;8. You will understand that I have given most careful consideration to the appointment of sir HenryMaitland v/ilson, having regard to his age, and I am satisfied that for the great co-ordinating task whichwill be entrusted to him, he has all the qualifications and the necessary vigour.    This is also the opinion ofthe C.I.G.S.-9, Turning to the OVERLORD theatre,. I proposethat Tedder shall be Eisenhower&apos;s Deputy supreme commander on account of the great part the air will play in this operation, and this is most agreeable toEisenhower,    Either Alexander or Montgomery willcommand the Expeditionary Army,    Ramsey is alreadyassigned to the Fleet, for which he has unique -experience, and Leigh Mallory to the air,Eisenhower-would prefer to have Alexander, and is willing to have only one group of Armie!s command inthe early months if that can be arranged,    I havenot made up my mind whether it will be   Alexanderor Montgomery, but the C.I.G.S. is staying withAlexander now, and when he rojoins me in a few daysI shall be able to take a decision.10, These appointments must be settled in thenext fortnight, and no doubt the Americans will have their own counter suggestions about their own people,I think however that what I have put down here isprobably pretty well what they will ask,11, I shall be glad to hear from you that, inprincipal, my colleagues concur in these proposals onwhich I have spent much time and thought and which itwould have been impossible to shape except upon the spot.    I will then telegraph togthe President, who should be back about the 16th. til very much regret that on account of my illness and fever, whichcontinue, I have not been able to visit the Italian ^front,    I still hope to do so after I have recoveredT.0,0. 141855Z.CIRCULATION.-Deputy prime Minister.,Foreign secretary.First sea Lord.C, I.
