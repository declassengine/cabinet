This hod resulted in a heavy localin Harbour concentration of gas, and a number of gas casualtiesbad occurred in H.M.  ships and among merchant seamen.Immediately after the raid the harbour hadbeen cleared, but as it was not at once realised what had happened, the number of casualties had been greaterthan might otherwise have been the case.      Several ships had arrived at other ports in the heel of Italy and atAugusta still   contaminated. Steps.had been quicklytaken to decontaminate the ships, but there had beena number of deaths.Orders had been given that the casualtiesshould be entered as due to chemical burns, but thefact that a ship containing gas bombs had been hit was widely known in Bari.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.........^.^-^^0^^............W.M.J45) 176TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUT3 confidential Annex(28th December,  1943 - 5.30 p0 m. )FOREIGN-AFFAIRS TUP SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS--- informed the War Cabinet that the following information had been given to ELM. Ambassador at Angora by thePeace Feelers       Turkish Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs, who hadreceived it from the Roumanian Minister at Angora.The German Minister at Bucharest had recentlyCalled in uniform on the Roumanian Minister for ForeignAffairs and had made a statement that Germany was prepared to accept peace on the following terms:-(a) Surrender of fleet, submarines, merchant &apos;fleet, air force.(b) C omp1e t e di s armam e nt.(c) Evacuation of all conquered territories.(d) Undertaking never to ask for return of colonies.(e) Europe to be organised according to wishes of Allies.(f) Economic freedom thereafter for Germany tobe arranged as found suitable by theAllies.The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed the Roumanian Minister at Angora that he refusedto communicate this statement to His Majesty&apos;ambassador;    but finally he had done so privately as&quot;news&quot;.      His object in refusing to communicate this statement officially was that, in view of presentTurkish attitude towards entry into the war, he didnot wish us to think that he was seeking a way out by encouraging such a move.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he was sending a telegram to the Prime Minister to the effect that he found it difficult to treat this offer seriously.      TheGerman Minister at Bucharest was not the type of personthrough whom it was   likely    that a peace offer would besent.      Moreover,   it was difficult to see why theGermans should use as an intermediary in this matter theMinister of a country which was such an unreliablesatellite of Germany.      He thought that it was by nor-, means impossible that the Roumanians had invented thestatement in order to obtain a reply from us which theycould pass to the Germans as an offer emanating from us.He accordingly pro nosed to suggest to the Prime minister that the offer should be ignored, but that we should tell the Russian and United States Governments of it   for-/hot it was worth,--1-

Our Ambassador- at Angora should also he told to look out for any developments that might throw light&apos; upon, it,.,The War Cabinet approved this coursecTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that,   as the War     ,Cabinet would have seen, the recent pronouncements byMarshal Tito were not in accord with the views which&apos;Tito had expressed to Brigadier Maclean about King Peter,The Foreign Secretary said that Marshal Titohad sent a mas so go to the Prime Minister wishing him a rapid recovery.,      The Prime Minister    thought that itwould be worth while making his reply the occasion forinforming Marshal Tito that, while he would have nofurther dealings with Mihailovic, - it would not bechivalrous or honourable for Great Britain to castaside the King of Yugoslavia,, who had escaped as a boyand come to this  country as a ye-ahg prince in distress.;While therefore ^e should continue to give military support to Marshal Tito, we intended to continueofficial relations with the King of Yugos la via andhis Government,&quot; .   ,The Foreign Secretary said that he had one ortwo minor suggestions to make on the Prime Minister&apos;sdrafts but he thought that a message on the lines proposed would certainly do no harm, and might wellhelp in the difficult undertaking of building a bridgebetween Marshal Tito and King Peter,The War Cabinet approved the course proposed,,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had also received a telegram from our Anibas sadoi-- to the yugoslav government in Cairo to the effect that we ought to breakat once with General Mihailovic,The Foreign Secretary said he had informed our ambassador that he was prepared to recommend this course to the War Cabinet; but that he must have proofs thatGeneral Mihailovic hod collaborated with the enemy,  eventhough the proofs might be of such a nature that theycould not be publicly disciosedaTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR asked whether itwas not sufficient to point to the fact that GeneralMihailovic had refused to  comply with our request thathe should carry out a certain operation,  and ha, d alsorefused to meet the British Officer sent to contact him,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat&quot; General Mihailovic had been asked to carry out acertain operation on the following day, and it thereforeremained to bo seen whether he would comply with this request,.The Foreign Secretary also said that GeneralMihailovic had asked us to try to patch things up between him and Marshal Tito,    He had informed our Ambassador to.the Yugoslav Government that we should take the line -thatit was now too late for us to act as an intermediary,. and that if General Mihailovic wished to make an appealto Marshal Tito,  he should do so direct;,The War Cabinet took note of this statement.

&amp;ip 9 9Greece(previous reference erencW.i;I. (43)ConclusiMnute 2160thons ,)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that both Zervasand E.L.&quot;A.S.  had now made an approach to us and were anxious that Hmr bands should stop fighting each other.The United States had given us strong support in thismatter, but the Russian attitude had been rather morecautious.The Foreign Secretary said that he had informed our Ambassador to the Greek Government tha.t,in view of the changed attitude of the leaders ofE.L.A.S., the supply of food, etc.  to the E.L.A.S. bandscould now be resumed.      Subject to the views of theCOmmander-in-Chief.there was also no reason why thesupply of arms should not also be resumed to E.L.A.S.bands which were engaged in fighting the enemy.The Foreign Secretary added that there wasalso some indication that the Germans were worriedabout the position in the Peloponnese,  and he thoughtthat the Chiefs of Staff might, perhaps,  considerwhether, on military grounds,  it would not be worthwhile taking special steps to supply food and arms to theguerilla bands in Greece.      He assumed,  however, thatthis would mean some diversion of effort from elsewhere,since, at the moment, nearly all the available resources were being devoted to sending supplies to Marshal&apos;Tito 1sPartisan troops.THE CHIEF   OP THE, AIR STAFF and THE VICECHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that theChiefs of Staff would look into the points mentioned by the Foreign Secretary.        The utilisation of theavailable aircraft was, of course,  a matter for the&apos;) i r C omma n der -in-Chief,vhose command covered bothMediterranean Allied Air Forces,Yugoslavia and Greece.Thevr Cabinet took note of these statements,Offices of the WarCabinet,q  v; 1
