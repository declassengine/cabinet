CcfcKw Wo*...W.M.(43)l56TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential   kxmex(17th November, 1943 - 12 noon)DEFENCE THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITY saidREGULATION     that he was considering whether Sir Oswald Mosley should be18B. released from detention on medical grounds.     The HomeSecretary said that the responsibility in this matter mustof course rest with him personally, but in view of thepolitical considerations involved he thought it right that his colleagues should be aware of the position andshould have an opportunity of letting him know their   views.Sir OswaldMos3ey suffered from tbrombo-phlcbitis,   and some time ago a report had been received from his solicitor that his health was getting worse.      He had been given all practicablefacilities for medical treatment while in detention.     Hehad perhaps not been very corporative recently;  but in any even this condition   had deteriorated.     Recently Lord Dawson ofPerm had seen him and had said that he was not certain thatcontinued detention might not be dangerous to his health.The Home Secretary said that he had contemplatedseeking medical advice independent both of the prison doctors and of Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s doctor, but at this stage LordDawson had proposed a conference of all the medical adviserswho had recently been in attendance on Sir Oswald Mosley.He (the Home Secretary) had agreed to this conference,-which had been attended by Lord Dawson of Penn, Dr.  GeoffreyEvans (Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s own doctor), the MedicalCommissioner of Prisons,  and the two prison doctors whohad recently attended the case.The collective judgment of this conference had beenthat if Sir Oswald Mosley continued to be kept in detention,there was a substantial risk that his physical conditionwould suffer further deterioration with permanent damage&quot;toThe Home Secretary said that,  in the circumstances, hethought that the right course would be to suspend the detention Order in Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s case subject to conditions designed to imposo the strictest   practicablelimitations on any political activities.The question then arose whether Lady Mosley, who wasdetained in the same quarters as her husband,  should alsobe released.&apos;     On humanitarian groiuads there was a strong case for letting her out5  since it could be said that her husband would need her presence and help owing to his physicalcondition.      It was also true that one of the reasons whyshe had been detained had been in order to prevent him frommaintaining, through her visits to him while he was in detention, contacts with some of his previous associates;and this consideration would no longer apply once her husband&apos;had been released.      On the whole,&apos;the Home Secretary was disposed to take the view that,  although a case could be made

out for continuing to keep Lady Mosley in detention afterher husband had been released, the Detention Order in hercase should be suspended at the same time.The Home Secretcases, he had been csons still in detentstantial number had of the serious casesDomvile and Mr. John,a further review whiof those persons stiof persons of hostillead to the release5ary said that,  apart from these twoarrying out a general review of per-ion under Regulation 18B0     A sub-already been released,  including some, e,g0 Mrs. Nicholson, Sir BarryBeckett.     He had been contemplatingch would result in the release of most11 in detention with the exception e0go,o origin and association^      This wouldamong others,  of Captain Ramsay, M.P,The Home Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that the test in this matter must be whether the detained persons would,  if released, be dangerous to our security,,The War Cabinet generally agreed with the HomoSecretary&apos;s conclusion that the Detention Order against SirOswald Mosley should now be suspended on medical groundssubject to the imposition of proper safeguards;    and thatLady Mosley should also be released subject to similarsafeguards.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR asked that he should be recorded as disagreeing from this view on the ground that the releaseof Sir Oswald Mosley would weaken morale and would have an unfortunate effect on negotiations and discussions in theindustrial field.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was not entitled to take these considerations into account as decisive factors whendeciding whether to retain a man in detention.On the more genera..:, issues raised by the HomeSecretary,  the view of the War Cabinet was that it would bedesirable to draw a sharp distinction between the action proposed on medical grounds in the case of Sir.Oswald,and any further review of persons still in detention.     Itwould indeed be preferable that a certain period of time should elapse after the release of Sir Oswald and LadyMosley   before this further, review took place..   Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.X&quot;     NOTE:The Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 30th November sent forme a propos of developments on the Mosley case.     He said thathe had been reading the Confidential Annex to the discussion on the 17th November and thought that two sentences were notaccurately expressed.      The first was the sentence in themiddle of the second page which reads as follows:%0 &quot;The War Cabinet agreed generally with the HomeSecretary&apos;s conclusion........&quot;He pointed out that this was not strictly consistent with theconstitutional position which was accurately set out in thefirst paragraph of the minute./over
This, however,  was less important than the ensuingparagraph which the Minister of Labour asked &quot;that heshould be recorded as disagreeing from this view&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he blamed himselffor not having taken the Minister of Labour up whenhe asked that he should be recorded as being in dis-agreernent, seeing that there was no question either of the Cabinet recording a formal decision insupport of the Home Secretary&apos;s view, or of a part-particular Minister dissenting therefrom.The Chancellor of the . ucchequer said that hethought it would be right that a note to this effect should be recorded in my copy of the file, but he did hot suggest that the minute should, at thisstage, be recalled.I should perhaps add that I was not aware of thispoint when drafting the minute.      It is to be notedthat no formal conclusion was recorded, but as In fact the War Cabinet had expressed their general agreementwith the Home   Secretary&apos;s proposed action (althoughperhaps somewhat informally),. and as the Minister ofLabour asked to be recorded as disagreeing therefromand po-one     had     disputed     his action, I felt bound to record what hau happened.
