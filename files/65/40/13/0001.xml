(W.P.(43)  526).This Memorandum referred to telegrams from.M. Ambassador to the Greek Government(Nos. 362 and 364 of 17th and 18th November)which showed that the situation was deteriorating and that further delay in reaching a decision on the main issues ofpolicy would be dangerous.The Poreign Secretary accordingly proposedthat authority should be given to theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East,  and toMr.  Leeper to work out, in conjunction, theaction to be taken in the military sphere onthe lines orooosed in Mr.  Leeoer&apos;s telegramNo.  364.This plan of action would involve thefollowing stages:-(i) The King should be informed that we did not intend to renew our support of E.L.A.3.  andshould be persuaded,  on this understanding,to make a declaration that he would not return to Greece until invited to do so bya properly constitutional and representative government on Greek soil after the liberation of Greece.(ii) If the King agreed to this suggestion atelegram should be sent to Zervas informing him privately of the above and telling himto ask the King that his bands should be incorporated in the Greek Regular Army.

(iii) Zervas1 request should at once bo accepted and a senior Greek Officer sent to his headquarters.(iv) Leaflets should &quot;be dropped over E, L. A. 8.troops, Informing them of the above and ofthe reason why no farther support could begiven to them as at present constituted,,(v) British Liaison Officers should be instructedto accept any genuine requests from ELL, A. 3.hands to be incorporated in the RegularGreek Army   on the same basis as ZervaScTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had reportedto the Prime Minister the upshot of the discussion in theWar Cabinet on 16th November, and that the Prime minister had replied to the effect that he would prefer to wait until the Foreign Secretary arrived in Cairo beforeapproaching the King of Greece.THE VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that the Chiefs of Staff had sent a telegram to-the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle Erst,  informing themthat the matter was  to come before the Cabinet that afternoon,  and that unless a telegram had been received to the contrary, the Chiefs of Staff proposed torecommend a solution on the lines of the proposal putforward by Mr. Leeper.The following points were made in discussion:-(a) Reference was made to the military aspect ofthis proposal a rid its probable effects on the interruption of communications in Greece and the holding of German divisions  in that- area.      In this connection the VICE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF read&apos;extracts from a recent appreciation as to the future military value of E.A.M.  - E.L.A.S., which,  now that theyhave shown their true colours, was believed to be small, although they would probably continue to support us passively on their own terms.(b) Was there any need to inform the RussianGovernment before we took action which might result inthe Germans being able to withdraw some forces from greece?        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that    at the Moscow Conference   he had mentionedthis matter to M. Molotov,  ho showed no interest and said that he regarded the matter as our affair.(c) THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE referred to paragraph 5 of Telegram No.   364 from Mr,  Leeper,   in whichthe Ambassador said that he only proposed that the king of Greece should be asked to make a declaration thathe would not return to Greece until notified to do soby a properly constitutional and representative Governmenton Greek&quot;soil after liberation, thus avoiding the word&quot;plebiscite&quot;.      The Minister suggested that the avoidance of this word might result in robbing theDeclaratbn of much of its value, since plebiscitesformed a regular feature of Greek political life,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed that this point should betaken into consideration.

(a) THE MINISTER OP ECONOMIC WARFARE also asked that full warning of any intended break with theleaders of E.A.M.-E.L.A.S.  should be given to theBritish Liaison Officers.,rfl   (e)   . THE FIRST LORE OF THE ADMIRALTY said that,while agreeing with the course proposed, the admiralty would like a chance of seeing any leaflet which was prepared.      There were already 50 naval units manned by Greeks and their part in the naval war effort was of considerable importance.       This was agreed to..The bar Cabinet -(l) Gave general approval to the courseof action now proposed by the foreign secretary,  i. e.  on the lines indicated in Mr.  Leeper&apos;s TelegramNo.  364.(2) Agreed that the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary should beauthorised to deal with the matterbroadly on these lines,  in&apos; consultation with the MilitaryAuthorities in the Middle East.Offices of the War Cabinet,S.    1.
