W.M. (43) 163RD CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6

Confidential Annex

(29th November, 1943 - 5.30 p.m.)

DEFENCE REGULATION 18B (Previous Reference: W.M. (43) 156th Conclusions. Minute 4).

THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITY said that a number of requests had been made that Sir Oswald and Lady Mosley should once more be put in detention. He assumed that the War Cabinet agreed that there could be no question of this being done. Incidentally if he were to act on these lines his action in again detaining Sir Oswald and Lady Mosley would be open to challenge by the courts.

The War Cabinet endorsed this view.

THE HOME SECRETARY referred to a telegram from the Prime Minister (FROZEN 145) which suggested that, in the debate on the address, the Government Spokesman might advance the view that we were anxious to dispense with our powers under Regulation 18B.  The Home Secretary said that, in his view, it was essential to retain those powers, at least until the war in Europe was over.

The Home Secretary said that certain articles had appeared in the Press, stating that the action which he had taken in this matter had been taken against the advice of one number of the War Cabinet. He referred to this matter with some reluctance; but he assumed the War Cabinet would take the line that he must refuse to be drawn on this point.

The War Cabinet endorsed this very and pointed out that, in any event, proceedings in Cabinet could not be revealed save with the Consent of His Majesty The King.

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE stated that he regretted that he did not see his way to support the action taken by the Home Secretary. He regarded the Mosleys as among the worst enemies of this country. He would not feel able to vote in support of the action which the Home Secretary had taken, and as he would not have recourse to the subterfuge of abstaining from voting if the matter came to a division, he felt that his only course night to be resign from the Government.



THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he felt as strongly as the Minister of Labour in regard to the Mosleys; but he did not think that the suspension of the Detention Order had resulted in Sir Oswald Mosley escaping from the kind of control to which he ought to be subjected. Further, he reminded the War Cabinet that action taken in this matter was the personal responsibility of a particular Minister - the Home Secretary. The Home Secretary&apos;s colleagues in the War Cabinet did not share his responsibilities in this matter in the same sense as in other matters which were the subject of War Cabinet decisions. In a matter of this kind the War Cabinet were entitled to learn from the Home Secretary the action which he proposed to take, and to put to him such consideration as occurred to them. The decision, however, was the Home Secretary&apos;s personal decision; and all that the War Cabinet could then do was to make up their minds whether the Home Secretary had exercised his discretion properly.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that the decisions taken by Home Secretary, in matters of this kind, were very similar to the decisions taken by the Attorney-General as to whether to proceed with or abandon a prosecution in a particular case. On such occasions his Ministerial colleagues had to forbear from bringing pressure to bear on the Attorney-General in favour of, or against, a particular course of action. But when the decisions had been taken, the Government might have to consider whether they could support a Law Officer who had exercised his discretion in a particular way.

Continuing, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as he understood the medical evidence, he thought that the Home Secretary had taken the only course which he or any other Minister in his position could have taken. The Chancellor concluded by saying that if, when he had been Home Secretary, he had allowed his judgement to be ever-ridden by the Cabinet in deciding what people should be detained under Regulation 18B, then his section would have been liable to have been over-ridden by the Courts.

THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER and other Ministers spoke in the same sense, in support of the views put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Following for Prime Minister from Deputy Prime Minister.

In the course of discussion in Cabinet on the Mosley issue yesterday, Bevin expressed himself as strongly critical of Morrison&apos;s action and said that if there was a division, he would be unable to vote with the Government and might have to resign. It was pointed out to him that the decision was the Home Secretary&apos;s and that the question at issue was not that of taking responsibility for the decision which rested with the Home Secretary, but of confidence in a Ministerial colleague.

2. We had hoped to avoid a vote in the House, but the Debate tomorrow was now to take place on an amendment. I should warn you of the possibilities of the situation. Further, it is likely that a number of Labour M.Ps. will vote for the amendment and if there is not a greater number in the Government Lobby, the position of Morrison and myself will be very difficult.
