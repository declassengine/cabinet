&amp; &amp; &amp;BffiSDIATEDEDIP .&apos;&apos;My telegram No, 145.&apos;Following for Prime Minister from Secretary of State.I had- a further conversation with M. Molotov aboutTurkey,2.    I said I had reported my conversation withM, Molotov to London,    There had not, however, been timeto receive a reply,    I was, however, ready to sign anundertaking with M, Molotev to the effect that we would do our best to get Turkey into the war.this year,3,    M, Molotov suggested that we should draw up a protocol containing three points,(1)     That the three Foreign Secretaries considered it necessary for Turkey to come into the war in 1943in her own interests and the interests of all peace-loving nations.(2)    That we should approach Turkey with thisproposal,(3)     That we should now ask Turkey for the use ofair bases,4*    After considerable argument and discussion Ipersuaded M, Molotov that we were in urgent need of bases and that the first step must therefore bo to secure thenecessary facilities and that the entry of Turkey into thewar should be a subsequent step,5.    We therefore agreed upon a protocol, text of whichis contained in my immediately following telegram,    I realise that I am perhaps going somewhat beyond my instructions.,i[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should beretained by the authorised recipient and not passed on]&quot;0&quot;[CYPHER].-. : SPECIAL (EXTRA ,&apos;    FROM MOSCOW TO FOREIGN OFFICE. ,&apos; .&apos;.Sir-A. Clark Kerr D,   3.14 a ,m. - November 2,1943No. 153 Space Nocop&apos;   V&quot; R.   5,00 a,m.\ November 2, 1943November&apos;2, 1943
instructions in undertaking to press the Turks to enter thewar before the end of 194S.   On the other hand the SovietGovernment would not have agreed to our confining ourselves to asking for air bases unless we had undertaken to usepressure on the Turks to come in before the end of the year,In all circumstances therefore, I am convinced that it is inour interest to take this line by which we may obtain the bases now, press Turkey into the war within the next twfimonths and at the same time meet the wishes of the SovietGovernment in this question to which they attach the utmost importance.6.   After leaving M, Molotov, I saw Mr. Hull,   He was inentire sympathy with the policy but said he was unable to subscribe to the protocol without authority from Washington,7.   M. Molotov and I therefore agreed that we two should sign the protocol and that Mr. Hull should, if possible,subscribe to it subsequently.8.   As regards paragraph 5 of the protocol, I have,in agreement with M. Molotov written him a letter/pointing&apos;out that T shall approach Human in Cairo about facilities forair bases, and making it clear that they would only be forour own. use.9, lit Molotov showed no enthusiasm for the suggestionthat our submarines&apos; should enter the Black Sea but-proposedthat this might &quot;be discussed by our naval authorities.10.   We are signing protocol tonight.11.   Please see my immediately following telegram.O.T.P.
