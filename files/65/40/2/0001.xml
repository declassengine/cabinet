He thought it might be desirable for the War Cabinet to have a preliminary&quot; discussion,&apos;without attempting to reach final conclusions.THR LORD pm$XUZ:&apos;2: said that the Viceroy Designatehad asked for guidance on the policy which he should followos taking up office.     Aftor discussions in the IndiapowQittee, general agreement had been reached (the secretaryof State for War dissenting/1 on the line of approach tobe followed.     The essence of the proposal before theWar Cabinet was that the Viceroy should have discretion to explore the practicability of getting a small number of leaders of the different Indian Parties to come to a private discussion among&apos; thoiaseivo^ with a view to the inclusion ofpolitical leaders in the Viceroy&apos;e Executive Council.     Itwould/ however, be: an essential preliminary to the proposeddiscussion that the leaders -(i) should promise whole-hearted support of the war effort ;ill) should recognise that the new Constitution must bebased on agreement betxveen the main elements ofIndiafs national life;    and(iii) should accept the position that, during the war,- , there was no question of any constitutional change and the Viceroy5s pooera would remainuniirrpairsd.

The new Viceroy, on reaching India, was bound to have discussions with prominent Indians in thedifferent communities5 and it was right that ho should knoiin advance how far ho would have the support of the . war cabinet  in the&apos; line v/hich he wished to take.

Theessential disadvantage of the course proposed was that by the mere isoue of the invitation we abandoned theposition that it \fas for Oandhi and the other imprisonedCongress leaders to get themselves oat of the mass into which they had landed thewselves.     The issue of the invitation would restore G-an&amp;hl&apos;a stock to its Old level,and make him once more dangerous to the Government.     Hothought that Jinnah would not declare his attitude until he knew what Gandhi was going to do,THE W&amp;mi:&apos;?MiY OP CiVATd P- :K india agreed with theview expressed by the Minister of Aircraft Productionregarding the need for promoting a favourable atmoephere.It. v/as important to make Indians fool that wo stood by theprinciples to which we were pledged, and that we weroanxious to give then full scope to play their part in thewar effort.     In reply to the irrirae Minis tor he said that,if an invitation was extended to Mr. Gandhi a-ad he refusedto give the pledges aa:.:ed for, we should then bo justifiedin continuing to keep him in detention arid refusing toallow him to communicate with persons outside.     At thesame time, ho thought, it was worth while to give theCongress-leaders an opportunity to withdraw from the.... ^-uq

impossible position in which they had put themselves. He agreed that Gandhi was likely to try to quibble and start an argument; but the Viceroy must refuse to be drawn into such discussion, and must make up his mind whether Gandhi&apos;s answer constituted refusal or acceptance.

The Secretary of State thought that timing was very important. The Cripps offer had, in retrospect, been made at a most unfortunate time. The atmosphere and condition were already much better and might well continue to improve.

Some discussion ensued as to whether it would be possible to hold Ghandhi in prison, if he asked for an opportunity to consult with leaders of the Congress Party who were out of prison, before giving a final reply to any invitation addressed to him.

THE PRIME MINISTER thought it would be difficult to say that Ghandhi was to be given no opportunity of consultation with those leaders of the Congress Party who were not in prison.

On the wider issue, the Prime Minister said that it was, of course, abundantly clear that it would be open to the Viceroy, if at any time after he had arrived in India and surveyed the scene he came to the conclusion that an approach should be made to Ghandhi, to make a recommendation to this effect to the War Cabinet. It was, at all times, open to the Viceroy to make whatever submission he thought fit; any proposals he put forward would receive the most careful consideration, and he would be given a definite answer. It was, however, another matter to propose that the War Cabinet should agree now to the line of action proposed by the Secretary of State for India.

THE VICEROY DESIGNATE referred to the commitments and undertakings of H.M. Government in regard to constitutional reform, as set out in recent statements made in Parliament. In particular, he referred to the fact that the Cripps offer was still open. It was his duty, before leaving for India, to explain to the War Cabinet how he viewed the situation and to acquaint himself with their views.

It might be argued that it would have been better if we had taken a different line in 1917. But there was no doubt as to the goal to which we were now committed and towards which we must endeavour to make progress.

One policy was to say that we would make no attempt at progress during the war. On a short-term view this had advantages; but from a long-term point of view it was, in his view, dangerous. The best prospect of India being friendly to this country after the war lay in not delaying an attempt to make a further advance at the present time. The only way, in his view, of making progress was to include a certain number of political leaders on the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council and to get them working together, under the Viceroy, towards the solution of India&apos;s problems. These, of course, included the winning of the war and social and economic improvements. He had no intention of rushing matters, but as soon as possible he intended to sound some members of his council, and a certain number of

  

the Provincial Governors and the political leaders, in order to find out their views. He thought that he would take soundings of Rajagopalachariar and Jinnah. All this might take some time; but, if he was to achieve anything, the sooner something was done, the better. He contemplated that the suggested approach might be made in, say, three or six months. On the whole, he thought that, as the war went on, the position was likely to become more intractable, while owing to the many other pre-occupations, the end of a war was a bad time for making constitutional changes. His idea was to get together a small number, say ten or twelve, of the leading Indians, including politicians and officials like Mudaliar, and ask them to address their minds to the whole problem and to consider whether it was possible to form a new Council.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was, of course, nothing to prevent the Viceroy from discussing possibilities of this kind in the strictest confidence with trustworthy Indians.

Continuing LORD WAVElL said that the formation of a Government on the lines proposed would, of course, involve some risks. On the other hand, if there were no attempt to make progress, he was sure that we should find ourselves in a very awkward position at the end of the war. He agreed with the Prime Minister that the position was now much better than it was a year ago. On the other hand, he doubted whether it would be better a year hence; and he thought that a genuine and sincere attempt at an advance would rally support from Indians. All that he asked for at the moment was authority to take soundings on the lines proposed. After taking these soundings he might recommend making the approach; or he might say that the chances of success were so small that nothing further should be done.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would not be in favour of the proposition - if put forward - that the Viceroy should now make a definite statement that there could be no advance towards a settlement of the constitutional question during the war. Thus, it was possible that circumstances might arise, say, in a year&apos;s time, which would make it advisable to enter into negotiations. He was bound to add, however, that he thought that any negotiations with Gandhi were fraught with great danger. He would at once start up a controversy, and it was impossible to refuse altogether to answer questions addressed to one by a man to whom one had made a definite proposal. Gandhi might, for example, say that he was greatly in favour of much of the Viceroy&apos;s invitation but that he felt objection to the over-riding powers of the Viceroy.

The Prime Minister added that he regretted that the proposal put before this War Cabinet contained so little about progress on the social side. He had hoped that this new and rather promising note might have been struck.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that most of the powers in economic matters were now in the hands of the Provinces and there was not very much which could be done from the centre. While something could be done within limits, he believed that to put forward social changes as an alternative to constitutional reforms would have a very bad effect upon public opinion in India.

       

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE said that he thought, nevertheless, that some reference should be included in the Viceroy Designate&apos;s statement to the Government&apos;s intention to further economic progress and development in India.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that if an approach was made to Gandhi on the lines proposed, Gandhi would certainly not give a plain &apos;Yes&apos; or &apos;No&apos;. The result would almost certainly be that we should get involved in negotiations with Gandhi which would land us in considerable difficulties. The Foreign Secretary also thought that the last sentence of Annexure A was open to objection.

THE MINSTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION said that if the Viceroy once started to make soundings, this fact would become known. If, after he had taken soundings, nothing happened, it would inevitably be said that the Viceroy and the Government of India had been willing to make a now attempt to reach a settlement, but that the Government at home had been unwilling. This would be very unfortunate, and the Viceroy was therefore right in asking in advance what the views of the Cabinet were.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he would favour a statement by the Viceroy, an arriving in India, on perhaps the following lines:-

"The pledges already given by His Majesty&apos;s Government stood. He, the Viceroy, had not come out from England to say that no progress would be made during the war. On the other hand, he must make it clear that his first duty was to make sure that India was a safe base for the great operations against Japan which were now pending, and that the war was pressed to a successful conclusion, and that famine and food difficulties were dealt with. To all these tasks he must now devote himself."

The Prime Minister said that it would be a great pity to do anything which would start up the old political agitation. In particular, the proposal to start negotiations with Gandhi would lead to a first class political crisis in India. This, moreover, was proposed at a time when Gandhi&apos;s stock and the stock of Congress had never stood lower. The position might change and the time for negotiations might come, but for the moment the first essential was that India should be a tranquil and firm base for operations against Japan

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE thought that we should stand on the Cripps proposals. If Congress made any approach and made it clear that they were prepared to drop the civil disobedience movement; we should be prepared to do business with them. But he didn&apos;t like the proposal to make an offer which involved conditions which the Congress leaders would never accept.

THE HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER OF HOME SECURITY doubted whether in existing circumstances it would be advantageous for the Viceroy to open up negotiations on the lines proposed. On the other hand, it was clear that he must make some statement on arrival in

   

India. He thought that the draft statement at Annexure A would meet the position, subject to the last sentence being toned down to read as follows:-

"Attempts to make substantial progress towards this end during the war have so far failed, but I am of course free to examine whether a fresh attempt would appear to have prospects of success.

Having made this statement, the Viceroy could then wait and judge the situation as time went on, making cautious, informal soundings of the Indians whom he would meet from time to time. If he thought that the time was opportune for some further step, he would of course report in this sense, to the Government.  The present proposal was, however, in his view too rigid and formal. He also attached great importance to an Indian policy including measures of economic and social reform.

? said that he agreed that the last sentence of Annexure A required amendment. He thought that the proposal now before the War Cabinet was somewhat dangerous, since it contained conditions which Gandhi could not accept.    The approach was, therefore, almost certain to fail; and we should be asked why we had started, negotiations which were bound to fail. The first object of the Viceroy should be to maintain the tranquility of the country, so that our military effort could be prosecuted to the fill extent.

THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION said that there were 30 American newspapermen at Mew Delhi and others were coming out from the U.S.A. If any meeting on the lines proposed was held, it would obtain the maximum publicity within a few hours of its being held.

VISCOUNT HALIFAX said that the Viceroy Designate was faced with a dilemma. If he started negotiations With prominent Indians who were at large, he would be asked why he had not also issued an invitation to Gandhi.     On the other hand, if he entered into negotiations with Gandhi, he would find himself faced with formidable difficulties.  He therefore wondered whether it would not be possible to make it clear that the responsibility for opening up negotiations lay with the Congress leaders, and that if at any time they disavowed their former attitude, they would find that discussions with the Government were not barred.

THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION thought that no progress could be made with negotiations when one of the principal parties was in prison. He also thought there was not much use in starting negotiations on the basis of conditions which the leaders of the Indian political parties were unlikely to accept. He therefore came to the conclusion that the best course probably was not to attempt/fresh negotiations for the time being. to start

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought it was generally accepted that it was unlikely that negotiations on the lines proposed would be successful.



At the same time the mere fact of starting negotiations would involve greet risks. A crisis would he worked up in India, in the United states and in this country, from which serious consequences might follow. He mentioned the serious political repercussions which the Montague-Chelmsford discussions had had on the Government during the last war.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Viceroy Designate had held high office in India during the last two years and therefore had much more recent experience than others taking part in the discussion. Great weight should therefore be attached to his opinion. He also feared that if no action was taken the position might deteriorate.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not by any means entirely rule out the idea that further progress might be made during the war. He was, however, disappointed that the suggestions put forward took the form of resuscitation of the same old political arguments with the same old political leaders. He had hoped that new methods of approach to the subject might be attempted.

The Prime Minister said that he would like to suggest that he should prepare an alternative draft to the Annexure, in the light of the discussion. In this revised draft stress would he laid on the need for tranquility in Indian and for ensuring conditions which would facilitate the successful prosecution of the war. At the same time it would be made clear that further progress on constitutional questions was not ruled out.

The conclusions of the war Cabinet were as follows:

(l) While it was of course open to the Viceroy at anytime to submit recommendations to the War cabinet if he thought that the moment Was opportune for taking some further step which would assist a solution of the constitutional problem, it was doubtful whether any advantage was to be gained by laying down at this stage too precise and definite a course of action before he had had a further opportunity of studying the political situation on he spot and assessing the prospects of securing further progress.

(2) It would he a mistake at this juncture to remove from the Congress leaders the onus of making a disavowal  of their present attitude; moreover, as at present advised the War Cabinet were not prepared to embark on a policy of negotiations with Gandhi, which in their view would be attended by grave inconvenienced.

(3) The Prime Minister undertook to prepare a Revised draft of the Annexures to W.?. (43) 435 in the light of the Discussion. These would be communicated to the Secretary of State for India and the Viceroy Designate, and thereafter to the War Cabinet. They could, if necessary, be discussed at the Meeting of the War Cabinet on the following day.
