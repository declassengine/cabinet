He thought it would be a mistake to try to define too clearly, at this stage,our own attitude towards the difficult questions raised in the Foreign Seer.tory&apos;s Memorandum;    and he deprecated,  in particular, any attempt to reach bindingconeliisions on these questions.THE F0REIGM SECRETARY said that, while he recognised that no cut and dried decisions could begiven,  it would be helpful to him to know the mind ofhis colleagues on the specific points set out inparagraph 15 of his Memorandum.The War Cabinet proceeded to discuss seriatimthe points set out in paragraph 15 of the Memorandum.&quot;(a) As regards the political future of Germany,K.M. Government still have an open mind as between (i) a unitary Germany undera Central Government, (ii) a decentralisedadministration on a federal or confederalbasis or (iii) the splitting up ofGermany into a number of separato States.We should,  however,  do all in our powerto encourage separatist and particular1stmovements in Germany.itThe general view of the War Cabinet was that,while we should like to see a united Germany give place to a number of separate States and should certainlyencourage any separatist movements which might develop,it was impossible to foresee at this stage whetherit would in the event be practicable to bring aboutsuch a solution;    and many Ministers doubted the feasibility of forcing a solution on these lines onan unwilling Germany.

One view advanced in discussion was that the increasing power of Russia might make it inexpedient to carry too far a policy of crocking up the unity ofGermany.     Another view put forward was that, eventhough it proved impracticable to secure that thewhole of Germany was divided into separate States,there was in any event much to bo said for isolatingand possibly even dismembering Prussia, whose evilinfluence had twice been responsible for a european war, and at the same time encouraging the formationof a Danubian Federation baaed on Vienna.It was the view of the War Cabinet that, forthe time being, we should keep an open mind on the alternatives set out in paragraph (a).&quot;(b) It may well be undesirable to recogniseany Central German Government of whatever political complexion, anyhowduring the early months after theconclusion of hostilities.&quot;As regards the conclusion of an Armistice,theview of the War Cabinet was that it would be impossible in practice, to refuse- to deal with a Central GormanGovernment which offered unconditional surrender.&quot;(c)  ..bother or not a Central German Governmentexists,  Germany should in fact be administered for a period, possibly aslong as two years, by an inter-Alliedbody deriving its authority ultimatelyfrom a world-wide body and,  if such isconstituted, more directly from a united Nations Commission for Hurope.&quot;The War Cabinet took the view that it would be inexpedient for the United Nations to assume the heavy and invidious tasks involved in assuming direct responsibility for the administration of Germany afterthe war.      On the other hand,  the view was expressed that there were certain matters in which control byinter-Alliod bodies would be inevitable.     For example,United Nations must be in a position to insist on the reform of the Law Courts so as to ensure the impartialadministration of justice, and the control of the press and broadcasting.The general view of the War Cabinet was that paragraph (c)  could be accepted subject to thesubstitution of &quot;subject to a measure of control&quot; byinter-Allied bodies, in place of &quot;administered&quot;.&quot;(d) Total occupation of Germany by the three major Allies, possibly with assistancefrom France and the minor Allies,  inaccordance with a scheme to be agreedupon by the experts of the threec bun trie s.11It was agreed that a measure of military occupation would be necessary but that this should belimited to key areas&apos; and should not cover the whole country.

&quot;(e) Total disarmament of Germany.&quot;This was agreed to,  subject to the retentionby Germany of such Forces as were required for themaintenance of public order.&quot;(f)  Germany should revert to her pro-?Anschluss frontiers.       This wouldmoan:   (1) restoration of a free and independent Austria, possiblyconnected with some central Europeanconfederation;    (2) restoration of czechoslovakia, possibly - with minoragreed frontier rectifications in theEger triangle;    (o) restoration of pre-war territorial status quo in the low countries and Luxemburg;    (4-) restorationto Franco of Alsace-Lorraine;(5) return of the Memclland toLithuania (whether independent or afederated republic of the U.S.8.R.)&quot;.This was accepted,  on the understanding that itmight be undesirable for us to take the initiative in raising the question of the return of Memellandto Lithuania, since this might provoke discussionregarding the future of the Baltic States.-&quot;(g) In addition, the cession to Poland of east Prussia, Danzig,  and considerableareas of Silesia,  including the Oppelndistrict, and consequent transfers ofGorman populations.&quot;This was agreed to.&quot;(h) Transfer (if desired)^ of control of theKiel Canal to the United Nations.&quot;This was accepted.      It was suggested that consideration might also be given to the establishmentof international bodies for the  control of otherwaterways of international importance, o.g., the danube and the Rhine.&quot;(i) Imposition on Germany of some form ofinternational control of her industryand economic life.&quot;This was agreed to.The War Cabinet then considered the Memorandumby the Chiefs of Staff on the military occupation ofGermany (W.P.(43) 413).The views of the War Cabinet on the fourquestions set out in paragraph 4 of this Memorandumwere as foliows:-(a) As indicated above, the provisional view ofthe War Cabinet was that, while it wouldbe desirable to encourage any separatisttendencies which might develop, it wasnot possible at this stage to foreseewhether it would in the event be practicable to enforce the partition ofGermany.

(b)(c)It was the intention of the War Cabinetthat Allied military government ofGermany should be confined to the minimumconsistent with operational requirements&apos;.The War Cabinet endorsed the view of theChiefs of Staff that each of the occupying powers should be allotted a separatezone.      It would, however, be importantf that the zones should be so arranged asto avoid creating for any of the occupying lowers a special &quot;sphere of influence&quot; within the occupied territories,   (cf. W.M.(43)  86thConclusions, Minute l).([0.) The War Cabinet had already agreed on16th Juno, 1943, that ^ustria should be separated from Germany and shouldreceive wore favourable treatmentthe rest of Germany (...:.. (43)  86thConclusions, Minute 2).      The WarCabinet also favoured the ultimatetransfer of Hast Prussia to Poland.t hanTurkey(previous reference:W.ivi.(43) 25thConclusions,Minute 2).The War Cabinet next discussed the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on policy towards Turkey (W.P.(43) 420).Both H.M.  Government and the Sovietdesired that Turkey should join the war on theof the United Nations.      The difference likelyarise in the discussions between ourselves and russians was that, &quot;while the Soviet government over-nmentsidetothedesiredto bring Turkey into the, war at once, we preferred,for military reasons,  that they should participateat a later date.TEW! PRIivui MINISTER said that, while he ouldnot wish to press Turkey to enter the war at thisstage on conditions involving the dive sion to Turkeyof military resources required elsewhere,  ho wouldbe glad if Turkey decidedinitiative.to enter the war on her own-Proposed Anglo-bovictAgreement onTreaties withLesser WuropeanAllies(previous references:W.i:..(43)  89thConclusions,Minute 5 andW.ivi,(43) 93rd) Conclus i ons,Minute 5).War Cabinet gavegeneral   approval to the course of action outlined inij It.      &apos;^ &apos;   &quot;&quot;&quot;^ c^  ,&quot;1&apos;&quot;&apos; &quot;**  --^ *?r&apos;Subject to this point,  the.   pprovparagraph 6 ofForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum.The War Cabinet then discussed the Memorandumby the Foreign Secretary on the proposed Anglo-SovietAgreement about the conclusion of treaties with the lesser European Allies and its bearing upon therelations between the U.S.S.R., Czechoslovakia and poland (W.P.(43)  423).The War Cabinet expressed general approval ofthe main purport of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum,namely, that we should deprecate the conclusion of bilateral arrangements between Russia and Czechoslovakiaor between Russia and other European countries, whichwould prejudice the prospect of concluding at a later date a satisfactory settlement of the Soviet-Polishdifficulties.     On those grounds the Cabinet were ingeneral disposed to favour the adoption of a &quot;self-denying ordinance&quot; as set out in Annex I of theMemorandum,   if the Russians could be persuaded to conclude such an agreement.
