Furthermore,  therewas a danger that if it were established at one ofthese two places, it might tend to become a fifthwheel to the coach.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said ho thought thatthe Russians would welcome the establishment of theCommission in London;    but he was not sure how theAmerdcnns would regard this.THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  if necessary,  theForeign Secretary should make it clear to Mr. Hullthat we could not accept the view that London was nota suitable place for inter-Allied meetings.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION thought  thatif a solution was obtained on these lines,  the RussianGovernment might want to have an observer stationed in the Mediterranean aroacTHE PRIME MINISTER said he sew no objection tothi;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR asked whatreply would be given if the Russians asked to have cshare In the.exercise of authority over the control commission dealing with -Italian affairs.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that this could not he agreed to.     The Control Commission must hecovered by the responsible Allied Supreme Commander-in-Chief in this theatre.Reference was made to the position of theFrench Committee of National Liberation,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he saw noobjection to the French Committee of national liberation continuing to have a representative on theCommission if it was set up in London.      As regards other Powers, the line taken should be that thereshould be ad hoc consultations with theirrepresentatives on occasions when their affairs were involved.The War Cabinet -Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum and agreed to the despatch of the draft telegramsannexed thereto.Western &apos;   The Committee had before them a MemorandumFrontiers of        by the Secretory of State for Foreign Affairsthe U.S.S.R. (W.P.(h3) h38) as to the attitude to be adopted atthe Moscow Conference on the question of U.S.S.R&apos;sWestern frontiers,,THE PRIME.MINISTER said the cardinal pointof our policy in this matter must be that we should welcome an agreement between the Russians and thePoles;    and that while we could not force the Polesto come to an agreement which would mean, ceding toRussia territory in the Eastern part of their country,we would urge them to come to a settlement on theground that this was in their own best interests.We would also take the line that if they ceded a frontier in the East approximating to the curzon line,  they should receive compensation by the cession to them of East Prussia and part of Silesia.THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION saidthat he thought the main difficulty lay in the factthat it was very difficult for the Polish Government,being an emigre Government, to cede territory.        Itwas pointed out, however,  that if no arrangement was arrived at as to the frontier betv/een Russia and poland,  a very difficult situation would arise whenthe Russian Armies reached the Polish frontier. &apos;. THE SECRETLY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFF,iIRSsaid that the Poles had definitely asked him not todiscuss frontier puestions at the Moscow Conference.THE PRIME MINISTER said that our position must remain that we hoped to see a settlement byagreement, and would do what we could to promote one;but, of course, we could not bring about a solutionby compulsion.The War Cabinet took note with approval of theForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum as a guide tohim in the forthcoming conversations.

Poland-UndergroundResistanceMovement.The War Cabinet considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (w.p ,(43) 439)  on theline which might be taken at the forthcoming Conference in moscow regarding the underground resistance movement in poland-.The short-term problem arose from the fact that thePolish Government had not pot decided what instructions theyshould give to the organisers of this movement regarding their attitude when Russian troops crossed the Russo-Polishfrontiers      It was suggested in the Memorandum that, inolder to avoid clashes between Polish and Soviet guerillas,it might be advisable that the Polish underground movementshould withdraw altogether from operations in EasternPoland.      It was thought that in any event&quot; it would benecessary that the movement should declare itself to theRussians, although this might mean that H.M, Governmentand the U,S. Government would have to use their influence to prevent any Russian victimisation of the, leaders of themovementcThe long-term problem concerned the administrationof liberated Poland and the possibility of equipping thePolish underground arrayo      It was suggested that decisions on these questions would have to await a solution of theSoviet-Polish frontier question.THE MINISTER OP ECONOMIC WARFARE gave particulars ofthe numbers and state of equipment of the Polish under-ground army,  and of the extent to which Russian militaryoperations had already been assisted by sabotage and other activities carried out by the underground movement.     TheRussians might be impressed by the extent of theseachievements.-,The minister was satisfied, however, that the PolishGovernment would be unwilling to disclose the organisationof this underground movement to the Russians, for fear ofvictimisation of its members3rThe War Cabinet -(l) Invited the Minister of Economic &quot;warfare tocommunicate to the Secretary of State forForeign   Affairs full particulars regardingthe size and equipment of the Polish under-ground army and the successes already achieved by the movementa      It should be left to theForeign Secretary to judge how far it v/ould bein the interests: of the Polos to disclose this information to the Russians in the forthcomingconversations at Moscow; but nothing should be disclosed which would enable the Russians to identify the leaders of this organisation,(2) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary,  in his conversations at Moscow, should bo guided bythe considerations outlined in V/.P.(43)439,subject to the point mentioned at (l)  above.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W,lo
