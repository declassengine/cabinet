It was emphasised that our build-up was nowreduced,    compared   with   the   est-imate which had been prepared at thebeginning of September before Operation&quot;AVALANCHE11 had been launched.      Moreover,our forces would be seriously hampered by the progressive reduction in landingships and craft available in the Medlter-ronean due to craft being sent back to thiscountry for &quot;OVERLORD&quot;0     Most of the craftavailable had to be used for build-up andcoastwise maintenance, and this imposed astrict limitation on amphibious operations9There was, therefore, a risk that thesituation in Italy might take an unfavour-able turn and that the initiative inthis theatre might pass to the enemy.(2) Telegram No. COS(w)  907*from the BritishChiefs of Staff to the Combined Chiefs of- Staff,This telegram referred to NAF 486 and expressed the view that Generals Eisen-. hower and Alexander must be backed to thefull so that the momentum of the offensivecould be restored.     For this purpose they must have the resources they required,even if thereby the &quot;OVERLORD&quot; programme was to be delayed.      The telegram alsodealt with the position of landing craft.(3) Telegrams Nos. 142*and 143**EXTRA from thoPrime Minister to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in Moscow.In the former telegram the PrimeMinister asked the Secretary of State tomake it clear to Premier Stalin that the assurances about &quot;OVERLORD&quot; taking placein May were subject to specified conditions and must be modified by the exigencies ofthe battle in Italy, and that ho was takingthe matter up with President Roosevelt.The latter telegram repeated NAF 486to the Secretary of State.r

THE PRIME MINISTER gave a general review ofthe position and explained that,  in his view, anattempt to carry out &quot;OVERLORD&quot; in May,  regardless of its effect on other operations, would prevent us from   reaping the fruits of our successfulMediterranean strategy.      He had already communi-cated his views on this matter to president roosevelt and he had high hopes that the president would be impressed by the arguments which he had put to him.The Prime Minister said that he thought itwas essential that there should bo another meetingof the Combined Chiefs of Staff in the near future.It was already 90 days since the last CombinedMeeting.     Much had happened in this time and theposition called for review.     He had pressed thePresident to agree to an early meeting,,The Prime Minister mentioned that president roosevelt had sent him a message suggesting thata Russian military representative should be present at forthcoming meetings of the combined chiefs of Staff dealing with British-Americanoperations.The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinetthe President&apos;s telegram on this subject (No.397&apos;&apos;of 27th October) and-/his    own   reply of    the   same   date (No,^^), strongly deprecatingthe suggestion of inviting a Russian military representative to be present at meetings of the combined Staffs.The Prime Minister said that the russians had asked for a further special meeting of the moscow Conference to discuss operational matters.He had accordingly invited the Foreign Secretaryto show to Premier Stalin the full text of the review of the situation in Italy by GeneralsEisenhower and Alexander, and to make it clearthat any assurances about the date of &quot;OVERLORD&quot;must be regarded as subject to the exigencies ofthe battle in Italy.     The Primo Minister hoped thatthe War Cabinet would see their way to endorse theline which he had taken in these telegrams,,     he added that these telegrams had been despatchedafter consultation with the Chiefs of Staff, whowere in the most complete agreement on this matter,both among themselves and with himself.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the situation which had now arisen had beenforeseen at the Quebec Conference,     Ho had thenstated that he thought we should not be able both tocarry the operations in Italy through to a success-ful conclusion   and also to carry out Operation&quot;OVERLORD&quot; at the date which had been agreed in theTRIDENT Conference.     He had then expressed the viewthat our power to carry out &quot;OVERLORD&quot; successfullydepended upon the success of our operations in Italy;we must, therefore, be ready to send sufficient forces to Italy to ensure success in this theatre.     Moreover,it was folly to withdraw forces from Italy   until itwas Clear that we were in a position to carry out&quot;OVERLORD successfully.The bottleneck was landing ships end craft, end orders had been sent to s top the return from the Mediterr-anean to this country of those -types cf British Ilanding craftwhich could make the journey later in the winter.

THE VICE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF explained that only the larger landing  ships and craft could make the journey through the Bay of Biscay in the winter months.The smaller craft would not be able to make the journey after about the middle of November.      Ifthey had not been sent back to this country bythat, date, Operation &quot;OVERLORD&quot; would be postponedby two or three months-THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theUnited States were now sending air forces to theMediterranean to an extent which would hamper theirbuild-up of air forces for &quot;OVERLORD&quot;.      this seemed to be inconsistent with their insistence onthe withdrawal of land forces and landing craftfrom the Mediterranean in order to ensure the carrying out of &quot;OVERLORD&quot; in May,FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS  said that he had no -quarrel with the conception of Operation &quot;OVERLORD&quot;,which was bound to be carried out as the last bigblow in the war.     But he thought that we shouldnot attempt to carry out that Operation in May 1944*To attempt to do so would impair the effect of thespectacular successes which we had won in theMediterranean.      It would have a disastrous effecton morale if we were to be seriously held up for aconsiderable period in the neighbourhood of Rome.Ho was certain that our right course was to pro-secute our success in Italy until we reached aline which we could hold with perfect safety;    then the French might start another front in SouthernFrance and,  if the Russian pressure from the Eastcontinued, it should be possible to carry out&quot;OVERLORD&quot; in, say, August.Ho thought that if President   Rooseveltpressed for adherence to the May date, he should beasked whether he would be prepared to take theresponsibility for ordering the Operation to takeplace in that month against the advice of GeneralsEisenhower and Alexander,  the British Chiefs of staff and the War Cabinet.     Put    in a nutshell, to insist on &quot;OVERLORD&quot; in May would mean the defeat of all our operations against the under-belly.Reference was also made to the fact that if&quot;OVERLORD&quot; took place in May,&apos; we should have to stopheavy bombing operations against Germany a monthsooner.      FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS thought that thiswould be. most unfortunate,,      He believed that our air attacks on Germany were having a tremendouseffect and might bring Germany to her knees intwelve months.In further discussion, THE CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF mentioned that there were nowsigns of a German Division being withdrawn from italy to meet the situation on the Russian front.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this provided a strong argument against taking any action whichwould reduce the pressure we were bringing againstthe enemy in the south at a time when he was alsounder such strong Russian pressure from the East.In further discussion Ministers expressed theirenture agreement with the views expressed by the PrimeMinister and Chiefs of Staff, and the War Cabinetwarmly endorsed the line taken by the Prime minister in the telegrams which had been despatched dealingwith this matter.ho r&quot;&apos;\r &apos;&apos; Tpin^f;  &quot;&apos;

Liilse you I rejoice in the good progress made at Moscow,and I greatly hope we may arrange EUREKA.2. I deprecate the idea of inviting a Russian military representative to sit in at the meetings of our Joint Staffs.Unless he understood and spoke English,  the delays would heintolerable.      I do not know of any really high officer of theRussian Army who can speak English.      Such a representativewould have no authority or power to speak except as instructed.He would simply bay lor an earlier Second Front and block allother discussions.      Considering- they tell us nothing of theirown movements, I do not think we should open this door to them as it would probably mean that they would want to have observersat all future meetings and all discussions between us would beparalyzed.      We shall very soon have six or seven hundred thousand British and American troops and Airmen in Italy andwe are planning the great operation of OVERLORD.      There willnot be a Russian soldier in any of these.      On the other handall our fortunes depend upon them.      I regard our right to sittogether on the movements of our own two Forces as fundamentaland vital.      Hitherto we have prospered wonderfully, but I now feel that the year 1944 is loaded with danger.      Greatdifferences may develop between us and we may take the wrongturning.      Or again we may make compromises and fall between two stools.      The only hope is the intimacy and friendshipwhich has been established between us and between our HighStaffs.     .If that were broken I should despair of the immediatefuture.      A formal triple conference with the Russians is another thing.      Then they have to be represented by plenipoten-tiaries,  or at any rate persons having wide discretionarypowers.      I need scarcely say the British Chiefs of Staff fullyshare these views.      I must add that I am more anxious about the campaign of 1944 than about any other with which I have been involved.

PRIME MINISTER&apos; 8PERSONAL TELEGRAMSerial No.  T.1745/5PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TO PRIME MINISTER.PERSONAL AND MOST secret the present Moscow Conference appears to be a genuinebeginning of British Russian United States collaboration whichshould lead to the early defeat of Hitler.        In order to furtherstimulate this co-operation and particularly to increase theconfidence of Stalin in the sincerity of our intentions it issuggested that immediately upon our receipt of information ifit turns out that he is unable to meet with us at Basra or otherplace that is acceptable to both of us, we jointly transmit some such message as the following to him:-I&quot;Heretofore we have informed you of the results of ourcombined British American military Staff Conferences.     You may feel that it would be &quot;better to have a Russian military representative sit in at such meetings to listen to the discussion^regarding British American operations and take note of thedecisions.      He would be free to make such comments and proposals  Ias you might desire.      This arrangement would afford you and your staff an intimate and prompt report of these meetings.- IIf you favourably consider such an arrangement we shalladvise you of the date and place of the next Conference as soonas they have been determined.      It&quot;would be understood that theprocedure outlined carried no implication of discussion of plans for purely Russian operations except as your representative mightbe instructed to present&quot;.No.  39727.10.43.If he does agree to meet us at Basra we can discuss thismatter with him at that time.

OUTWARD TELEGRAM 36[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bekept under Lock and Key.][CYPHER] PRISECFROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO MOSCOWNo. 145 EXTRA. D.   9.25 p.m. 26th October, 1943.26th October, 1943.MUMMOST IMMEDIATE.DEYOU.PERSONAL AND MOST SECRET.Following from Prime Minister for Secretary of State.Following is telegram from General Eisenhower referredto in my immediately preceding telegram.Transmitting entire text because this morning at aCommander&apos;s conference, General Alexander presented a reviewof the battle situation in Italy which gives such a clear andaccurate picture.PART I.1,   (a)   On 9th September, the date of the launching ofAVALANCHE and the announcement of the Italian Armistice, theestimate of the general enemy situation was that 2 divisions were opposing the advance of Eighth Army in Calabria: 1division was in the Heel of Italy: 3 divisions were in aposition south of Rome and available to take action againstthe Allied landing in Salerno Bay;   more than 2 divisions were inthe neighbourhood of Rome and 9 in the north of Italy.   TheGermans, therefore, had a total of some 18 divisions at their disposal on the Mainland.   Of these it was considered thatsome would be engaged in Northern Italy to deal, with theinternal situation which was expected to cause themconsiderable embarrassment.(b)   It was of course realised that our assaults nearSalerno would prove hazardous In the face of German opposition,but it was thought that the Italian situation, coupled with theopportunity of landing light forces in the Heel and our over-whelming air superiority, weighed the scales sufficiently mour favour, and the risks quite rightly were taken.   Further,landing craft were available in large numbers and gave usliberty of manoeuvre and flexibility in both build7up andmaintenance by sea.   They also afforded the possibility offurther amphibious operations to assist the advance by land.This flexibility proved invaluable and was utilised fully byEighth Army in its operations along the coast of Calabria and bySeventh Army in reinforoing the Salerno Area with 1 division from Sicily in the critical early days of the battle.

(o)   Although at that time it was known that craft&amp; were to be withdrawn during the winter, the number tobe withdrawn and the dates of withdrawal were not established.Ourmplans then envisaged an estimated build-up of 1300vehicles a day from all Mediterranean ports.   Such a figure??anJ tlr?t ? total of 20 Allied Divisions, together withthe Tactical Air Forces, could factually have been put into italy by the end of the year, provided that they could be equipped and their maintenance assured.   At the same time,the estimates of craft available for the future allowedsufficient elasticity to assist maintenance and to providetor amphibious operations in conjunction with the land advance to Rome, should such steps be necessary.PART II.2,   (a) To-day the situation has changed greatly.   In theSouth, 11 Allied Divisions oppose 9 German while further Norththere are some 15 more, a known total of 24 Divisions, and perhapsas high as 28 Divisions.   On the basis that there are nounforeseen causes of a still lower rate of build-up, the optimumnumber of formations at our disposal on the mainland will be:end of November - 15 Divisions, end of December - 14/15Divisions, end of January - 16/17 Divisions,   Our rate of build-uphas fallen from the previous estimate of 1300 vehicles a day toan estimated 2,000 a week with a consequent delay in the calling forward of Air Forces and Army formations.   The reductionin the build-up of ground forces has also been influenced by thedecision to move the strategic Air Force into the Foggia area as rapidly as possible rather than to wait for the capture of bases in the Rome area.   The demands of the Air Forces should bemet by the end of the year.(b) The reduction in craft, already decreased by wear andtear, has been so serious as to preclude us from taking advantage, other than with minor forces, of the enemy&apos;s inherentweakness, which is the exposure of his 2 flanks to turningmovements from the sea.   The majority of such craft as areavailable are required for build-up and for coastwise maintenanceon account of demolitions to road and rail facilities, and traffic in the ports, owing to the shortage of lighters and tugsand enemy sabotage to berthing facilities, which will take timeto repair,3,   (a)   An examination of the enemy position has shown thathis lines of communication enable him to build up in Italy, mainly in the North, to the order of 60 Divisions, should they beavailable, and maintain them there in the winter months, despiteour air superiority.   The Germans clearly are trying to form areserve by shortening their lines round the Fortress of Europe.Such a reserve could be employed in reinforcing further theirarmies in Italy.(b) In comparison, the Allied position is less favourable.With the resources available no increase in rate of build-up canbe made.   A stabilised front South of Rome cannot be accepted, forthe ........

fee capital has a significance far greater than itsstrategic location and sufficient depth must be gained beforethe Foggie. airfields and the Port of Naples can be regarded assecure.   This being so?   the seizure of a firm defensive basePorth. oi Rome becomes imperative.   Moreover we cannot afford to adopt a purely defensive role, for this would entail the surrender of the initiative to the Germans.PART III.i 4.   The obvious present German intention is to hold a lineSouth of Rome, where the country favours defence and allowsno scope of the deployment of our superiority in armour orartillery.   Coming bod weather will limit the employmentof our Air Forces, as indeed it has done already&quot;.   enemy troops may be tired but they can be relieved by formationsfrom the North.   There are indications that this is being done now.   i/e have neither the formations nor the shipping to enable us to do so.   It would therefore appear that weare condtted to a long and costly advance to&quot;Rome, a &quot;SluggingMatch&quot; with our present slight superiority in formations on thebattlefront offset by the enemy opportunity for relief: for,without sufficient resources in craft, no out-flanking amphibiousoperation of a size sufficient tc speed up our rate of advanceis possible.   There is a danger that a successful conclusionof this &quot;Slugging Match.&quot; might leave us North of Rome in such astate of exhaustion and weakness as not to be able to hold what we have gained, if the Germans bring down from the North fresh divisions for a counter offensive.   An enemy strike of this nature may not be fully neutralised by our Air Forces duringthe winter months: otherwise, I should feel no concern.   TheGerman reinforcement of Italy appears greater than warrantedby the internal situation or by purely defensive requirements^If the opportunity for an easy success occurs, there is little doubt that it will be seized upon to counter the effects of ayear of defeats on all fronts and to raise German moraleprior to the campaigns of 1944.   The effect in the balkans and in. France might be particularly to our disadvantage.5.   (a)   In conclusion, the picture in Septemberlooked rosy, provided the initial assault at Salerno was successful.   The German Divisions in the North were about tobecome involved in difficult internal security problems.In the South the rate of build-up was believed to be such that,given no reinforcement by reserve German formations, we shouldhave had 20 Divisions opposed to probably his 18 by the endof December, and our full Air Force requirements have been on the mainland.   It was believed that sufficient craft -would be available to turn his sea flanks and maintain forcesover the beaches, as might be necessary.(b) To sum up:   To-day the situation is that 11 allied divisions are fighting a frontal battle in country favouringthe defence against an immediate strength of 9 German Divisions,which ......

tich can be reinforced at any moment.   Our build-up hasin&amp;led to a maximum of 16/17 Divisions by the end ofJanuary against a present enemy strength of a certain 24divisions, and our resources are not available foramphibious operations of much more than of local character.We may be delayed South of Rome sufficiently long to enablethe Germans to clear up the situation in Northern Italy andthen reinforce his Southern front.   In this case, theinitiative might well pass to him.    Review Ends.[Copies sent to the Prime Minister and Brigadier Jacob],O.T.P.

D. 6.U p,m.&apos; 26th October, 192..3.MOST IMMEDIATEDEYOUMOST SECRET AND PERSONALFollowing from Prime Minister for Secretary of State.I send you in my immediately following a very serioustelegram from General Eisenhower reporting General Alexandersappreciation of the battle in Italy.   You should show this toStalin and let him read it for himself.     The reason why weare getting into this jeopardy is because we are moving some ofour best divisions and a large proportion of vital landing-craft from the Mediterranean in order to build up for OVERLORD,seven months hence.   This is what happens when battles aregoverned by lawyers&apos; agreements made in all good faith months before and persisted in without regard to the ever-changingfortunes of war.   You should let him know if you think fit thatI will not allow, while I am responsible, the great andfruitful campaign in Italy which has already drawn heavyGerman reserves into action to be cast away and end in afrightful disaster, for the sake of OVERLORD in May.The battle must be nourished and fought out until it is won.We will do our very best for OVERLORD but it is no use planning for defeat in the field in order to give temporary politicalsatisfaction.2.   It will therefore be necessary for you to make itclear that the assurances you have given about May OVERLORDsubject to the specified conditions must be modified by the exigencies of battle in Italy.     I am taking the matter up with president Roosevelt, but nothing will alter my determinationnot to throw away the battle in Italy at this juncture, so faras the King&apos;s Armies are concerned.   Eisenhower and Alexandermust have what they need to win the battle, no matter whateffect is produced on subsequent operations.   This may .certainly affect the date of OVERLORD.0.T.P

We are very disturbed at situation revealed inNAF. 486,    We were already examining the whole positionof the campaign in the Mediterranean and its relationto OVEIMhiD, but receipt of NAF. 486. which confirmsfears we had already formed, makes it necessary for usto communicate our views to U.S. Chiefs of Staffimmediately.2. We consider that Eisenhower and his Commanders-in-Chief must be backed to the full so that momentum of offensive can be restored until Rome and airfields to thenorth have been captured.    For this they must have theresources they require, even if the OVERLORD programme is delayed.    We are convinced that if the campaign in italy should lead to a reverse,&apos; or oven to a stalemate,resulting in the Germans recovering the initiative, thenOVERLORD would inevitably have to be postponed,3. As stated by Generals Eisenhower and Alexander,the crux of the problem is landing craft, both to improve our build up and to enable amphibious operations on asizeable scale to be carried out at an early date,4, To show how serious the position is, we pointout that 56 British and 48 American L.S.TS, and many ofother types of landing ships and landing craft are due toleave the Mediterranean within the next few weeks.   Manyof these have already been withdrawn from the battle in preparation for the voyage to United Kingdom,5. We shall be ready in a few days to elaborateour views on this problem, but, in meanwhile, we considerit would bo a grave military error, in the light ofGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s and General Alexanders report, toremove these essential landing ships and landing craftfrom the Mediterranean,/. 6,    Holding

InFuture this telegram the Foreign Secretary said that M&quot;.of the Molotov had referred to the Prime minister&apos;s state-Italian ment that over 100 naval vessels and more thanFleet. 150,000 tons of merchant shipping had passed to theAnglo-American coalition, and had asked that in orderto extenuate the struggle the following should be handed over to the Soviet Government forthwith -1 Battleship1 Cruiser8 Destroyers4 Submarines   and40,000 tons,of shipping.The Foreign Secretary thought that russia had a good claim to a share in tho Italian Fleet,and that an early favourable decision would bo very helpful at the Moscow Conference..The War Cabinet also had before them a further telegram (No. 97 SPACEfrom the Foreign Secretary,saying that it would be very helpful if he could beauthorised to say that we agreed to the SovietGovernment having the ships for which they asked andthat the question of the ports at which they were tobe delivered should be examined by the naval staffs.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this matter had been examined by the Chiefs of Staff, v/hose views were as follows:-(i) We should establish whether we were legallyempowered by the Agreement with the ItalianGovernment to hand over these ships to theSoviet Government.     The Admiralty were examining this.(ii) If the legal position were satisfactory, theChiefs of Staff thought we should agree tothe Soviet suggestion in principle. .(iii) The handing   over of the ships would, however,give rise to a great many difficultieswhich would need very careful examination.FIELD MARSHAL SMUTS said he thought the matter was one which&quot;should be dealt with at a high levelbetween the President, the Prime Minister and premier stalin.THE MINISTER OF STATE pointed out that anyanswer which could be given in a favourable sense(even if it was only to the extent of saying that wewere anxious to meet the Russian claim but that therewere formidable difficulties which would have to be

examined) would be of. great help to Mr. Eden at the moscow Conference.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY pointed outthat we wanted the Littorios ourselves, and that ifany battleship was to be given to Russia, it shouldbe a Cavour class battleship.     Their claim fordestroyers was inadmissible as it would more thanabsorb all the sea-worthy destroyers available.     he saw no reason why the Russians should not be given some torpedo boats.THE MINISTER OP WAR TRANSPORT said that  themerchant shipping which had been captured would pro-bably not suffice to meet the import requirements ofthe Italian civilian population, let alone the needsof our troops in Italy.     There was therefore noquestion of there being any surplus merchant shipping to be divided up among the United Nations.Reference was also made to the strong claims of other United Nations, especially tho Greeks.The Free French and the Yugoslavs were also mentionedin this connection.It was also pointed out that use might bemade of these ships in the Japanese war, after the defeat of Germany.The telegram should indicate our desire tomeet the Russian1s over this matter, but should draw attention to the following points:-(a) That v;o had hopod that the Italian Fleetwould play its part in tho War against Japan.(b) That sorlous practical difficulties wouldbe involved in sending Italian ships to russian Arctic ports.(c)-Tho claims of othor of the United nations to share in the Italian Floot, must beborne in mind.(d) It was important to do nothing which woulddiscourage Italian co-operation.In tho light of all these points, it should bosuggested that discussion of this matter had better be postponed until the forthcoming Conference between thePrime Minister, President Roosevelt and Premier Stalin.jMtils telegram was later despatched as No. 171-*&apos;&quot;&quot;EXTRA from the Foreign Office to Moscow.,./The War Cabinet Invited: -The Prime Minister to send a telegram to theForeign Secretary on the following lines:-Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,

If they could get there in-the next ten dayswould they help drown the bastards escaping from the Crimea &apos;-and sink valuable material?     If he thinks it worth while, Iwould try.2,    Would not this- be a good test case to put to theTurks?    Would it not be the thin edge of the wedge?    Britainand Russia could say to them &quot;you must turn a blind eye to:  -the passage of these submarines&apos;through the Dardanelles andBosphorus,     They -would remain submerged-by day, and only   -travel by night.   : If presently the.;Germans say they havebeen sinking ships in the Black Sea, you can answer &quot;theymust have slipped through somehow&quot;.3,     It seems to me this is much the best way to tackleTurkey on a small concrete point where she could be a help andat the same time not have to take a formal plunge.    Arrange-ments would have to be made for the supply of fuel, torpedoes,etc,, but these are matters which can be settled later.     let me know before you leave whether U.J. is interested in this ornot.40    Italian Fleet,    In principle we willingly admit theRussians&apos; right to a share in the Italian Fleet,    We had however thought that this Fleet would play its part against japan, and we had been planning to tropicalise the Littoriosand some other units for this later phase of the war.    if russia would like to have a squadron in being in the Pacific,that would be a very considerable event, and we would like todiscuss this project at Eureka.5*     At present the only place Y/here Italian ships couldbe handed over to the Russians would be Archangel and Murmansk.The Italian warships are quite unsuited for working in Arcticwaters and would need several months of dockyard work first.We should also have to be careful lest the immediate transfer to the Russians would have an ill-effect on Italian co-operation.     It is important for Italy to have her flag onthe sea against Germany.   . We do not want to provoke a refusalby the Italians to carry on the important Yirork they are doingfor us in Taranto dockyard.     One cannot be absolutely sure/that
OTP,Jthat they would not souttie some of the ships they&quot;brought out from the German clUtQhes if they thought they were to he handed over to foreign crews.    Theyare doing a good deal for us at the present time,Italian submarines are.carrying supplies to Leros.Italian destroyers, of which there are only sevengood ones, are escorting local convoys-.    Their cruisersare transporting troops and supplies.    We should there-fore in any case have to ensure against publicity until we could take steps to counter these ill-effects.    ,Oncedistribution of the Italian Fleet &quot;begins, the French,the Yugoslavs and Greeks would put in their claims   ...which are pretty good.6.

D.    8.22 a.in&apos;.  20th October, 39^3HO. 6l\. SPACE R. 10.00 a.m. 2kth October, 19u323rcl October, 19h3Following from Secretary of State.My immediately preceding telegram.After expressing pleasure at Mr. Hull&apos;s statement and enthusiasm about the political situation in Italy, M. Molotovsaid that as we were to some extent business men too as well aspoliticians, he had a proposal to make on behalf of the SovietGovernment.      Italy due especially to the -part played until recently by Mussolini, had taken active part in the war againstthe Soviet Union.      Together with Germany she had until hersurrender, fought for more than two years in Soviet territory and caused great damage to her people and economy.      that damage was difficult to value but Italy should begin to someextent to repair it.      This was necessary in order to intensify the struggle against the principal enemy.     He /j? grp.omtd.: made/7&apos; reference to Prime Minister&apos;s statement that over100 naval vessels and more than 150,000 tons of merchantshipping had passed to the Anglo-American Coalition.     his proposal therefore was that in order to extenuate the struggle,there should be handed over to the Soviet Government forthwith1 battleship,  1 cruiser,  8 destroyers and 4 submarines to sailto Northern ports of the Soviet Union and h0,C00 tons of merchantshipping to sail immediately to Black Sea ports.      This proposal would be put in writing.      He did not insist 03.1 an immediateanswer but asked for it before the Conference ended.2.      For myself I think that Russia has a good claim to ashare of the Italian fleet,  I presume that we take the view that italian fleet is at our disposal to do with as we wish.      If thisis so, has not the time come to decide what -portions of it we areprepared to allot to our allies?     The Greek claim we know to be small:    probably a cruiser and two or three destroyers and alike number of submarines would satisfy them.      Politically it isdesirable that C-Peeece should have a fleet which will at leastgive her naval equality with Turkey.      At present Greece throughher losses in this war is weaker than Turkey at sea.      I presumethat Yugoslav claims would be very small, perhaps a destroyer anda submarine.      Then there are the French claims about which Itelegraphed from Algiers.3.      As regards Russia, their demand seems to me moderate and reasonable.     Ambassador has expressed the opinion that acquiescenceon our pert in this Russian request would have &quot;stupendouspsychological effect&quot; on opinion in this country and. I trust thatwe can meet it.      He thinks that Russian suggestion is basedmainly upon reasons of prestige and that obvious practicaldifficulties which might arise, particularly as regards delivery -at Russian Black Sea ports of merchant tonnage,  should not beallowed to influence our judgement in coming to a decision.An early favourable decision would help us greatly here.
