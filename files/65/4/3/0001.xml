- MOST SECRET -W.M.(59)  69th. CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex.THE CHANCELLOR   OP THE EXCHEQUER explained tothe War Cabinet the agreement which had been reached with the French Government on the financial aspect of the plan for the destruction of the Roumanianoilfields.   The basis of the plan was that we andthe French should take equal shares in compensatingthe Roumanians for the damage to the oilfields andthe consequent loss of revenue.    In the last war we had promised compensation, but when the time had come, had. set off the amount due to the Roumaniansagainst their War debt.   This arrangement had naturally)aroused, some resentment on the part of the RoumanianG-ov eminent.   The scheme now proposed was&apos;that weshould give the Rotimanians  1 million in sterlingas preliminary expenses.    If destruction of the oilfields took place,  compensation would be fixed by a Mixed Commission   and, if agreement could notbe reached, by some neutral body   and payment would be made in cash, half in francs by the French,and half in sterling by ourselves.   On their part,      jthe Roumanian Government would undertake to carry        ^out the destruction of the oil wells, under plansalready pre-arranged with them, whenever we consideredthat the time was ripe.

21THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO explained tothe War Cabinet that he and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, in the course of their examination of the wider problem of stopping oil supplies reaching Germany, had investigated thequestion of supplies from Roumania.   He believedthat the successful negotiations which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had just reported had a value whichwas by no means confined to their prospective andcontingent importance.   He had little doubt that theyhad prepared the way for results already achieved inchecking the passage of oil to Germany.   He recalledin this connection that M. Tilea, the roumanian minister, had recently informed the Secretary of-State for Foreign Affairs that the Germans were notgetting out of Roumania even the quantities of oil dueunder the German-Roumanian agreement, bec9.use the communications from Roumania to Germany were unsatis-factory.   He and Lord Chatfield had received informa-tion from other sources which threw much light on thecause of these ba.d communications.   All kinds of accidents had occurred to the pontoons where the oilwas shipped, and to the Danube barges, in consequenceof which the Germans were now endeavouring to get the oil away by rail to Orsova, near the Yugo-Slavia .frontier, where it could be put on board barges.But many of the railway ca.rs had already been taken up by the Allies and removed to the east of Roumania..The railways were already being used to take oil allthe way to Germany, and it seemed doubtful if this method of transit for transporting further oil supplies as far as Orsova would prove very satisfac-tory to the Germans.lichmond3rdTerrace, S.W.1,November, 1939.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.
