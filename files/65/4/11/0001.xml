MOST SECRET.,BELGIUM.staff conversations.W.M.  (59)-80th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.The War Cabinet had before them telegramNo.185 from Brussels, giving an account of an inter-view between General van OverstraeteBk and theBritish Military Attache.   Prom this telegram, itwas evident that the Belgians were reluctant toenter into frank Military Conversations with theFrench and ourselves together, and preferred tocontinue discussions between the Belgian military attache in Paris and General Gamelin, and between general van Overstraetesfi and the British military attache in Brussels.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF informed the WarCabinet that Sir Roger Keyes was crossing to Prance,and would be at Headquarters, British ExpeditionaryForce, at 3 o&apos;clock that day.    There he would meetthe British Military Attache at Brussels.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR emphasised the importance of ensuring that the discussions inParis and in Brussels should proceed on identicallines.    The British Military Attache could only saythat the help which the British would give would bein accordance with the French plan.    The british expeditionary Force was under the command of general george, and Lord Gort could therefore make no separate plan to assist the Belgians.    This had beenmade clear to the British Ambassador in Brussels in telegram No. 142, which was sent off late theprevious night.   We should no doubt obtain,through our Mission, information of what General Gamelinhad said to the Belgian Military Attache.    There

did not appear to be anything more we could do,until the results of Sir Roger Keyes&apos; visit to belgium were known.The War Cabinet took note of this information, and agreed that,for the moment, no further action could usefully be taken.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.12th November, 1939.
