- MOST SECRET -W.M.(59)  78th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 4.Confidential Annex.*     *     *THE NETHERLANDS THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that, during and&apos; BELGIUM.the discussion which had taken place at the War Cabinetthe evening &quot;before, reference had been made to the lineGivet-Namur-Wavre-River Dyle, and it had been thoughtthat- the Belgians were working hard on the sectorbetween Wavre and Namur.   A report had, however, beenreceived from the British Military Attache^ in Brussels,in which he said that he had not been able to make anyprogress in military discussions with GeneralOverstraeten.   He had, however, been able to establish the fact that no defences had yet been made on the line!Namur-Wavre.   He had motored across this line, and he   1thought that the absence of defences had probably been iresponsible for the Belgian reluctance to allow him to  1visit it previously.   He had noticed that the steelanti-tank obstacle which existed on the line Hal-Ninove(land which formed part of the defences of. Brusselsagainst attack from the West, was now being taken up and removed.   He thought it probable that this obstacle was being re-erected on the Namur-Wavre line.   He had    pcarried out a reconnaissance of the line of the Dendre.!THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had now been able to obtain copies of the messages which had passed between the French and the belgians, and to which reference had been made during    pthe discussion the evening before.   He was able to confirm that these messages had been conveyed through Idiplomatic channels, and that M. Spaak had asked theFrench what action they would wish Belgium to take in the event of a German invasion of Holland.

The French had replied that they would prefer belgium to intervene and to ask for Allied assistance, ratherthan remain neutral.   The Belgians had also proposed the sending of a &quot;technician&quot; to hold consultations with the French.   By this he presumed they meant a staff Officer who could discuss military matters.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,10th November, 1939.
