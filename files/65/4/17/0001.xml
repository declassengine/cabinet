- MOST SECRET^ -W.M. (59) 90th. CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 11.Confidential Annex.THE Secretary Of STATE FORWAR&apos;S visit to PRANCE.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that he hadbeen along practically the whole front of the Britiahsector.   As an illustration of the permeation of english and French forces, Lord Gort&apos;s Command included a French Division, which had been strengthened by aBritish Brigade, aflfr British Ma chine-Gun Battalion^&apos;The permanent fortifications of the line includedblockhouses about 1,000 yards apart, and a continuousanti-tank obstacle in the form of a trench which hadbeen strengthened and revetted.   A great deal ofdigging was in progress along the front, but he hadbeen surprised to see only two new pill-boxes being constructed.   He had mentioned this point to Lord Gort,who had informed him that there was some difference ofopinion as to the best form of pill-box. The british authorities, it appeared, did not agree that the Frenchtype of pill-box was the best that could be devised.The Secretary of State for War said that he had consulted General Gamelin, who sad sugjasac! that fefee&amp;5?4*?HS&quot;h d......fee-^e^a: cement works at their disposal^The French had so organised matters that they couldbuild a pill-box in three days.   Most of the trencheswhich were being dug in our sector filled at once with/ater, and the French thought that they should be^m?re4re-lined.   Engineer Officers from the Field force were coming over to England that day, and he hoped thatgreat improvements would be made.Generally speaking, however, our defences were very strong, and Lord Gort was  constructing two linesof defences behind the main line.-1

He had had discussions with Genera,l Gamelin on many subjects.   General Gamelin was mainly concernedwith the need for more men.   He was in process ofbuilding up 10 new Divisions, which would bring thetotal French Divisions on the Western Front to 90.He thought that the Germans in the Spring would have160 Divisions, and that we must find means of augment-ing our contribution.The Secretary of State for War said that he had also been struck with the wastefulness of having ourbase 400 miles distant.   Until recently, 500 tons of petrol had been consumed, every day, but this quantitywas now being reduced.   He was certain that the distance to the base should be cut down by using portsfurther East.    This, however, would mean more Fightersupport.   Great structures were being erected at Rennesfor our base services.General Gamelin had referred to the decision takenby the Supreme War Council in regard to Air Policy,and had said that this would now enable the Army tobe supported by more Bombers in the event of a German    ijinvasion of Belgium.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that this, of   icourse, was not the case.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he had had lunch with M. Daladier and M. Guy la Chambre.The latter had referred to an offer- which the french had ms.de (and which the Secretary of State understoodhad been refused) to let us have a certain number of aeroplanes of a special type appropriate for close support, which the French hoped to be producing at the   ira-te of 250 machines a month by March, 1940.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he had never heard of any such offer, but would make enquiries.)S.W.I. *  *   *1939.
