- MOST SECRET -W.M.C59)  74th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex.SECURITY OPFLEET BASES.scapa Flowand the Lossof ROYAL OAK.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that AdmiralDrax&apos;s Report had disclosed some rather disquietingfacts, but he was most anxious not to hold an Inquiryat that stage to apportion the blame for any short-comings.   There might, however, be criticism to facein Parliament when he made his Statement, and the WarCabinet might perhaps like time to study the Reportbeforehand..   His own view was that an Inquiry toestablish responsibility was out of the question forthe present.    It would involve not only the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, but 8.1 so the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, who had. acted, forthe late First Sea Lord during his illness early thatyear.    It could not be denied that the defences ofScapa Flow were inadequate.    Those responsible were,however,  in his opinion guilty of an error of judgmentand not of neglect of duty, and he did not think thatthere was any ca.se at all for a court-martial;   whileany Inquiry of a. judicial nature would, involve bringing the officers responsible back from duty in order thatthey might have a chance of defending themselves.Any public Inquiry was, of course, out of the question,since it would disclose information of vital Importanceto the enemy.In answer to a question by the Secretary of Statefor Air, the First Lord, said that the Senior naval officer in Scotland, had. reported the previous Aprilthat the defences of Scapa were inad.equa.te.    In May,the admiralty had replied to the effect that they were satisfied with the arrangements that had been made.

In July, the Commander-in-Chief had again, drawn atten-tion to the state of the defences, and the admiralty had then ordered additional blockships to close theentrances to the Plow.    One of these blockships hadbeen sunk in its appointed position, a second entrancehad been closed by means of wires, but the blocks hipfor a third entrance had only arrived after the ROYALOAK had been sunk.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that it might be asked why the Commander-in-Chief had not taken greater pre-cautions for the safety of the Fleet in Scapa in theabsence of adequate means to block the entrances .THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY did not think itcould be denied that the Commander-in-Chief and the senior Naval Officer on the station had not takenadequate measures.   But it must be remembered thatthey were fa.ced at every hour with many dangers fromthe enemy, and they probably felt no particular appre-hens ion of the danger of submarine attack.    In thistheir judgment had since been proved to be at fault.There had, in fact, been sufficient drifters in Scapaat the time, which might have been impressed for thispurpose and used to picket all the entrances, andtheir employment would have avoided the loss of theROYAL OAK.    In spite of all this, however, he felt sure that it would be wrong to permit the greatdiversion of effort which would be involved in a detailed Inquiry of a disciplinary nature.   He proposedmerely to inform the House of Commons that energeticsteps were being taken to make good, the deficiencies in the defences of Seap8., and to ask Members to have confidence in the Board, of Admiralty,   He might add that long immunity from attack had given the Fleetconfidence in the security of the base, which events had shown to be unjustified.-2-

THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEexpressed grave concern that the Admiralty&apos;s arrange-ments for the security of this important base had broken down.   He felt sure that the Commander-in-Chiefof the Home Fleet and the Commander-in-Chief of theMediterranean Fleet, who had been responsible at theAd.mira.lty before the war, both felt very deeply a sense of responsibility for the loss of the ROYAL OAK.    Itwas surely impossible to allow this matter to be passed over without any censure at all on these officers.He suggested, that it was for the Admiralty to make up their own minds as to where the fault lay and to informthe officers concerned accordingly.   The First Lordwould then be in a position to say that all the propersteps had been taken in the matter.   In his opinion there would be a strong feeling in the Navy if nocensure at all was passed on the officers responsible.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR thought it quite possible that the House of Commons would accept the explanation which the First Lord would make without-making any serious trouble.   On the other hand, awkwardquestions might be asked, such as whether, before thewar, any officer had represented the unsatisfactory state of the defences.    For this reason he suggestedthat the First Lord might like the members of the WarCabinet to read Admiral Drax&apos;s Report-and form theirown opinion upon it, so that they could be in a positionto give him the support of their advice.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY expressed himselfconfident that he would be able to satisfy the Houseof Commons with the Statement which he proposed to make.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought that itwould be better not to make any reference in the Houseof Commons to assigning responsibility for what had happened.   He doubted whether any section of the House

was out to make trouble on this matter.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL siipported this view.    Hethought it better that the Statement should be madeon Wednesday, 8th November, as originally proposed;otherwise curiosity might be aroused as to why theStatement was being delayed.The War Cabinet agreed  (i) That the Statement by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty on the circumstances ofthe sinking of the ROYAL OAK should bemade in the Hous e of Commons, as originally proposed, on Wednesday, 8th November:(ii) That no reference should be ms.de in this statement to assigning responsibility forthe loss of the ROYAL OAK:(iii) To defer a decision on the question whether any action should be taken in regard toassigning responsibility until the WarCabinet had had an opportunity of studyingAdmiral Drax&apos;s Report and the commentsthereon of the Second and Fourth Sea Lords.Ri richmond T errace, S ,W .1,7th November,  1939.

MOST SECRET..WVM,   (59) 74th CONCTUSIONS,  MINUTE  5.Confidential Annex,..........-.......-THE AIR The War Cabinet had under consideration a &apos;STRENGTHS OFGREAT BRITAIN.:. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air onFRANCE ANDGERMANY. &quot;&apos;he Air Strengths of Great Britain,, France andGermany (W.P.   (39) 102),THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the reportof a broadcast by the Minister of Supply, in whichhe was alleged to have said that, with the help ofthe United States, the Allies would be in a positionto produce double the German output of aircraft.,THa SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said thathe had never c ommitted himself to saying more thanthat the combined output of. English and Frenchfactories would&quot;-cxtreedy^tha t of Germany *Continuing, he made the following points 2-(i) There were indications that Germany was taking steps to intensify her aircraft production.    Nevertheless, he, personally,was not prepared to accept the estimate that Germany&apos;s monthly output would reach2..400 machines in a year1 s time    He put the present German rate of output at about 1,100 to 1,200,(ii) The main anxiety about production inthis country concerned the possiblewithdrawal of some 20,000 skilled men for service with the Colours,    He wasdiscussing this matter with the Chairmanof the Man-Power Committee,&apos; who thoughtthat, subject to the approval of theWar Cabinet, arrangements could probablybe made to prevent the withdrawal of&quot;key&quot; men without detriment to theinterests of the War Office.,    This matter would, in due course,  reach the War Officethrough the appropriate machinery.

STATE FOR WAR questionedof heavy bombers. the wisdom of producing the heavy bombers of the halifax and Manchester types in view of their high cost, both in labour and money.      Air paritywith Germany could only be reached if the airneeds of all three Services were taken into account.

How could the air needs of the Army and the Navyhe met so long as a very high proportion of our aircraft manufacturing capacity was employed in producing very heary bombers?THE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR AIR said thatthe new types of heavy bombers were being produced in conformity with the policy approved by theGovernmento    He referred to the Memorandum on&quot;The Ideal Bomber&quot;.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, whilsthe had been convinced by, and did not now dissent from the arguments in support of this policy, itwas perhaps desirable to remember that this policy had assumed a long-term programme.    In view of thepossibility that the war might be short,  it mightbe as well to review that policyoa discussion ensued as to whether ourpresent aircraft programme was designed to produce the various types of aircraft in the rightproportions.    It was suggested that in time70 per cent, of the available capacity would be devoted to the production of the new heavy bombers.,THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR AIR agreedto examine the 70 per cento  figure, but pointedout that the case for the heavy bomber rested onthe most cogent arguments which had already beenaccepted by the War Cabinet,.    This type of machineseemed the only method oi achieving parity

Utilisation of aircraft manu-factured April-September, 1939.with the Germans in terms of bomb-lift.    Furthermore,recent air operations went to prove that, to be effective, an   Air Force must be equipped withthe most up-to-date and efficient machines.    Theheavy bomber belonged to this class, not only because of its speed and bomb-dropping capacity,but because of its formidable armament.    Even so,the Air Ministry, in order to balance the programme,had dropped production of the largest machinecontemplated in the heavy bomber programme, theStirling, while continuing their plans for the halifax and the Manchester.A discussion then followed on the utilisation of the new aircraft manufactured forthe Royal Air Force during the previous sixmonths.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR gave thefollowing details of the A&amp;aiim m document^n disposalof the afFcraf t/afeiivered fbetween 174739and &amp;0v9&quot;s-&amp;9*: -Re-arming of squadrons at home.Reserves and wastage at home.Formation of new squadrons andre-arming of squadrons overseas.Reserves and wastage overseas.Training.Experimental purposes.767,162146.155385362,651In addition 60 aircraft of operationaltypes were sent to the Dominions andforeign countries during the same period.&quot;

THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explained thebasis on which the present allowances for wastagehad been worked out before the war.      These had been based on the experience of the Great War and had been calculated separately for each type.      The figures were now being revised.     While it would be premature to base wastage rates on the experience of the lasttwo months,  the Air Staff had reached the conclusionthat the wastage rates on which they had previouslyworked assumed too high a level of sustained *4sfie^**w^and they were therefore now being reduced.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY was strongly of the opinion that the present allowance for wastagewas too high.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL agreed,  and consideredthat there were arguments for allotting more aircraft to the forming of new squadrons.Considerable discussion ensued on the contention of the Secretary of State for Air that the diversion of manufacturing capacity to provide theArmy with the 250 First-Line aircraft for which theywere asking by next Spring would rob the Bomber Air-Striking Force of half its strength.      It was statedthat the present first line mobilisable strength ofthe Bomber Force was 500, and that the production of bombers during the next six months was expected to be1,600.      Furthermore,  the output of bombers during thepast six months had amounted to 1,500.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the-Secretary of State for Air should furnish the WarCabinet with a paper giving the details of, for example

what had happened to the 1,500 Bombers produced during.the..^last six months, and similarly what the Air Ministryproposed to do with the 1,600 which t ey hoped toreceive during the next six months.      It would be helpful if a &quot;balance sheet&quot; could be prepared on this basis, showing how the total aircraft production wasutilised.     This course was agreed to.Purchases of THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that heAircraft fromthe U.S.A.       was giving consideration to the possibility of buyingand Italy.certain types of aircraft from the United States andItaly.      He warned the War Cabinet, however, thatcompared with our own, the aircraft industry in theUnited States was small and/unaeveloped and that we mustnot therefore rely on being able to obtain other thanvery limited quantities of aircraft.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recollectedthat the Mission sent to America in 1958 had reported,first, that American machines were not very good   and,secondly, that they were expensive.     Remarking thatthe French had a smaller Air Force than ourselves, but more gold, he suggested that it would be more appropriate for them than for us to buy American aircraft.Continuing, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIRreferred to the possibilities of purchase from Italy,&apos;including, in particular, 600 Italian- twin-enginedtraining aircraft at a cost of some  6 millions.      the disadvantages of purchases from Italy were;, first, thatit would probably be necessary for us to supply the rawmaterials required, and secondly,  that the aircraft would be relatively more expensive than similar aircraftproduced in Great Britain.     On balance, he thoughtthat it would be preferable to purchase in the UnitedStates than in Italy, but political considerationsmight intervene.

The War Cabinet agreed:-(l) To take note of the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (W.P. (39) 102).(2) To invite the Secretary of State for air to submit the following further Papers tothe War Cabinet:-(a) Beginning on the 1st January, 1940,quarterly statements giving particularsfor the ensuing six months on the same lines as those given in W.P.  (39) 102;(b) A statement showing what percentage ofthe total capacity of the aircraft industry would be devoted to the construction ofthe new heavy bombers (the Halifax and manchester Classes) when these types werein full production:(c) Detailed analyses showing:-(i) The total production of aircraft of each main type (e.g., fighters,bombers, trainers, etc.) between the1st April, 1939, and the 1st October,1939, and the purposes to which theaircraft in each of these main typeswere put:(ii) A Similar statement in respect ofthe anticipated total production of aircraft between the 1st October, 1939,and the 1st March, 1.940:(iii) The statements in (i) and (ii) should show the use made of any aircraftdisplaced by the production of newertypes during these periods.(3) To take note that the Secretary of State for Airwas in communication with the Chairman of theMan Power Committee in regard to the effecton aircraft production of the demands for manpower for military purposes.(4) To take note that the Secretary of State forAir had under consideration the question of purchases of aircraft from the United Statesof America and from Italy, and that he would submit his recommendations to the War Cabinet,after consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.,7th November, 1939.
