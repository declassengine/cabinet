MOST SECRET.W.M.   (59) lgSnd CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.The War Cabinet had before them thefollowing papers(a) Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs on the situationin Scandinavia and the possible resultsof the invasion of Finland (W.P.(39)164).(b) Note by the First Lord of the admiralty on the iron ore traffic from Norway(W.P.(39) 162), and a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on the same subject (W.P.(39)168).(c) Memorandum by the Minister of economic warfare on the subject of iron ore from narvik (W.P.(G.) (39) 153).(d) Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the stoppage of Swedish Iron Ore to Germany(W.P.(39) 169).(e) A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs covering a Frenchdraft of proposed Instructions from theFrench and British Governments to theirRepresentatives at Stockholm and Osloon the subject of help for Finland(W.P.(39)  170).THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that, as amatter of procedure, it would be convenient todeal first with the narrower question of the stoppage of ore from Narvik, before going on tothe wider implications of what might be done tobring about a total stoppage of all ore from sweden.At the request of the First Lord of theAdmiralty, he read extracts from a Memorandumsummarising Herr Thyssen&apos;s views which were thatvictory would accrue to the side which obtainedmastery of the iron ores and magnetic iron inNorthern Sweden.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY saidthat this information from Herr Thyssen confirmed that which had &quot;been supplied by the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare.      The cutting off of suppliesof Swedish ore, which were vital to Germany&apos;sprosecution of the war, was worth all the rest ofthe blockade, and provided a great chance ofshortening the war and possibly saving immeasurablebloodshed on the Western Front.      He realised thathe was asking the Foreign Secretary to make a verydifficult decision and was grateful to him for hishelpful attitude.As to the procedure to be followed, theFirst Lord&apos;s suggestions were as follows:-(i) The first step was to urge Sweden and norway to give all possible help to finland now, and offer them a guarantee____that we would go to their assistance7            71 I^N    with adequate forces if ,-iaa consequen^i/o t- tuiftfutnlly KliTJ&apos; aY^o-f their ho lp to Pinlandr^tresia-^r       7OT&quot; (rtTTyicmy Qfiba-simple    J     Gormany should steff-4ja.      This was going/PVCt^  tiifW-      ^---rather further than the French proposed&apos;----&apos; in their draft Note (W.P.(39) 170).(ii) We should tell Norway of the action whichwe proposed to take to stop all traffic to Germany along the West Coast of norway, at the^same time that the joint anglo-French demarche was made,(iii) Paragraph 12 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sMemorandum (W.P,(39) 168) was a suitablebasis for our action.      The actual method would be to send a force of nineDestroyers which would, in the initial stages.maintain a continuous patrol ofreliefs.      They would require no landbase in Norway.      Consideration had beengiven to the possibility of sending themto the Vest Fjord just outside Narvik,which would have the advantage of enabling them to control the traffic at its source, sending such ships as mightbe required direct to England andstopping the rest.    At the outset,however, the Admiralty were in favour of sending the force to a more lonely area.

Over&quot; and above the limited question of stopping the ore traffic from Narvik, there was thegreater   question of our laying plans to cut off all supplies of Swedish ore to Germany.      These wereplans which would require to be put into executionby the end of April, when Lulea would cease to beicebound. If they were successful, Germany,famishing for iron ore, would be in a very serious position.    In such straits; she would probablyreact violently and try to coerce Sweden by threatsand then by bombing;   but this might have the opposite effect and throw Sweden into our arras0Germany might endeavour to land a force at Luleato take possession of the minefields, and to exploitthem by forced labour for her own needs.    Y/e mustbe prepared to dispute such an attempt with armed force,    Thio weald- o-ompliontw  fee queb L.iuu,hufr &quot;] here was no reason why we should not be. able to send and maintain the necessary military and naval forces.Indeed, in many respects there would be distinctadvantages in conducting operations in Scandinaviain preference to the Western Front,      Such operations would give us the opportunity for exploiting theamphibious   strength of this country.    He did notthink that such action would necessarily involve us in general hostilities with Russia, v/hich he was-most anxious to avoid.     The Russians would have avery long way to go, across difficult country, toreach the ore fields.    Even if there was a clash with their troops, hostilities might be local only,such as had taken place in Manchuria for a longtime past.    It was, however, impossible to foresee,

(previous reference:W.M.  (39) 91stConclusions,Minute 7.)at this stage, what steps we might have to take in April, since these must depend on the reactions of Norway and Sweden, of Germany and of Russia,The First Lord was therefore strongly in favour of taking the first step of interruptingsupplies from Narvik, after such preliminarydiplomatic negotiations as might he necessary, withour eyes fully open to the fact that we could not possibly know precisely what would be the nextstep we should have to take.      But none of thepossible consequences of our action could outweigh the advantage which would accrue to us in deprivingGermany of her vital supplies of Swedish ore0    Therewas nothing that Germany could do to stop us from taking this initial step.      As a counter measure she might seize Stavanger which would improve the radius of action of her aircraft, and so bring Scapa withincloser range:   but this would be no more decisive thanthe threat of air attack to which London was atpresent exposed,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that we had given Norway an assurance that aGerman occupation of Stavanger would be viewed asa matter of direct interest to us.   We had intended.,if that guarantee were invoked,to confine our assistance to Norway to naval measures, but the WarCabinet had agreed, that this limitation   should notbe communicated to the Norwegian Government.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFobserved that Germany was inexperienced in combined operations.    An invasion of Southern Scandinavia wouldbe an enormous commitment for her.

THE FOREIGN SECRETARY fully recognised theimportance of cutting off all iron ore supplies to Germany.Furthermore, if,, in consequence of our action, the war spread to Scandinavia, it would he less likely to spread to the balkans, also.The stoppage of the Narvik supplies was by itself of little importance, and must be viewed in relation to thelargerquestion of preventing all supplies - namely those from Oxelsund at the present time, and from Lulea when the spring came0    He therefore thought that we ought first tosee our way clear as to the reaction of the two parts of theproblem on each other before dealing with only one of them.The key to the whole problem was the stoppage ofsupplies from Lulea,The First Lord had laid great stress on ourtaking such military action as would dominate the Galivarcfield, to prevent its acquisition by Germany.    It thereforebecame necessary to obtain a clearer indication of what this would involve.    He presumed that i t would mean landinga force at Narvik and sending it down the railway.    Such a landing could hardly be made without the consent of Norway,,He felt very doubtful whether either Norway or Sweden would welcome any guarantee of assistance from us against Germany,whatever might be their attitude to an offer of assistance against Russia,    Any action to stop the Narvik suppliesmust be weighed against its possible repercussions on thelarger project of stopping all supplies to Germany.    Itwould be unwise to prejudice our success in the largerproject by action at Narvik which would only have alimited effect.     The goodwill of Norway and Sweden was.essential for success; in the larger project.    his conclusion,therefore, was that we should give everyassistance in our power to Finland and press the scandinavian countries to do the same, on the lines-proposed by the French.    Meanwhile we should take no actionabout the Narvik traffic until we saw the results of theproposed demarche.

THE PRIME MINISTER said there could he no doubtthat the decision to be taken was of the utmost import-ance.   It might be one of the turning points of the var.He was greatly impressed by the statements containedin Herr Thyssen&apos;s memorandum, and it certainly seemedas if there was a chance of dealing a mortal blow toGermany.He agreed with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs that it would be a mistake to prejudice our chances of success in the major project of stoppingall supplies of ore to Germany, by precipitate actionon the limited project of stopping the Narvik traffic.To- carry out the big project it would be essential tohave the good will both of Norway and Sweden, though somedistinction might be drawn between these two countries.Norway was less vulnerable to German attack than Sweden.Even if the Germans seised bases on the coasts of Norwayit was very doubtful whether they could ever over-runa large part of the country.   The effect on Norway ofGerman hostility would therefore be correspondinglyless, though no doubt she would not at all relishthe idea of such hostility.    Sweden, however, was ina different position.   The danger to that country ofRussian aggression could easily be exaggerated,particularly in view of what we now saw of Russianinefficiency in their invasion of Finland.    It wasvery doubtful, however, whether Sweden would welcomeour guarantee against German aggression, since this might very rapidly involve her in hostilities withGermany.   On the other hand, it was essential to get-Sweden in on our side.      It would be impracticable

to put in a force through Narvik to stop supplies toGermany from the Galivarc minefields unless we had thegood v.-ill of Sweden;    and if we had Sweden&apos;s good will,Norway would probably fall into line.    There seemed little-prospect that much could be done by sabotage alone.The problem therefore resolved itself into gettingSweden into the war on our side, and it would benecessary to consider very carefully what effect actionagainst the Narvik traffic would have on Sweden.    Itwould, be desirable to obtain as early as possibleher reactions to a guarantee on the lines proposed bythe French,  coupled, with a hint that we intended to takedrastic action to cut off supplies of ore to Germany.Sweden would, probably realise that if she sent ass is t-ance to Finland, she might be attacked by Russia, andthat in this  case Germany might well offer her &quot;protec-tion&quot; against Russian aggression.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs pointed out that if Sweden accepted our guarantee against Russia in the first instance, she would, be socommitted to us that she would, have to look to thesupport of the Allies against Russia, rather than toGermany.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL emphasised, that- in .any negotiations with Sweden the best.  card, of entry wouldbe Russia.    There had. always been a very strong anti-Russian feeling in Sweden.

THE PRIME MINISTER observed that it would beas well to point out to Sweden that Germany would beloath to quarrel with Sweden for fear of losing her supplies of ore: but if, nevertheless, she tried to seize the minefields by force of arms, we should beable to get there first and protect them againstGermany.-THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY emphasised theimportance of Sweden&apos;s friendship from the supply pointof view.     We were very short of ferro-chrome, and we also drew a large amount of our supplies of calcium-carbide from Scandinavia.     We had plenty of Turkishchrome-ore, but our manufacturing capacity to convertthe crude ore into ferro-chrome was small and would takea considerable time to develop.      If the Swedish suppliewere cut off, the position would be rather serious.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed thatGermany might seize southern Sweden and cut off these supplies, but, on the other hand, we should stop her supplies of iron-ore, which were- the deciding factor.THE MINISTER FOR GO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEgave the War Cabinet a. summary of the discussion whichhad taken place on the whole question at the last meeting of the Military Co-ordination Committee.      their general conclusion had been that, though it would bedesirable to cut off the Narvik supplies immediately,and thereby deprive Germany of something between amillion and two million tons of ore during the winter(which we could incidentally divert to our own use),this was only the first step.      Our action wouldprobable stimulate Germany into increased activity, and55     M.C.   (39) 10th Meeting.

the whole tempo of the war would speed up.      It wastherefore necessary to be sure that we could carry through the whole project of stopping all the orejo/fier fcav hyAr&amp;yce/ ctcf/on ceittie-supplies to Germanybefore tne rxrst step was taken.^For this reason, the Committee had asked the Chiefsof Staff to consider and report on all the implication,of the despatch to Narvik, and subsequent maintenance in north Sweden, of a British or Franco-British forceof sufficient strength to hold the mines in northSweden against attack by Russia and/or Germany.    TheChief of the Imperial General Staff had given a preliminary opinion that quite a small force could hold the minefields during the winter months, but itwas essential to have a picture of the full military implications of the project.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR urged that itwould be unwise to take a decision on the limitedNarvik project alone until we were quite sure that wecould successfully carry out the full project.      Itwas, therefore, essential to wait until the Chiefs ofStaff had made their report.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO pointed outthat there might well be a long delay before we were ina position to see the full implications of the bigproject.      The Russian advance in Finland might go veryslowly, and the Scandinavian countries might temporisefor a long time before giving any answer to our demarche..If no attempt was made to stop the Narvik supplies inthe meantime, we should lose an opportunity ofinflicting a serious embarrassment on Germany.     Evena limited restriction of their imports of ore mightprevent them carrying out any major operation.

THE MINISTER OP ECONOMIC WARFARE said thatwe had no precise knowledge of Germany&apos;1 s stocks of ore-,If these were large, the stoppage of the Narvik supplierwould admittedly have very little effect0      But if wecould cut off supplies from Oxelsund as well as Narvik;the embarrassment to Germany would be very serious?He agreed that, since the Germans had not yet startedmilitary operations on any intensive scalef their consumption would probably have been smaller than theymight have anticipated before the war.      Nevertheless,reports had been received that some of the ironworks innorthern Bohemia had already shut down owing to lack ofore.THE MINISTER FOE CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE drew attention to an important strategical consideration which would arise if the war spread to the BalMfl0 * if germany could carry on a war in the Balkans as well asin the Baltic;  we should be hard put to it to find theshipping to supply the forces on three fronts.      If,however, the opening up of the Baltic front preventedGermany from invading the Balkans, it would be to ourbenefit, since the maintenance of forces in Scandinaviawould be very much easier than that of troops in the balkans.      He hoped the Chiefs of Staff would try andassess the possibility of the Germans carrying on a warboth in the north and in the south-east at the same time,THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE pointedout that the loss of Norwegian shipping to us would be serious, particularly in respect of tankers,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL observed that we had notyet begun to take the drastic measures which we had usedin the last war to obtain from neutral countries the

shipping which we required.     We should have to govery much further before the war was over.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY hoped that,if Norway and Sweden refused to have anything to do with our proposed guarantee to them, it would not mean that the whole project was to be abandonedo     It wasvery doubtful whether Norway and Sweden would want tobecome involved in the war, but we should not let thisdeter us.      He felt very strongly that we should seize the minefields at all costs.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that reluctance on the part of the scandinavian countries need not necessarily be a decisive factor.He suggested that we should start by pressing themhard to support Finland on the lines of the draft note of the French, and that we should take the opportunityto broach the question of stopping the Narvik supplies.But we should have to keep an open mind and see howthings developed.      He did not think it would benecessary to wait until the Chiefs of Staff had completed their full examination of the big projectbefore we made our joint demarche to Norway and Sweden.In the French draft, it was only proposed to say thatwe were &quot;prepared to consider in what circumstances andin what form an assurance could in practice be given to sweden and Norway of Franco-British help against thepossible consequences to them of such direct or indirect assistance as they might afford to Finland&quot;.Some discussion then took place on the methodof the approach to be made to Norway and Sweden.      Itwas suggested that it might be better to send a specialemissary to Stockholm and Oslo, possibly under cover of the Anglo-Swedish Commission to be set up under the

War Trade Agreement with Sweden.      On the other hand,it might be better for the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs himself to make the communication tothe Norwegian and Swedish Ministers in London.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it would benecessary to make it clear to Norway and to Sweden,at the same time as the offer of a guarantee was made,that we were considering action to stop the suppliesof ore going to Germany.      Our guarantee could be offered as an offset to this communication.     Thiswould force their hands and prevent them temporisingbefore accepting our offer of a guarantee.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR suggested thatwe might at the same time point out to Norway and Sweden-,who were peace-loving countries, that it lay in their power to end the war quickly by co-operating in the cutting off of vital supplies to Germany.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY observed thatthere had been reports that the Russians were preparingships with a view to seizing Narvik by a sea-borneexpedition.      i* would toa ac well ta bring nsheae-report a to tho notioo of Norway.The War Cabinet:-(i)    Approved the Memorandum of Instruction;&quot;:set out in W.P.  (39) 170 as to the communication to be made by the Frenchand British Governments to theNorwegian and Swedish Governments onthe subject of the assurance to begiven to the latter Governments ofFranco-British help against thepossible consequences to them of such assistance as they might afford to finland:(ii)   Agreed that when the communicationreferred to in (i) above was made tothe Governments of Norway and Sweden,they should be informed at the sametime that we intended to take certain measures to s top t he supply of iron ore from Sweden to Germany:

(iii)    Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to consider the most appropriate means of making the communications referred to in (i) and(ii) above,  i.e., whether through HisMajesty&apos;s Ministers at Oslo and Stockholm;or through a special emissary;    orhimself personally to the Swedish and norwegian Ministers in London:(iv)    Invited the Chiefs of Staff, in thelight of the above discussion, to give further consideration to all the military implications of a policy which aimed atstopping the export of Swedish iron oreto Germany:(v)   With reference to W.P.  (39) 170, invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider -(a) The character and extent of the indirect assistance which thiscountry could render to Finland?with particular reference to thedespatch of technical missions and the supply of material:(b) What assistance could, in practice,be given to Sweden and Norwayagainst the possible consequences to them of such direct or indirectassistance as they might afford to finland:(vi)   Agreed that until the Report of the Chiefsof Staff referred to in (iv) above hadbeen considered by the -War Cabinet, andthe reactions of the Swedish and norwegian Governments had been obtainedto the demarche referred to in (i)and (ii)above, no action should be taken by theAdmiralty towards stopping the exportsof iron ore from Narvik to Germany.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.22nd December, 1939.
