- MOST SECRET -W.M.(59)  120th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 11.Confidential Annex.*      a      *THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO reminded the WarCabinet that he had made an interim oral report onthe 5th December on the question of coast watchingin Eire.   He had then advocated the establishmentof a modest Secret Service to aupplement the officialService, but had refrained from asking the War cabinet for a decision pending further information, for which,he was waiting, about the condition of the officialCoast Watching Service, and also details of theproposed Secret Service.   He had now&quot;received reports on both these points.The matter had, however, now become urgent, asit was necessary to offer an appointment to thedesignate Head of the proposed Secret Service, whohad been offered alternative employment by theGovernment.The Naval Attache&apos;&apos; in Dublin had visited a numberof Eire Coast Watching Stations in company withCoUntlOeiBHBmder Archer, the founder of the Service.   TheNaval Attache&apos;&apos; had stated that the Eire authorities were doing their best to make the official serviceefficient.    The personnel, equipment and pay of theCoast Watchers were better than we had been led to expect.   Accommodation was not yet complete, butcontracts had been placed and were in hand..    In onerespect, however, the Coa.st Watching Stations remainedhopelessly defective, namely,  in communications, andparticularly in telephones..

isDuring the past fortnight only one official report, and that a vague one, had been received fromthe Eire Coast Watching organisation.    Ho reliableevidence had been received of the use of the Irishcoast by German submarines, but several sinisterand circumstantial stories had come to hand.   A secretreport had recently been received to the following effect:-&quot;Stories of the presence of german submarines off the west coast have become so common that they have ceased to cause any great interest.&quot;Continuing, the Minister said, that the matter, inhis opinion, was of such importance to the Navy thathe did not think that we should, hesitate any longer in authorising the institution of a modest secret service, such as he had. described in his report to theWar Cabinet on the 5th December.     It would be built up on the ba.sis of the existing small Secret service in Eire, and. would, be controlled, by persons of provedexperience and. caution.The Director of Naval Intelligence was satisfied with the scheme which had. been worked, out.The Secretary of Sta.te for Dominion Affairs ha.dlikewise seen the scheme Land was willing to accept it,subject to some modification of the arrangementsoriginally proposed, for communications which they werediscussing together, and, of course, on condition that every precaution would, be taken to ensure the secrecy of the s cheme.In seeking the approval of the War Cabinet to theestablishment of a modest Secret Service, the minister without Portfolio asked, that he might, at . the same time,be allowed, to continue to keep in touch with thequestion of coast watching in Eire in both its aspects,

namely, the development of the official scheme,  andalso the proposed Secret Service.THE HOME SECRETARY was informed, in response toan enquiry, that the -activities of the Secret service would be strictly limited to coast watching.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that theproposed Secret Service would be a material help tothe Admiralty, and cn.rnestly hoped that it would, be approved by the War Cabinet.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that therewere no financial objections.The War Cabinet  Approved the proposals of the minister without Portfolio for an intelligence organisation in Eire, and invited himto keep in touch with the question ofcoast watching in Eire from the aspectsboth of the Official Scheme and of the secret Service.Ri richmond T terrace. c e , S .W. 1,20th December, 1939.
