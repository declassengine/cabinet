- MOST SECRET -W-.M.J39)  67th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex.SECURITY OPFLEET BASES,(previous reference:W.M.(39)  65thConclusions,Minute 3 .)THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY gave the War cabinet an account of the meeting which, accompanied by theFirst Sea Lord and the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff,he had had with the Commander-in-Ohief, Home Fleet, on:the previous day.Complete unanimity of view had been reached onthe policy to be followed in the immediate future forthe basing of the Fleet.    It was clear that theCommander--in-Chief was s.nxious to use Scapa, if possible,.-&apos;   .-v&quot;     ^V&apos;-:-   ^ -.&quot;&quot;-&apos;&apos;-v.-:.;&apos;   \     . , .   .as his mam base, but he had fully appreciated thereasons why this would not be practicable for sometime to come;    and he had been convinced of theadvantages of either the Clyde or Rosyth as againstSeapa from the point of view of fighter defence, moreparticularly in the event of sustained attack by successive waves of bombers.   As between the Clyde andRosyth, the Commander-in-Chief had. been strongly infavour of Rosyth.    While the Clyde position had thevery material advantage of giving the fighters a bettercha.nee of engaging raiders, both before  fee after their attck, it had distinct disadvantages from the Navalpoint of view.   For example, heavy ships using the clyde had to proceed along a narrow, seven-mile stretchof water in which it was impossible to zig -zag.   From.the point of view of A.A. gun and balloon defence,the Fleet anchorage at Rosyth could be much moreefficiently defended than any suitable anchorage inthe Clyde.    In addition, the anti-submarine defences inthe Forth afforded much greater security than those inthe Clyde.

On balance, therefore, it had. been agreed that, ifor the time being, Rosyth should be used in prefer-once to the Clyde.The Commander-in-Chief shared the views of theFirst Sea Lord that Capital Ships should not be sentinto the Southern part of the North Sea unless we hadsure information that they would meet the enemy&apos;sheavy ships.    The Commander-in-Chief had also agreedthat xt would be unwise to take any unnecessary riskswith the HOOD.The future movements of the Fleet would thereforebe as follows.    The HOOD would proceed, to Devonport,and the NELSON and RODNEY, after an interval at sea,would, proceed to Rosyth.The War Cabinet approved the abovearrangements.&apos;Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,1st November, 1939.
