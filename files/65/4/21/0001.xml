- MOST SECRET -W_.lL._i39) 96tli CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.O * *THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY informed the WarCabinet that an ice-breaker, the property of theSoviet Government, had now successfully rna.de its way through the Skaggerak into the Baltic.   It remained to be seen what use the Russians intended to make ofthis ice-breaker.    If it were to be employed in theGulf of Finland, we should have no cause for complaint,although the anxieties of the Finnish Government mightbe somewhat increased.    It was possible, however,that the ice-breaker was intended to be used in theGulf of Bothnia, for the purpose of keeping open thetrade route between Lulea and Germany.    If so, thiswould be a notable example of Russo-German economic co-operation, and a gra.ve threat to us .    It wouldenable the German munitions industry to maintain itssupplies of Swedish iron ore throughout the winter.The First Lord said that a method had occurred to  him by which this danger, if it materialised,  couldbe removed, without a formal breach between thiscountry and the Soviet Union.     As his colleagues were aware,,., two Polish submarines, which had escapedfrom the Baltic, were now atta.ched to the Royal Navy.They were dependent upon us for their supplies.    Thequestion of the relations between Poland and russia was not one which need trouble us.    If the government at Angers was not technically at war with Russia,the worst relations existed between them.   His sugges-tion would be that one of the two Polish submarinesshould be encouraged to return to the Baltic for the

1911 M i.purpose of torpedoing the Russian ice-breaker.   Thesubmarine would probably be able to remain at sea forsome 14 days before returning to one of our ports totake in fresh oil.The First Lord said that he was not now asking for any decision on his suggestion. . The need for action would only arise if the Russians attempted tokeep the route to Lulea open.The War Cabinet took note ofthe shove statement.Richmond Terrace, S ,W .1,28th November. 1939.
