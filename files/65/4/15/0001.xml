BELGIUM.Staff Oon-versations.- MOST SECRET -W.M.(59)  87th. CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 6.&apos;-Confidential Annex.*     *     *ADMIRAL OP THE FLEET SIR ROGER KEYES gave theWar Cabinet an account of his recent visit to Belgium.He had visited the General Headquarters of the british expeditionary Force on his way, where he had been told that, as the B.E.P. was under the command of general george , no underta,kings could be given to the belgians by the British for assistance on land exceptthrough the French.On arrival in Brussels he had had dinner withQueen Elizabeth.   She had paid a number of visits:Vtothe Belgian defences on the frontier recently, andspoke highly of the morale of the Belgian troops andof the immense efforts which had been made to strengths]the fort if modifications .    There ws,s no doubt about theBelgian determinant ion to defend their country.He had asked the Queen whether the violation of theDutch frontier by the Germans would be sufficient to cause the Belgians to ask for our assistance.   She wasnot prepared to give a reply on that point.   Sheexpressed her great admi.ra.tion of the King of the belgians, who was very liketids father and. had a determined character. Her Majesty spoke a good dealof the difficulties which the Belgians had had withthe French ever since the last war, and of the King&apos;sunpopularity in Paris.    She a.lso expressed unboundedconfidence in Genera.1 Van Overstraeten, who waspro-Ally in sympathy and was the outstanding figure inthe Belgian Army.-1-^&apos; he. also      M%C Ce+ilwb^ (jivJitcbs&quot;Ajo\&apos;e*

Sir Roger Keyes,  continuing, said that on thenext day he had seen the King and had discussed withhim the probable Belgian attitude if the neutrality of Holland were infringed.   He had expressed to theKing his views of the attitude which he thought wouldhave been adopted by the late King in present circum-stances.   He had said that he thought the late Kingwould have declared that the present concentration ofGerman troops on the Eastern frontier of Belgium was an outrage, and. that the British and French could be relied upon not to violate Belgian neutrality:   hewould have ms.de it clear to the Germans that thecrossing of the Dutch frontier would inevitably bringBelgium into the war against them.   The King had pointed out that he was a constitutional monarch and could only express the views of his Government, who did not judge the moment opportune for any suchdeclaration.   He was, however, Oommander-in-Chief ofthe Army, and when the right time came he would leadfob-As        \&amp;euAA be-them against the Germans, he w^as-.....supportedby the of his Government.Sir Roger added that it appeared that the Dutchhad not asked, the Belgians to come to their assistance if attacked, and the Belgia.ns did not wish to be askedThey felt that the Dutch Army was so small that itwould call upon the Belgians to operate against theGermans in areas v/hich were not at all suitable, andwhich would prejudice the defence of their own country it was, nevertheless,  certain that if Holland wereinvaded, the Belgians would call us into their own country.On the following day he   (Sir Roger Keyes) had again met the King at the Queen&apos;s house.    The king had again expressed his desire to do something more

in an effort to restore peace before irrevocableaction was taken.   He knew that the war would, be abloody one, and that the Germans would stick at nothing.It would be worth a great deal to gain time, even if noother benefit resulted from a further attempt at asettlement.   He had told the King that he feared thecase was hopeless.   Herr Hitler could hardly put forwardany terms which we could consider, and our attitude had been made clear by the uncompromising answer fromKing George to the offer of mediation ms.de by the queen of the Netherlands and the King of Belgium.Continuing, Sir Roger Keyes said that at the timeof his last visit to Belgium, a German doctor had beenin Brussels who ha.d treated the King after a ski-ingaccident, and wlxo had established friendly relationswith him.    This doctor had. been through the Polishcampaign, and was known to be in close touch with herr hitler.   He surmised that this doctor had been sent to belgium to impress on the King the great power of theGerman mechanised drive into Poland.   He had heard that the doctor had had an audience of the King, fromwhich he had come out much depressed, and went straightback to Germany.    It was probable that the King had told the doctor that Belgium would resist any attempt by Germany to pass through her territory.       He (Sirhsr^h bitRoger Keyes) thought it /likely that any feelers whichthe King might wish to put out to Germany would be donethrough the agency of this doctor.Sir Roger thought that his telegram of the 13thNovember had perhaps been phrased to give an impression that the King of the Belgians wished to put out peacefeelers with the authority of the British Government.This did not correctly express the King&apos;s attitude.The King realised that such feelers would probably

produce no result, but be hoped that if, by any chance,any reasonable proposals were to come from Germany,His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider them.    It wasonly to this extent that the King had expected us tobe associated with his action.It was quite certain that the Germans had had nothing to do with the offer of mediation which hadbeen made by the two raonarchs .    The King was inspiredwith a genuine wish to do what he could, at any rate to gain time.The importance of more time was also emphasisedby General Van Overstra.eten.   The Belgians were anxiousto complete the work on their second line of defence.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether the King ofthe Belgians was expecting any further measage fromthe British Government.   We had already expressed, our readiness to examine any proposals, in King George&apos;reply to the offer of mediation.SIR ROGER KEYES thought that a friendly messagewould be well received by the King.   Perhaps theeasiest method would, be for a message to be includedin a letter which he would write to the King, and, ifthe Prime Minister approved this suggestion, he would immediately prepare a draft.This proposal was approved.&apos;Continuing, Sir Roger Keyes said, that the Belgianshad been convinced, that the Germans were going to begintheir invasion on the 11th November.   A number ofGerman diplomatic families had. left shortly before,and all Intelligence pointed the same way.    For several days beforehand the German reconnaissance aircraft had flown ceaselessly over the Belgian defences, takingphotographs.   However, the attack had. not come, a.ndthe Belgians attributed, this to the fact that the*A CoL 4 *** ****** K b

tooGermans had discovered the great strength of theBelgian defences and the Allied concentration behindI .   the Franco-Belgian frontier.    The Belgians were now-inclined to think that nothing would happen until the spring.   But General Van Overstraeten was quiteconfident that if the Germans did come they wouldsustain a decisive defeat.The Belgians were very anxious to obtain someA.A. guns, in order to prevent the continual reconnais-sance on the part of the German Air Force.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thathe had promised to send them four 3.7-inch guns as soonas possible.Continuing, SIR ROGER KEYES said that the british military Attache&quot; in Brussels had established very good relations with General Van Overstraeten, and would, begiven full information.   The General was suspicious of the French military.ry Attache&apos;, however, and desiredall conversations between the French and the Belgiansto take place in Pa.ris .THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he understood that Sir Robert Clive was about to be relieved and replaced, by someone else.   He questionedthe wisdom of making a change at such a vitally import-any juncture.SIR ROGER KEYES said, that the King of the Belgianshad expressed the same view.   Sir Robert Clive was now well known in Brussels, and. they were used, to him.    the ambassador&apos;s attitude had been extremely helpfultowards the somewhat delicate Mission which he (sir roger) had. just undertaken.SIR ALEXANDER CADOGAN undertook to bring to thenotice of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsthe view which had been expressed.richmond Terrace, S.W.1, TtLe War cabinet took note of the18th November, 1939. above statements.

I told the Prime Minister of Your Majesty1sintense desire to contribute something towards an acceptablepeace end of your understanding that the replies of king george, and the French President to Your Majesty and QueenWilhelmina were definite and uncompromising;   I said that your Majesty fully appreciated that any further approachescould only be initiated by Germany.     I told the Prime Ministerof your readiness to try personally to ascertain secretlywhat the German Government would be prepared to offer.     Ifurther told him that your desire to help was based onhumanitarian grounds in the hope of averting ruthless anddevastating warfare, and that you urgently stressed the valueof delay on military grounds, since delay could only favour the Allies and Belgium and be of detriment to the Germans.The Prime Minister asked me very earnestly totell you that he understands your sentiments and your desireto avoid useless bloodshed, and that he agrees with your majesty that from a military point of view time is on the sideof the Allies;   but the British position has been made clear in our public declarations, and there could be no question of

any steps &quot;being taken by us, or by our wish, to invitenegotiations.     He told me that he also felt &quot;bound in honestyto say that he thought it would he impossible that hitler would make any proposals that His Majesty&apos;s Government couldlook at.    He takes this opportunity of sending Your Majestyhis heartfelt sympathy in your most anxious situation.I am afraid Your Majesty will be disappointedwith the Prime Ministers reply, but you will remember that1 told you I could hold out no hope of a favourable answer to Your Majesty1 s suggestion.
