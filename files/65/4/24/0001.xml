MOST SECRET.W.M.  (39) 104th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 8.Confidential Annex.EIRE: THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO informedIntelligence the War Cabinet of the position reached in the enquiryOrganisation.into the arrangements for Intelligence in Eirewhich he had been asked to conduct.He said that he had begun by looking intothe existing Coast-Watching system which was under thecontrol of the Eire Government.      This had only comeinto existence last August, when it had been started on a purely police basis and had been of little or no value.      Throughout September the position had been thoroughly unsatisfactory, but had improved a littlewith the appointment of Sir John Maffey.      Through himan arrangement had been made on the 12th October,whereby movements of enemy submarines, when observed by the Eire Coastal Watch, should be telegraphed to dublin and Cork and thence sent by wireless to the eire Air Force Coastal Patrol on a stated wavelength.So far as was known, only two reports had been sentunder this arrangement, one on the 2nd November andanother on the 3rd.      Subsequent corroboration showed that these reports had been accurate.      Unfortunately,owing to a misunderstanding about wavelengths,  theywere not picked up by the Admiralty.      This misunder-standing had been cleared up, and continuous watchhad since been kept on the correct wavelength, but nofurther reports had been r received.      The present arrangements suffered from the following defects(i)   Listening for reports involved a continuous twenty-four hour watch,which not only immobilised apparatusbut imposed a severe strain onpersonnel.-1-

(ii)    It made it very difficult,  if not impossible, to assess the reliability of such reports as we might be ableto intercept.(iii)    It was doubtful whether messages onthe agreed wavelength would be received in this country unless transmitted with considerable power.(iv) Reports were sent en clair and were therefore liable to interception bythe enemy,Furthermore, the Eire Coast-WatchingService was, at present, of low efficiency.      Thecoast-watchers were badly paid, ill-equipped (theyoften did not even possess binoculars), and wererecruited on many sections of the coast fromunreliable personnel.     No watch was kept at night,although it was obvious that a U-boat putting infor provisions would be much more likely to do sounder cover of darkness.      Since the beginning ofthe war the Admiralty had received reports, whichwere considered reliable, of at least four cases of u-boats entering Irish Territorial Waters, namelys-One in Blacksod Bay on the 16th September.One in Donegal Bay on the 30th September.One in Donegal Bay on the 8th October.One in Bantry Bay on the 9th November.The first three had occurred before the arrangement of the 12th October had come into force.      The BantryBay case was, however, subsequent to that date;    and though the source from which our information came was undoubtedly reliable, we had received no reportfrom the Eire authorities.Continuing, Lord Hankey said that, in examining the Admiralty proposal for a secret BritishCoastal Intelligence Service in Ireland, it had at

once become evident to him that it would take sometime to organise such a Service,  and that it could never provide a complete substitute for the existing service.      Indeed, the Admiralty view had been thatany Service to be set up in the immediate future shouldbe on a moderate scale, designed to supplement theexisting Eire Government Service and to provide acheck on its reliability.      Moreover, while it was;in the making we should have to rely on the existing service.Clearly, the first step, therefore, was totune up the present Service as far as possible.    Hehad accordingly asked the Admiralty to draw up theirdesiderata,    which had been approved by a representativeof the Dominions Office and himself.      These desideratadealt with matters of detail, of which the mostimportant was that -(i)   All reports should, if possible, becommunicated confidentially through our Naval Attache in Dublin; or, ifthe Eire Government would not agreeto this, they should be asked,  inaddition to broadcasting reports whenreceived, to wireless a summary totheir Coastal Air Patrols at statedtimes, say, twice or thrice a day, inorder to save the Admiralty from having to maintain a continuous watch.    reports to be sent, if possible, in cipher.Other suggestions for improving the Coast-WatchingService were.-(ii)   An adequate watch by night as wellas by day,(iii)    The supply of equipment for thecoast-watchers on favourable terms.(iv)    The establishment of D. P.  stations in Eire,

Lord Hankey emphasised, furthermore, thatour need for information was not confined to reportsabout the movements of enemy submarines only.    we wanted to know as much as possible of everything that was happening on the Eire Coast - movements ofsuspected vessels?    the presence of supply vessels;attempts to purchase victuals or to obtain water;or to land spies or agents as in the case of RogerCasement in the last war,With the assent of the Dominions Officehe had authorised Mo.1,5 to arrange, through theIrish High Commissioner, for Colonel Archer, whohandled these matters in Eire and was the recognisedliaison officer, to visit this country as soon aspossible.      Advantage would be taken of ColonelArcher&apos;s visit to enable the Director of NavalIntelligence to discuss with him the whole questionof improving the Eire Coast-Tfetching Service, onthe lines which he (Lord Hankey) had indicated.Meanwhile, the Naval Attache in Eire was, at thepresent time, visiting the whole of the Coastal stations and it was hoped that his report, which would be readyvery shortly, would provide a good deal more informationFollowing the semi-official conversations with ColonelArcher an official approach would be made through sir john Maffey to the Eire authorities with a view toplacing the matter on a more formal footing.Having thus described the provisionalarrangements which he had set in train for improving the existing Coast-Watching Service in Eire, Lord Earfeaywent on to deal with the preliminary investigation which

he had made into the possibility and usefulness ofestablishing a secret British Service, as suggestedby the Admiralty.     At the outset he drew attentionto certain features which distinguished a Coast-Watching Service from similar Services in Great Britainand Northern Ireland:-(a) In Great Britain, if anything unusualwas observed, information was immediatelypassed to the Naval Centre concerned;and immediate action was taken to send the necessary Naval Forces.In Eire, except possibly near the bordersof Northern Ireland, such Forces would not normally be available in the vicinity.(b) By contrast with this country, communications in Eire were very poor, e.g., at one of thepresent Eire stations, the Coast-Watchershad to walk twelve miles to reach a telephone.(c) There was general agreement that thewatching of a long and indented coastline,such as that of Eire,  could not be effective without the willing co-operation of thelocal population.(d) The number of Coast-Watchers required for acomplete Service would be very large.     Inthe last war we had employed 700 Watchers,and the present Eire Service comprised 500or 600.(e) The Eire police were very efficient, andour Intelligence authorities all agreedthat anything in the nature of a largeSecret Intelligence Service would very soon be discovered.In these circumstances, Lord Hankey saidthat he had come to the conclusion that if we were tohave a Secret Service for Coast-Watching in Eire, itmust necessarily be on a modest scale.     He had in mindan organisation which would include a few carefully-chosen agents who would be placed at a dozen or moreselected points along the coast.      This Service would beof particular value in providing us with some check onthe Government of Eire&apos;s official Coast-Watching Service

and.would thereby enable us to discover its shortcomingsand weak points, so that, if the opportunity offered, wecould in the most friendly and helpful way make representations for its improvement.     In addition,this Service would give us either -(i)   reliable information as to the habitsof U-boats in visiting particularplaces;    or, alternatively,(ii)   negative information that nothing washappening on the Irish coast, or on aparticular stretch of it.     Suchnegative information would be of first importance, as it would relieve us fromthe necessity of watching, and so enable us to economise substantially in ships and menaLord Hahkey said that he had asked theauthorities concerned to work out the details of a modest service of this kind.     When he had received thedetails of such a service;   had heard the results of the tour of our Naval Attache;    and knew the outcome of the conversations which would be taking place with ColonelArcher, he, would make a further report.     Until then, he did not ask the War Cabinet to take any decision.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY expressed hisgratitude for the very thorough examination which hadbeen carried out by the Minister without Portfolio.The War Cabinet took note of the InterimReport made by the Minister without portfolio o5th December, 1939.
