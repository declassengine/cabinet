- MOST SECRET -W.M. (59) 98th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 9.Confidential, Annex.GERMAN-soviet relations.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, according to information received from a secretsource in Berlin, which was regarded as exceptionallyreliable, Count von Schulenburg, the German ambassador in Moscow, about a fortnight before he had beenrecalled to Berlin for consultation with Herr Hitler,had addressed a despatch to the German Foreign Office,in which he had given his grounds for believing thata feeling of deep hostility was entertained by theGovernment of the U.S.S.R. towards the tenets ofNational Socialism.    In submitting this report the ambassador had added that he realised the effect thatthis might have on future policy.On the 9th November, 1939, an official in theGerman Foreign Office, who had exceptionally wideknowledge of the U.S.S.R. ana. was believed to have served in the German Embassy in Moscow, wrote a Minutein the German Foreign Office on Count von Schulenburg&apos;despatch in which he said that, whereas at the timewhen a contact was first established between Germanyand the U.S.S.R. the latter had shown restraint intheir attitude towards National Socialism in Germany,now, however, there was no such restraint.   On thecontrary, open hostility was being shown againstNational Socialism, both as regards its structure and its foreign aims.   At present, such anti-Naziopinions were being expressed through unofficialchannels, but in view of the nature of the Governmentin the U.S.S.R. there was no doubt that these attacks

were directly inspired by the Soviet Government.The official who wrote this Minute drew the conclusionthat these attacks were intended to pave the way fora change of policy by the U.S.S.R. in regard toGermany .According to the same report, officials of theForeign Office were strongly of the opinion that theRussian adventure had been a failure and that thepolicy would be abandoned as soon as Herr von Ribben-trop disappeared.    It was also stated that HerrRosenberg had been strongly opposed to the German-Soviet connection, -and that if he had given opendis-expression to his ^approval by resignxng his offxce, aschism in the National Socialist Party would have beeninevitable.   Herr Hitler had accordingly been at greatpains to win Herr Rosenberg&apos;s support for that policy,and in this he had been partly successful.   HerrRosenberg was now asserting that the German retreatfrom the Baltic was only temporary.    It was interest-ing to note that Herr Rosenberg and Field-marshal goering were now working closely together.   TheField-Marshal was strongly opposed to Herr von Ribben-trop&apos;s policy towards the U.S.S.R.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W..1,29th November, 1939.
