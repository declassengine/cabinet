Minute 8.Confidential Annex.J?HE NETHERLANDS THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO gave theQnD BELGIUM.___ War Cabinet the following account of the progressMeasures to betaken in the which had been made in the preparation of measuresevent of an invasion by to &quot;e taken in the event of an invasion of BelgiumGermany.and Holland by Germany.(i)   A short &quot;War Book&quot; had been drawn updefining and assigning the responsibilityfor the action required of Departments.(ii)    The Foreign Office had on the 1stNovember communicated a summary ofthe measures to our Ambassador at brussels and our Minister at TheHague, with a letter explaining tothem exactly what their responsibilitieswere.(iii)    The Naval arrangements for sendingdestroyers to Dutch ports and toAntwerp, and the Military arrangementsfor sending Demolition Detachmentsin those destroyers had been tuned up and co-ordinated.     The military party was ready to move at twelve hours&apos;notice, and the Destroyers at twenty-four hours&apos; notice.     The NavalCaptains who would be in charge ofthis work had visited the ports atwhich they would have to operate.In reply to an enquiry by Lord Hankey,THE CHIEF OP NAVAL STAFF said that the Destroyersconcerned were now standing-by and could be definitelycounted upon to be available when the time came.(iv)   A summary of the plan, exceptingonly the arrangements with regardto gold, had been communicated tothe French Military Authorities.Excellent work in a: general and informalway had been carried out by our Service and diplomatic Attaches, whose reports tended to showthat both the Dutch and Belgian authorities were taking the question of demolitions very seriously.

Gold and Sir Robert Glive had confirmed that the securities.question of gold reserves and negotiable securitiesin Belgium had already engaged the attention of the governors of the National Bank and the SocieWJ jGenerale.Prom the Netherlands Sir Nevile Bland had confirmed, on the authority of the Director-Generalof the Ministry of Economic Affairs, that two-thirds of the Dutch gold reserve was at present in the UnitedStates of America and South Africa;    and that   theHead of the Dutch National Bank was fully alive tothe importance of moving what was left.Oil. The Netherlands.Information had been received from M. Kestler,a leading man in the oil industry in the Netherlands,that the Dutch military authorities had made thenecessary plans for the complete destruction of allstocks of oil, and that they were satisfied that this could be done in a matter of twelve hours..Concurrently, it was intended that the tankers shouldbe got away;    and if this proved impossible they wereto be destroyed.Belgium.We had reliable information that theBelgian Government had made similar plans.     our naval Attache reported that arrangements were inhand to destroy all stocks of fuel and other storesat Antwerp;    and our Military Attache&apos;, with whomLord Hankey had discussed the matter personally,was of the opinion that the Belgian MilitaryAuthorities were fully aware of the importance of

preventing valuable stocks from falling into the handsof the enemy.In Belgium, the stock of nickel hadalready been reduced to a minimum.     Our ambassador had reported that it was intended to maintain copperstocks at their present level, namely, 30,000 to40,000 tons, but the Ministry of Economic Warfare were taking steps to see whether these could not be further reduced.Belgium.The Naval Attache had reported that plans were in existence for the speedy evacuation of allshipping from the port of Antwerp, which would berouted to French or British ports, with the exceptionof a certain number of ships which would be sunk inthe approaches to the port.     Preparations had beenmade for increasing the traffic to other Belgianports, such as Ghent, Bruges, Zeebrugge and Ostend, ifAntwerp were put out of action;   but in the last resortthese ports, also, would be put out of action by thedestruction of lock gates in the entrances to the canal,  and by the sinking of ships and barges in suitable positions in the harbours.     Our naval attache&apos; had gained the impression that the whole matter had been very carefully considered by theBelgian Authorities.     The only difficulty concerned the removal of the canal barges, and this was under examination.The Netherlands.The Dutch shipowners were alive to theimportance of getting their ships away and had been

fcrangements.in communication with the Ministryof Shipping.Our Air Attache had reported that theBelgian Air Staff had considered plans for thedestruction of their air materiel and aerodromes.As mentioned by the Secretary of State for War earlier in the meeting, the Dutch were already putting their plans into operation by ploughing up their aerodromes in East Holland.Summarising the position Lord Hankey saidthat it would be seen that the most important changes,since he had last reported to the War Cabinet were as follows:-(i)   A tuning-up of the readinessand completion of our own arrangements.(ii)   The receipt of informationindicating that the Dutch,and especially the Belgianarrangements, were probably more complete than we had anticipated.This evidence of greater preparedness onthe part of the Netherlands and Belgium would not,however, in his opinion, justify any alteration dhour plans.     It was impossible to foresee howpeople would react to the emergency of a suddeninvasion, and therefore to know whether, in theturmoil of a &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, the Dutch and Belgianswould carry out their plans in whole or in part, orwhether they would fail to do so.     Our own course was clear, namely, to make all such preparationsas we could, and this, he was satisfied, we had done.     Our plans had been laid on the assumptionthat the Belgian and Dutch Authorities would take

all necessary action themselves,  and he (the minister without Portfolio) considered that we ought tocontinue to he in a position to supplement their action or, in the last resort, to act for them.    this applied to our plans for sending blockships toZeehrugge and Ostend to co-operate in blocking thoseports, as well as those for dealing with Antwerp andthe Dutch ports.    Moreover, Sir Robert Olive and sir nevile Bland had now been given precise instructions as to the steps which they should take in an emergency,including, in particular, the arrangements to securethe s;afe^ arrival and the reception of the british forces by the Belgian and Dutch Authorities.     Itwould be their duty, on obtaining the consent of theGovernments concerned forthwith to notify the ForeignOffice, who, in turn, would inform the service departments to enable these to put their plans intoimmediate operation.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that furtherinformation should be obtained about the rapidity withwhich the inundations could be effected, in viewof the reports that these could be outstripped bythe advance of mechanised columns.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR agreedto obtain this information from the Military Attaches.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEmentioned that the level of the water in the canalswas at present being kept high&quot; but that no sluiceshad yet been opened.

THE HOME SECRETARY raised the questionof the possibility that the ships leaving holland and Belgium would, if their departure were delayed,almost certainly he filled with refugees.      In this event special provision for their reception inthis country would have to he made with port and localauthorities.In the discussion which ensued it wasagreed that no definite plan could he made butthat the Home Secretary should examine the question with a view to making such preliminary preparationsas he could.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,12th November, 1939.

- MOST SECRET -W.M. (59) 79th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE. 9...Confidential Annex.*     *      *THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat a further development had taken place since theprevious evening in regard to the prospect of Belgian-French Staff Conversations.    In Telegram No. 392,received by telephone that morning from His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Paris, Sir Ronald Campbell reported thathe had been informed by M. Champetier de Ribes that since Thursday, 9th November, 1939, when the FrenchGovernment had received an urgent appeal from theBelgian Government, the latter had again turned shy.The Belgian Military Attache&apos; in Paris had made no attempt to get in touch with General Gamelin, and inthe circumstances the French Government had not sent a French General to Brussels, which (as reported in telegram No. 391, dated 10th November, 1939, from his majesty&apos;s ,jesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris) they had previously decidedto do.    The French Government could now only suppose that the Belgian Government felt that the threat of attack by Germany had diminished in intensity.   Theywere evidently somewhat exasperated by this shilly-shallying, and feared that, when the threat materialisedand the Belgian Government ma.de up their mind to appeal for help, there would no longer be time for french troops to take up the positions which it was essentialthey should reach before the German Army could frus-trate them.   Three elea-r days were required for thispurpose, and if this period was not available, theFrench General Staff would, Sir Ronald Campbellgathered, be averse from any ma.jor operations onBelgian territory.

In the discussion which followed, the view was generally expressed that it was prohably King Leopoldhimself who was holding back his Cabinet from permit-ting Staff Conversations being started with theFrench;    and it was suggested that it would be ofgreat value at this juncture if arrangements could bemade for Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes to payable further visit to Queen Elizabeth of the Belgians.If this visit was to take place, it was essentialthat it should be made with the utmost secrecy, andthat it should be ascertained in advance whether itwould be agreeable to Queen Elizabeth.    It would benecessary also that it should, be clearly understoodin the Royal Palace that this was a purely private-tevisit by Sir Roger Keyes, and that he was not acting under instructions in any way.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said, that he had that morning received from the Belgian Air Attache an urgent request from the Belgian Chief of the AirStaff for the despatch of aircraft (but not pilots)to Belgium.The War Ca.bi.net agreed  That the First Lord of the admiralty should see Sir Roger Keyes and arrange,if possible, for him to pay a privatevisit to Queen Elizabeth of the Belgiansin the manner suggested above.Ri richmond T terrace ce, S .W .1,11th November, 1939.

- MOST secret.M.(59)  79th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 11-Confidential Annex..*     *     *THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs gave the War Cabinet particulars regarding the possi-ble development of German policy received from twohighly secret sources.   The first of these reports which was da-ted 8th November, was consideredparticularly reliable, coming from a Party officer in close touch with Herr Hitler&apos;s entourage.According to this report, Herr Hitler&apos;s fear ofassassination had greatly increased in recent times,and he had spoken of this danger before the recent-bomb explosion.    This fear had added greatly to herr Hitler&apos;s desire to strike at us, and it was believed that he was planning a large-scale air attack both on this country and also upon the Fleet,and in particular upon our Capital Ships .    It was believed that a German diving bomber would provevery effective if it were used without regard to the lives of the pilots.    The same report stated that herr Hitler was planning a Continental blockade ofthis country and had in mind certain action also inthe Middle East.The second report, which only carried theposition up to the 5th November, and which had. alsocome from Germany, drew a picture of divided counselsin Berlin.    The atmosphere was said to be one ofdesperation, no way out of the present difficultiesbeing seen.    Conferences were held daily.   At anearly stage of these discussions the Nazi Party had urged. Herr Hitler to launch an attack upon Pranceby way of Switzerland.    The German Army had demurred

to this proposal, and had insisted that if an attachwere made it must be made on both flanks;    and inthis attitude they had been supported by marshal goering.   Herr Hitler was strongly opposed to theGerman Army remaining inactive in the West whilerecent German acquisitions in &quot;the East were beingconsolidated.   He was filled with vindictive andviolent rage against England, and for this purposedesired a German attack upon the Netherlands.   TheGerman Naval and Military High Commands were opposedto such a step, but had agreed to make certainpreliminary dispositions.   This plan had, however,the support of the Nazi Party, but was opposed byMarshal Goering.    It was believed, however, that ifit were decided upon, the latter would be unlikely toraise further opposition.   Of the three possible courses of action, the first (an attack on Francethrough Switzerland) had been ruled out;    the second,for an attack on France at each end of the line, was still under consideration.   The proposal   for theoccupation of the Netherlands for the purpose of launching an all-out attack upon England, includingpossibly a landing, was also under consideration, andwas being strongly urged by Herr von Ribbentrop andHerr Hiiamler.   At the date of the report (5th November,1939) Herr Hitler was himself still undecided.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.Richmond Terrace, S .W.1,11th November, 1939.
