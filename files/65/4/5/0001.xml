MOST secret.M.   (59) 72nd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 5*Confidential Annex.MILITARYI implications of A german invasion of holland.The War Cabinet had under consideration aReport by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on theMilitary Implications of a German Invasion of Holland(W.P.  (39) 108).THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF recapitulated the salient points of the Report, and added that, if itwere approved Toy the War Cabinet, the Chiefs of Staffsuggested that it should he communicated through theusual channels to the French.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether, on theassumption that the Germans proposed to use Hollandsolely as a base for attack against this country, itwould be possible and to their advantage that theyshould occupy Holland north of the Rhine only, and inso doing reassure Belgium that they had no designsagainst that country.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat such a move was possible.     The defences in NorthHolland were based primarily upon a carefully-plannedsystem of inundation, though it would take some time forthe water to reach a sufficient height for the inundationsto be effective.     The inundations should be effective against an invasion by land forces, the movement of whichin this area would be difficult at any time.     On theother hand, the country south of the Rhine would present no obstacle to the advance of land forces.General Gamelin&apos;s plans, in the event of aGerman advance into Holland were to move forward,but only if invited by the Belgians, and then

only if he could he certain of reaching one of threedefinite lines of advance - the Scheldt, the Dendreor the Antwerp line.The real danger, however, of an attack southof the Rhine lay in the occupation of the islands at the mouth of the Scheldt which the Germans could then use as a&quot;base for air attack against this country.       If we had toattack these islands after they had been occupied byGermany, this could only be done by a Naval operation.Possibly on this account no plan had been made by theFrench to deal with this contingency, which, however,deserved careful study.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR considered thatthe occupation of the Scheldt Islands would constitute a very serious menace in placing the German medium bombers and fighters within range of London.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreed.     his information confirmed the view that the German plan was most likely to be to leave the Dutch &quot;fortress&quot; north ofAntwerp alone, and to concentrate on the area betweenRotterdam and Antwerp.      If so, it would make it easier forthem to carry out a mortal attack on this country.     It was difficult to see what could be done to prevent a german occupation of this area.     He therefore advocated that we ought to be prepared, if necessary, to retaliate immediately by attacking the Ruhr.     Further, if Germany attackedHolland, it seemed probable that the Belgians would invitethe French and ourselves to enter Belgium.     It was clear   ,from what General Georges had said that every preparation for such a move had been made.     General Georges had spoken highly of the eighteen Belgian Divisions which he considered were better material than some of the lesswell-equipped German Divisions.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR mentioned thatwe were experiencing great difficulty in persuading theFrench to agree to any move being made against the Ruhr.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL attached considerable importance to preparations being made by the Dutch to floodthe aerodrome at Amsterdam if necessary.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explainedthat there were 19 aerodromes in Holland, well spreadover the country.     The occupation of northern Hollandwould not place the German short-range bombers, nor anyof their fighters within effective reach of this country.Even from southern Holland such aircraft would only beable to operate against this country from a few aerodromes in the South-West.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat, in return for certain highly secret information whichhe (the Foreign Secretary) had confided to him, the DutchForeign -Minister had given him a very frank account of theDutch view of German intentions against his country  Ho (theDutcb Foreign Minister) had received similar warnings ofan intended German invasion, but had been given acategorical assurance from Berlin that they were unfounded.This was strengthened by a report that the German AirCommand were of the opinion that the operationaladvantages of gaining some 50 to 100 miles by the seizure of Dutch aerodromes would not begin to outweigh thepolitical consequences which they would suffer from an invasion of Holland.     Appreciating the temptation afforded by Amsterdam Aerodrome, however, the Dutch had taken thenecessary steps to enable them to put it out of action at short notice if necessary.,THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that thiswas consistent with the detailed plans which the Dutch had

made for the destruction of their oil  resources inthe event of an attempted German occupation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR quoted a secretreport of the 1st November which had been received atthe Air Ministry.,      The Dutch Army was said to have takenall possible precautions, such as the mining of bridges,preparations for inundation and the laying of tank trapsand land mines, against the possibility of a german invasion..     Nevertheless, they regarded such attack asimprobable on strategic and political grounds, and theyattributed the presence of German troops oppositeHolland to the fact that it was a suitable area for holding troops in reserve for employment on the western front, because it was near and had good communications.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence pointed out that the Chiefs of Staff Report was based onthe assumption that Belgitim would be neutral.     Hesuggested thai   consideration should be given to what action we might take .in co-operation with the French, if holland were invaded by Germany and Belgium invited us touse her territorycTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR suggested thatthe Foreign Office should press the Belgian Government tostate what their attitude would be if Germany invaded Holland, Hisown  view was that such a step would be a move on thepart of the Germans which, on balance, would be to our advantage.      It would shorten our distance from theRiohP;would seriously complicate Germany^ importation of food supplies, and would draw the moral stigma of the worldupon her.     Apiainst this, she would enjoy the singleadvantage of being able to operate her short-range bombers and fighters from a few aerodromes in Holland.
