- MOST SECRET -W.Mo   (59)  68th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.LEAKAGE OP THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO informed theINFORMATIONTO GERMANY.  War Cabinet that,  in accordance with the invitation whichthey had extended to him at their meeting on the 31stEireCensorship.  October, he had assembled a Committee comprising theSecretary of State for War, the Secretary of State for home Affairs and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,to examine the question of the possible leakage of secret information through Eire.    The First Lord ofthe Admiralty had been good enough to attend themeeting, and they had also had the benefit of thepresence of the Chief Censor.Lord Hankey said that, until the previous day?there had not been the smallest impediment to informationreaching Eire by telephone, telegraph, mail-bag ormessenger, but on that day,  in accordance- with thedecision of the War Cabinet, arrangements had been madeto listen in secretly to all telephone conversations between Great Britain and Eire.    At the meeting of his committee on the previous day it had been agreed that theSecretary of State for War should arrange, through theChief Censor,  to extend this arrangement to NorthernIreland as soon as the necessary staff could be assembled.This would provide a useful but limited check.    (in thisconnection, Lord Hankey mentioned the ruse of making useof little-known languages such as Welsh, and said thathe had put the Chief Censor on his guard against thepossible use of Erse.)   His Committee had therefore considered whether it would not be prudent to go further

and recommend a cancellation of all free intercourse,both by telegraph and telephone, between Great Britainand Eire5 limiting communication to written messageswhich, after being censored, would be transmitted by the postal authorities.      This would be a very strongmeasure.      It would correspond with the restrictions which were now imposed on traffic to Continental countries,including Prance and Belgium, and would involve the cessation of all telephone calls except those from government Departments, Diplomatic Missions and, afterprior censorship, from the Press and approved firms.But to be effective it would have to be applied to NorthernIreland as well as to Eire.      It would require a verylarge staff.      It would interfere seriously with business and would be particularly resented by Belfast and the clyde, between which there was a very heavy traffic.It would be stigmatised as a further measure of unnecessarycontrol,  and would provoke an outcry from the Press.It would almost certainly alienate the goodwill of Eire,to which the Censorship authorities, who had establishedgood working relations with the Irish authorities, attached a good deal of importance.Moreover, the imposition of telephone and telegraph censorship on the lines suggested,would only secure a few hours delay unless we also imposed full postal censorship - a measure

which would cause a good deal of delay and whichwould require a staff of some 2,500 - and, in addition,enforced a strict control of passenger traffic to andfrom Eire.     Whilst it was true that this few hours&apos;delay might be important in the case of movements of warships and military movements, it would not preventthe leakage of other classes of information to Eire.Before coming to any decisions, his Committeehad turned to the question of how far, and through whatchannels, information might leak from Eire.     The IrishHigh Commissioner had assured the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs, very confidentially, that nomessage had left the German Legation by cable forWashington since October the 6th.      This had been confirmed independently by the Chief Censor.       Theneutral Legations in Dublin had despatched diplomatictelegrams only very occasionally.Messages from Eire to America were subjectto censorship, firstsin Eire (where, admittedly,censorship might not be good) and,secondly, either at Canso in Nova Scotia or Hearfs Content an Newfoundlandthese stations both being in touch with the BritishCensorship.      Thus, sooner or later all messages to America came into the hands of our Chief Censor,who had reported that so far they had not revealedanything sinister.The only European cable from Eire was onewhich went to Le Havre, where the Chief Censor hadalready established close liaison,,The Irish Chief Censor was friendly andhelpful but he had to work under a strictly &quot;neutral&quot;

political chief, and his censorship machine was of doubtful efficiency and was not to be relied upon0Our own Chief Censor had suggested that matters wouldbe considerabley improved if the Government of Eirecould be persuaded to agree that all cablegrams shouldbe routed through England,,      This would enable allmessages to be censored here instead of in Eire andwith practically no delay.      The Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs was willing, if the War cabinet approved, to approach the Government of Sire with thissugges tion.Lord Hankey pointed out that there was, atpresent, no positive evidence of any leakage of secret information out of Eire, or even of any regularvolume of privileged communication out of that countrythrough the ordinary Cable system, and his Committeeinclined to the view that leakage, if it were takingplace from Eire, would be passing more probably throughchannels other than cables.There were three such possible channels:-(i) Neutral Ships, which could send wirelessmessages to Germany the moment theywere outside territorial waters.The number of such ships was, however,too limited to provide a regularchannel;    and such messages were,moreover, liable to interception.(ii) Illicit Wireless, which the Committeeregarded as a much more likely source of leakage.At least one   such station was suspectedto exist in Eire, but the Eire Governmenthad not the technical means of runningit to earth.      In order that we shouldbe in a position to apply these technicalmeans, which were highly specialised,it would be necessary that we should beallowed to operate in Eire.    There was,however, reason to believe that the

Eire Censorship Authorities might givepermission for our technical experts to co-operate with them in an attemptto locate illicit wireless stations and the Committee were in favour of an approach being made to them towards thisend with the least possible delaythrough the appropriate channels.(iii)    Carrier Pigeons.&apos;    It was consideredthat these did not constitute so great a danger as (i) and particularly (ii)above.      The possibilities were under examination.Leakage from this country, no less than from Eire, was possible by any of the three methods which he had mentioned.     There was already in thiscountry an active organisation for the interception of illicit wireless, which had recently been considerablystrengthened by the appointment of Sir Prank Smithto take charge of the technical side.Summarising the main considerations, LordHankey said that it was necessary to remember:-(a) That, as yet, there was no actual evidence,either from the Security Services or elsewhere, - though there was a strong presumption - that leakage was taking place through Eire.(b) That there was no evidence that any leakagefrom Eire to enemy countries was going out throughcables - the evidence,  such as it was, being the other way.(c) That leakage was more probably taking placethrough illicit wireless from Eire, but equally itmight be through as yet undiscovered illicit wirelesssets operating from this country.(d) That the Security Services might obtain further evidence in the very near future from listening-into the telephones, which might give us the material required to enable us to decide what the next step shouldbe.

On a review of all these considerations, his committee had therefore felt that it would be preferable not to impose complete and immediate censorship ontelephones and telegraphs, and still more on letters,parcels and packages, but to keep these more drastic measures in reserve for the time being;    and their4.recommendations were accordingly as follows!-(i)    The arrangements for listening-into all telephone conversations between Great Britain and Eireshould be extended forthwith to northern Ireland.(ii)    All cable traffic from Eire should berouted through London for censorshipby the British authorities(iii)    Immediate arrangements should be madefor our Illicit Wireless InterceptionOrganisation to co-operate with the eire authorities for the detection of possible short-wave wirelesstransmitters in that cb\intry?      (Aninterception set was already inoperation in Northern Ireland.)(iv)    Should these arrangements.fail to stop the present leakage,  consideration should be given to the imposition of full censorship measures and thecontrol of passenger traffic..(v)    The Secretary of State for War shouldbe invited to report on the possibilitiesof creating prohibited areas in places where it was of special importance tokeep the movements of Military and naval Forces secret,.,A further point which had occured to him,personally, after the Meeting, was that --(vi)    Arrangements should be made by theSecurity Service to keep a close watchon German broadcasts, and to transcribeand analyse any statements which appeared in any way to bear out the belief that there was, in fact, aninexplicable leakage of information-,

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe German broadcasts clearly showed that they had- an intimate and widespread knowledge of what was going on in this country.      Indeed, they seemed to take amalicious pleasure in regaling the British public withdetails which could only have been obtained by personalobservation - for example,  the reasons why Groydonwould make a good bombing target;    the fact that amunitions factory was being erected in a certainlocality with a decoy factory nearby;    the presence ofthe balloon barrage on the Clyde within a few hoursof its arrival.      This state of affairs was naturallyextremely disturbing in relation to the security ofthe Fleet, the movements of which in Home ports might be reported to Germany with disastrous results.      It was for this reason that the Admiralty had pressed for theapplication of full telephone and telegraph censorshipbetween this country and Irelando      He regretted the refusal of Lord Hankey&apos;s Committee to grant these full powers.      Accepting that the full demands of theAdmiralty could not be accorded, he was concerned to  -ensure that such modified arrangements as might beallowed would really result in stopping a leakage ofinformation through Eire.      He therefore hoped that wewould strain every effort to make a reality of themore limited measures which were now proposed, and thatthese should be put into force with the least possible delay, viz:-(a) Listening-in to telephones.(b) The interception of illicit wireless.He asked that there should be a thorough and vigorous handling ofthis question in Eire, and that ahigh priority should be given to.whatever additional equipment and personnel might be required forthis, not only in Ireland but alsoin this country.

-3 r1-u(c) The routeing of telegrams from Eirethrough London.      He trusted thatthe Secretary of State forDominion Affairs  w ould do his utmost to obtain this concessionfrom the Government of Eire,reminding the 1 ar Cabinet that wehad evidence that, had Italy comeinto the war against us, she had intended to make the ItalianLegation in Dublin the headquarters of her espionage activities against great Britain.(d) Wireless messages from neutral shipson leaving British ports.    He would arrange that the Admiralty should examine this question.      It might bepossible to insist on our havingthe right to board neutral vesselsafter they had left these shores,as a condition of their being allowed to call at our ports.It could then be seen whether a thoroughtrial of thesfimeasures would produce any mitigationof the present situation, which was most unsatisfactory.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thathe and the other Members of Lord Hankey&apos;s Committeehad fully appreciated the seriousness and gravity of the situation as described by the First Lord,and it was in that spirit that they had examined theproblem,  and,  after a very careful consideration ofall the factors, had made the recommendations which theyhad.     The steps which they proposed had been discussed with the First Lord, and the Committee understood thatthey had met with his concurrence.The Admiralty were, in fact, being given themeasures for which they had asked - with one exception.This    was that, instead of immediately imposing fullcensorship of telegraph and telephones,  the Committeehad decided that it would be preferable that a

4 f*lopreliminary trial should first be made of listening-in to telephones between this country and Ireland,If this failed to produce an improvement, it would remain possible to introduce full censorship at alater date if this were still considered desirable.The arguments which had weighed with theCommittee against the extreme measure of completecensorship were:-(i)    It was hoped that listening-in totelephones might prove a quick andeasy method of enabling us to tracesources of leakage, which it might take us longer to discover by otherme thods.(ii)    Some, at least, of the examples ofleakage showed that the Germansappeared to have a means of communication of such swiftness as to point to their use of short wave wireless.     If this were the case, the suspension of normaltelephone communication with ireland would be an unnecessary step whichwould merely deny us the advantages which we hoped to derive from listening-in.(iii)   Furthermore,  this sudden step would beregarded by the Irish as cavalierbehaviour on our part,  and would,at a stroke, destroy the good relations and useful co-operation which nowexisted between the censorship authoritiesin England and Eire respectively.(iv)    It would also unquestionably arousethe antagonism of the Press and ofbusiness interests in this country.It was these considerations which had ledLord Hankey&apos;s Committee to decide that, on balance,we should stand to lose more than we should gain by animmediate imposition of telephone and telegraph censorship.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the impressionhe had gained from the account of the investigations

1 91 4of Lord Hankey&apos;s Committee was that the means ofillicit communication with. Germany were very muchmore numerous than he had at first supposed.     Inparticular, it was clear that there might he sources of leakage much nearer home than Eire.     This pointed to the necessity for pressing on with our efforts inall directions rather than directing them towards thestopping of any one particular channel.     Personally,he would regret cutting off the telephones to Irelandbefore giving the present arrangements for listening-ina chance of exonerating Eire from the suspicion which atpresent fell on that country.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION APPAIRSsaid he wished to make it quite clear that he regarded the security of the Fleet as being of paramount importance, and that he was therefore ready to take any steps^whieh the War Cabinet might consider necessaryto safeguard this vital interest, irrespective of  what hostility these might arouse in Eire,His hesitation to recommend the adoption of full censor-ship was due to his belief that the less drastic measures proposed by Lord Hankey&apos;s Committee^igM; be successful,  and that they ought therefore to be given a .trial.      Meanwhile, preliminary enquiries had led himto hope that the Government of Eire would agree to theproposals for the routeing of cablegrams through London.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY admitted theforce of these arguments, and said that he would be willing to forego the complete censorship for which hehad at first pressed, provided steps were taken toensure that immediate and definite action was taken onthe recommendations of Lord Hankey&apos;s Committee.Concurrently,  the Admiralty would study what might bedone to control wireless from neutral ships leaving thiscountry.      If vigorously pursued, these steps ought to

o0establish the guilt or innocence of Ireland one way or the others, which would be a great step forward.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that LordHankey&apos;s statement revealed a state of affairs whichwas very disturbing, and one which, unless remedied,might become even more serious once we found ourselvesengaged in active air operations over this country.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL agreed.      He attachedparticular importance to the investigation and analysis of both past and future records of all German broadcasts.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the various measures which had been agreed to by the War Cabinet inthe course of the discussion should be made the subjectof a further report to the Cabinet, and invited theMinister without Portfolio to keep his Committee in beingas a centre which should watch progress in connection withall matters concerning the leakage of information.The War Cabinet agreed:(l)    That the Secretary of State for war should arrange for the existing arrangements for listening-in to alltelephone conversations between GreatBritain and Eire to be extendedforthwith to telephone conversations between Great Britain and NorthernIreland:(2)    That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should approach the HighCommissioner for Eire with a view to allcable traffic ex Eire being routed throughLondon where it should be scrutinised bythe British Censorship authorities:(3)   That the Secretary of State for war should arrange for the Illicit WirelessInterception Organisation to supply the necessary apparatus and personnel in Eire for the detection of possibleshort wave wireless transmitters inthat country:3)- 11 -

(4)    That,on the evidence so far available,there was no justification for going \beyond the statement that Eire might &apos;be presumed to be one of severalsources of leakage of information toGermany.     It was therefore undesirableat this stage to go to the length of imposing telephone and telegraph censorship on all traffic from GreatBritain to the whole of Ireland onthe lines of the censorship nowimposed on traffic to continental countries, and also the applicationof a rigorous control of passenger traffic, since this would result inthe risk, not only of losing theuseful co-operation which now existedbetween the censorship authoritiesin this country and Eire, but also ofarousing considerable criticism andantagonism in this country:(5)    If however the arrangements under(l) to (3) above failed to stop the present leakage of informationof military dispositions in thiscountry,  consideration should begiven to the further measures referred to in (4):(6)    That the Admiralty should consider what steps could be taken to preventthe despatch of secret informationby means of wireless from neutral ships on leaving ports in this country:(7)    That the Secretary of State for war should arrange for the German broad-casts to be studied by the security service, in co-operation with theGeneral Post Office and the Ministryof Information.     All statements inthose broadcasts which had any bearing on enemy espionage activities in thiscountry should be transcribed andanalysed.      This analysis should coverpast as well as future broadcasts:(8)    That the Secretary of State for war should submit a Report on thesuggestion that extensive prohibitedareas should be created in localitieswhere special importance was attachedto keeping secret the presence ormovements of Naval and/or Air Forces:(9)    That a very high priority should begiven to the manufacturing and manningrequirements of the Illicit WirelessInterception Organisation:

(10) To invite the Committee on the leakage of Information, under the chairmanship of the Minister without Portfolio, tocollate reports on the action taken inaccordance with the above conclusions,and to submit a Report to the WarCabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.2nd November, 1939.
