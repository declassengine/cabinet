MOST SECRET,W.M*  (39) 112th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.MAGNETIC MINES.Proposed actionagainst GermanMine-layingSea-plane Bases,THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFFinformed the War Cabinet that on the night ofthe lOth-llth December some six German aircraft had laid mines in the estuary of the Thames.The various measures which we had so far tried toprevent this type of enemy operation had failed.Interception by fighters in the dark was extremelydifficult - like looking for a needle in ahaystack; and the detection of these low-flyingenemy aircraft by R.D.F, had not come up toexpectations.    The Air Ministry had, in con-sequence, been giving serious consideration toother means of dealing with this problem.Their proposal, for which they sought the approval of the War Cabinet, was that weshould maintain constant Bomber patrolsthroughout the hours of darkness over the fiveGerman bases from which the mine-laying aircraft operated - three at Sylt, one at Borkum and one at Norderney.    There would be two patrols, eachof a single aircraft, the one dealing with Syltand the other with Borkum and Norderney.    Eachaircraft would do two hours on patrol and then besucceeded by a relief aircraft throughout the night.  It was to be hoped that the effect

of these patrols would he to force the germans to extinguish the flare paths, and soprevent the seaplanes from taking off.      If,on the other hand, they lighted the flarepaths and attempted to take off, the seaplaneswould he seen and our patrols would attack them.The instructions to our patrols would he thatthey should only attack targets on the sea.Our patrols would probably meet a certainamount of anti-aircraft fire, but we werebanking on the assumption that the germans would encounter the same difficulties indealing with them as we had experienced indealing with the German seaplanes visitingour own shores under similar conditions.The Air Ministry wished to try this operation at least as an experiment which,if it did not entirely succeed in preventing the departure of German mine-laying aircraft,would at least curtail their activities.      Thedecision to use single aircraft was due tothe danger of collision between aircraftflying in the dark in a confined area, CUiHOUc    &amp;uCt*fl VoJLtk  LloGafcl^ t&amp;d&amp;efyoeJ,--?-. &apos; &quot;THE FIRST LORD OF&quot; THE ADMIRALTY saidthat it was becoming increasingly necessaryto deal with the menace of the magnetic mine.The new Commander-in-Ohief at the Nore had reported that the position was not improving.There were at the moment only two channelsopen;    and if these were closed, as they

might he at any moment, a very serious situation would arise.      Meanwhile, the german aircraft were coming over, not only by nightbut also by day, when they had the great advantage, denied to them in the dark, ofbeing able to see the channels marked out bythe buoys, which were a necessity for the guidanceof shipping.     Whilst he welcomed the proposalsdescribed by the Deputy Chief of the Air staff for patrols at night, he earnestly hoped that means would also be devised of dealing withthe mine-laying aircraft by day.     Y/ould it not,for example, be possible to attack the Germanbases v/ith bombs?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR repliedthat this question had been made the subjectof a Paper by the Air Staff which he would discuss with the First Lord.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that theAir Ministry plan for night patrols would bea suitable way to start.      If need be, the plancould be modified later in the light of experience.      Meanwhile, he asked whether itwould not be possible to place buoys alongfalse channels to deceive the enemy, on thelines which had been suggested by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF explained thatthis would be difficult and that it would takea long time to do.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE&apos;ADMIRALTYadded that the Admiralty were meanwhile pressing on with their efforts to solve the problem ofneutralising the magnetic mine.The War Cabinets-(l) Approved,as an immediate measure,the action described by the deputy chief of the Air Staff for dealingwith German mine-laying aircraft:(2) Took note that a Memorandum wasbeing prepared by the Air Staff onthe wider issues involved in anattack on the German mine-layingbases, and that this memorandum would be considered in the firstinstance by the Secretary of Statefor Air and the First Lord of theAdmiralty.13th December, 1959.a
