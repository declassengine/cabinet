- MOST SECRET -W.M.  (59)  100th. CQNOLTJSTONS.  MINUTE   -Confidential Annex.m     9     9GERMANY. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS gaveProbable the substance of an Intelligence report dated about the intentions.middle of November, obtained by the intelligence service of a neutral State.    Considerable friction and difficulty were being encountered in the co-ordinationof the German. High Command.    The splitting of the command into three sections, Army, Navy and Air Force,meant that the unified direction of operations wasimpossible to secure, with the result that there was alack of coherent policy.   The formal position was that herr Hitler now possessed the powers which had been exercised in the last war by Field-Marshal von Hinden-burg and General Ludendorff combined, and he wasassisted in the discharge of these duties by GeneralKeitel.   Herr Hitler was unable to make up his mind,and General Keitel was a second-rate man.    It thereforefell to the heads of the three independent Commands to formulate advice as to policy.   This led to endlessconferences from which very little emerged.   Everythinghad been ready on the 4th November for a decisiveaction in the West, but two days later (6th November)General Keitel had said that some amelioration in thepolitical situation should first be secured.    In spiteof the advice of General Brauchitsch, Herr Hitler hadshrunk from launching an attack on Belgium and theNetherlands.   As regards the air arm, Field-marshal goering had been most unhelpful and had refused to launch a heavy air attack upon Great Britain except on condition that full use of the Army was made simultaneously.   This lack of decision in high qmarters-1-

i. Z ohad spread, a feeling of depression in the Army, whichhad even reached the Divisional Commands.   There wasa feeling now that it might he necessary to invadethe Low Countries under much less favourable conditionsPear was widely entertained that there might be civiluprisings in Germany if heavy air attacks were madeby the Allies on German towns, which it was recognisedwere inevitable if the German Air Force were to startbombing England.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,1st December, 1939.

- MOST SECRET -W.M.  (59)  100th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 12,Confidential Annex..ITALY.appreciation of internal situation inGreat Britain.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS read to the War Cabinet extracts from a translation of aletter recently written to a. correspondent by SignorBastianini, the Italian Ambassador in London, giving his impression of the state of feeling in this country,the general effect of which was as follows.   A sense of boredom was creeping in and there was constant talk of how the war could be liquidated.   The word &quot;Germans&quot;was never heard in conversation, the word &quot;Nazis&quot; beingalways used.   There was no enthusiasm for the war, thepeople who were most depressed being City business men.If severe military reverses were sustained, the socialsituation in this country might become serious.Signor Bastianini had added that he found british officials very easy to deal with, and that he hoped to be able to stay in London as Ambassador for a longtime.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,1st December, 1939 .

MOST SECRET.W.M.(S9)  IQOTH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 13. .Confidential Annex..SIZE OP THE BRITISH The War Cabinet had under considerationEXPEDITIONARY FORCE.a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for WarSupply of equipment and (W.P.(39) 141).Maintenance position for the First Ten THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR saidDivisions.that his Paper assumed that    ten Divisions wouldbe in France by the beginning of March 1940, andhad been designed to show the probable shortages of equipment which would obtain on the basis ofthe forecasts of the Minister of Supply.     Hesuggested that the War Cabinet should considerthe Appendix which showed the position inrelation to the major items of equipment.. A discussion ensued on the figures inthe Appendix to the Memorandum in the course ofwhich the Secretary of State for War and theMinister of Supply gave the information recorded in this Minute.      The general point was made that,whereas the weapon position (except in the caseof anti-aircraft artillery and anti-tank guns forthe later divisions) appeared reasonably secureon the basis of 10 divisions, ammunition wouldcertainly be short, and every endeavour should bemade to bring fresh capacity into production assoon as possible to meet the shortage.In this connection, the ASSISTANT CHIEFOP THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF explained that therates of expenditure assumed for ammunition were broadly the same as those assumed by the French,and were based on average expenditure on theWestern Front in 1917 and 1918.

Bren Guns.Anti-TankRifles andAmmunition.Small arms ammunition.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR said that thescale of reserves for weapons represented twelveweeks wastage, and for ammunition six weeks wastage.The fact that only 50% reserves of Bren Guns was heldwas not by itself very disturbing, since reserves on this scale were sufficient to cover a six weeks interruptionin supply.     Output was 1,900 Bren Guns per month andthe anticipated monthly wastage was 976 when theforces were fully engaged.      By the time we had twentyDivisions in the field the wastage would require thewhole of the existing output,; but by that time it ishoped that the output would have been substantiallyincreasedoThe situation regarding anti-tank rifleswas satisfactory, but additional capacity forammunition was urgently required.Continuing, The Secretary of State for Warpointed out that, if the Field Force were to be incontinuous action from now onwards,  there would be aserious shortage of small arms ammunition by the end ofFebruary 1940.   A shortage of S.A.A. was indeed alreadyapparent and the Admiralty had made a most generousoffer to take only such new supplies as weresufficient to replace what had been consumed by theNavy during the previous month.     No doubt agreement would be reached between the Air Ministry and theWar Office regarding the allocation of the remainingoutput.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY gave the followingdetails of production in the United Kingdom--November 1939    25 million rounds per month.May 1940    60        &quot; &quot;        &quot;September 1940 120       &quot; M &quot;December 1940 200       &quot; &quot; &quot;

In addition, he expected to obtain regular supplies ofS0A.A0 from India? Canada and Australiao     He was considering introducing special machinery for S.A0A0This special machinery,,  in common with other machine tools, represented the bottle-neck, in manufacture.     Hehad also been promised 25 million rounds immediately available in Canada and 50 million rounds to be produced in Australia.Reference was made to the serious prospectiveshortage in field artillery ammunition, and thefollowing figures of production were given by theMinister of Supply: --September, 1940 - 900.,000 rounds per month.December, 1940    - Over 1 million rounds per month.March.,. 1941 \\ million rounds per month.The maximum production at which the Ministryof Supply were aiming was 2 million rounds per month.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed outthat the anticipated rate of production at the end of12 months of war would suffice for only 10 divisions,whereas in 1914-18 we had sent abroad from GreatBritain 47 divisions (including 5 cavalry divisions) inthe first 12 months.      It seemed vital to increasecapacity immediatelyoIt was pointed out that the formations whichwe were now putting in the field were far better equippedthan in the last war, and., furthermore, that therequirements of the Air Defence of Great Britain for3o7&quot; A.AP ammunition impinged upon the production offield artillery ammunition. 0u (Cc^lt^       , ^)itf.i*&apos;&apos;*** u*t*. Ceu*AtA,&apos; The following figures of production for the5*5&quot; Howitzer, a new medium gun of considerably greaterrange than existing types, were givenj-September., 1940 - 20 guns per month.December, 1940 - 25 guns per month.March, 1941 - 30 guns per month

i 1 0i 3 c)Heavy andSuper-heavyArtilleryj jfijnraunition.Anti-tank guns.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR pointed outthat the older types of medium artillery would still beavailable pending replacement by the new gun.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that heavy andsuper-heavy artillery ammunition was a new requirement,the demand for which had only been received shortly before the war.      His difficulty in production would beto obtain sufficient presses.     He was trying to produce a built-up shell for the 18&quot; Howitzer, but both for this and for other types of super-heavy ammunition, it wouldbe of great assistance if the Admiralty could assist bylending capacity and presses.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that thechange from the 15&quot; to the 14&quot; Naval Gun had necessitatedmaking new ammunition, sufficient for two outfits for thevarious battleships under construction.     He would,however, enquire whether any capacity could be placed atthe disposal of the Minister of Supply.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that the anti-tank gun position was most serious, particularlyin view of the fact that it was essentially a weaponof defence.      It would be seen from the table that therewould be no 2-pdrc anti-tank guns at all for the last4 divisions out of the 10 under consideration.      The Chiefof the Imperial General Staff and the Commander-in-Chiefboth emphasised the imperative need for sufficient weapons of this nature.     Our present design was the best in theworld, but we must be prepared, if necessary, to accepta simpler one.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that no anti-tank guns could be purchased in any of the neutral countries.The French had, however, made a suggestion that we should

supply them with gun forgings, and that they would return to us, on a barter basis, a proportion of thesemade up.into complete equipments with a full outfit ofO ammunition.     They had a 25 mme anti-tank gun in full production and their chief &quot;bottle-neck&quot; was the barreland forgingsoLight Anti- THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR said that theAircraftGuns. position in regard to the supply of light anti-aircraft guns was equally serious.     All our sources of supply ofthe Bofors gun from Sweden, Poland, Hungary and Czecho-slovakia were closedo     The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff and the Commander-in-Chief had pointed out that these weapons were no less important .to our security than anti-tank guns.      The Turks also were pressing us for supplies.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY said that by June, 1940,it was expected that 1,000 equipments would have been delivered.     Production after that date would be at therate of 150 per month.     More machine tools were being obtained for the ordnance factories and the Nuffield plant,and every effort was being made to increase capacity.    Thechief difficulty was in the production of the gun carriageitself.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that at the end ofthe war, we should have on our hands large numbers of munition factories, the utility of which would have ceased.The disposal of this productive capacity would raise veryserious problems.     He enquired whether it would not bepossible to induce the Dominions and India to set up morefactories and thus correspondingly reduce our own post-war problems.THE MINISTER OP SUPPLY pointed out that such anarrangement would seriously militate against speed ofC) production.      It was far quicker to expand existing factorieshere than to start entirely new plants abroad.     There was,however, a prospect that Canada would meet some of our requirements in forgings..- 5 -

&apos;   ;    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatthe tank position was not dealt with in the scheduleattached to his Memorahdum, but there was a very-serious deficiency in infantry tanks *      On 1stDecember this year there would only be 70. infantrytanks in France out of a total requirement of  04.By the end of February 1940 the requirementwould have risen to 461, and the number thenavailable for overseas would be about 130.   Productionof these weapons was slow and the mechanism was very complicated,.     The French had a design which theywere producing already at the rate of 3 per day.They hoped to work up production, to 8 per day inthe near future.     The General Staff had not beenin favour- of accepting the French design when this had been suggested last May? but in vie?/ ofthe shortage its production in this country wasbeing seriously considered.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that he had only just been informed of the War Office viewson the French design, and he would immediately see what could be done to obtain tanks of the French design.Some discussion followed on a suggestion by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thatthe highly-trained personnel of the Armoured division should be equipped with French tanks in order to relieve the dangerous situation in which we foundourselves owing to the lack of both anti-tank gunsand armoured fighting vehicles.     The War Cabinet were informed that the chief deficiency in the equipment of the Armoured Division was in respect of cruiser

Possibility ofTransferringGuns fromA.D.G.B. tothe    B.E.F.Scale of equipment and reserves.tankso     Sufficient light tanks are available, butby May 1940 it was expected that they would be 166cruiser tanks short of the total requirementoIf an emergency arose lu f.h.3 :.ioax&apos; futures brigadesof the Armoured Divisions might be sent overseasseparately^that, in view of the shortage disclosed in the anti-aircraft defences of the British Expeditionary Force,it was time to examine the possibility of diverting A,A.guns from A.D.G.B. to the British Expeditionary-Force oTHE PRIME MINISTER suggested that thisquestion should be examined by the Chiefs of Staff,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER asked thatthe scales of equipment and reserves should be carefully considered.      For example, was it necessaryto maintain a 200% decontamination reserve of clothing in France?      when the forces concerned werecomparatively small, large reserves and a more lavishscale of equipment was probably necessary, but itwould, he suggested, be unsound to calculate therequirements of a force of 32 divisions as being 32times that of 1 division.      This consideration perhapsapplied in particular to the motor vehicles of theBritish Expeditionary Force,      He had been told thatthere was at present one motor vehicle for every sixmen in France.      It was possible again that thestandard of armament of troops in the base and lineof communication areas could be considerably reduced.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY suggested

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR saidthat every effort was being made in the WarOffice to review the demands on production tosee that we were not over-insured.     At thepresent time the gap between requirements and production was very wide.     There would,however, be no question of equipping the v/holeof the 55 divisions which it was ultimatelyproposed to raise on the same scale of motor transport as the original expeditionary force.He had obtained from General Gamelin anequipment table for a French division, and though he had expected to find the French verymuch less lavishly equipped than the British,this had not been the case.In discussion considerable surprisewas expressed at the achievement of the french in putting into the field 95 divisions, each ofa strength of 17,800 men, whereas the british expeditionary Force at the present time onlyconsisted of 5 divisions on a considerably lowerestablishment.      It was pointed out, on the otherhand, that the French were operating in their own country and had not the difficulty of supplyingtheir divisions from overseas.      Moreover theFrench were already experiencing shortages inmany items.

the SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR, in summing upthe position, said that the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff and the Commander-in-Ohief were agreed as to the desirability, in view of the attitude of theFrench, of having 10 divisions in France by 1st March,,They had pointed out, however, that there would be aconsiderable risk in not having these divisions properlyequipped with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons.     from what was known of the German tactics, it would be these weapons which would be most required in the event of a heavy German attack in the spring.      It was only right that the War Cabinet should be aware of the risks that were being run.     At the same time, it would be realised that if the present lull continued throughout the winter,the general equipment situation would be correspondinglyeased.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY observed that all theestimates on which the War Office figures v/ere based were on the pessimistic side and that the position by the spring would probably not be quite so bad as now appeared.The War Cabinet -(i)   Approved the proposal in the Secretaryof State for War&apos;s Memorandum that theimmediate aim should be the increase ofthe British Army in France to a strengthof 10 divisions by the end of February,1940:(ii)   Agreed that the position in regard to thestate of equipment and maintenance ofthe British Army in France should be examined in detail by the Military Co-ordination Committee, in collaboration with the Minister of Supply:(ii.i)    Invited the Chiefs of Staff to examine and report on the possibility ofincreasing the number of heavy and lightanti-aircraft guns to be supplied to theBritish Army in France at the expense ofthe Air Defence of Great Britain.Richmond Terrace, SoW.lo1st December, 1939n
