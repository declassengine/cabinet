1 1 ixxx- MOST SECRET -W.M. (59)  92nd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.EIRE. The War Cabinet had under consideration a MostIntelligence Secret Memorandum by the Naval Staff on intelligence organisation.Organisation in Eire, submitted by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (W.P.(39) 131).THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that thepresent absence of intelligence facilities in Eirewas preventing the Admiralty from obtaining info ma-tic n which was of vital importance to them.   he therefore asked the War Cabinet to approve therecommendations contained in the Memorandum by theNaval Staff for the extension of the S.I.S. Organisa-tion to that country.    This would have to be donedelicately, in close touch with the Dominions Office.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs suggested that, before we committed ourselves to theadditional expense and other implications which wouldresult from the adoption of the Admiralty proposals,a further trial should be given to certain arrange-ments which were now in hand, viz.(i) A Naval Attache had recently been appointedto Eire and had just begun a tour of inspee-tion of the Coast-Watchihg Service.   would it not be better to wait for his report,which would be ready in about a fortnight?(ii)The Eire authorities,  at our suggestion,had made arrangements by which navalinformation could be rapidly transmitted to us by wireless.    A -number of messagesof this character had apparently been sent,but owing to some misunderstanding aboutthe wavelength, these had not been receivedby the Admiralty.    The matter was beingrectified.% (iii) We had already established a form of secret service in Eire, from which the results,though not at present impressive, mightbe improved.-1-

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, despite thearrangements described by Mr Eden, the fact remainedthat the intelligence which we received from Eire was less than from anywhere else.     Quite apart from theneed for obtaining information about the possibleactivities of U-boats, there was, he felt, urgent needfor establishing a really efficient Secret Service.The I.R.A. provided just the sort of organisation which the Germans  could use against us, and he had nofaith in Mr de Valera&apos;s powers to prevent this.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 7AR read a Minutewhich represented the combined views of the internal security and Secret Intelligence Services.    In theiropinion it would not be possible to set up theorganisation in Eire, as suggested by the Naval Staff,in less than two to three months, and anything in thenature of a complete coastal-watching service wouldrequire a much longer period.    It would, moreover, benecessary, if this Organisation were to be reallyeffective, to ensure rapid means of communication withthe Admiralty.Should it become apparent that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had established a Secret IntelligenceOrga.nisa.tion in Eire   and the risks were obviouslyconsiderable   it. seemed almost certain that thepresent good relations which existed between M.I.5and Colonel Archer, of the Eire Ministry of Defence,would be seriously impaired, and it would be quite impossible for our S.I.S., however efficient their organisation, to obtain the information now being received by M.I.5 from Colonel Archer, who had thewhole machinery of the Eire Government at his disposal .

It- was therefore suggested that, before commit-ting ourselves to the rather drastic step of settingup a secret organisation in Eire, another attempt should be made to obtain the eo-operation of the eire government in a scheme for improving their existingOoast-Watehing Service.   As a preliminary step it wassuggested that M.I.5 should, approach Mr Dulanty and. ,ask him to arrange that Colonel Archer should come tover to discuss matters in general with his oppositenumbers in M.I.5.    This would at least enable us toget a. better^ picture of the real position with regard,to the Coa.st-Wat ching Service, and possibly of other difficulties which might be hampering Colonel Archerin his work.If co-operation seemed possible, we could supply the necessary wireless sets for communication betweencoastal stations and Dublin, and. it would, then be an easy matter to pick tip any of these messa.ges and acton them without waiting for them to be passed by the eire Government.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSconfirmed, that the views expressed, in the War OfficeMinute read by Mr Hore-Belisha were endorsed by the secret Intelligence Service.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO torus ted. thatextreme care would be exercised, in the use of wirelessfor the transmission of messages, having regard, to theIllicit Wireless Interception Organisation, which was at this moment about to be launched, in Eire.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY repeated hisdissatisfaction with the present state of affairs.It was indisputable that the Admiralty were not receiv-ing the information which they should, the absence ofwhich constituted, a real danger to the Royal Navy,

He would look into the reason why the Admiralty hadnot received the wireless messages from Eire, but -meanwhile he did not consider that there was muchto be gained by waiting for the report of the NavalAttachedTHE PR DIE MINISTER said that it was evident thatthe present arrangements were not so.tisfactory.    Onthe other hand, there was good reason to believe thatwe were not deriving the best advantage from theexisting arrangements, such as they rere.   He therefore suggested that, before discarding these arrangements in favour of the Admiralty proposals, about which certain misgivings had been expressed, it might bedesirable to have the whole question re-examined, andthat the Minister without Portfolio&apos; should be invitedto undertake this work,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS hopedthat Lord Hankey would find it. possible t&apos; bringColonel Archer into the discussions as soon as possj^1.^The War Cabinet agreed  (i) To invite the Minister without Portfolioto  conduct an inquiry into the existing arrangements regarding Intelligence in eire, and to submit a Report thereon withhis recommendations as to what further steps should be taken in this matter:(ii)  Pending the results of the inquiry providedfor under (i) above, to defer a decision onthe re commendations made&apos; in the Naval staff memorandum, submitted by the First Lord of the e Admiralty ( W. P. ( 3 9) 131).*      o      oRi richmond T terrace ce, S..W. 1,23rd November, 1939 .
