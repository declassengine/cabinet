- MOST SEORBT. -W.M. (59) 113th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 11.Confidential Annex.m      *      aGERMANY&quot;. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS gaveProbable the 7/ar Cabinet particulars of information containedMilitaryIntentions. in a secret report, dated 1st December, 1939, obtained by the Intelligence Service of a neutral State in a manner unknown.   According to this report, the closestconsideration was being given in the highest Germanquarters to the question how to intensify the war against Great Britain without invading the netherlands and so far as possible without incurring counter air attack by ourselves.   Herr Hitler had held a consider-able number of conferences on this subject withGeneral Keitel and with the German Military and NavalCommanders.    The plan which they were considering wasto intensify warfare against this  country both by sea and in the a.ir.    In particular, they hoped to damageBritish trade with Sweden, Finland and Denmark, inaddition to that with the Netherlands and Belgium,by means of intensified mine-laying.   Admiral Raederwas stated not only to have concurred in theseproposals, but to have made suggestions for theirextension.    It was also proposed to lay mines at thesouth end of St. George&apos;s Channel and off the coast of Scotland.   These mines would be laid partly bysmall units of the German Navy and partly be speciallyconstructed seaplanes, the units for which were nowbeing established.   It was also hoped to prevent theca.rriage of Swedish goods to this  country in Norwegianbottoms.   The view expressed at these conferences wasthat it was unlikely that Great Britain or France would

counter this intensification of war on their trade by. an aerial bombardment of German industrial centres,since it was thought that Great Britain would never be the first to bomb civilians.   Great weight was laid on this consideration, which would probably be decisive.In reply to a question by the Secretary of Statefor War,  THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said thatwhile the German aircraft industry had been dispersed,it was impossible for the Germans to apply this policy to the heavy industry situated in the Ruhr.The Y/ar Cabinet took note of theabove statements.Richmond Terrace, S .W .1,13th December, 1939.
