MOST SECRETg-^HOLLAND ANDBELGIUM.Position inthe eventof german aggression.Report of conversations&quot;between theCI.G. So ,the C.A.S.and general gamelin, .W.M.  (59) 77th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF gave the War Cabinet an account of the visit which he and theChief of the Air Staff had paid to General Gamelin.    Theyhad been received that morning by General Gamelin andGeneral Georges, who both seemed very confident.    they thought that some move on the part of the Germans was bound to take place very shortly, and expected that thiswould take the form of an invasion of Holland.    During the visit, messages had been continually passing between theFrench and the Belgians.    The French were trying to find out whether Belgium would call in the Allies if Hollandwere invaded, but nothing definite seemed to have been settled.If they were called in by Belgium, the Frenchintended to hold the line of the Scheldt in any event. an advance to this position would mean, for the british expeditionary Force, only a move of some five miles forward on the right and thirteen miles on the left.    If timepermitted, a more advanced position would be occupied onthe line Givet-Namur-Wavre-River Dyle.    Some 2,000 Belgianswere believed to be at present at work on the twenty-milestretch Givet-Namur, which represented the weak link inthis line.    In between these two main lines there was apossible intermediate position - the line of the Dendre -but no work had been done on it.    The French plan was fora methodical advance to one or other of these lines bymobile forces followed by the main bodies; but they wouldnot move into Belgium unless they were invited by the belgians.    No difficulty was anticipated in reaching theline of the Scheldt-Escaut, but General Gamelin was determined not to fight an encounter battle, his intentionbeingto fight either on the Scheldt line or on theNamur-Wavre-Dyle line.    ^

thence through Ghent to the s ea. ^0n thi-g-1 ino , withthe river in front of them as an obstacle, thoy*ld,lj lso-JJ-/ ff&amp;ftW be in a better position than they were now.Their present line would be available behind themto give depth to the defence.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR inquired whatthe Belgians were doing to prepare these defensivelines.    It seemed a most unsatisfactory position that we should have no definite information of their actions.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that,as far as our information went, the Belgians were working hard on the sector between Wavre and Namur^It was believed that they intended to fight on theline Givet-Namur-Liege and the Albert Canal.    So far the French had held no Staff conversations with them.He saw no reason why the Germans should not be ableto use their mechanised forces across  country even aslate in the year as this, as the ground had not yetbeen cut up by bombardment.Continuing, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that the possibility of seizing the islands at the mouth of the Scheldt had been raised!by General Gamelin as a new feature of his plans.    TheFrench had two motorised divisions ready to move offalong the coast to the narrow strip of Dutch territorysouth of the West Scheldt, and hoped to be able to seize Walcheren and South Beveland, the islands in the mouth of the Scheldt, by detachments passed over either from the south bank, or from ports such as Ostend andDunkirk, with a view to forestalling the seizing of-2-b&amp;M Co*,\ZhjJ-&amp;l &apos;Aw**- (** UiHlyi)7s*6,^r,fauj*4, 4^&apos;.If the British Expeditionary Force advanced to the Scheldt, they would be occupying a line fromMaulde to Oudenarde, the French continuing the line

t&amp;iJ&amp;j t     tf*cthe islands by German parachute troops.    It had beenmade clear to the French that British troops wouldnot be provided for this operation, and General Gamelinhad accepted this position.   He had, however, expressedthe &quot;hope that we would later relieve the French troopsin these islands *The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was doubtful as to the   chances of the French reaching theDutch territory on the south of the Scheldt estuary intime, though if they once got there, he thought theyshould be able to hold out in spite of air bombardmentTHE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF doubted whether main-tenance of forces in this area would be possible underheavy air attack.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed out thatit would be equally difficult for the Germans to hold the mouth of the Scheldt in the face of air bombardment,if they succeeded in seizing it firs toSome further discussion ensued on this part of theFrench plan.    It was pointed out that the possessionof the mouth of the Scheldt would be of advantage, inthat it would ensure access to Antwerp.   On the otherhand,&apos; the enemy might seize the river higher up.    Inany event it would be desirable to encourage the Dutchthemselves to hold the islands and the south bank, andto prevent occupation by the Germans, who might employparachute troops.    Flushing was a strong fortress whichshould be able to resist capture by mechanised forces,but the Dutch might prove half-hearted in its defence,unless they were given some support.    It might be wellworth while risking the loss of a comparatively small force to hold this important position, though admittedlyits possession would be a convenience rather than a vital factor, since it would not automatically ensurethe security of Antwerp *

THE CHIEF fit ; THE i,IR STAFF said that the french would require from us naval cover for the sea transport oftroops to Walcheren, and also anti-aircraft protection byan A.A, cruiser.      Our air forces would be asked to protect the coast from Ostend to the Scheldt during the move.    TheFrench had also asked.us to consider landing a few troops from civil aircraft at the Flushing Aerodromeo He himself wasnot satisfied that it would be possible to operate troop-carrying aircraft on this small aerodrome.THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that the royal navy could provide the requisite cover, by submarine patrols and support from cruisers and destroyers.      The possibleline of approach of the German naval forces might alsobe mined.The discussion then turned on the subjeft ofStaff conversations with Belgium.      It was suggested on theone hand that the strongest pressure should be brought tobear on the Belgians forthwith to invite the Allies to concert plans with them and to give full information oftheir dispositions and intentions.      This action might be supported by the immediate despatch of Sir Roger Keyesto interview King Leopold.      We might act in this matterindependently of the French.      On the other hand,  it waspointed out that the whole of the operations would becarried out under the orders of a French Commander and that therefore any action which we took should be in concert with the French.      The French were already in touch withthe Belgians, trough it was not known whether these consultations were between the military authorities only,or were being   carried out through diplomatic channels.

THE. MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO suggested thatit was a matter for joint action with the French,THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff pointed out, however,  that there was no risk of runningcontrary to the French in the matter..    The Belgianshad definitely asked the French whether they wishedBelgium to remain neutral or to call on the Frenchfor helpc.    The French had replied that they wished tohe asked for help0    General Gamelin himself was quite certain that if Holland were invaded and the Belgianscalled in the French, Germany would immediately attackBelgium.;.    There was little that we could do to help the Dutch, hut it was clearly to our advantage to go into Belgium^After further discussion- the War Cabinet  Invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to despatch an urgent telegram toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brusselsinstructing him to make immediate represen-tations to the Belgian Government in thefollowing sense:-(i) The trend of recent events pointed to the possibility of an imminentattack by German forces on holland or Belgium.      In either event the resistance of Belgium and Hollandshould at once be supported by theforces of France and Great Britain.(ii) In order that such support, ifrequested, might be effective, it was most urgent that plans should be oov-certed now, without further delay,with the Belgian military authorities^Delay might prove disastrous.(iii) We could not render the full aid whichthe Belgian Government might seek,  andwhich the French Government and weshould desire to give, unless plans were made immediately.

r oAir Policy. Discussion then turned to the action whichshould he taken by our Bomber Force if Germany invadedHolland.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF recalled that theWar Cabinet had decided that,  in certain circumstances,we should attack the Ruhr with our bomber forces.    this information had been passed to the French,  and thematter had been discussed at the meeting with general gamelin that morning.      It was quite clear that theFrench were uncompromisingly opposed to an attack onfactories,    unless the Germans initiated such attacks.They held the view that air attack on the Ruhr wouldnot prevent the Germans from over-running the low countries;    that such an attack would not be decisive;and, finally, that in return   the Germans would attack the British and French air factories.      The French were particularly nervous of any attack on their fighterproduction, which was concentrated in a very small number of factories.      The French were not to be shakenfrom this view,  and he suggested that the Chiefs ofStaff might review the problem once more, in the lightof the French point of view.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he was quiteunable to accept the French point of view.      The moment at which the German Army started to advance into theNetherlands was the psychological moment to launch anattack on the Ruhr.      The German Air Force was only justrecovering from the operations in Poland;    there wouldbe no depth of defences to the Westward of the Ruhr andthe district itself would be full of advancing german troops and supply columns.      Such an opportunity to strike a really heavy blow might never recur.

j (jTHE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that the problemhad been -under discussion by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee earlier that day?     They had agreed that,while the French did not look upon a German advanceinto Holland as a vital matter, it was for Britaina matter of the gravest concern to prevent the germans from occupying a position from which their medium bombers could operate, with fighter escorts, against this country.    They therefore felt that all possible steps should be taken to slow up the German advance.The role of our medium bombers was clear, namely to operate against the German Army.    Our heavy bomber force could be used, either against the German Army or againstthe Ruhr, the objective being the same in each case, to slow up the German advance.    It would, however, bea misuse of our heavy bombers to employ them againsttroops, roads or railways;  their proper objective,therefore, was clearly the Ruhr.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theFrench agreed that we should not use our heavy bomber force against the German Army, but they held to theview that we should conserve our forces for actionin the Spring.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he agreed with the views of the Chiefs of Staff, that themoment Germany invaded the Netherlands we should bombthe Ruhr.    He thought that such an attack would have agreat effect on the morale of the German people.    AGerman invasion of the Netherlands, after the solemnassurances given ty the German Government, would be themost profound shock to moral opinion throughout the k In the absence of the C.A.S.  and C.I.G0S.,  fjvi&apos;Franco j %vis tieeting rhad-been attended by. thedD.C,A,;J, a: .1 D.C.I.G.S.

world, and, from the moral point of view, we would heampiy justified in attacking the Ruhr if Germanyinvaded Holland and Belgium.It could perhaps be argued that if we attacked the Ruhr,  our bomber force might be so reduced that itwould no longer be a deterrent to a German attack onthis country,,    Moreover,  it was probably true to saythat our position, from the point of view of the fighter force, would be stronger by the Spring of nextyear.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL observed that, from therecent comparative figures of aircraft production,it appeared that,  if anything, we should be worse offin the Spring.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO emphasised the valuable results to be obtained from an attack on germany&apos;s oil supplies.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out that,in the case of the Ruhr, we should be attackinggjjaa^fcy. military objectives., and although civilian casualties were inevitable, such bombardment was covered by the draft Hague Convention.    Attack on oil installations,^&amp;&amp;^fcfe!^waAfa^3?^^nii^h--^--n^-f:tfng&quot;-ff-r:i-n^ii  . &quot;Ffn would iH^4^abi^r entail heavycivilian losses, and, in addition, it would be necessaryfor our aircraft to penetrate into the heart of Germanyto attack the main Installations.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that before reaching a decision,  the WarCabinet should give due weight to the possible effectof such action on neutral opinion.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that the moralaspect had been considered by the Chiefs of Staff, who wished to point out that the bombing of factories hadtaken place in Poland. If we did not seizeupon the moment when worldi indignation would-8-

have heen aroused hy the German invasion of Holland or Belgium,we might find ourselves morally headed off from ever attacking-the German factories.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF reminded the War Cabinetthat they had agreed that an attack on the factories in the ruhr could not be carried out without the approval of the WarCabinet, and that the conditions which had been laid down as justifying such an attack had included:-(previous reference: (l) A German violation of Belgian neutrality.tfu*&apos;V*(2) A^-aJ*ta^ete--Qja^e44fa)ag^F r an c e or ourselves, wki-eh-e^tej-^e^jfee^ibattlo &apos; eojhsuIt was not clear how the se-e-e^td point could be establishediff.M.(39)47thConclusions,Minute 4. )without appreciable delay, which might be fatal to the successof any attack on the Ruhr.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR suggested that thedecision which the Cabinet had taken should be amended, andthat invasion of the Netherlands by the Germans should beconsidered sufficient reason for ordering an attack on the Ruhr.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that we should press our views in the strongest possible manner on the French.If, however,  they refused to alter their point of view, he feltthat we ought to be prepared in the end to defer to theiropinion.    It must be remembered that we had agreed that theFrench should be in command on the Western Front, and that theFrench Army would have to bear the brunt of the fighting.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed that we ought not to insist on attacking the Ruhr if the French would not agree.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL was reluctant to accept this condition.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thatGeneral Gamelin believed in his heart that the Allies would bemore successful in a long war than in a short one, and that itwas for this reason that he was unwilling to sanction a step which might lead to both sides throwing all their weight intothe scales in an attempt to reach an early decision.-9-

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR consideredthat we should not imperil the whole of our bomberf o 3?ce by concentrating the maximum number of bombersavailable on the Ruhr.      He favoured making a limitedattack on the Ruhr, but in sufficient force to ensurestriking a heavy blow at Germany&apos;s centre of industry.It might be a sound policy to make an attack,  at thesame time, on Germany&apos;s oil resources.      This was apolicy which General Gamelin also favoured.      He(General Gamelin) ?/as known to be disinclined tostake everything at one fell blow.      It was not improbable that Hitler would be forced to make agambler^ throw within the next few months.      should we,  therefore, not be playing into his hands if wewere to decide to put the whole of our bomber force onto the Ruhr on the chance of scoring a spectacularand resounding success?THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that if weattacked German oil resources, we should suffer heavy casualties owing to the deeper penetration into germany which these operations would entail.      As a rough estimate, we might employ about 150 bombersagainst the Ruhr spread over a period of -yar-e-e days.This force would attack targets which had already been carefully pin pointed.      The casualties wouldbehigh - upto possibly 50% of the attacking force - but it wasconfidently anticipated that we dhould strike a heav-blow at the Ruhr industrial area.      It was important to describe this operation as &quot;an attack on important military objectives in the Ruhr are&amp;H, rather than as &quot;anattack   on the Ruhr&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that an announcement should be made in the newspapers that if Germany invaded Holland or Belgium ,jv?td ours u vet r*we should, attack&apos;military objectives in the Ruhr.

r nTHE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY did not favour this proposal, as we should then lose the great advantage of surprise.    He enquired whether our aircraft were qualitatively better than the Germans.THE CHIEF OF THE aIR STAFF said that theexperience of air fighting was so far mainly confined to combat between fighters and bombers, and the resultshitherto had shown that fighters had a marked advantage.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR suggested thatthere was much to be said for the argument that, owingto our relative inferiority in numbers at the presenttime, it would suit our book for Germany to attack thiscountry and for us to take heavy toll - as we undoubtedlyshould - each time a raid occurred, rather than for usto launch a heavy attack on Germany.    By this means we might gradually reduce the gap between the strengths of the two air forces and at the same time keep our ownbomber force in being.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY    demurred.     Ifwe allowed the Germans to occupy both Holland and Belgium-they would be in a far better position to attack ourgreat centres of industry.    The Germans would, moreover,be able to build up a heavier scale of defence for the ruhr area.    Germany&apos;s object in going into the low countries would be to make it easier to attack GreatBritain, and we ought, therefore, to throw in everythingwe had to prevent this.    With regard, to the number   of aircraft to be used for attacking the Ruhr area, 150 seemedto be on the low side.    Supposing 200 were employed, theloss of even 50?o would be trivial compared with the great advantages that Germany would gain if we allowed her toestablish herself in Holland   or Belgium..   If it was found,after the first day of delivering attacks on the ruhr, that the losses were even heavier than anticipated,due possibly to some unforeseen methods of defence, the project could be abandoned.-11-

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that thequestion under discussion was a vital one, and. forthis reason it seemed only right that the War Cabinet,before taking a decision, should know more about theactual plan envisaged for attacking the Ruhr area,e.ge, the numbers of aircraft  to be. employed, the losses which it was anticipated we should sustain, and theresults whi ch w e hope to  a chi ev e .After some discussion THE CHANCELLOR OP THEEXCHEQUER said that the main results to be expected,by attacking the Ruhr were, first, a formidablemeasure of destruction of Germany&apos;s heavy industry,and, secondly, an effect on the morale of the german army and. people.   On the first point, atreasonablyaccurate assessment could probably be made.    On thesecond, however, a forecast was more problematical.The attack might either stiffen the morale of theGerman Army and people, or weaken it.    It was certainly true that   an attack on the Ruhr would inviteretaliation on this  country..  One of the strongestarguments, however, in favour of vigorous action onour part was that Germany would be in a far better position to intensify and press home her attacksus if she had. first become established, in the low countries.   While this was not a matter which called for a hard and. fast decision    that evening, moreespecially in the absence of the Prime Minister, it-seemed, that, on balance,  the consensus of opinion wasin favour of taking vigorous action immediatelyGermany violated, the Low Countries.    It was not clear,however,  that, so far, we had. the French with us onthis question,  and it was clearly essential to discussthe matter with them, at an early date.-12-

The War Cabinet agreed as follows :-To report to the Prime Minister thatthe. War Cabinet felt strongly the weight of argument in favour ofretaliating against a German invasion&quot;oSjfenM-m^-ov......Bolgi-wei by an immediate and heavy air attack on military objectives in the Ruhr.
