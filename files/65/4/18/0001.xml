- MOST SECRET -W.M. (59) 91st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 9.Confidential Annex.THE GERMAN THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidAIR FORCE.- that he had received a report from a secret source which,Question of efficiency. if reliable, threw an interesting light on the efficiency of the German Air Force.   The source in question was a former German Attache&apos;&apos;, who in the past had, at differenttimes, given a considerable amount of information on airquestions which had invariably proved to be correct.According to this report there was no way by which Germaiycould escape from her present difficulties unless herr hitler could by some means persuade us to agree to peace.Owing to its imperfect construction, the German Air force could be used only as a political threat.    It could not teregarded as an effective instrument against an air forceof equa.1 quality.   The Air Force was strong in numbers,but in view of its questionable quality it was not fit tobe subjected to any sharp test.   So far, therefore, as theGerman Air Force was concerned,the time for bluff was over.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that it was veryremarkable that while the German authorities recruitedtheir pilots by compulsion, they called for volunteers for the performance of dangerous duties;   whereas werelied on the voluntary principle for the recruitment ofour pilots, but subsequently required every pilot to carryout any order which might be given.THE SECRETARyJoF STATE FOR AIR said that it would be unwise to attach too much importance to the report now received;    the German Air Force was very large and it wasimpossible to forecee what account it would give of itself.The War Cabinet took note of theabove discussion.fichmond Terrace, S.W.1,22nd November,  1959. .  .   .
