MOST SECRET.W.M.(39) 82ND CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that the problems raised by the Chiefs of Stcffrelated to the method of employment of the part oj.   cheAir Striking Force which was equipped with heavy bombers of great striking power, in three different sets of circumstances:-(a) An invasion by Germany of Belgium,with or without a simultaneous invasion of Holland.(b) An invasion of Holland only;   but on theassumption that Belgium would find itnecessary to intervene, and to call forour assistance.(c) An invasion of Holland only; but on theassumption that Belgium- remains neutral,and does not call for our assistance.The last of these three contingencies could beshortly dismissed.     It was dealt with by the Chiefsof Staff in a Report (W.P.  (39) 122), in which theydid not recommend any departure from oar originalair strategy.The first two contingencies could be linkedtogether, and they were the subject of the otherReport by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.  (39) 118).

Q 16 tjThree principles had &quot;been laid down as a&quot;basis for our air strategy.      These were:-(a) That we should conserve and build up our strength until the gap in numericalstrength should have narrowed.(b) That decisive operations could only result from the action of the air and land forces in conjunction.      Air actionalone was unlikely to be decisive.(c) That it would be highly uneconomical to employ the heavy portion of our air striking Force in the forward areas ofthe land battle0In seeking to apply these principles,  theChiefs of Staff had come to the conclusion that aGerman invasion of Belgium would constitute actionwhich would &quot;look like being decisive&quot;.      For thisreason, if such an invasion took place, we should notshrink from using all that we had to defeat it.      Thebest method of utilising our heavy bomber force underthese conditions would be in an attack upon selectedmilitary objectives in the Ruhr - the attack to besynchronised with the early stages of the german invasion.      The Chiefs of Staffs&apos; reasons for taking this view were set out in full in paragraph 12 oftheir Report0The Military Co-ordination Committee had met the previous evening to carry out a detailed examination of the alternative major objectives onto which the Air Striking Force might be directed.The object of this examination had been to satisfythemseves that the attack on selected military objectives in the Ruhr was an operation which &quot;fjuld be likely to lead to the results anticipated by the Chiefs of staff and that other possible objectives would not be equallydecisive. ^o-

The Minister-.for,..Co-ordination of-Defence then.gave the War Cabinet a full explanation of the type oftarget which would be attacked, and the methods whichwould be employed.     He said that it was estimated that,if the attacks on the targets which had been selected were carried out to the point at which their destruction couldbe assured, the result would be a crippling of the wholeGerman war industry.      To achieve this result might takeanything from three to eleven weeks of intensiveoperations, in the course of which casualties might amountOh   \-oto anything toedawoon1 -SOnasr-00ntt and 50 per cent, of then aircraft engagede      The Military Co-ordination Committeehad been satisfied, however, that there were no alternativetargets in Germany which it would be so profitable toattack.The War Cabinet would be aware that general gamelin was opposed to an attack on the Ruhr, at any ratebefore the Spring.      As it vras of the utmost importance that the machinery for launching such an attack should operate without delay, the Chiefs of Staff strongly urgedthat the conflict of opinion between ourselves and theFrench should be resolved as early as possible bydiscussion on the highest level.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that it shouldnot be imagined that the Chiefs of Staff were at allanxious to let loose unrestricted air. warfare, or, indeed,at present to start a trainrof circumstances v/hich was likely to leadto heavy retaliation on our own and the French aircraft industry.      They were only recommending the attack on the ruhr in the particular circumstances of a German invasion of Belgium.,     Apart from the justification which such a violation of neutrality would give, they felt that themoment when the German Armies were starting their advance was psychologically and militarily the right one.      Asregards the legalitjr of the operation, there were no agreed- 3 -

o ^5 5rules on the subject.      The Hague draft Rules hadreceived a certain measure of acceptance.      In thesedraft Rules &quot;factories engaged in manufacturingdistinctly military supplies&quot; were defined as military objectives.     As the whole of the German industry was organised for the production of war material, he thoughtthat the targets selected would come within the definition.It was hoped that an attack on the objectivesdescribed would not only paralyse the German industry -a comparatively long term result - but would seriouslydislocate the communications of the Germany Army.An attack on the German oil installations wouldbe more difficult to undertake, and would not be sodecisive;    nor would it have any immediate bearing on theland operations.The French were opposed to an attack on the Ruhrbecause they feared retaliation on their own aircraft industry.     They felt that they would be better off in the spring, and appeared to contemplate with comparativeequanimity a German invasion of Belgium,Some discussion then took place on the strengthof bombers available, both first line and reserve, andthe rate of production which could be expected.     It waspointed out that an air operation of this type could be stopped at any moment,  if it was thought that the lossesoutweighed the results.     On the other hand, the start of the operation would also be the signal for retaliation,the duration of which we should be unable to control.Hence, before setting the Air Forces in motion, it wouldbe necessary to weigh the possible effect on our own industry, together with the losses our bomber forces wouldsustain, against the results to be foreseen from a successful outcome of our attack.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that a great dealappeared to turn on the point expressed in paragraph21 (a) of the Chiefs of Staff Report.      Were we toconsider that a German invasion of Belgium would constitute action which &quot;looks like being decisive?&quot;THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat both the French and the British General Staffswere of the opinion that If the Germans invaded Belgium,a decisive battle would result,,      General Gamelin hadevery intention of accepting the challenge and fighting the battle to a stand-still.     Where exactly thisdecisive battle would be fought, it was impossible toforetell.      If Germany invaded Belgium General Gamelinintended to move his line forward into Belgium, but whether he would fight on the line of the Scheldt, oron the line Antwerp - Namur, would depend uponcircumstances.      The more of Belgium that could be saved,the better,  and anything that would tend to hold up theGerman advance would be to our advantage.      He (theChief of the Imperial General Staff) thought,  therefore,that the attack on the Ruhr, if timed to coincide withthe German invasion of Belgium, would have two principaleffects.        First it would have a great psychological effect on the German Higher Command.      It would come asa surprise, and would d-ivert their attention from their main objective and might well throw their plans intoconfusion.      The second effect might be to cause suchdislocation behind the German Army that their advance would be seriously hampered and an Allied counterattack might be facilitated.-5-

o nTHE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether theGeneral Staff thought that the German invasion would succeed if the air attack on the Ruhr did not takeplace.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat he felt confident that the Franco-British Armieswould not break under the strain of the German attack,but they might only be able to stem the enemy&apos;s advance on the Franco-Belgian frontier.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR pointed outthat the real danger of the German invasion, from theBritish point of view, lay in the fact that they would obtain the whole of Belgium for the establishment ofair bases and for the development of depth in their air defences for the Ruhr.      It was in this possibility thatthe &quot;decisiveness&quot; of the German invasion would lie.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that thearguments for and against the attack on the Ruhr werefinely balanced.      On the one hand, we might sustainsevere losses in bombers which we could ill afford, andwe should lay ourselves open to heavy retaliation.      on the other hand, our blow on Germany&apos;s industrial lifemight prove mortale     He thought that, on balance, thegreat concentration of industry presented to us in the ruhr would justify the hope that our attack would be moreformidable than theirs,  especially as we could confidentlyhope to exact a fearful toll from the enemy&apos; s bombing-squadrons .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that wehad accepted as a governing strategic principle thattime was on our sidec     He thought we should not be

deflected from this idea unless a decisive &quot;blow wereto &quot;be struck against us, in which case there would be no alternative but for us to throw everything into thescale.      There was, however, a difference of view between the Chiefs of Staff and General Gamelin.     TheChiefs of Staff thought that a German invasion of Belgiumwould be decisive, whereas General Gamelin, while recognising that it would constitute a very seriousthreat to Great Britain and France, was not prepared togo so far.     For this reason, General Gamelin proposedtwo plans.      The first, which should be put into-immediate operation directly the invasion took place,envisaged an attack on military objectives, troops,lines of communication, aerodromes, etc.     The second,which would be subordinated to the decision of theGovernments, would be for the heavy bombardment ofthe Ruhr.      He (the Secretary of State for War) thoughtthat the French reasoning was entirely sound.      they wished to wait and see whether the German attack onBelgium developed in decisive fashion, before deciding to unloose the chain of circumstances which would follow from an attack on the Ruhr.     Furthermore, theFrench did not agree that this attack on the Ruhrwould have any noticeable effect on the Germanprogress into Belgium.   In other words, they thoughtthat the Germans would succeed in getting theirbases in Belgium, irrespective of whether we attacked the Ruhr or not, unless the Belgian Army couldwithstand the German blow, until the British andthe French could come to its assistance.     He thought

that a premature decision to bomb the Ruhr would be putting in peril something which we could not afford,and he urged that we should continue to act on our original assumption that time was on our side.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO and THE FIRSTLORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that it would be impos-sible to take any final decision in this matter inadvance of the actual occasion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed with thisview.   He thought that it was extremely difficult toreach any decision on this matter before we knew thecircumstances in which effect would have to be givento it.    The whole matter turned on whether the battlelooked, like being decisive.   Unless he was sure thatit was going to be decisive, he would not wish to embark on this operation, which might involve us in very heavy losses of trained personnel and machines.Further, it would almost certainly give rise toretaliation, which might result in heavy losses to theFrench aircraft industry and possible&apos; dislocation over here.    Owing to their superior forces, Germany would,at the moment, be in a better position than thiscountry to maintain raids .    There was also the effecton neutral opinion to be considered.The Prime Minister said that the adoption ofthis action might be necessary, and, if so, he wouldnot shrink from it.    Nevertheless, he-would be reluctant-tant that this  country should lay itself open to the accusation of being the first country to adopt actionof this kind.    He did not think that what had happens!in Poland was altogether comparable to the action whichwas proposed in the Ruhr, at any rate as regards theeffect which it would have on world opinion.   his conclusion was that the matter would have to bedetermined by judgment of the whole position whenthe time came.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that it was evident that we could not leave things as they werebetween the French and ourselves.   We should arrive atan understanding before the emergency arose.   Thequestion for decision was whether we should make up our minds before approaching the French, or whether we should discuss the matter fully with the French,with a view to arriving at a decision.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that it would be unwise to anticipate a decisionon this important matter.   The War Cabinet would haveto arrive at a decision when the crisis arose,in thelight of the facts which might exist at the time.   Hethought that there were two tests which should beapplied before deciding to carry out this policy.   Thefirst was whether the effect of the land battle in belgium would be decisive on the whole course of thewar.    If so, we must not hesitate from taking any action which might restore the situation.    Secondly,would an attack on the Ruhr shorten the war and help us to win it?   This, he thought, was the question onwhich doubt arose.    If the measure of success which weattained came up to our fullest expectations, there wasno doubt that the effect on the German power to continuethe war would be very great.    It was necessary, however,to consider the effect on the morale of the Germanpeople.   He had been able to consult a number of authorities who had lived in close touch with theGerman people up to the outbreak of war, and theirviews were conflicting.       All were agreed, however,

Ofthat the breaking of the German morale would ultimately depend upon the success of our venture.    Ifwe attacked the Ruhr and failed, not only should we havelet loose indiscriminate bombing, but we should havestrengthened the German will and made easier the task of the German Government.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the matter should be fully discussed with the French.     It wouldbe necessary to explain to them fully the reasons which led us to regard a German invasion of Belgium as sucha vital threat to our security, and the reasons why the attack on selected military objectives in the Ruhr,combined with the opening of the great battle on land,was in our view, the right strategy to adopt.       Wecould explain to them that we had this plan completelyready, and that the military advisers of the BritishGovernment urged its adoption.   We could say thatwe intended to loose the attack only if and when a mount decisive for the Allies had arrived, whichmight be very early in the campaign;    that, if timepermitted, we would consult the French Government,but rather than miss what might be a fleeting opportunityto strike a decisive blow, we desired to reserve theright, in the paramount interests of our own defence,to authorise the operation of our own responsibility.There was general agreement that the french should be approached, in the manner described bythe Prime Minister, and that a Meeting of the supreme war Council would be necessary for the purpose.richmond Terrace, S.W.1,14th November, 1939.
