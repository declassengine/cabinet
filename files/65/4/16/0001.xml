AIR OPERATIONS.Policy as toAttacks on theGerman Fleet.- MOST SECRET -W.M. (59)  89th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 2.Confidential, Annex **     *     aTHE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that we were nowIin a position to employ heavy bombers which were much better armed than those used at the outset of the war.The heavy bombers now used, had ventral turrets with two guns shooting downwards, and thus were in a better position to defend, themselves against fighters.Further, we now had much more information about thehabits of the Germans.   We had also learned theunwisdom, of making an attack following on a, reconnais-sanee.   His proposal was that if there was a. reasonable chance of finding German &quot;wweships in Schillig Roads, .-.-- ---------        -j\we should send, out a force of 18 or 24 bombers withouta prior reconnaissance.   He felt that it was wiser tosend out a, fairly large force which would, have areasonable chance of achieving success, rather than to send a small force which might suffer severecasualties but e-e&amp;iovo-easy results .   He contem-plated high level attack, i.e., from about 7,000 feet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that the WarCabinet must be prepared to accept a certain measureof loss, as the ships might well be attacked not at allfar from. land..In reply to a. question by the Prime Minister,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that- the proposal hehad described constituted a slight departure from thepolicy previously adopted.   There was, however, thepossibility that the attacking force might get inunobserved.Ri ehmond T terrace ce, S.W.1,20th November, 1939 .\
