This mine was not dangerous until it came into contact with water, when its contents of caleium .raadeALit extremely sensitive.    Its explosive power would besufficient to blow a hole some 2 ft. square in the sideof barges of the type used on the Rhine.It would be possible to drop these mines fromthe air, and for a single aircraft to carry 400 to500 of them at a time.   The Rhine was the economiclifeline of Germany, with a traffic amounting to some77 million tons per annum.

Reference vr&amp;s made to the bearing of InternationalLav/ on this type of operation.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, if andwhen it was decided to carry out this operation, itwould have to be made clear that we were doing so as areprisal for the sinkings caused by the illegal use of mines by the Germans.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR asked whetherconsideration had been given to the possibilities of&quot;liquid fire&quot;, which, he understood, was engaging theattention of the French.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that thepossibilities of &quot;Greek Fire&quot; had been very carefully examined during the Great War, but the results had been disappointing.

According to this report a WarCouncil had been held in Berlin on the 14th November, atwhich Herr Hitler had been in the Chair, and at which theleading Generals, Admiral Raeder and the Party Leaders hadall been present.   Herr Hitler had bitterly upbraided, the generals for not having obeyed his orders to launch anattack on the Maginot Line and on the Netherlands on the13th November.    The Generals had replied that it was too late in the season to launch an attack on the Maginot Line,while an attack on the Netherlands would have mobilised thewhole of world opinion against Germany.    The Generals statedalso that it would be impossible for the German Army toattack in any force before the following April, by which time the Allies would be stronger than the German Army.For this reason, therefore, it was necessary for Germany tosecure peace.    Even General von Reichenau, who had alwaysbeen most closely associated with the Nazi Party, had supported this view.   Herr Hitler had been infuriated atthe attitude taken up by the Generals, and in an attempt toreassert his authority he had. given orders for an immediateattack to be made by the German Army on the Western Front.The report continued that preparations were now being madefor the formation in Germany of a Military Government, ofwhich Dr Schacht would be economic adviser.    The report con-cluded by anticipating that the time would come when Britishand. German forces would, join in an attack upon the U.S.S.R....Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,24th November, 1939.
