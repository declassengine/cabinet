General Gamelin had given him the general outline of the French plans and had told him that the Allied Army was preparedto advance into Belgium immediately if the Belgiansashed for assistance, and would advance methodicallyto the selected defence lines.    It was general gamelin&apos;3 intention to fight a decisive action on ground of his own choosing;    he would avoid anencounter battle.    The Belgians appeared to be extremely satisfied with the information which hadbeen given to them.   General Gamelin had beeninformed that the Belgians thought that they could hold out on the Albert Canal for a week. &apos;THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that sir Roger Keyes had gone to France on the previous day and had been present at Lord Gort&apos;s headquarters at a meeting between the Commander-in-Chief and our military Attache to Belgium.    Lord Gort had not-given the Military Attache&apos;&apos; details of any of our plans for assisting Belgium, which, he had said, werein the hands of General Gamelin.    Sir Roger Keyes hadbeen given a free hand, and he was now in Belgium.He (Sir Rober Keyes) had told the First Lord that theKing of the Belgians appeared to be apprehensive thatif the French now occupied Liege they would refuseto give it up at the end of the war.    Sir RogerKeys had endeavoured to explain that any such fearswere fantastic.

Later in the Meeting THE SECRETARY OH STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he had received a telegram(No.187, by telephone, dated 13th November, 1939)from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Brussels, reporting that Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes had arrived in Brussels after having the previous afternoonvisited Lord Gort&apos;s Headquarters, where he had beeninformed that the entire responsibility for helpingBelgium rested on General Georges.   General vanOverstraeten had particularly asked the british military Attache to inform him what support we could bring to the defence of the Albert Canal within 48hours, and what further support would be availablewithin the first four days.    In view, however, of thesubordination of British Headquarters to the french high Command, Lord Gort had declined to authorise theBritish Military Attache to give any undertaking atall.    In these circumstances, the task of Sir RogerKeyes was extremely delicate, since it was impossiblefor him to give King Leopold the assurance that HisMajesty wa.s hoping to obtain.    Sir Roger Keyes would,however, try to make His Majesty realise the immenseimportance which His Majesty&apos;s Government attached toBelgium1 s deciding that a German attack on theNetherlands would constitute a casus belli for theirown country.    Sir jjOTilo--Djrand added that an assurance that His Majesty could count on immediate and adequateAnglo-French support might well turn the scale.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that from the military point of view the difficulty wasthat General van Overstraeten was constantly.askingwhat assistance we could render in certain circumstances,Owhile at the sane time refusing to furnish particulars

regarding his plans, the disposal of his troops, andthe length of time which he estimated he would be ableto hold selected positions, though it was impossiblefor us to answer his questions in the absence of this information.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR thought it mostimportant that Sir Rob or Keyes should realise fullyboth the present position and the difficulties created for us by the Belgian attitude.   He proposed, after theMeeting of the War Cabinet, to prepare a further messagefor transmission to Sir Roger Keyes.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he would be glad to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors-:&apos;..oi\ Brussels, to communicate to Sir Roger Keyes the message which the Secretary of State foi &quot;Var desiredto s end him0The War Cabinet took note of theabove discussion.Ri chmonci T err a ce, S .W. 1,13th November, 1939 .
