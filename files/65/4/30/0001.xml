MOST SECRET,.Ml ,15.9.1 1.83rd CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE I ,Confidential .&apos;jinex.At the outset of the discussion, THE PRIMEMINISTER informed the War Cabinet that he had receiveda letter from the Lord Privy Seal, of which the two main points were:-(a) That we should help Finland as much as possible even at the expense of our military strength elsewhere:(b) That it would be of the greatest advantage to have Swedenon our side in. the war.      This would be difficult toensure but we should make the most of Sweden&apos;&apos;&apos;s iirten.sehatred of Russia,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs recalled that the War Cabinet,  at their previous meeting, had agreed,first that a diplomatic demarcheshould be made to Norway and Sweden giving them an assurance of Franco-British help against the possible consequences to them of such assistance as they mightafford to Finland;    secondly, that an oral communication should be made simultaneously to the two Governments,informing them that we proposed to take certain measuresto stop the supply of iron ore to Germany-,      The french had agreed to this procedure, and the ground was thereforeclear for the communications to be made.      On reflection,however, he felt a doubt as to the wisdom of thistwo-fold communications      It was clear that, owing tothe Finnish successes., Sweden&apos;s abiding fear of germany was now less diluted by fear of Russia.      Presumablyour main purpose was to get Sweden into the War againstGermany, war between Sweden and Russia being used as a

stepping stone to this end.     He (the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs) thought it not unlikely that any mention of the iron ore positionwould so alarm the Swedes that they might react un-unfavourably to the diplomatic demarche.      In thesecond place, he was reluctant to appear topledge us to action in Scandinavia until we were satisfied that it was feasible.        This would presumably be for the Chiefs of Staff to say.In the circumstances, he suggested that it mightbe advisable to confine ourselves at first to the diplomatic communication, postponing the oralcommunication until the Chiefs of Staff had beenable to examine the full implications.If; however, it was decided by the WarCabinet to broach :the iron ore question at thesame time as the diplomatic demarche,, he thoughtthat it would be necessary to.deal with thematter on the following lines:That control of the iron ore mines might wellbe one of the Soviet objectives and that it was clear that the supply of iron ore was likely toexercise a capital influence on the duration andissues of the war;    that his Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere giving careful consideration to the wholequestion and would acquaint the Swedish and norwegian Governments in due course with their conclusions, and hoped that they might secure theco-operation of those Governments in any measure which might appear to be necessary.

THE PRIME MINISTER said a proposal on thelines indicated by the Foreign Secretary went far beyond what he had anticipated we should say at thisstage.      He had the same comment to make on theinterpretation which; as seen from paragraph 2 of theReport by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (W.P.  (39)175), the Chiefs of Staff had placed on the conclusionof the War Cabinet (W.M.  (39) 122nd Conclusions,Minute l(ii).      He had thought that we should make ourdiplomatic demarche, namely, our offer of assistanceto hearten Norway and Sweden,     We should also, but without seeking to link it with the diplomatic approach,make an oral statement to the effect that, in view ofa net Ti ecilrct ?the way in which the Germans had sunk our^ shipping in norwegian territorial waters, we proposed to take stepsto stop the German traffic from Narvik down theNorwegian coast.     For this purpose, it would benecessary to enter Norwegian territorial waters.     Whatwas said to Norway would differ from what was said to sweden,      In the case of Norway, we should   give themnotice that we were going to act in their territorial waters against traffic in general, not specificallyiron ore traffic, proceeding to Germany.     In the caseof Sweden, we   should     give them notice of our intendedaction,but as a matter of courtesy, since the Swedishore would have left Sweden and been taken over by the purchaser when we seized it,:&apos;   THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY entirelyagreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s interpretation of theWar Cabinet&apos;s previous conclusion.     He had notcontemp lated that we should land troops at Narvik orsend an expedition to the Swedish ore fields at the3 -

present stage.     He had assumed that we would merelyinform the Scandinavian Governments that we proposedtrafficto take action to stop Germany1 s in norwegian territorial waterso     The Admiralty were ready tosend a force of destroyers to intercept the trafficas soon as the War Cabinet authorised it.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that theChiefs of Staff had had the impression that the communication on the measures we intended to take to stop the supply of iron ore to Germany would coincide with a moment when Sweden, as a result of a Finnishcollapse, was seriously threatened by Russia, and was likely to agree to the landing of an Allied force to occupy the mines.      If the Chiefs of Staff had had the explanation of the War Cabinet&apos;s views,  as given bythe Prime Minister, they would not have thought itnecessary to put forward their Report  (W.P.(39) 175)*THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought thatFinland was still in great danger. He understood thatthey had only one month&apos;s supply of ammunition..THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the only way in which the situation had changed was that, although there was little doubt that Russia would be able toover-run Finland when weather conditions improved, thedanger of their doing so before the spring had now beer,removed.The Prime Minister emphasised that there were two separate operations which we could undertake;firstly, the interruption of the traffic down the Nor-wegian coast, and secondly - a far more formidable operation - the occupation of. the northern Swedish minefield.Norway and Sweden would no doubt protest over our acticnagainst the traffic *     This protest, in itself, mightnot be of great importance;    but we must be sure thatthe carrying out of the first operation would not resultin our being prevented from carrying out the largeroperation later on.        .

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that assoon as Germany B-aw that we were. laying our hands on theiron ore from Narvik?  she would take action againstSorihexn Scandinavia which would give us full justification,for the larger operations the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggestedthat the- immediate question for decision was whether theproposed oral communication regarding the stoppage oftraffic along the Norwegian coast would prejudice the chances of a favourable reaction on the part of Norway and sweden to our diplomatic approach on the subject of their assistance, to Finland and of our offer of a:&apos;.-:?,  if such assistance should involve them in hostilities;      No doubtany assurances which had been given by Germany to Swedenonly related to the situation which would result fromScandinavian assistance to FInland$ and would not operate in the event of interference with the supply of ore toGermanyoFurther discussion then took place as to thedesirability of making the oral communication-concerningthe stoppage of the Norwegian coastal traffic at the sametime as the demarche regarding Scandinavian assistanceto Finlando      On the one hand it was suggested that itwould ha preferable- for these two communications to be  wellseparated, in time,, otherwise there was a risk that the scandinavian Governments would link them up and thatwe should thereby prejudice the  good effect of -the diplomatic approachc It was also ur-g^d that it mightbe unwise to inform them that we had it in mind to stop the coastal traffic- unless wo were ?  infact, ready to carry out the necessary naval measures

within a very short space of time.    Otherwise theymight react violently and take some action which would seriously embarrass us before we had time to put these measures into effect.On the other hand it was pointed out that no specific mention of the iron ore traffic need be made0If the Norwegians said that they intended to instituteconvoys to protect the coastal traffic    against attack by german submarines,  the practical difficulties of suchaction should be clearly pointed out to them.    It wouldin any case be desirable to obtain their reactions before our patrols were sent into Norwegian territorial waters,,We had the necessary naval forces ready but we should haveto allow sufficient time for the Norwegian Government to warn tneir^naval f ore     and to draw up instructions to ourown naval commanders on the action which they should take if they met with any opposition from Norwegian patrolsor escorts.    It was very probable that if there was a delay between the making of the proposed communication tothe Scandinavian countries and the taking of naval action,  information of our intentions would reach Germany;but we had sufficient naval force to do what we wishedregardless of any action which the Germans might take,THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that it was ofthe   utmost importance from the point of view of winningthe war, to .gejfc...Nj2rway.And Swe-den on^ur--sJLae.;.   or atleast -to ensure that they were not against us0    it therefore seemed to him most desirable to make sure of our ground as far as possible before embarking on action whichmight have the very opposite effect to that which we desired.    He, personally,  thought that the Norwegians andSwedes would protest, but not violently, and he contemplatedour taking naval action with very little delay, after the oraloomriTunicatinraa.      n :iJ94s, No harm would be done, however,  indeferring the decision to take that action until we were quite sure that there were no very alarming reactions toour communications,

It was generally agreed that the making of theorel communication about the Narvik traffic would not prejudice the chances of our success in carrying through thethe bigger project of stopping all the iron ore from Sweden going to Germany, and that there was no need, therefore, to await the report of the Chiefsof Staff on all the military implications of thisbigger project before making the   oral communication.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY emphasised that it was quite impossible to foresee at thisstage the pretext on which we might have to relywhen deciding to send an expedition to seize the orefieldsin Sweden.     He therefore thought that the Chiefs of Staff,in preparing this Report, noed not take into accountany political factors but should confine themselvesstrictly to the Military implications of the projectfe^p stopping all the iron ore supplies to Germany.THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that it would be desirable to inform our ambassador in Washington of the action we proposed totake, and to instruct him to pass this information onofficially to the President.      In view of the factthat President Roosevelt had already been informedunofficially and secretly of what we had in mind,it would be necessary to ask him, through the samechannels, to show no prior knowledge of this information when the official communication was madeto him by the Ambassador,     as regards the timing ofthe two communications to be made to the scandinavian countries, he suggested that he should make the diplomatic approach to the Swedish and NorwegianMinisters in London, regarding assistance to Finland,as early as possible;   but that he should delay untilthe beginning of the ensuing week the making of the oralcommunication to Norway regarding the stoppage of the coastal traffic for Narvik.      This communication wouldalso be made to Sweden as a m^iier of couriesy.- 7 -

jjssistance to THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF explained that the(inland andScandinavian        Chiefs of Staff had found it difficult to report onibuntriesf,P. (39) 173).    the second part of the remit covered by this Paperm (namely, what assistance could,  in practice, be givento Sweden and Norway against the consequences of such assistance as they might afford to Finland) in advanceof the fuller Appreciation which they were preparingon the military implications of stopping the exportof iron ore from Sweden to Germany.      On this partof the Report, the Chiefs of Staff had only attempted to- set out some of the more important points involved,THE PRIME MINISTER referred to paragraph16 of the Report in which it was stated that if Germanybombed Scandinavian cities and invaded their territories,this would result in the immediate loss to Germany ofthe Swedish iron ore until she had been able tocompletely over-run Sweden and recondition the mines and railways.    The paragraph continued that we should therefore make it clear that an air attack onScandinavian cities would be regarded in the same lightas an air attack on Great Britain and would inviteretaliation.      He was not sure that he followed theline of thought in this paragraph.THE CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF said that ithad been thought possible that the Germans mightthreaten to bomb the Scandinavian cities as analternative to landing an expedition,.    The Chiefs ofStaff thought that in that event we should make it clear at once that we would retaliate.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR took the viewthat our intention to do this should not he declareduntil the time actually came.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was not infavour of the principle of sending British volunteers to help Finland,,  such action &quot;being reminiscent of&quot;non-intervention, in Spain&quot;.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that special personnel and material for thesabotage of railways were standing by ready to leave for Finland.      These personnel would go to Finland in theguise of commercial agents in order to be availablewhen the opportunity arose to cut the Murmansk railway,an operation of great importance?        It would not bepossible within the time available to give adequateinstruction to Finns in this country.It was agreed that the railway sabotage personnelshould sail forthwith for FinlandoA discussion ensued on the suggestion (inparagraph 5 of the Report) that the Foreign office should approach the Swedish Government with a view toreleasing the Polish submarines, now interned in stockholm, for operations against the Russian fleet in the Baltic.        The view was taken that there was/little which these submarines could usefully do now andthat they might be able to play a much more prominentpart in the spring when the ice had melted, in operations,for example, against Lulea and in the Gulf of BothniaoTHE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFasked whether the War Office should proceed with thepreparation of a force for Narvik, for which specialclothing and special equipment (skis^  snowshoes andsleighs) would be necessary, most of which would haveto be ordered from Canadao

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that this was amatter which could he decided when the final decision was taken in the light of the full appreciation whichwas being prepared by the Chiefs of Staff and whichwould come before the Cabinet in the course of thenext few dayso       Meanwhile the War Office shouldcontinue with the necessary preparations withouthowever actually placing ordersoThe War Cabinet:-(i) Took note that the Foreign secretary proposed that afternoon to communicate to the Swedish and Norwegian ministers in London the assurances to theSwedish and Norwegian Governments ofFranco-British help against thepossible consequences to those Governmentsof such assistance as they might afford to Finland:(ii) Agreed that, unless the matter was firstraised by the Swedish and NorwegianMinisters,  the Foreign Secretary shoulddefer until early in the ensuing week the proposed oral communication to those ministers referred to in Conclusion (ii)of WoMo(39) 122nd Meeting, Minute 1:(iii) Agreed that this communication should beto the effect that we proposed to stopcoastwise traffic from Norwegian ports to Germany as a counter-measure for german infringement of norwegian territorial waters and that for thispurpose we proposed to order naval vessels to enter Norwegian territorial waters:(iv) Agreed that preparations should now bemade which would enable us to follow up this communication by action at very short notice, but that no final decision should be taken to order Naval vessels to enter Norwegian territorial waters forthe purpose of stopping coastwise traffic form Norwegian ports to Germany until wehad learnt how the communication referredto in (ii) and (iii) was received:(v) Invited the Foreign Secretary to informour Ambassador in Washington of this communication, which should be communicatedto President Roosevelt:

(vi) Invited the First Lord of the admiralty to ask President Roosevelt to show noprior knowledge of this information whenthe official communication was made tohim by the Ambassadors(vii) Took note of the Report by the Chiefs ofStaff on Assistance to Finland and the scandinavian Countries (W.P.   (39) 173) as representing their provisional views onthis question, pending the submission oftheir full Report on the military implications of Stopping the Export of iron Ore from Swoden to Germany:(viii) Agreed that the question of further assistance to Finland over and above the equipment already promised or underconsideration (as shown in Annex A toW.P.(39) 173) should be re-examined inthe light of this Report.(ix) Agreed that volunteers, particularlytrained aircraft crewsj should not be sentto Finland, for the present at any rate:(x) Invited the War Office to continuepreparations with a view to the ultimatedespatch of a force to Narvik,&apos; withouthowever actually placing orders for equipment of a special type.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.27th December, 1939.



NOTES OP THE PRIME MINISTER&apos;S suggestions as TO THE APPROACH TO BS MADE TO norway and SWEDEN.The Prime Minister said that he didnot anticipate that at the present stage weshould disclose any far-reaching designs.      Hethought that we should not say more than thatwe intended that a Naval Force should, at somepoint,  enter Norwegian territorial waters forthe purpose of stopping the Narvik traffic ....At a later stage, the Prime Minister said thathe would not seek to link the diplomaticapproach which was to he made in regard tohelp for Finland with the action to he takenin Norwegian territorial waters.     Further,what was said to the representative of Norwayv/ould differ from what was said to therepresentative of Sweden .      To the former, hewould say that he thought it right to give notice of our action because it would benecessary for us to enter Norwegian territorial waters.      It did not necessarily follow that,because this notice was given to Norway, we intended to act at once.      The Swedishrepresentative was not directly concerned,since the ore would have left Sweden.      to sweden as to Norway we should offer helpagainst Russia if this was necessary as theresult of either Sweden or Norway giving help to Finland.      As a matter of courtesy we should at the same time tell the Swedish representativewhat we were telling the Norwegian representa-tive in regard to stopping the Narvik traffic.

Statements in this sense could not do any harm, and   jhe did not, however, like the idea of taking action without saying anything in advance.     The essentialthing was not to take any action which might prejudice the bigger issue later on.

AIBB-MSMOIEB-In. connexion with the problem presented by theBttsso-oeriaaa threat to Scandinavia arising fiut of thepresent soviet attack on Finland, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have &quot;been greatly impressed by theimportance of the quest!on of the supply of iron ore.Control of these mines may veil be one of the sovietobjectives, and whatever might be the reaction of theGerman Government to any such move, it is clear thatthe supply of iron ore is likely to exercise a capitalInfluence upon the duration and issue of the waraIn these circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave been giving careful consideration to the wholequestion.   They -would propose in due course to make theNorwegian Government acquainted with any conclusions atSwedishwhich they may arive, in the earnest hope that any measures which may appear necessary an$ practicablemay secure the co-operation of the Horgegtlan Governments.Swedish&quot;
