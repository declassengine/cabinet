- MOST SEORB^ -W.M. (59)  109tla CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 11.Confidential Annex.AIRCRAFT THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR informed hisPRODUCTION.colleagues that the programme of purchases in Americawas quite separate from the production programme.   Ourown factories had produced some 800 aircraft inNovember, 1939, and production would steadily increaseuntil we had attained the figure of 2,250 aircraft amonth, which was our objective.The following points were made in the course ofdis cussion:-(l) There was probably no alternative tocalculating in figures of aircraftproduced per month, but the method of&quot;counting heads&quot; failed to do justice to the recent improvement in ourposition.   The much larger and much better aircraft which we were nowturning out were infinitely.more effective weapons of war than the types produced a, year or two ago.(2)  In war conditions there was inevitablya large number of major and minoraccidents. Damaged machines were goingfor repair to the organisation which lord Nuffield had set up.   This organi-sation was already at work and would bein full swing by February, or March,1940.The aircraft returning to service fromthe repair organisation would constitute a valuable hidden reserve.&quot;The provision ot spars parts had not(.3)oeen sufficient in the light of war-timeoperational requirements.   Steps. wes*e* however,being taken to increase the supply of sparesand this would greatly facilitate the tas&amp;of the repair depots.   The new policy was to insist on the diversion of 1Q&amp; ofI output, or in certain cases 18jSe towardsthe ^revision of spares, in addition to the10$ previously provided.   The aircraft whichwere now being ordered from the United States(would all be accompanied by spare parts.&quot;(4) The Air Ministry had been in constantconsultation with the Ministry of Labour.., on the question of the scientific use ofman-power for aircraft production.   Aconsiderable dilution of labour wasgradually taking place in the aircraft factories.    This dilution had attracted

very little attention, as it had, beenarranged, on a local basis.a month.    This figure was ma-italy made upof fighters.    The bomber position in france was, however, still unsatisfactory.Iffhe--*maxs&amp;&amp;&amp;- -of a (ya&amp;^aoas- in.....t he.....P^r^rnrehr-Aia?-was calculated that our production and theFrench, taken together, now exceeded theGerman production.   As stated in Minute 10,the French Government, like ourselves, werepurchasing aircraft in the United States.The War Cabinet  (i) Took note of the above statements regardingthe position of aircraft production in thiscountry and in Prance:(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Air toinclude in his next quarterly statementa comparison between the British and Frenchfigures of aircraft production, togetherwith an estimate of the production whichthe French were likely to attain by the spring of 1940.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,9th December, 1939.-a-
