Hotes of the First tovd^s Meeting with ministers on September 23 1949.The First Lord gave an account of theoperation at Dakar which had cemmeliced that morning.He said that a landing had been made but was resisted, /the French Admiral stating that he would answer force with force.    One of our battleships had. fired 13 roundsat: the forts.    One of our destroyers had been hit onthe foc*sle and US, CuMBERLASD had been so severely damaged by a hit amidships that both enginerooms had hadto be evacuated.    During the meeting a telegram was brought in which the First Lord read out, stating that.M.S. OTBKHL1HB had withdrawn and was not in need ofassistance.In answer to questions the First Lord statedthat the reduction of the Forts was the primary object.He did not think the presence of the newly arrivedFrench cruisers was of much importance compared witti the coastal forts.
Taming to the Mediterranean the First Lorddescribed how the Fleet there had &quot;been greatly strengthened by the recent operation which had been called JMTS*    this not only gave the Cin C. H.M.S.VALIAJ8T, but also H.M.S. ILLUSTRIOUS, so that he now had available the new Fulmar fighters with a speed of275 m*p*h.    fe had also successfully passed a greatdeal of Important stores to Malta.The First Lord then referred to the unhappyaccident to BVULS, OST which was damaged by torpedoattack from the air while engaged on an expedition forbombarding Bardia.     She had however been successfullytowed back to Alexandria.    In the same week H*I*S.SUSSEXhad been bombed at Glasgow and a report on the severity of the damage was being awaited.    These twomisfortunes meant a serious reduction of our 8m Cruiserstrength.
The First Lord then referred to the successfulconvoying of Military Transports and Personnel to Suesfor the Igyptian campaign.    He observed that the twoconvoys concerned were both arriving 2 days ahead oftime.     It had Hn4 been decided to rush them through for unloading at Port Said.The First Lord theg&amp;pointed to the convoyingof Munitions and planes from TJ.S*Ju and Oanadas and said that since July 1st an enormous ipantity of materialhad been successfully convoyed without loss.    this included 554 airplanes, JQ4 tons of aircraft parts,217 airplane engines, nearly I million rifles, withTfh million rounds of ammunition, a large quantity of guns including nearly 16,000 Lewis Machine Guns for aircraft, together with high explosives, motor vehicles and other stores.In reply to a question about tbe Germancapital, ships, the FJrst Xord said that we had, it was
thought, accurate information about the BISMARCK whichhad now left lie! and was still uncompleted8 and aboutthe SGHMHOHS? and WZSmffi which were damaged, butwe had no information about the-SSEOT^asked about the GEQRJ^ ? the First tord said he had seen her at leweastle a few days before,,    Shewas to sail to Rosyth early next month to fitUropellers and would be ready by the beginning ofBovember.Finally the First I^ord resorted on theprogress made in dealing with the magnetic parachutemines which the Germans had been dropping.on land.Of the 164 mines which had been dropped no less than75 had been rendered safe.
