Her neutrality was felt to be more benefit to the Allies than to Germany and it was in our interests to keep her in her present not unfriendly mood and gradually try to bring her closer to us. It was at any rate unlikely that she would enter the war on the German side, especially in view of the general feeling of her people against such action.

4. The Balkans. If Russia attacked Roumania, it seemed probable that Italy would go to the latter&apos;s support and would not object to the Allies acting similarly. If Germany attacked in that area, it seemed certain that Russia would move similarly and Italy&apos;s position would then become more doubtful; she might be tempted to come in to share the spoils.

5. Russia and Japan. Germany was endeavouring to bring Japan and Russia together. This could only be for strategical reasons, as it could hardly be believed that Germany should wish Japan and Russia to be permanent friends.

GERMANY - POSSIBLE ACTION BY:

6. LORD CHATFIELD then referred to the factors which might influence military action by Germany.

I. Political.

(a) Her internal situation. This was an important factor, though it could not, of course, yet be prophesied whether it would influence her in any military action.

(b) Her general position vis-a-vis Russia - the ability of Russia to support her and cause the Allies to disperse their forces; the possibility of Germany herself having to move to forestall a Russian move.

(c) The need to keep Italy benevolently neutral by not moving too far into the Russian fold.

   


II. Economic. It was probable that Germany had suffieient stocks to carry her through a campaign in the coming summer, but two very important factors which might affect her strategy were her oil and ore supplies.

(a) Oil. Lord Chatfield gave figures showing that as regards oil, Germany&apos;s stocks and sources of supply in the first year of war were estimated at 8,000,000 tons, and her expenditure at 10,000,000 tons. The latter figure was not based, however, on the present conditions of static warfare, so that Germany&apos;s oil position might not be so critical as appeared from the foregoing estimates. On the other hand her oil position was not measured entirely by military operations, but also by the large requirements of industry.

Lord Chatfield then described the measures we were taking to attract Roumanian oil supplies to ourselves and to limit the supply to Germany.

(b) Ore. As regards ore, Lord Chatfield observed it was important to realise that German stocks at the beginning of the war were small and estimated at not more than three months&apos; consumption at the then rate. Herr Thyssen had in fact said that the iron and steel industries were at that time living from hand to mouth. Lord Chatfield explained that as the blockade had closed to Germany sources which supplied her with 9,000,000 tons, or about half her total annual import, it was vital to her to maintain her other great sources of supply from the Swedish ore fields. She must in fact obtain 9 to 10,000,000 tons from Sweden in the first year of war. Of the principal exporting ports, the supply from the nothern ports - Lules and Narvis - was far the most important. An export - an ex-Industrial Magnate of ? - had in fact 
stated that the complete stoppage of ore export from the northern Swedish fields would ruin Germany within six months.

Germany&apos;s ore supplies constituted, therefore, a very important strategical factor.

Lord Chatfield also pointed out that to ensure the supply of 9 to 10,000,000 tons from Sweden, 800,000 tons must be imported monthly, but with the cessation of ?00,000 tons a month from Lulea for four months during the winter, the total would be correspondingly reduced unless Germany could import a considerably greater quantity than at present from Narvik.

POLICY OF THE ALLIES.

7. LORD CHATFIELD then discussed the general military factors affecting the strategical policy of the Allies.

Germany&apos;s strength lay in

(a) her form of Government;

(b) her interior lines;

(c) her military and air superiority;

(d) her powerful fortified position in the west, giving her a feeling of security on that frontier, and enabling her to dispose her large reserve forces in operations elsewhere.

Her weakness lay in her naval position, both geographically and numerically. She had tried to free herself but had been checked, at some less to ourselves but not to an extent to impair Allied superiority.

8. As regards action by Germany, Lord Chatfield felt that the Allies must consider the following possibilities:-

(1) she might continue a waiting policy:

(2) she might remain on the defensive in the West and  operate in the Balkans, Scandinavia, or Holland;

(3) she might attempt decisive operations against Great Britain, or France, or both.

Lord Chatfield added that Germany had about 95 divisions on the western Front opposed by the Allied so divisions plus the 15 fortress divisions in the Maginot Line. He felt is probable that Germany could stand on the defensive

 


fed  en the western Frost wits 80 divisions and take: the offensiveelsewhere?   a war on two fronts was not beyond her powers.&quot;i9. Turning to the question ot the military strengthof Germany, LORD QBATffWQ said that Germany had ISO divisions on the outbreak ot war.    The French General staff estimatedshe would add 38 to 40 divisions by next summer, but thelatter divisions could hardly be of the same value as theformer, either in equipment or efficiency.Lord Ghatfield felt it was Impotent in thisconnection not to overrate the German strength.     There wassometimes a tendency to believe that Germany could havesimultaneously 170 divisions in the field, thousands of first-Hue aircraft, and a vast output of submarines.     Xt seemedextremely doubtful, however, that her Industries could provide all three at the same time, and it was necessary to try to strike a correct balance as to what could be achieved ;in toto.    Lord Ohatfield referred in that connection tothe Economic Committee, which it was under consideration toset up, to advise the Chiefs of Staff on this Important point.ii10. LORD OHATFXSLD then gave particulars of thepresent strength -andlie organisation of the B.B.F. and ofthe extent to which it would be increased by the beginningof March.    He also informed Ministers about the completesurvey of the requirements of military equipment, bothshort-term and long-term, wMehwas now being1 undertaken bythe Military Co-ordination Committee, and he drew attentionto the very large productive effort which would fee ^accessaryfor the completion of ihe-long-term,&apos;programme.    Be referred?also to the very considerable artillery requirement ofA.D.O.B., which was neari^*S**.
AIR FACTORS.

11. LORD CHATFIELD gave a comparison of the respective air strengths, which showed that the German first-line   bomber strength was nearly double, that of the Allies, though we had large reserves. The fighter strength was about equal and we had a ? number of long-range fighters capable of accompanying our bombers. The Allied air strength was growing rapidly, especially from mid 1940.

Germany&apos;s air front was short and could thus be defended in depth and her air defence was reported to be very good. On the other hand, she had a very vulnerable industrial area in the Ruhr uncomfortably near her enemies, if, for example, she ventured to invade Belgium.

There was always the chance that Germany might make mass air attacks on our ships. so far such attacks had been spasmodic.

Lord Chatfield added that so far the German aircraft seemed inferior to ours, and her fighters untrained in night fighting. In this connection it had to be remembered that a change over to improved types of machines inevitably resulted in slowing up production.

MAGNETIC MINES.

12. LORD CHATFIELD summarised the position in regard to the magnetic mine offensive and the measures now in operation to counter it, which were meeting with considerable success. He referred also to the programme of the de-magnetisation of naval and merchant vessels, which was now well under way. Lord Chatfield added that it seemed probable that the magnetic mine was Hitler&apos;s secret weapon and this view was strengthened by the practicability of de-magatisation which explained the immunity claimed by the Germans against attack by a similar weapon. It was difficult to understand, however, why Germany had only started this form of naval warfare in a half-hearted way and had not made an attack of great magnitude before we had out antidotes ready.


QUESTIONS BY MINISTERS.

13. Mediterranean. LORD IRELAND asked whether Germany had made no attempt to send submarines into the Mediterranean. LORD CHATFIELD replied that so far she had not. She had no bases, as she had in the last war when her submarines operated from Turkish ports. It was, of course, possible that her submarines might he sent in and based in Spanish or Italian harbours.

14. Finland. LORD DB LA WARE asked about the help we were affording to Finland. LORD CHATFIELD explained that at great sacrifice we were Sending a very considerable quantity of material - aircraft, guns, ammunition, equipment, clothing, etc.  The Finns were also receiving a number of aircraft from America, and aircraft, guns and ammunition from France.  As regards personnel, Lord Chatfield gave particulars of the organisation for recruiting volunteers, which the Finnish Minister was Setting up in London, and he explained that the Norwegian and Swedish Governments were willing to allow the passage of volunteers through those countries under certain conditions.

Lord Chatfield referred to the investigation now being carried out as to the possibility of operations by the three Polish destroyers and two submarines against Russian shipping in the Petsamo and Murmansk areas. He pointed out the difficulties of these forces operating so far from their bases in England.

15. Ore Traffic.

Questioned about the possibility of hindering the iron ore traffic in German ships from Narvik, Lord Chatfield informed Ministers of the recent examination of this question originating with the Admiralty proposal to send naval forces into territorial waters to force out the ships laden with ore. The reaction of the Norwegian and Swedish Governments to the proposal had, however, been so extreme that with great reluctance we had had to abandon a scheme, which would.


without doubt, have been --fejgr ^effeativ/e.;  -The -pow aUw* - .:^yer&amp;ments were also found to fee opposed to-the ii^ingemeat:of neutrality that would; have- been involved.Lord Ohatfield referred to the possibility ofseising the northern ore fields and pointed out the greatdifficulty of euoh an operation in the face of opposition feySweden, which country seemed, unfortunately, just as likely tosail for German as for our support in the event of herfeeing threatened.Lord Chatfield added that the whole Scandinavianquestion was shortly to fee considered between ourselves andthe French.Id.   Blockade.    LORD GALDECQTE said he was always askinghimself how, apart from the effects of blockade, the war was to end.    LORD CHATFIELD said the main principle ofBritish strategy was the economic blockade which, It had always been emphasised, was a slow weapon.     It might taketwo years or more to achieve success, so that if thatweapon alone was relied on the war would fee a long one.Ho new development had so far arisen to alter that position,but there might, of course, fee some new development in       aGermany j   for example the German Army might not fee so j/    itpowerful a weapon as anticipated. ;LORD OALDHOOSS remarked it was difficult to - see how or where it would be possifele to inflict a militarydefeat on Germany.GOLOHEL 0OLVILLB suggested an opportunity might feeafforded if the German Army invited the :L^w Oountriesi/&apos; !
