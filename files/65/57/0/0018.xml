With Lord Halifax&apos;s compliments.A meeting of Ministers took place in the Secretary ofState&apos;s room at the Foreign Office at 5 p-ra. on October 29th.The following were presentThe Secretary of State for Foreign AffaireThe Lord chancellor the Secretary of State for india the President of the Board of trade the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the Minister of transport the Minister of food the Minister of Economic warfare the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Secretary for Petroleum.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that, afterthe  akar incident, the Vichy Government had made an approach to us and shown that they were extremely anxious to reach amodus Vivendi about supplies for France from North Africa.   Wehad been negotiating with them on the subject when the Hitler-Laval meeting took place.   Messages had then been sent by thePrime Minister and by the King to Marshal P6tain.   We had heard that there was a sharp divergence of opinion at Vichy betweenon one sideLaval and Darlan/and Peta in and Weygand on the other.    We had therefore done our beat to keep Weygand, who was in Horth Africainformed of the various communications made to Marshal Petsin,Presiiden.t ifejpsetslt had also sent a strong message to marshal petain.Lord Halifax then mentioned the visit of Professor Bougie;who had been sent to England by Marshal P6tain.   The general -taken by Professor Rougier had been that Marshal Petainthoroughly disliked Laval and hoped that he would be able toget rid of him in a few weeks.   Marhhal PStein wanted to befriendly with us but we had made many mistakes of p^-ehologyin     x
in our relations with the Vichy Government.   Professor Rougier&apos; sedviee -was that we should refrain from exacerbating the situation by indulging in enterprises like that of Dakar.   General Weygandhad been sent to $Forth Africa with the idea of stiffening theFrench Colonial Empire.   If the Vichy Government were to agreeto yield further to Germany than had been laid down in thearmistice, the French Colonial Empire would almost certainlyrevolt.   Lord Bellfas added that the Prime Minister had seenProfessor Rougier and had encouraged the attitude of resistance to Germany in the French Rorth African colonies.   ProfessorRougier had objected that there was a great shortage of warmaterial and of supplies in general.     The Prime Minister&apos;s answer to this had been that the remedy&amp;f this situation could bediscussed and he had maintained his advice that; If Marshal Petainhimself could not go to iorth Africa, otter French leaders might do so.   As a result of recent developments in France* ProfessorSougier thought that he could serve our common interests betterby going to north Africa himself to see General Weygand insteadof returning direct to Vichy.In reply to a question from the Lord Chancellor, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thoughtHsEhal Petain had been sincere in his approach    to us but thatthere was nothing too had that could be said about M. Laval.   a discussion ensued from which it appeared that the general opinion was that General Weygand was a sick man and that not a greatdeal of reliance could be placed on him.$HE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER asked what would hethe effect on the United States of France*s yielding to Germany.THE 8ECHETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS replied that anything that made the war look grimmer would have a very healthy effect in
- *    is .UIn the United States.   He went on to say that it was held byGreece        some people that Mussolini had attacked Greece against Hitler8swishes.   He thought it more likely to he part of the generaloffensive against Egypt.THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE pointed out that it was absolutely vital from the point of view of our blockade thatwe should continue to be in a position to control theMediterranean.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES asked what chancethere was of successful resistance by Greece.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that our military advisers were pessimistic.    We would do what we could to help Greece on the sea and in the air.   He added that recentreconnaissances had shown that the Italian fleet was still in harbour.    Ours, on the other hand, was moving out.THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE asked whether we had anyrecent information about Turkey&apos;s attitude.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that therehad been nothing since the news that Turkey would he&amp;p Greeceif Bulgaria attaked her.    Lord Halifax thought that the Turks would resist if the Germans attacked them, but he would not be particularly optimistic on this score if there were any signsof a Russo-German agreement at the expense of Turkey.   We hoped to help Greece by bombing Southern Italy.    The question of the bombing of Rome had been discussed and the Cabinet had held the view that it would be well to wait until Athens itselfhad been bombed by the Italians.   In the meanwhile we would; :r; concentrate on the bombardment of Naples,THE LORD CHANCELLOR pointed out that, If we showedOurselves incapable of helping Greeee, the effect In the eastern mediterranean would be extremely bad.THE
rvHUQSiS.bombing of BerlinSpain.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed, but said that in this war we must expect a great deal of criticism of that nature.   It would continue until we had been able todevelop our full war potential.   We should not be too muchdiscouraged by such temporary losses of prestige.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that hewas not particularly sanguine about Russia, whose fear ofGermany washer dominant feeling at the moment.Lord Halifax read the text of Belgrade telegram No. 809of October 25th giving sn encouraging account of the effect ofour air bombardment of Berlin.Lord Halifax Said that Spain was another source of anxietyat the moment, it was clear that German pressure on Franco wouldbe very considerable.     It was also clear that Franco wanted tokeep Spain out of the war if he could.     We were thereforemaking what use we would of the financial and economic weapon,,The Secretary of State went on to tell the Ministers- of theorders to sink Spanish ships which had been found recentlyin enItalian submarine.     He added that this intelligence was beingpassed on to General Franco.THB SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he had recently had one or two conversations with Lord Dothisn who hadbeen quite encouraging.     He expected no serious difficult aboutfinancial help from the United States when the time came in whichwe should need it.     He had said that people in the United states had got firmly in their minds the effect on their security ofcertain key points remaining outside the power of the Germans.naval and military experts having v^trione time been rather Ipessimistic/
Sopessimistic about our chances, had been greatly lnflueneby the reports given In Washington by one of the UnitedStates Air Attaches in load on end their opinion of our chances have changed overnight.THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT asked whether we were giving any help to China.The Secretary of State replied that we were doing what we could to help her but we had no war material to spare.     She was asking for credits and the questionwhether we should give them was now being considered,,He was personally inclined to favour it.THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT then asked whether theJapanese were getting b%g^d in China.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathe was inclined to think that this was so.     TheJapanese might be able to do something from Indo-Ohinabut he did not think that their bombing would have a verygreat effect on the Surma Road.     He thought that theJapanese would probably continue to be very cautious in .their dealings with the United states.     A Russo-Japanese non-aggression pact was likely and this mightwell be to the prejudice of China.
