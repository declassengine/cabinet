LORD HALIFAX said that personally he didHe*****
He doubted whether we should succeed in doing so and whether, even if we did, it would prove possible to maintain relations in the face of the activities in which we should indulge, e.g. bombing, blockade, leaflets. But he thought it was worth while continuing the attempt, in order at least that failure should rest upon the shoulders of the French Government rather than upon ours. In reply to a question by the LORD CHANCELLOR, LORD HALIFAX said that we could only release French experts when the secret information in their possession was out of date.

RUSSIA AND THE BALKANS

LORD HALIFAX mentioned Sir S. Cripps&apos; recents conversations with M. Stalin and M. Molotov. He thought it clear that M. Stalin did not want trouble with Germany and that Germany did not want trouble in the Balkans. The object of the recent visits of Balkan statesmen to Germany had presumably been to keep the Balkans quiet and bring tham into the new economic orbit. According to a recent secret report the invasion of Great Britain had been decided on, but put off until the Balkan position was regularised.

Roumania must now be considered as a German vassal. The Roumanian Government had recalled their Minister in London and asked for the agrement of M. stoica whom we regarded as a mischievous individual. We were thinking of withdrawing Sir R. Hoare on grounds of health and suggesting that representation in each country should be left to Charges d&apos;Affaires. Meanwhile the Roumanians were behaving badly, commandering our shipping and interfering with our companies.

BALTIC STATES

Lord Halifax said that we had not yet replied to the Russian....




Russ&amp;aa protests on the blocking of the gold of the BaltioStates.    The question was linked up with that of recognition of their incorporation in Russia, as to which wehad received protests from the three Ministers,    we shouldItlike to avoid saying anything, but it was not.easy as we hadto deoide whether we should continue to recognise theMinisters or not.    Also we had important commercial interests !lto safeguard, and with the example of the Russian oooupationof Poland before us it was clear that they would need safe-guarding.    The United States Government had taken similarnotion to ourselves la blocking the Baltio gold, and we should &apos;try to keep reasonably in step with them,LORD HALIFAX mentioned the recent difficulties with king farouk, who had, however, now yielded in the question of hisChef de Cabinet,ABYSSINIAWe were hoping to stir up trouble for the Italians in abyssinia, The relay seasoa had Just started and we were using the interval to stimulate Abyssinian unrest with, the help of money and rifles. The matter had importance as a means of deflecting Italian forces from operating againstourselves,FAB, EASTLORD HALIFAX outlined the mala reasons why His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had been reluctantly f eased to seek a compromiseofmaintaining a fleet both ia the Far East and la theMediterranean, the unwillingness of the tmitsd states Ooveraaaiftto/v
to afford m armed assistance and the attitude of Australia.It ramst be uddteratood that we had no guarantee of being able to take a stronger line after three months, but thesituation wight have changed in our favour by then, e.g. aGerman invasion might have been launched and repulsed, andwe^ave had a successful action against the Italian fleet.the secretary for petroleum mentioned the United states proposal for an oil embargo and pointed out that, thoughdirected against Japan, it might damage us.    We badly needed American lubricating oil, and if United states actionforced the Japanese to take action against the NetherlandsanotherEast Indies, A source of our supplies would be closed.It rauid be no help to us if, as had been suggested, theDutch blew up their oil refineries;   nor would It materiallyaffect the Japanese, who had large stocks and would still beable to take crude oil and refine it themselves.    Moreover,we were already having difficulties with the Shah andshould find it difficult to stop him from sending iranian oil to Japan if the Japanese demanded it.THE secretary of state for INDIA said that it was important not to stop Burma from stocking up.    If thesituation deteriorated at the end of three months, stocks in burma wo^id prove wry useful.THE MINISTER of eoomomic warfare suggested that woengtot to consider where we could hold the Japanese.    Hewas Inclined to doubt if our line of defence &amp;ould be furtherafield than Singapore.LORD HALIFAX said that if the Japanese established themselves permanently in the Netherlands Bast Indies, thesituation would be very serious, particularly in its effecton Australia.THE/
THE MINISTER OF HSALTH spoke of the personality of thenew Japanese Minis tw tm Foreign Affairet whoa he had knownla the past end thought to be narrowly nationalistic and anti-demeeratle,THE minister of labour then spoke of the attitude of theworking Glasses in this country and in Europe.    He thought we had lost a great opportunity of winning the sympathy of the masses by our official attitude at the International LabourOfflee.    His Majesty&apos;s Government had always seemed to&apos; take the side of the capitalists,,    There was a feeling to-day among theBritish working classes that they were merely fighting for the capitalists.    If we were to win them over to*sa belief in theirown country, we needed to work out an economic policy which wouldgive them a place in the new world.    Hitherto no word had been said which would give the masses of Europe anything to hipefor even if we did win- the war.    But the masses were going toplay a far bigger part in the future, and it Gould not be ignored that Russia makes a big appeal.     Mr, Bevin believed thatone reason of the French collapse was that the French workingmen&apos;s morale had been undermined by a laftk of hope in thefuture.    It seemed essential that the masses should be given a message of hope now.    He asked whether there was anyprejudice in the Foreign Office against Russia as such because ofher system.lord HALIFAX replied in the negative hut said that we shoulddelude ourselves if we thought that Russia could top propertreatment be made a safes/friendt of this country.    Sir s. c^ippswas more likely te make contact with the Russians then anyoneelee* end it was for that reason that he had been chosen forMescow.    But Russian policy was frankly opportunist-    we could get an agreement with Russia to-morrow if we were prepared tc paythe/
the pries, but the necessary price would not appeal to theMinletet^off Economic Warfare.     lord halifax added Ik replyto a further question by u. r bsvin that there was no questionof our wanting to attack Russia after the defeat of Germany.the MINISTER of SUPPLY reverted to our attitude to the vichy Government and thought we were in danger cf fallingbetween two stools.    we seemed to hesitate between a franklyaggressive policy and one of co-operation.    To his mind itwas inevitable that the Vichy Government should in presentcircumstances be unfriendly, sad he thought we should take that for granted and make things as difficult for them, andso for Germany, as possible.lord halifax said that while we hadnot yet moved to acomplete Interruption of relations, we were not deflectedfrom bombing, blockade, etc.THE minister of supply then suggested that we should makestrong propaganda with the supply of food, by saying that thefood was there for the asking as soon as Hitler had been gotrid of.This was, generally agreed, coupled with the rider thatwe mast have supplies stored and ready to send immediately to any country ae aeon as it should be liberated.THE MINISTER of MIBES thought that we should go furtherend prepare some general economic plan, shewing our readiness for international oo**operation.    This must,bebased on the control of finance in the interests of the masses.Ml. bbvxh then stressed the necessity of am. Internationalsocial loan, directed to social purposes and controlled byan international body.    This alone to hie mind could take tipplace) filled by the armaments inducts? in the past, and bringabout the reconstruction of Surope,    He thought the UnitedStates would find such a loan attractive.LORD/&apos;&apos; ...     ............     ............. ... ........ -*

BEVXN&apos;3 views.There was finally some discussion as to whether our propaganda in Germany should be concentrated against Hitler,The view was expressed that this might only rally the germans to Hitler,    Lord HALIFAX said that we had abandoned the&quot;Hitlerlsm&quot; note in our propaganda in deference to the viewsOf the French who regarded all Germans as beyond the pale.We were now reverting to our original line in the hope thatthe German population would eventually abandon Hitler if they thought thaywould thereby be saved from ruin.
