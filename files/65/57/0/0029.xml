Monday, 8th April.

On Monday, 8th April when the War Cabinet met we had no news of the German attack on Norway. We had taken the decisive step of laying minefields at selected points in Norwegian territorial waters. We learned that this operation had taken place between 4.50 and 5.30 a.m.

Germany, however, had sent out her warships and transports some time before our first mine had been laid. Our air reconnaissance had already revealed that one or two groups of enemy ships were out at sea, including the GNEISENAU, another big cruiser and two smaller cruisers. These had been bombed by the Royal Air Force, who had scored "near misses". The Navy had rapidly made dispositions to intercept the German Vessels.



Tuesday, 9th April.

We had now learned that German forces had proceeded to seize all the important Norwegian ports, namely, Oslo, Christiansand, Stavanger, Bergen, Trondhjem and Narvik. As soon as the news had come in, the Admiraltry had again revised their dispositions. As a result the RENOWN had been in action with the SCHARNHORST and another cruiser; in the course of the action the SCHARNHORST had had her main armament damaged.

   
M. Reynaud and M. Daladier had arrived in London the same afternoon for a meeting of the Supreme War Council. The general policy decided upon at this meeting might be summarised as follows:-

(1) Strong forces to be sent to ports in Norway with a view to their recapture, and to the secure holding of the port and railhead.

(2) It was particularly important to secure Narvik.

(3) The Norwegian requests for assistance were to be met with a statement of the operations already undertaken by the Navy and the Air Force, and by reference to the fact that forces were rapidly being prepared by the Allies to be sent to their help.

(4) It was noted that -

A French Force of one Alpine Division had already received orders for embarkation.

The following British Battalions were reported ready -

Two battalions that night.

Five battalions with three days.

Four battalions within fourteen days.

(5) It was decided to occupy the Faroe Islands, which had since been done.

(6) It was decided to urge the Belgian Government to invite Allied forces to enter their territory forthwith, before a German attack on Belgium took place.



Wednesday, 10th April.

We had already laid mines in West Fjord, and destroyers were available from that operation for a preliminary reconnaissance of Narvik. In this operation one German destroyer was sunk and three damaged; one munitions ship was blown up and six other vessels were sunk. On the British side one destroyer (HUNTER) was sunk and one (HARDY) was run ashore.


Saturday, 13th April.

A second Naval attack at Narvik was carried out by H.M.S. WARSPIKE and mine destroyers. Seven German destroyers were sunk and the harbour cleared of enemy ships. The town of Narvik remained in the hands of the enemy.



Further measures to secure the command of the sea.

Large numbers of submarines were concentrated in the Kattegat and the Skaggerrak, in order to interrupt German communications. It was decided that, as the Germans had stopped neutral shipping in these seas, submarines and aircraft should be free to fire at any vessel they met.



The German Fleet&apos;s heavy losses.

At this point Lord Hankey said that it might be of interest if he attempted, on the strength of information furnished by the Admiralty, to bring out the serious effects of the recent fighting on the strength of the German Fleet. In order to have a standard of comparison, it would be as well to give the numbers of vessels of various classes in that Fleet at the outbreak of war:-

As regardstransports, merchant vessels, etc., 38 had been captured or sunk in the recent fighting, of which about half were sunk in the region of the Sksggnrak.Kattegat and Great Belt.    These included 3 tankers,1 ammunition ship. 1 passenger ship and a good manyvessels of which the character could not be identified*.LXs   Xs-C^ ^MKff*3c^
Air Measures.

It had been of the first importance to limit as far as possible German air activities. Those were at first conducted mainly from Stavanger. Consequently, Stavanger had been bombed from the air daily. In addition, it had been shelled from the sea by H.M.S. SUFFOLK on the previous day.

The Royal Air Force had now available heavy long-range bombers, which had begun to bomb enemy aerodromes as far north as Trondhjem.

The Germans also were very active in the air. In particular, they were bringing considerable quantities of troops into Norway from Denmark by air transport.



Present position at Narvik.

Within the last few days a British expedition had arrived at a point some 30 miles north of Narvik, with orders to make contact with the Norwegian troops in the vicinity. The expedition included oilers, net-layers, a mine-layer and all the apparatus of an advance Naval base.

The German forces in the Narvik district were estimated at some 2,000 men, of whom perhaps 1,300 were in the town. The positions which they occupied included pill-boxes and concrete fortifications.



Present position at Trondhjem.

The German forces in and around Trondhjem had been estimated at 3,000 men, of whom perhaps 1,600 were working along the railways in different directions. The Norwegians, however, were thought to be carrying out demolitions on the railway line between Trondhjem and Oslo.



Present position in the Oslo district.

The German forces in and around Oslo had been estimated, but without any certainty, at some 35,000 men. They appeared to occupy the area south-east of Oslo up to the Swedish frontier and were also spreading out south-west of Oslo. In addition they were working




outwards from Oslo along the railways, including the line to Trondhjem.

Position of the Norwegian forces.

The German invasion had taken the Norwegians completely by surprise. They had not mobilised and their main mobilisation depots had been captured by the enemy. They were resisting more or less spasmodically around Oslo and there were "pockets" of Norwegian resistance in a number of other places. Their morale was low and they were extremely short of ammunition. We were, however, holding ready for them some 50,000 rifles, some 2,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition, a large number of Bren guns and some anti-tank rifles. These, however, would only be handed over to the Norwegians if the state of their morale made it likely that they would be able to use them effectively.

Lord Hankey gave certain further information as to other preliminary measures which had been taken in Norway. The "fog of war" was lying thick over this theatre of war, but it might be assumed that further operations would not long be delayed.

Lord Hankey mentioned the fact that Admiral Sir Edward Evans had now gone to Norway for the purpose of maintaining liaison with King Haakon.

To form a correct mental picture of the situation in Norway one must not forget geography and climate. Much of the country was still under 4 feet of snow. The railways were poor and deficient of rolling stock and the roads were narrow.

He asked his colleagues not to press him for information bearing on future operations. They might expect to hear stories of landings at many different places. Some would be feints to mislead the enemy, some diversions, others genuine operations. For the moment it was advisable to avoid speculation on the subject.


SWEDEN.

Lord Hankey referred to certain steps which had recently been taken by the British and French Governments, apparently with a measure of success, to stiffen the Swedish Government&apos;s resistance. The Swedish Government wished to keep secret one of these measures, namely the despatch of a military mission.



BELGIUM.

No result had been produced by the appeal to the Belgian Government mentioned on page 3 above. There were reports that King Leopold and his Government had decided to remain neutral in the event of Holland being attacked. The Belgian Ambassador in London had been instructed to make representations regarding the preliminary dispositions for a further advance which General Gamelin had made. These dispositions were of course on French territory. The Ambassador had gone so far as to request an assurance that Allied troops would not enter Belgian territory without an invitation. He had been given an effective answer.


HOLLAND.

The only solid fact was that a German invasion of Holland had been mounted since the previous November, and could be launched at any time at short notice. All also was rumour. The rumours were not even consistent with each other. One day one heard that the Germans had removed their barriers opposite the Maestricht Appendix. Shortly afterwards one heard that the Germans were carrying out further wiring.



ITALY.

Another factor that the War Cabinet had to consider was that Signor Mussolini had came out as a rabid enemy of the Allies, and the situation had taken a very menacing turn. Under Mussolini&apos;s inspiration the Italian press had latterly become very hostile.

Much might depend on our getting across to Italy the true facts of our successes in Norway, but it was very hard to surmount the barrier of the Italian censorship. In spite of all this, public opinion as a whole was anti-war and so, it was reported, were King Victor Emmanuel, Count Ciano, General Badoglio, Count Grandi and other leaders. Good personal relationships still existed between the British and Italian fighting services.

Another cause for optimism was the fact that well-known Italian liners were still carrying out their regular sailings.

Certain preliminary dispositions were being taken to consultation with the French to meet the possibility of Italy entering into the War against us.


Rumour had suggested many different directions in which Italy might commit an act of aggression, including -

Corfu

The Dalmatian Coast

Into Slovenia from Albania

Roumania

Gibraltar (in combination with the Spanish)

The Balearic Islands.

The provisional view of the War Cabinet was that we could not afford to disinterest ourselves, if an Italian attack on Yugoslavia should materialise.

In reply to questions, Lord Hankey said that up to the present the Turkish Government did not appear to be greatly disturbed by the possibilities of Italian aggression. A united front in the Balkans was very desirable in theory, but in practice Bulgaria always "ran out".

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER drew attention to the fact that Signor Bastianini, the Italian Ambassador in London, was dining that night with the Anglo-Italian Parliamentary Committee.

THE SECRETARY FOR MINES said that his information was that the Italian Government were making preparations to reduce drastically their imports of British coal. The figures for April were of the order of 300,000 tons, those for May of the order of 150,000 tons and those for June of the order of 100,000 tons. Italian experts were said to be anxious about their country&apos;s coal position.
