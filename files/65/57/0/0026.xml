The total,including killed, missing and wounded, was estimated not to exceed 1,800.    In BrigadierPhillips * brigade, which had been fighting inthe Namses area and which, according to somereports, had liven out to pieces, the totalcasualties were of the order of 200,In reply to a question. Lord Hankey saidthat we had withdrawn from Namses because ourbase had been destroyed, not on account of the casulties we had suffered.    The allegations.1-
that we had left large quantities of material behind were untrue. A certain number of Bofors guns had been abandoned, but these had first been destroyed.

Narvik.

Lord Hankey described the present dispositions of the Allied and enemy forces in the Narvik area. We were gradually surrounding the German positions and the indications were that we should be able to isolate the enemy force but it would take some time owing to the snow. For the moment, however, the Germans, still held the railway from Narvik to the Swedish frontier.

Lord Hankey gave certain further details about impending operations at Narvik. The difficulties of capturing the town would be formidable but should not be insuperable. Lord Cork had now the assistance of certain fresh troops, including a detachment of the French foreign Legion. He had the advantage of the Germans as regards supplies. We were informed on good authority that their supplies were running short.

Questions were asked as to car ability to hold Narvik, assuming that we were successful in capturing it. Lord Hankey said that the probability was that we should be able to held our ground. Nam? and Andalesnes had been bases which it was very hard to defend against the air menace. In both places the facilities were few and situated in one confined area.
In Narvik, on the other hand, there would be a number of landing places and a considerable area over which the land forces could be spread. They would be rather less susceptible of being knocked out by one or two air raids.

Air and anti-aircraft weapons would, nevertheless, probably be decisive in the Narvik campaign. The reports that over 100 enemy troop carriers had proceeded to Narvik should be treated with reserve. The Germans in Narvik, however, had received some supplies by air. There could be little doubt that within a measurable space of time the Allied forces at Narvik, whether they took the town or not, would have to meet a very heavy scale of air attack. The Germans would have the advantage of us in numbers of aircraft, and they would be able to spread their attacks over the whole daylight period of 24 hours.

We were preparing to meet this challenge by converting Narvik, and the surrounding district, into a smaller ?, so far as air defences were concerned. We were clearing the ground for aerodromes at two places which were mentioned, and we were installing a considerable number of Bofors, 3-inch and/or 3.7-inch anti-aircraft guns. As regards aircraft, a number of Gladiators and Hurricanes were being despatched and, in the meantime, the position was being held as far as possible by sea-borne fighter aircraft. One aircraft carrier was already operating off Narvik, and a second was expected shortly.
No area.

Lord Hankey described the backward state of communications in the large area lying to the north of Namsos and to the south of Narvik. Inn order to hold the position, while Narvik, was being put into a state of readiness to meet attacks, we had installed small independent companies in this area at Bodo. ? and ?. They were there for the purposes of guerilla warfare and to carry out demolitions, etc., but could not hold these positions permanently.

Shipping negotiations with the Norwegian and Danish Governments.

THE MINISTER OF SHIPPING gave an account of the present state of his negotiations with the Norwegian and Danish Governments for the chartering of their Mercantile Marina. The Norwegians had been trying to drive a hard bargain. They had apparently been under the erroneous impression that we were about to evacuate Narvik. ICELAND.

LORD HANKEY gave the Meeting certain information regarding the British fores which was on its way to Iceland. We intended to occupy the island for the period of the war, in order to keep out the Germans.

ARUBA AND CURACAO.

Lord Hankey described the measures which would be taken for the protection of the oil refineries in Arabs and Curacao, in the event of a German invasion of Holland.

ITALY.

The situation vis-a-vis Italy was on the whole easier than it bad been two or three weeks previously. The official Italian view appeared to be that Italy was an ? Power, rather than a neutral, but that her assistance to Germany would be by means of the propaganda weapon. It seemed as if there might be some truth in the report that Signer Mussolini had some weeks previously intended 
to enter the war on Germany&apos;s side, but had been dissuaded by his military advisers, who had demonstrated to him the backward state of Italy&apos;s warlike preparations.

THE MEDITERRANEAN.

Lord Hankey and the Minister of Shipping described the present position in the Mediterranean. Orders had been given a short time before to divert round the Cape several large classes of British vessels which normally used the Mediterranean. With the improvement in the Italian situation, the Mediterranean had been partially re-opened to British shipping. There were now some 170 British and Norwegian vessels in the Mediterranean.

THE RED SEA.

The slow convoy of troop-ships from Australia and New Zealand was now approaching Aden and would go through the Red Sea, unless the situation vis-a-vis Italy deteriorated in the near future.

FLEET CONCENTRATION IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN.

Lord Hankey said that three old British Capital ships and two old French capital ships had proceeded to Alexandria a short time ago. H.M.S. Warspite, a more modern vessel, had now passed through the danger zone, and would shortly join the rest of the Fleet at Alexandria.

THE GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION ON THE WESTERN FRONT.

Lord Hankey said that, so far as he was able to judge, we were on the eve of grave events in Western Europe. The Chiefs of staff had reported that, on the assumption that Germany had decided to seek a decision in 1940, the most likely method by which she might attempt to achieve this object would be by a major offensive against Great Britain. An intensive air offensive against us might, if successful, culminate in an attempt at actual invasion. An enemy occupation of the Law Countries would seriously increase the danger. Holland, therefore,

In this connection difficult questions of air- policy cane up for decision. .la reply to a ^aestion, Lord Bankejr saidthat measures were in hand, under his supervision,which should go at least some way to deprive germany of the economic resources which she might expect to &apos;gain from an invasion of Holland or Belgium.A reference to certain circumstances inwhich Germany would he likely to open unrestrictedsir warfare against Great Britain led to a discussionof the situation on the Home Front.The following subjects were touched upont-The degree of success which s German siroffensive against this country would belikely to achieve.The period for which we Should be able tobomber retaliation saslnssaction had been estimated, to min she proportion of 3*1.)

The rate of casualties due to enemy air section to be expected in this country.

The consequences of heavy German air attacks as regards evacuation policy.

The consequences as regards our import programmes.

DIVERSION OF SHIPPING.

THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT, at Lord Hankey&apos;s request, described his plans for the diversion of shipping from the East to the West Coast. These plans were ready to be pat into operation at short notice, and he was satisfied that they ought to work fairly smoothly. A great deal of progress had been made in recent weeks in clearing the West Coast ports of congestion with a view to the reception of additional traffic. The only serious difficulty which he foresaw would be in maintaining our iron ore imports. We should probably find it necessary to use some of the East Coast ports, even under emergency conditions, in order to keep up our steel production.

Other Ministers present gave particulars of their plans for meeting a situation in which the bulk of our shipping would be diverted to the West, under the following heads:-

Food

Cold Storage

Oil

Coal

Transfer of dockyard workers and ship repairers.

THE HOME FRONT.

LORD HANKEY said that steps were now being taken to tune up the whole machinery of Home Defence, both military and civil. In his opinion it was high time that this was done. The risks of invasion might not be high, but they undoubtedly existed. Apart
