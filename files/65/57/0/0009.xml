THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Declaration had been further revised, account being taken of the comments made by Ministerss at the Meeting held on Thursday, 5th March. He thought that the Declaration represented a sound scheme and was a satisfactory document. It was clear, however, that if it were published at this moment, it would meet with considerable opposition from representatives of some of the Indian political Parties. The Viceroy was also opposed ;to the Declaration. The Prime Minister read a Personal Telegram from the Viceroy indicating that if the Declaration immediately he would wish to resign.

The Prime Minister also referred to the fact that the the Commander-in-Chief, India, was opposed to the scheme. In the last two days the military situation in Burma, had deteriorated and we had withdrawn our forces from Rangoon. These forces had found their way to the North blocked, and had had some difficulty in fighting their way out. To the North West of Rangoon a Brigade had been cut off at Pegu, and it was not certain whether it would be able to extricate itself.

In the light of all these factors , the War Cabinet had decided against the immediate issue of the Declaration. Instead, it had been decided that one of their number should visit India in order to ascertain whether the scheme had any chance of acceptance. If as a result of this visit, it was found that the scheme was acceptable that would be all to the good. But if there was no chance of its acceptance, it would he far better not to announce the scheme.

The Prime Minister said that the Lord Privy Seal had volunteered to undertake this mission. In view of what was known of the probable reactions to the scheme of the leaders of Indian political parties, the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s prospects of obtaining acceptance of the scheme could not be rated very high. The War Cabinet were greatly indebted to the Lord Privy Seal for his courageous sincerity of the endeavours which we were making to settle this intractable problem. Further the fact that the Lord Privy Seal had undertaken this mission wouid, of itself, tide us over the awkward period which would necessarily eneuc, now that expectation of some step on our part had been aroused, both in this country and in India.

The Prime Minister said that he prepared to make a statement on the following day or on Thursday, indicating the decision which the Government had reached. Until this announcement had been made, the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Mission to India must be kept very secret. Furthermore, the text of the Declaration must also be regarded as of the utmost secrecy.

The Prime Minister added that in this statement he proposed to say something which would be reassuring to the Meslems. he had telegraphed to the Viceroy explaining the position and decision reached, and saying that there could be no question of his resignation.

Ministers expressed their Agreement with the decision which had been reached, and joined with the Prime Minister in cordial expression of their gratitude to the Lord privy Seal in their good wishes for the success of the important mission which he had undertaken. Great George Street, S.W.I
