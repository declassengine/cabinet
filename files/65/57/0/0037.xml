Zaleski, had visitedhim that afternoon and had spoken on the subject of theproposed Anglo-Franco-Polish declaration condemning german atrocities in Poland.   The Polish Minister for Foreign affairs had desired to add something to the declaration to the effectthat those responsible for these atrocities would he punishedafter the war,^/^ iujU&apos; U Ujtck** -* ^ ^jdJr,^THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then gave theMinisters the substance of recent 8.1.8 reports on the stateof feeling in Germany.   These were to the effect that certainGenerals were becoming Increasingly anti-Hitler, were moreIntent on furthering their political intrigues than pressing forward military preparations and were determined, if possible,to avoid an offensive In the West.   A facile optimism existed in certain Party circles but was not shared by industrialcircles
circles where fatalism reigned.   There were symptoms of disagreement between the Army and the Party machine, hut verylittle likelihood of a serious conflict of Interests atpresent.   Hitler was reported to he sensitive to publicopinion and any public demand to get on with the war would undoubtedly influence him.   At present the hope of peace without a &quot;blood bath&quot; survived, but the situation might easily be changed.   There was much speculation throughout thecountry on what the beginning of the real war would mean, butit was thought certain that an air attack on England would form part of any German initiative.   In this connexionparticular interest was being shown in Party circles at thereturn of evacuees to London.ITALY. THE SECRETARY OF STATE then gave Ministers the substance of Sir P. Loraine&apos;s telegram Ho. 2k Saving, which contained the latter&apos;s assessment of Signor Mussolini&apos;s attitude.SOVIETRUSSIA.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then toldMinisters of the journey of Sir Stafford Grippe to Moscow.Sir Stafford Grille gathered that the Soviet Government werefeeling uneasy about their connexion with Germany and were seeking a means of getting out of it.   Sir Stafford Intendedto take advantage of transport by air from Ururachi which wasbeing arranged for him by the Soviet Government.IRAN.THE SECRETARY of STATE said that the Iranian Governmenthad been showing signs of nervousness about Soviet intentions in the spring.   The Shah had recently put out feelers to find out what assistance he might expect from us.FINLAND
THE MINISTER OF TRAN8P0RT asked what was the latestnews from Finland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that theWar Office did not appear to take over-seriously the^Russianthreat to the Mannerhelm Line.   Russian attacks were heavyhut on a narrow front.   He then told Ministers that, fromthe diary of a Russian officer which had fallen into the handsof the Finns, it seemed that the morale of the Red Army inKarelia was already throughly had ten days before the Finnishcampaign began, that discipline was poor, that the war against Finland was unpopular, in contrast to the Polishcampaign, and that the officer in question and his colleaguesfound it difficult to reconcile with the facts the officialSoviet attitude that Ruesia was fighting a war of liberationin defence of Soviet frontiers.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF EDUCATION asked whether anything was being done to inform the Russian people of thereal facts.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthe Finns were doing some broadcasting and that we on our partwere doing all we could.In answer to a question from the Qp STATE FORINDIA, LORD HALIFAX said that we and the French Governmentheld more or less the same view as regards war with SovietRussia, i-e. that we were agreed in thinking that adeclaration of war on the Soviet.Union would serve no useful purpose.      f-Vs-^A haJ-hx^Katl^Mf^ ^ A-^o. chcja^^   &amp;3e*J^ 6^.-1^ .THE MINI ST KH OF LABOUR pointed out that people in thiscountry who ran the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; to orders from Moscow were extremely
extremely active.   Their main efforts were directed towardsthrowing doubt on the bq&amp;a fides of responsible Trades Onionleaders.   He was doing what he could to arrange a counter-campaign in the press.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD DP EDUCATION said that hehad recently heard that a certain member of the executive of the National Union of Teachers wae evidently of the same way of thinking as the people responsible for the &quot;daily worker&quot;.   This Individual had pressed for the exclusion froma report of the Union of certain passages acknowledging thegood work done by the Government, on the ground that theUnion should oppose the Government and weaken the country&apos;swar effort.THE SECRETARY FOR MINES drew attention to a recent coal strike in Lanarkshire, and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLANDpointed out that the Lanarkshire miners&apos; union had got intobad hands.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR was most anxious to find outwhere the money for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; came from.   In replyto a question, he said that the position of the Labour party was very difficult.   For twenty years they had been pro-Soviet and it was impossible for them to change their views in a hurry.   Extremist elements in this country wereconducting a campaign on the slogan &quot;Peace and High Wages&quot;,and were doing their best to undermine the position of the responsible Trades Union leaders.   In this campaign the &quot;Dallyworker&quot; wae playing a very prominent part, and it was mostimportant that urgent consideration should be given to thepossibility of taking some action against the paper.THE SECRETARY FOR MIRES suggested that it would benecessary to deal at the same time with &quot;Action&quot;, the organ ofthe British Union of Fasoi&amp;e. of which the tendency wasconsistently defeatist.FINLAND.
THE IIWI6TER -OF HP-tons asked what the Supreme WarCouncil had decided in regard to Finland.THE 8ECRETARY OF STATE FOE FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathe was unable to give Ministers very much information,but he could say that France and Britain were at one in considering it vital to support Finland and to induceNorway and Sweden to permit the freer passage of troops-.The question of man-power was becoming more and moreimportant.   The Finne had practically no reserves and theywould shortly become exhausted.   Everything depended onthe attitude of Norway and Sweden, who at present weregoverned by a strong desire to keep out of the war.In answer to a question from the SECRETARY OF STATE FORSCOTLAND, LOBS HALIFAX said that the Finnish figures -ef-Buool-an JLseeoo were perhaps not absolutely reliable butthey had been enormous, and the morale of the Red army was bad.In answer to a question from the PRESIDENT OF THEBOARD OF EDUCATION, LORD HALIFAX said that we had sent to finland a very considerable amount of material.THE LORD CHANCELLOR then said that he had the feeling that the amount of auppliee which we were sending to finland was governed by what we thought we could spare,whereas it should be governed by the conviction that wecould not afford to let Finland be over-run, even at thecost of finding ourselves at war with Russia.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that neither we nor the French were deterred by fear of warwith Russia.&apos;    - THE
;V 6.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND pointed out that,in declaring war on Russia, we might conceivably play intothe hands of Germany, for not only would it add to our commitments but it would support to some extent the viewsof a certain section of opinion In Germany which held thatBolshevism wa8 the great danger and that the civilised worldshould band together against it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then pointedout that Soviet-German relations were in all probabilityvery close and that we were not afraid of them becomingcloser.   In any event Finland must be saved, if it werefthumanly possible to do s-e, but he must emphasise the factthat the possibility of aid to Finland depended to a largeextend on the attitude of Norway and Sweden.    Public opinionappeared to be developing satisfactorily In those countries.In answer to a question from the MINISTER OF HEALTH, theSECRETARY OF STATE said that substantial aid to Finlandwould probably be regarded with alarm in Germany and leadto pressure by the latter on Sweden and Norway.   It might even be necessary for us to go so far as to give thesecountries certain assurances of support In case of attack.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked what the Secretary ofState&apos;s views were on the chances of the war being greatlyintensified In the spring.   In reply, LORD HALIFAX said thathe personally was inclined to think that the Germans wouldnot make an attack.   The French view was that, if there were no German attack in March or April, there would be none thisyear.   It was not clear whether this would really suit us ornot
OFRANCE.SOUTH-eastern europe.&quot;ROUMANIA*not.   Undoubtedly our blockade would not have as great an effect if Germany were not making a great military effort,although in some things, particularly lubricating oils,her position was not good.In answer to a further question from the MINISTER OFHEALTH, LORD HALIFAX said that, according to all reportsavailable, French morale was good, though the Frenchtemperament undoubtedly made it more difficult for them to sit still and do nothing.   There was some uneasiness InFrance owing to this comparative inactivity, which wassedulously fostered by the Stuttgart wireless.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thaton the whole the results of the Balkan Conference were satisfactory, but that this did not mean that the membersof the Balkan Entente had bound themselves to go to eachother&apos;s assistance if they were attacked.   However it didshow/certain increase in Balkan unity and gave commonexpression to their desire to avoid war.   The feelingtowards Bulgaria was better.   The French were engaged in staff talks with certain of the Balkan Powers and It was hoped that this might lead to some extension or at anyrate improvement of arrangements for resisting aggression by Germany or Russia.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatwe had had some difficulty with Roumania over oil supplies to Germany.   We had at one time thought of bringing realpressure to bear on her, but we had decided first of all to clear up the question of what commitments she had
towards Germany in this respect, and we were now awaitingher formal reply.   He thought there was a great deal oftruth in what Sir Reginald Boa re had said of Roumanianpromises, which wae that they were unreliable hut that thedifference in the promise given to us and to Germany wasthat the Roumanians meant to fulfil those which they gave us and meant to evade those which they gave, to Germany.Referring to the recent invasion scare, the Secretary Of STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that there was now some doubt whether the message from the King of the Belgianswhich Sir Roger Keyes had transmitted to the First lord had, in fact, been correctly transmitted.    It might well bethat the French strictures on Belgium&apos;s attitude during that weekend might prove to be unjust.
