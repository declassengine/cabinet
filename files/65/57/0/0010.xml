India.

The Meeting had before them:-

(1) The text of a draft Declaration (W.P. (42) 109).

(2) The following selection of documents bearing on the position:--

(a) The Sapru Manifesto, dated 2nd January.

(b) A memorandum by the Secretary of State for India, covering a Note by Major-General R.M. Lockhart, Military Secretary to the India Office (W.P. (42) 107).

(c) A telegram from Mr. Jinnah to the Prime Minister, dated 2nd March.

(d) A telegram from the Viceroy, enclosing a message from Sir Firozkhan Noon.

THE PRIME MINISTER gave a general explanation of the reasons which had led to the preparation of the Declaration, and of the arguments for and against making a declaration at the present time. He thought it could be claimed that the document was free from any humbug, and, so far as the future Constitution of India was concerned, only made explicit what had been implicit in our previous undertakings.

He also emphasised that it was intented that it should be made clear that the Declaration represented finality, and that we would not be prepared to bargain in regard to it.

The Prime Minister explained that in present times it was not possible to take soundings of opinion in Parliament and elsewhere, as would be done in peace-time. The proposed draft Declaration had been prapared by the War Cabinet and two or three other Ministers with special knowledge of India and Indian matters. But he did sot think it would be right to proceed without discussion of the matter on a broader basis. The present Meeting had been arranged in order to ascertain the views of ministers generally. He invited ministers present to express their views.

THE SECRETARY OF STAE FOR INDIA informed the Meeting of the views of the Governor of the Punjab (telegram No. 14 G) and of the views held by former Governors of the Provinces.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought that the disadvantage of making a declaration at the present time outweighed the advantages.

In particular, he saw objection to the inclusion, at the end of the first paragraph, of the words conferring a right to secede.

From the financial point of view, he thought that if coupled with other unfavourable circumstances, there was a risk that the Declaration might precipitate a flight from the Rupee.
The Chancellor also thought that the words in paragraph (c), that His Majesty&apos;s Government must inevitably bear the full responsibility for India&apos;s defence, might be taken as meaning that His Majesty&apos;s Government assumed the sole financial responsibility. He would like this phrase altered, so as to make it clear that what was intended was executive or political responsibility.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION also saw objection to the inclusion of the words relating to secession. He also feared that the Declaration would have a bad effect on the Army.

He also pointed out that there was no assurance that the proposed treaty with the new Indian Union would contain provisions dealing with such matters as the retention in India of British troops or the safeguarding of British interests.

THE PAYMASTER-GENERAL (designate) asked whether words should not be included in the Declaration dealing with the appointment by India of representatives at the Peace Conference.

THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY said that he had read the Declaration as not doing more than making explicit our existing undertakings.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES doubted whether the issue of the Declaration would lead to the present controversy dying down. He thought that provision for safeguarding of the rights of minorities should be made in Declaration. He criticised the inclusion of the words "for the time being" in paragraph (c) (i), and suggested that more time should be given for the consideration of this most important document.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS and THE LORD PRIVY SEAL explained that the words "for the time being" were inserted since it was necessary to provide either for subsequent secession, or for the framing of a new Constitution for the non-asseding Provinces if they so desired.

THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION thought that the issue of the Declaration was likely to encourage defeatism, and would lead to controversy both in India and at home.

THE MINISTER OF WAR TRANSPORT said that his concern was with the timing of the issue of this document. He was afraid that its issue now would tend to lessen rather than to increase the war effort.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that the opinion of the Viceroy, when he had discussed the matter with him in India on his way back from the Far East, had been that he could hold the position; he had been opposed to an Constitutional change or to any further promise on the matter at the present time.  


The Chancellor of the Duchy quoted Sir Firozkhan, who had said "You have many friends in this country and many enemies". The Chancellor said that what was proposed here would discourage the Moslems but would not make friends of our enemies. We must stand by our friends. He did not see what we should gain by the issue of the proposed Declaration.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that if some action was not taken in the near future we might have to meet a worse situation. At the same time he saw no advantage in advertising the right to secede.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES also hoped that the words dealing with secession would be deleted.

THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION agreed with this view and also objected to the words "for the time being" in paragraph (c) (i). While he had no special knowledge of India, his own judgement would be not to take action on the lines proposed at the present moment. He did not like the idea of making it appear that concessions had been wrung out of us when the enemy was at the gates.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that he accepted the need for some action on the lines proposed, but hoped that the safeguards for the Moslem Provinces  and communities would be made abundantly clear.

THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE agreed generally with the views expressed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He thought that the proposed Declaration would land us in worse troubles than we were facing at the moment, and that it would not be accepted as final. He also asked whether the Declaration did not involve some breach of the pledge which we had given in regard to the Depressed Classes in the Hindu Provinces.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had been intended that this matter should be dealt with in the Treaty.

THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that he could not say what the effect of the Declaration would be in India. From the Constitutional point of view he thought it was a pity to include words dealing with the so-called right of secession. To do so might give rise to grave difficulties in the Dominions with a Federal Constitution. He queried the words "for the time being" in paragraph (c) (i). The wording of paragraph (c) (ii) also semed to imply that such matters as e.g, the rights of minorities, would be dealt with in the Treaty and not in the Constitution.

THE MINISTER OF FOOD said that he had read the draft Declaration with concern, and thought that it would give the impression that we were quitting. The document was a discouraging one. Was it necessary that the Declaration should go into so much detail.
