S3CHET 2nd February, 1940.My dear Edward,I enclose a note of thediscussions at the recent Meetingof Ministers, which you will liketo add to the set.Sir Edward Bridges, K.C.B., M.C.Yours sincerely,
A Meeting of Ministers was held at No. 10, Downing Street, at 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday, the 31st January, 1940.

The Prime Minister was in the Chair and the following were present:-

Secretary of State for the Colonies

Minister of Economic Warfare

Secretary for Mines.



THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been considering the implications of the recent speech made by Herr Hitler. It seemed to him that the speech was very uninspiring and that it was significant that Hitler had even used such words as "capitulation" and "death rather than victory". The Germans had not thought before either of capitulation or of dying. There was also a want of preciseness in the speech which seemed highly significant.

It was natural at the beginning of a new year to speculate on the future. There were obviously a number of alternative courses which Germany might take, but the idea had been growing in his mind that Hitler might choose an alternative not previously contemplated. It seemed possible that, not seeing any short way to end the war and being detered by his Generals from a military gamble, he might now be ...


 be thinking of trying to beat us at our own game and to outlast us in a siege war. The  violent attacks which were now being made on our shipping would be consistent with such a plan. It was possible that they might think that these attacks would embarrass us and shake our confidence and cheer up their own people.

Germany might also seek to take advantage of the difficulties of Russia to insist on a more intensive development of Russian resources. It was, indeed, reported that technicians had already gone into Russia. It might therefore be a part of their plan to keep neutrals quiet by threats and to put pressure on countries such as Roumania who could supply them with raw materials. They would thus bank on our getting tired and on their having sufficient time to make Russia efficient. If that turned out to be an accurate forecast, the Prime Minister said that he would except peace feelers to be put out fairly frequently with the object of detecting any symptoms of weakening on the part of the Allies. There were indeed already feelers of that Kind. They generally purported to come from the opponents of a Nazi Regime and to include prominent members of the Reichswehr. The name of Goering was often mentioned. All that he could say was that he had seen nothing as yet to show that there was in Germany any serious attempt to find terms of settlement which would be acceptable to us. It was doubtful whether Germany had yet felt the pinch sufficiently to be prepared for terms of that kind.

The Prime Minister thought that Germany must desire the Finnish War to end as soon as possible if only because its continuance must use up Russian resources. Germany would ...




 would presumably like the war to end either by a peace between Russia and Finland or by the defeat of Finland. We must therefore interfere as much as possible and give all the help we could to Finland. Finland had especially a need of aircraft. The Russian air attacks on their towns and villages were at present the most dangerous feature of the war. These attacks were trying to the morale of the civilian population and interfered with the output of munitions. Nevertheless it seemed clear that the Russian machines were bad and that their pilots were bad and timid. But as there was on the Finnish side an almost complete lack of aeroplanes the county was defenceless before these air onslaughts. If only it were possible to provide a few aircraft in each of the places exposed to attack, the attacks would soon cease. Unfortunately, the Finnish towns and villages were small and far apart and a relatively large number of aircraft was therefore needed. We were doing all that we could to help. Already we had arranged to give about 150 planes and France about 175. Italy was also providing planes and America would supply a few. Thus a total of perhaps 400 might be built up which should do much to help Finland. At present infantry was not needed and in any case it would be useless to send troops who were neither equipped nor trained to fight in the conditions which now existed in the Far North. Finland would, however, in all probability require troops in the late spring and we were not excluding from our minds the possibility of giving help. Our Chiefs of Staff were at the moment in Paris discussing the position. Nevertheless, an expedition to Scandinavia would obviously be a very formidable undertaking. It ...


It would make heavy calls on shipping; it would be difficult to organise a landing which would almost certainly be opposed. It would almost certainly involve war with Russia. Obviously we must not enter into an undertaking of that kind lightly. While an expedition to Scandinavia, with the possibility of cutting off Germany from Scandinavian iron ore fields, held out many attractions, it would be wrong to think that such a campaign would be simple or easy.

At their last meeting, Lord Chatfield had referred to the project of stopping ore supplies proceeding to Germany by sea from Narvik, but it was, important to remember that the stoppage of the Narvik ore alone would not be decisive, whereas the stopping of all Swedish ore might be decisive. it was clear that we could only make ourselves masters of the Swedish ore fields by the consent of Norway and Sweden. It had therefore been thought right to see what reaction these two countries would have to the Narvik project. As was expected, Norway&apos;s reaction had been violent. So also, somewhat contrary to expectation, had been Sweden&apos;s reaction. It had therefore been decided to suspend the execution of the plan. But we had been abandoned and it was important that they should not think this as we did not wish to lose whatever value there might be in the threat to execute the plan. We had therefore, asked them what they themselves proposed to do to meet our objects. We did not wish to give any grounds for grievance to Sweden and Norway as it was important to do nothing which might encourage them to make an agreement with Germany. There were already signs that ...


that the ruthless sinking of neutral ships by Germans and their callous brutality to the crews of these ships were stiffening the attitude of neutrals.

In other parts of the world we ourselves were in difficulties with neutrals owing to the measures we had taken in our economic warfare campaign. Difficulties had arisen with America, Japan, Italy and Roumania. Happily, however, things were now looking a little better. Lord Lothian had had an encouraging conversation with Mr. Cordell Hull. In the case of Japan, we had not fully appreciated the storm that stopping the "Asama Maru" would arouse. Our Ambassador had, however, been extremely skilful and it was to be hoped that we should be able to come to an arrangement with Japan. But the Prime Minister said that he would not, however, be prepared to do anything to meet the views of the Japanese in the "Asama Maru" case unless a settlement of this incident was part of a general agreement about the transport of Germans on Japanese ships. When Ministers had last met Lord Halifax he had told him that our relations with Italy were in a "trough". The Italian Press was conducting an offensive against us and Signor Mussolini was dissatisfied. The Prime Minister thought that we were now beginning to rise out of the trough and that the situation was looking better. The Master of the Rolls who had recently returned from Italy would shortly go back there and we hoped that he would be able to come to an arrangement satisfactory to us. The Prime Minister hoped also that as a result of the arrangement we should be able to obtain military equipment from Italy. Our Ambassador was keeping up a close but clandestine connection with the more important people in Italian

Government circles and we were receiving from him encouraging information. The Prime Minister thought that he could now say that the possibility of Italy joining Germany had become almost microscopic. Whether she would join us was obviously more doubtful, but it might be that it would suit us better that she should not do so.

The Prime Minister then referred to the statement made by the Chancellor regarding the steps to be taken to maintain commodity prices. He explained that he had seen Mr. Attlee and Sir Archibald Sinclair on the subject. Although Mr. Attlee had not been very forthcoming, it was clear that the Opposition Leaders approved the proposals. Moreover, the manner in which Mr. Attlee had dealt with Mr. Shinwell&apos;s interruptions in the House suggested that the Front Opposition Bench were not looking for quarrels.

LORD ZETLAND asked whether it was intended to publish the Russian Blue Book. The Prime Minister said that he had discussed this also with Mr. Attlee who thought that the book should be published. The Foreign Secretary still had some doubts on the matter and we were consulting the French. After that the Prime Minister intended to see Mr. Attlee again, but his own view was that it would probably be necessary to publish the Book.

LORD STANHOPE asked whether it was true that Russian merchant ships had been ordered to return to Russia or to take refuge in neutral ports by a certain date. The Prime Minister said that there was no official confirmation of this.

SIR REGINALD DORMAN-SMITH asked whether, if we decided upon a Finnish expedition, the reaction on our shipping ...


 shipping would be serious from the point of view of food supplies.

SIR JOHN GILMOUR said that he was quite sure there would be no difficulty in providing the ships for troops, but the shipping needed to maintain supplies for the expedition would be a serious drain on our resources.

The Prime Minister said that all such questions would, of course, have to be taken into account in considering the question of an expedition.

COLONEL COLVILLE asked whether volunteers were being allowed to go to Finland. The Prime Minister said that the Finnish Minister was being allowed to arrange for the dispatch of a small number of volunteers and it was understood that, provided they went in small parties, Norway and Sweden would not object.

COLONEL COLVILLE said that the Finnish Minister had recently been speaking in Scotland and that he had been very effective.

In reply to a question put by SIR REGINALD DORMAN-SMITH, the Prime Minister said that he did not think there had been any recent change in the political situation in Spain.

There was some discussion about political conditions in America and the Prime Minister drew attention to the possibility that Mr. Cordell Hull might be the next President. Speaking of the Canadian Election, the Prime Minister expressed the view that Mr. Mackenzie King would be returned, although it was possible that there would be a dissident minority. Nevertheless, all parties in ...
