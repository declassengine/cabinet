Jerram.VSITUATION.        1.   Land Warfare. Dealing first with the comparativestrengths of the Land Forces, LORD GSATFIELD said that thestrength of the german Forces on the Western Front had increased to a maximum of 110 Divisions.     She Allies had99 Divisions. Including the 15 French Fortress divisions in the Maginot Line.      The strength of the B.E. F. in france was now 8 Divisions, one of which was a Motor Division.Two further Divisions were ready to go to France.      the divisions of the third Contingent would be ready to go atthe rate of about one a month, beginning in April.The relative strengths-on the western Front. had not;:therefore, changed very much in the last six weeks.,    -$$^the Allied Forces might be added the SO Belgian Divisionsif Belgium called us In in time, which we feared they&apos;,mightyUS not. /l&apos;:i;(-;fIH The latest information as to german Dispositions V - ^Shewed that their forces had been strengthened opposite A .Belgium and Luxemburg at the;. expense&apos; Of. their.;poj^.^^^^^:south.

attack through those countries, though it was dlfflonlt tounderstasd wh^^^ moiwnt thanoa the previous occasion.      The moral aspect of sash anattack remained tas same j n&amp;less we gave the Germans, a pretext for such action.     The position was, however, thatall was staged for a German attack on the Western Front atany moment.mentioned that the German higher direction of war did notappear very good.    He referred to General Ludendorf&apos;smemoires of the Great War, in which the following observationwas made - The machinery of Government in Berlin gave theimpression of being extremely clumsy.     The various Depart-ments worked side by side without any real cohesion, andthere was infinite overlapping.     The left hand did not know what the right hand was doing.w    There seemed grounds for believing that the situation to-day was no better, and mightbe worse, so far as co-ordination was concerned - for examplesthe failure to exploit on a large scale the surprise weaponof the magnetic mine and the bombing attacks on our ships jthe failure of the German Air Force to interfere with therecent operation by the HSossack&quot;.3.   Italy.   A month ago It was felt that    would be -pcssihleto ease up considerably in our-preparations against;&apos; ^ta^^;&apos;:by Italy which, except for a considerable weakening of ourHaval Forces in the Mediterranean, had not been rala*%d^^teany extent since the outbreak of war. &apos;v The attitude-of&apos; \J\Italy had now? however, become somewhat more menaei^,,,-ah&amp;;;;sthe possibility of her hostility much affected, of cearae^;the Balkan and Mediterranean1 situation.
4. Turkey. With Turkey we had advanced a good deal. Anglo-French-Turkish staff talks had been held in Ankara, and further staff talks with the Turks had been arranged. An important point that had emerged from these conversations was that, in order to enable our Forces to operate to assist Turkey, much would be required in the provision and equipping of bases, and construction of communications. The present lack of bases much affected what we could do to help Turkey. Meanwhile, discussions were also proceeding with the French about using Salonika; the French were anxious to use that base, while we were not.

Our plans for assisting Turkey would be very much affected, of course, by the situation vis-a-vis Italy. If Italy were hostile, we could not do very much. If she were not hostile we could send two Divisions from the Middle East and the French could send two Divisions and some aircraft.

Lord Chatfield referred to the Treaty of Mutual Assistance with Turkey under which, if Roumania is invaded by Germany, and the British and French guarantees came into play, Turkey would lend us all the aid in her power. If, however, Roumania were invaded by Russia, Turkey was not obliged to take any action which would involve her in war with Russia.

5. Egypt and Palestine. Referring to the arrival of the first contingents of the A.I.F. 6th Division in Palestine and ======/%d.&apos; bill the H. g? ?F. 1st Division in egypt.p Lord Ohatf laid /osp$plf*&apos;*that, these. Forces will form part of our. strategicfor either, the./Middle last-or elsewhere.   . Bach:Dl^isie^:&apos;ylwould be completed to approximately 13,000all rank^;/ehi^rjl6* Finland. Lord Phatfield said we &apos; ana the FrehcJ: w^i^^fcsending considerable amounts owe/oould not .unforturaatoly-. son
 the Finns to hold the Karelian isthmus, where the situation was serious. At the moment the Finns were asking urgently for Bombers to use against the Russian concentrations in the Isthmus. Lord Chatfield save a general description of the military situation in Finland and added that, if the Finns could hold their line in the Isthumus until the thaw set in, they might then be able to prolong their resistance throughout the summer, depending on the amount of further help that was forthcoming.



7. Russia.

Lord Chatfield remarked it might be of interest to analyse the question of whether or not it would be of advantage to us to go to war with that country.

Russia&apos;s military machine had been shewn to be weak and deficient in many ways, and it was improbable that she could strike us heavy blows in India except by air. she could, however, cause us to disperse our forces, both military and air, by undertaking limited operations against us in more than one area. on the other hand, although war with Russia would be an indirect blow to Germany economically, there was little we could do against Russia, and, as had been explained previously, Turkey was unwilling to enter a war against Russia. The only effective measures we could take would be to attack the Baku Oil refineries (1) from Iran with medium bombers, (2) from Iraq with long-range bombers, or possibly (3) from Syria with French long-range bombers. We could also interrupt Russia&apos;s sea-borns trade.

On balance there seemed little advantage in going to war with Russia. Her prodigious expenditure of oil and munitions in Finland was already keeping her from helping Germany economically. Further, there seemed now some indication that Russia was inclined to become more friendly to us, and that her partnership with Germany was growing more uneasy.

  
OIL.

8. Germany&apos;s position. Referring to the particulars he had given to Ministers at the meeting on 25th January, Lord Chatfield said that a more accurate analysis of Germany&apos;s oil position was now available. The revised figures estimated that her total sources of supply for the first year of war were between 7,680,000 and 7,980,000 tons. Her estimated consumption was (a) 6,360,000 tons under static conditions of warfare, and (b) 7,170,000 under six months static and six months active conditions.

It was clear, therefore, that Germany&apos;s oil position was critical and was bound to have a considerable bearing on her strategy.

In the second year her home production might increase, and she might obtain more from Russia. In the latter connection, Lord Chatfield referred to the action were were taking to endeavour to reduce Roumania&apos;s export of oil to Germany.



ARMY SUPPLY PROGRAMME.

9. Lord Chatfield then referred to the examination now being conducted by the Military co-ordination Committee into the Army Supply programme, the number of Divisions we could put into the field being dependent on the output of munitions and equipment. The Minister of Supply now had authority to produce all that was possible in the first two years of war, the achievement being, of course, governed by the provision of Labour and supply of raw materials. At the same time, the Secretary of State for War was investigating the Scales of Equipment of the Army, and it seemed clear that he would be able to propose considerable reductions in a number of items, which should enable us to put larger Forces into the field and more rapidly.

Lord Chatfield added that the Committee would subsequently examine the Air production programme.

 
10,      Lord Cgfeatfleld gave particulars of German air attacon our shipping during the past four month and&apos; of its effect.. :   So far the &apos; Oeynene; had not employed imra tnan.8 per cent, of; their total Long-Baage Bomber Force on these;&apos; % SI 1operations * and the maximum number of aircraft operating inany one day had never exceeded 35* and was usually far less.This form of warfare was a serious problem, and if intensifiedmight necessitate diversion of our shipping to the west Coastjrwith consequent slowing up of our trade.    It already causedMthe expenditure of very considerable fighter effort on our part.The attacks had been facilitated by the lack of anti-aircraft guns in ships moving on the East Coast, butvigorous steps had been taken to arm merchant vessels, andthe present position was that 4?$ of the ocean-going tradeand 80$ of the Coastal Trade had now been armed withanti-aircraft guns.     In addition, bullet-proof platingprotection was being fitted in ships as rapidly as possible,and 500 detachments from the Army, armed with Lewis orBren guns, were now manning ships moving along the East Coast*11.- LORD S&amp;TJWOTD asked,, if Germany sent over bombers in which larger numbers, whether we should not be given betteropportunities of attacking thorn.LORD GHATFISLD replied that would probably be so by day, but that at night it was found to be exceedingly,difficult for-our fighters to obtain contact, ^^Th^lprevieuD-night, for.example, although a large number of ^m?s^:  r &apos;: \: ^:bombers were operating off the ::East Coast, ottr-&apos;.-figfttp^8Mwe^fe-;: ::unable to obtain contact with even one.
10*      Several Ministers raised the question of what wereour plane?MR. felt test Germany was eating into our reserves and we were not eating into her&apos;a.    She wassinking quite a considerable amount of our snipping, and sodepriving us of large quantities of foods and raw materials^Our reservoir seemed to be running out faster than Germany9s?He was wondering from where the thrust was coming by whichwe could win the war.MR. BHQWH remarked that prominent in the minds ofthe people at the present time were such questions as how the course of the war to date was affecting our position,whether the present &quot;waiting game*&apos;naaiiy was to our advantage and whether we felt we could win the war by continuing it.      He mentioned that he had recently talkedto an American who had been in Germany on business and whohad stated that there seemed to be plenty of food and that conditions generally appeared not very different from normal;?hQm CHAWXBLD replied that reports as to theconditions in Germany were always conflicting.    He felthowever, it was quite wrong to imagine that Germany wasGermany would have to Capitulate owing to her condition,without any great land fighting?
