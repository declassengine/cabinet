MOST SECRET.A sheeting of Ministers was held is the PrimeMialster*a room at the House of Commons at S.15 p*m* onThursday * Meosber Ttb* 1939.There were presents *The trine MinisterSecretary of State for foreign Affsirsminister for Co-ordination of DefenseSaord PresidentLord ChancellorSecretary of State for IndiaSecretary of State for -the- ColoniesMinister of FoodSecretary of State for ScotlandPresident of the Board ef TradePresident of the Beard of  ansatieaiiinisster of HealthMinister of L&amp;hsmr and National ServiceMinister of supplyMinister- of .Agrieultmfej end FisheriesMinister of Transport&apos; -Minister of Shipping&quot;   Minister of Informationaeeretary for 11mMr. BuskerThe Pritas Minister said&apos; that he proposed In thefirst plaee to give a short explanation of the reasons forthe meeting.   In the present war, we had the experience &quot;;of the war of 1914-18 to guide ne* and we were now able todo things which in the last war we had learned to do only after mistakes had been made.-   Beverthel^&amp;s, our methodsoven ...
even in IMi war had to be detsntaedte &amp;mm extent bytrial and error,   one tains- waa. He believed, unquestioned.In war time decisions bad to- be taken at abort- Aetlee*and it wee impossible to have a Cabinet of the sizeappr opriate to peace timt and for this reason the warCabinet hsi been set up without delay,   la order to make this possible he had asked hie colleagues in the lastCabinet to put their of flees at ale disposal,   they beddone this at- once and without -question.   Is had deeply&apos; appreciated the support give to hie la this way.Inevitably, there had been differeaeee of opinion as tothe best way of tonalag the War Cabinet.   So could givereasons for the way in whieh it- had. in fact, been formed,bat this waa -a matter which he thought they would all beready to leave ua&amp;iseussed.   The result of the appointmentof the f^r Cabinet had, however-, been that a good manyMinisters who had previously been gea&amp;era of the CabinetSere no longer able to share in the responsibilities ofthe cabinet.   Mstorelly, no-one liked giving upresponsibilities in this way and he fully appreciated&apos;^hat the change had meant for the Ministers concerned* andwas deeply grateful to taess for the say in which they were going their Jobs,   la recognised also that their workae ...
as Ministers la eherge of Beparteents was- affected bydeeiaJtons ofthe saar -Cabinet^.  They $mas% therefore^ bedeeply interested in the doings of the War Cabinet mad an endeavour bad been made to meet this point by circulatingCabinet papers and Cabinet conclusions.   In the early days ;of the war he had not suggested any etitor or closerliaison, bceausej, la the first place * nothing of the kindhad existed in the last war, and because, in the second place, the preesura of work on members of the War Cabinet&apos;had boon so great that it would&apos; not have beam possible forthem to give time to discussions with other Ministers.Bow, however, three months had passed.   The first hurriedrash was over, and the machinery of administration wassettling down into a routine^    fe-one could be sura thatsuch conditions would remain, but nevertheless , he thought-It was reasonable to adjust * with due caution, theorganisation of Government to the present state of affaire.The war, ee far had been very different from the kind of war we had expeetedw   There were many problems to be solved,and he realised that Ministers who did not attend dallymeetings, of the Cabinet must sometimes find difficulty Inappreciating the &apos;situation?   The $cabinet eeeeftwaiomt ware-not always complete, because some matters were too secret to be included in thorn.   In any ease, reading minuteswas *.*
was not the same thing as attending meetings. He thought, therefore, that the time had come at which an endeavour should he made to strengthen the personal touch between the war Cabinet and other Ministers. For this purpose he thought that there were three Members of the War cabinet who, because of the nature of their duties, could he especially helpful. They were the Foreign secretary, since foreign affairs ranked, in the forefront of our problems, and relations with neutrals and with our Allies formed part of our strategy and necessarily affected the work of departmental Ministers; the Minister for co-ordination of Defence, who possessed in special degree a general knowledge of the strategic situation; and the Prime Minister himself. Accordingly, he had asked the Foreign Secretary and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence  to join him in attending the first meeting of Ministers. He had not contemplated, however, that all three war cabinet Ministers should attend every time but if, for example, it was agreed that a meeting should take place ones a week, then one of the three Ministers might attend on each occasion, Thus, each War Cabinet Minister would attend a meeting once in three weeks. It was obviously desirable to avoid imposing upon members of the war ...
War cabinet too many engagements, and he did not want to make the arrangements too rigid. There might sometimes be occasions when the attendance of two members of the War Cabinet would he desired, or when some member of the Cabinet other than the three he had named might usefully attend.

As to the procedure to be adopted at the meetings, he would be glad to receive suggestions, but his own feeling was that it was essential that the talk should not be all on one side. It was important that the war cabinet should be fully informed of all that was in the minds of other Ministers. He thought, therefore, that the meetings might begin with an appreciation of the situation by the member of the War Cabinet present, and that this might be followed by questions. The questions put should, naturally, be appropriate to the work of the Minister present. He hoped that this explanation of the proposals would make clear what was in his mind that the meetings suggested would be acceptable and useful. (At this point, Mr. Oliver Stanley joined the meeting).

The Lord Chancellor said that he and his colleagues were greatly indebted to the Prime Ministers for all that he had said and cordially welcomed his proposals. They deeply appreciated the fact that the Prime Minister had made ...


made these proposals on his own initiative.

The Ministry of Information asked whether it was desired that notice should he given beforehand of any particular points which Ministers might desire to raise. The Foreign Secretary said that he thought this was unnecessary and that it would he desirable to maintain the complete informality or the meetings. The President of the Board of Trade said that he did not think it would be desirable for questions to be asked on detailed points. The Minister of Food agreed and pointed out that it would be very helpful to Ministers to be kept in touch with the background of events, a knowledge of which was most important in their daily work. The Minister  of Labour pointed out that a knowledge of the background was also essential for any Minister speaking in the country. He drew attention to the activity of the Socialists and the importance of counter-campaigning. The Prime Minister said that although the matter must be treated as strictly confidential, his colleagues should know that it was proposed to hare a series of meetings in the country in January and February. These meetings would be addressed by members of the War Cabinet. He himself proposed to open ...


open toe series toy addressing a meeting in the City ofLondon and end it by taking a meeting in Birmingham.   TheW^tofMMmtoF ***** whether the Foreign secretary had any information which would show how far it was true to say that time was on our side. What, for example, weethe tenpe of industrial construction in Germany?$he ffore*jer foreign *a*e ***** i* ^as impossiblefor him to translate into figures the Information at hisdlajiosal, bet nevertheless, more was no doubt that the-.Germans ware already greatly ae&amp;arrassed and that if thewar became intense, their embarrassment would increase.Time was certainly on our side la the sense that we weresteadily increasing oar capacity to hold the line against our enemies and thus maintain the inviolability of our industrial machine^ -The Lord President said that the Government wereoften criticised for not. prosecuting the war morevigorously.   What wore- the reasons why we were not doingmore?    &amp;&apos;ore we afraid, for instance, of the effect on neutral opinion?    The Prfoy minister said that we were certainly net de-terred from more vigorous action by the fear of its effect in America.   Our strategy had been
egiM apea with the breach, and indeed, was emphasisedeven more- fey them than by me,  Time wee en ear side, andear defence wee not yet es geea as we shoals wish it tobe before launching an offeasiwe.   If, for eaample, wewere now to bomb the Hair, it waa clear that whateverether off sots there might be, such action would certainly be followed by retaliation.   The French view was thattheir aircraft factories were so sited that retaliatorybombing; would be likely to destroy them, and. in a aborttime would result in their losing the mastery of the air.We ourselves were stronger in the air than the French,nevertheless, m- still wished&apos;to keep our forces until we were strong enough for an offensive.   The Minister ofHealth asked why, in these elrenastaaees* Germans1&apos; did not attack as.   The Prims, Minister said that he believed therewere two reasons.   In the first place, they had doubts about the overffhelmlag strength of their own forces.   Inthe second place, they were doubtful of the offset on thesser&amp;le of their own people of the retaliation which theymight draw upon themselves.   It was true that if this werecorrect it might be considered an argument in favour of ourassuming the offensive.,   nevertheless, the point had beenfully ...
fully discussed by the War Cabinet, and their unanimousfeeling waa the same as that ef the branch, namely, thatthe time had net yet eene*   the yi^etaff,-.ef - -Health saidthat it was met to be supposed that the Germans would beidle la the intervening period.   What wae their nextsaeve likely to bet    The Prime Mi slater said that hisbelief , which was perhaps a personal view, waa that hitler might still hope for a pesos.   If he had not had such a hope-, it was scarcely believable that he wouldhave allowed the French to mobilise or the BritishIjcpedltioaary Force to croas to France. &apos; Lord Oha^tffisldsaid that there was another possibility.   It might bethat the Germans thought that to hurl their long range bombers against ear fighters would not be a sound military operation.   In the amall*seale engagements which hadalready taken place, we had been able to Inflict a highpercentage of casualties.   There were three offensiveplans open to the Germans.   To attack the Maginot line, toattack in the air, and to attack on the sea.   It was- spitepossible that they felt that if they could attack theifsginet Mae and our factories simultaneously, they wouldhave a good- chance of success, but that as it was not easyat
at this time of the year to attack the Maginot Line, they might have for this reason concentrated upon the war at sea. The Minister of Heath asked whether it was thought that Germany was likely to go for the Balkans. The Foreign Secretary said that this was an obvious possibility which ought not to he excluded. The Balkan countries were, however, much more afraid of Russia than of Germany, and it was therefore possible that Roumania would be accommodating towards Germany. There were two great enigmas in the foreign situation. (1) what was the precise nature of the arrangements between Russia and Germany and (2) what would be the attitude of Italy? The Cabinet had been considering what action to take if there were developments in the Balkans. It was clear that our action must be conditioned by what Turkey could and would do. If Turkey felt that her interests were so affected that it was necessary for her to enter the war, then we should certainly support her in the Balkans. The President of the Board of Education asked whether we had been disturbed by the activity of General Weygand. Lord Chatfield said that General Weygand had certainly been active la making enquiries into the Balkan possibilities. So far, our attitude had been that of desiring to keep the Balkans quiet. The Minister of Agriculture said ...


said that the problem of what was happening inside Germany was an intriguing one. Was it true that events were taking place there which might reduce the length of the war, or did we still feel that the war would last for three years or longer?  The Prime Minister, pointed out that we had never said more than that we must be prepared for a three-years war, and he thought that was still the position. The Foreign Secretary said that very conflicting evidence came from Germany. There was no doubt that things were not comfortable and that there were dissensions in high quarters. The situation was encouraging and sometimes comforting to think about, but it would be most unsafe to build upon it. The only safe course was to continue with our preparations on the hypothesis that the war might be a long war. The effect of the agreement with Russia had,  of course, been considerable.  The German Admirals were annoyed at the loss of power in the Baltic, there had been irritation at the return of the German population in the Baltic, there was annoyance in the Party, and the agreement with Russia had assisted us in our relationship with Spain. Italy and Japan. The Lord President asked whether, if Russia invaded Sweden, Germany would be likely to go to the ...


the support of Sweden? The Foreign Secretary said that he thought this was most doubtful. The Swedish Minister was, however, painting pretty pictures of a new Anti-Commintern pact, including almost all countries outside Germany and Russia. The Minister of Supply said that he had been informed by the Italian Ambassador that fifty planes sent from Italy to Finland had refuelled in Germany; that they were piloted by pilots who had fought against the Russians in Spain, and that they had been successful in shooting down seven Soviet aeroplanes on the day of their arrival in Finland.  The President of the Board of Trade asked what was the present attitude of Italy. The Foreign Secretary said that thew was increasing anti-German and pro-British feeling, but there seemed little prospect of her coming into the war on our side. She was annoyed with our ban on German trade, and it was necessary for us to move delicately, but he did not think that we need have serious anxiety that she would go to the support of Germany. The Prime Minister said that Count Ciano was now undoubtedly pro-British. Mussolini had strong personal feelings and was inclined to have fits of rage at our interference with trade. Nevertheless, the general trend ...
trend of Italian policy was undoubtedly away from the Axis.

Lord Zetland  said that he assumed that the German-Russian Agreement was assisting this process. The Foreign Secretary said that this was so, and that German stock had gone down in Spain. The Minister of Food asked whether any information could be given about the activities of the Deutschland and the von Scheer, and the difficulties caused by the laying of magnetic mines. Lord Chatfield said that the Deutschland was thought to be in Arctic waters and the von Scheer in the South Atlantic.  He described the great difficulties of hunting down these vessels especially as they were adopting different tactics from those adapted in the last war. Instead of remaining on one trade route and harrassing the shipping found there, they were content to attack one or two ships only and then move to an entirely different area. Lord Chatfield also gave an indication of the strength considered necessary for attaching these vessels and went on to give an account of the accident to the submarine Triad, which hod not been due to enemy action, sad of the sinking of the Rawalpindi and of the present dispositions of the Fleet. In answer to other questions. Lord Chatfield said that there would be a large Influx of new ...
