Mr. F.H. Sandford



SIR KINGSLEY WOOD began by referring to the warning which he had frequently given against assessing strength and production on a purely numerical basis without reference to types. In this country it had always been the policy to concentrate on quality. This meant that more man hours were taken in construction, and that the number of man hours was constantly going up as new and improved types were introduced. He circulated to the meeting a table showing the man hours spent in the construction of pre-expansion, present and future types with corresponding figures of performance.

SIR KINGSLEY WOOD next outlined the arrangements which had been made for the production of the standard types of fighter and bomber on which we were at present dependent, and gave the production figures and details of the arrangements for extending production in each of these main types. He also gave the figure of aircraft production for January. In considering these output figures, it was necessary to take account of the facts that certain factories were now turning over to new types and that a considerable amount of productive capacity had been diverted to the production of spares.



  
As regards engines, he explained that, while during the earlier stages of expansion engine deliveries had been ahead of airframe deliveries, some anxiety was now being felt about certain types of engine. A very large figure was, however, being achieved at the principal factories.

During the winter a considerable amount of re-arming had been carried out not only from one type to another, but also from one Mark to another within the same type. He reckoned that the effective operational strength of the Royal Air Force had been increased by at least 70% within the last year and probably 100% would be nearer the mark.

SIR KINGSLEY WOOD gave estimates of the first-line strength and reserves of this country, France and Germany as 1st April and explained that these figures must be taken with certain qualifications. There was no doubt, for example, that the Germans had been disappointed in certain of the types in service and there was a limit to what could be done in the way of improvement.

SIR KINGSLEY WOOD also explained the steps which had been taken to build up production in this country and in France, and the ration which production in the two countries at present bore to German production and the ration it would bear during the Summer. In this country as a result of the decision taken by the Cabinet at the end of 1938, we should be turning over to larger and more powerful types of bomber and fighter, and SIR KINGSLEY WOOD explained the steps which had been taken for the production of several new types. He also mentioned the figure of estimated air expenditure in 1940.

SIR KINGSLEY WOOD then referred to the steps which had been taken to build up both the labour force and the materials required for aircraft manufacture. He also gave an indication of the further expansion which would be required in both fields.
