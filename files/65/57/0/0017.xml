Raper-Bingham.The Secretary of State gave the meeting an accountof his Middle East visit on the lines of his statement to theWar Cabinet on the previous day.     The meeting showed particular interest in, and various questions were masked on, the comparative strengths of the opposing forces; Abyssinia;Palestine and the present state of affairs in Syria; Creteand Cyprus; the attitude of the Egyptian Government andMilitary Authorities; and the possibility of German intervention in the Middle East campaign.In answer to these questions Mr. Eden pointed outthat, although numerically superior, the Italians could not possibly deploy their full strength in the Western Desert inattack, and this fact, together with the superior morale,training and experience of our troops, more than evened upthe score, except in the air where the enemy&apos;s numericalsuperiority was much greater.He gave the meeting some details regarding rebelactivities in Abyssinia, and pointed out the importance of
this movement in relation to any possible future offensive action from Kenya and the Sudan.He explained the proposed troop dispositions and plans of the G.O.C., Palestine, in the event of an attackthrough the Dera Gap, and pointed out the very delicateposition in Syria at the present moment.     For the timebeing it would be the least of evils if the situation in syria remained stable*Mr. Eden gave the meeting some details of ourtroop dispositions at Cyprus and Crete.     He explained thatCyprus was particularly vulnerable to invasion from the air,but that it was quite impossible to reinforce our garrisonthere for the time being.     The possession of Crete would be most valuable to us from the naval point of view, althoughSuda Bay was not yet sufficiently protected for it to be used as a major naval base.While the attitude of King Farouk was, to say theleast, uncertain, the &quot;present Prime Minister seemed a reliableman, and he felt that a few substantial military and navalsuccesses would eliminate the present uncertain attitude ofthe Egyptian Government.Should the Germans intervene in the Middle Bastcampaign this would substantially alter the whole positionoThe addition of German dive-bombers to the Italian forces might prove of the utmost seriousness as would the participation of German armoured divisions.     However,in this connection Mr. Eden pointed out that even a GermanPanzer Division might find war in the Desert a very differentthing from the conditions under which they are accustomed tofight.At Mr. Daltonrs request Mr. Eden then gave a general account of the campaign in Greece and its relation to theMiddle East situation.The meeting expressed its thanks to Mr. Eden for his statement which it found most encouraging.
