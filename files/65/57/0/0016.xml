45ASECEET. ^uNotes of Meeting with Ministers above the Line[X:) at the Admiralty. 4.50 d.ie. &apos;5ra Dec. 1940,The First Lord began by referring to the situationin the Mediterranean.     He pointed out that it had always beenthe aim of the Admiralty to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleetwith the object of striking at Italy.     Until recently, other commitments had hindered the execution of this policy, but within the last few weeks it had been possible to spare moreships for the Mediterranean and recent successes against theItalians had shown the soundness of the policy.As had been publicly seated, the damage to theItalian capital ships would result in a temporary easing ofthe position in the Mediterranean.     Nevertheless, care mustbe taken to avoid reducing the strength of AdmiralCunningham1s forces below the level at which he would be ablewith confidence to carry the offensive against the Italians.As an indication of the state of Italian morale,the First Lord drew attention to the recent Naval action inwhich Force H was engaged.     The First Lord described theaction in some detail, and showed, how unfounded were theItalian claims that it was the British units which had runaway.     He expressed the opinion that it was a chanceencounter, since the primary object of Force H. was toprotect (i) a large military convoy going through the- Mediterranean and (ii) one of the older capital ships whichwas being withdrawn as a consequence of a success at Taranto.In his personal view, the Italian forces were probably sweeping to cover a convoy about to leave Palermo
for Libya.The convoy which Force H. was protecting wascarrying R.A.F. drafts for Egypt to replace units sent to greece, ana reinforcements for the anti-aircraft defences and the garrison of Malta.     These latter were intended tomake Malta reasonably secure for use as an advance base for light forces against Italian communications with North AfricaPlans were on foot for further blows at the Italians.The Air Squadrons sent to Greece were being replaced by a special route depending on transport by carrier toTakoradi, whence the aircraft flew overland via Free french equatorial Africa, to Egypt.   FURIOUS had already landed 34Hurricanes at Takoradi and it was hoped that she would soontake another cargo of these aircraft.In reply to questions about the Dodecanese, the FirstLord explained that the four principal islands are quite wellgarrisoned, but that the Italian Naval ana Air Forces basedthere had shown singularly little initiative.     They had notin any way interfered with Greek convoys taking troops to salonika.     He thought this was an eloquent tribute to the respect which the Italians had acquired for the Royal Navy,as a result of various sweeps into the Aegean.     political considerations, unfortunately, entered into the question ofan attempt to take the Dodecanese.     Owing to the conflictingmclaims of Greece and Turkey it would probably be necessaryto garrison the Islands ourselves if the Italian garrisonsurrendered.Questions were also asked about the extent to which
the British Navy was able to impede the flow of reinforce-raents across the Adriatic into Albania.     The first Lordsaid that it must be remembered, although it was not oftenrecognised by the public, that the forces available to theC.  in C. Mediterranean, and especially the number of cruisers and destroyers, were very limited in relation tothe tasks which he had to perform.     Moreover,  there were very extensive minefields in the Adriatic.     For these reasons our patrols in tnat sea could only be sporadic,though one sweep by light forces had already led to heavy losses in one Italian convoy.     We had had submarines on patrol, but generally speaking they had seen little shippingmoving.The First Lord, at the request of the LordChancellor, gave retails of the Italian suxarine forces.    Hesaid, that we thought we had destroyed 27 Italian submarinesso far.     The Italian submarines had all achieved remarkablylittle.     The First Lord also mentioned the capture, onboard an Italian submarine sunk off Gibraltar, of ins true t-ions ordering the-submarine to sink the. ships of certainSpanish lines.     It had now been decided to publish theoriginal document,The First Lord also stated, in. strictest confidence,-in answer to enquiries about the fate of M. Chiapas, thatduring the coarse of the battle off Sardinia a strangeaircraft appeared which was apparently shadowing the Fleet,and was naturally shot down.     There hac. been no survivors,
A5DUout certain documents picked up suggested that it mighthave been the aeroplane in which&apos; Chiappe was travelling.Turning to the situation in Home Waters, the FirstLord said that he could not present a picture comparable to that in the Mediterranean.     In fact, merchant shipping losses remain extremely serious.     While they had shown l\ -some reduction from the very high peak reached a few v/eeksago, they still continued to run with a distressingregularity to figures comparable,  though not equal, tothose of 1917-     They were due also to a variety of formsof attack.     The submarine was the worst menace, but air attack, particularly on the large fast ships which sailedalone, had claimed numerous victims, and the mine also hadtaken its toll, especially with smaller ships.As regards the U-boat campaign it was stillunfortunately true that we still lacked the destroyerstrength required to provide effective escorts all round.The &apos;tramline&apos; scheme to which the First Lord had referredat the previous meeting was not yet in force.     partly because of damage to destroyers due to very heavy weather,and partly because of unpredictable&apos;delays in fitting theAmerican destroyers for ocean convoy work, we had not yetbeen able to assemble enough fast escort vessels to providethe high degree of protection necessary -to justify the1 tramline&apos; system!       Nor had we been able so far to gf&quot;^,sufficient reconnaissance over the waters in question bythe Coastal Command.     Nevertheless, we hoped that the escort position would improve.     Soon appreciable numbers
of the American destroyers should be fitted -for work in heavy Atlantic seas, and it was proposed to- ask America for more destroyers, still.     The HUNT Glass destroyers were coming out well, and it was hoped to complete seven more&quot;before Christmas.     These- would go to trie East Coast, where their armament would be particularly suitable for the defenceof coastal convoys against air attack, ana they would releasebigger and faster destroyers for the North Western ApproachesAdmittedly, many of the destroyers now had more defects than we would wish,- but this was laregly the consequence of the enormous amount of sea-time which they had had to put inin the first year of the war.The: threat of warship raiders to ,.fhe Atlantic convoyswa-s being met bya revival of battleship escorts, which would act as a very powerful deterrent.So far as air attack was concerned, the lack of close-range weapons for merchant ships was a great difficulty and this was mainly due to the cessation of the deliveries of Oerlikon guns fro:;&apos;. Switzerland almost before th y had started.     Arrangements were being made to manufacture themin England, but the First Lord did. not empect any productionuntil January- at the earliest. .In answer to questions, the First Lore; said that hewas not satisfied with the production.of merchant ships.The- original target had been lk million tons from home yards,in a year, but the special measures necessary to make good the- great.- and unexpected loss of military equipment inFrance mad made this objective unobtainable.     The target
was now It million tons.     To compensate for this reduction,it was planned to have more ships built in the U. S. A. andan order for 60 ships was being placed with an American Yard,although the price was of course very heavy indeed.     Afurther expedient which was under consideration was anattempt to persuade the United States both to charter ships to us and to escort their own vessels when- bringing Americangoods to this country.     This could be justified without serious prejudice to our views about belligerent rights, onthe ground, that the protection&apos;was against illegal methodsof Sea-warfare adopted bj the Germans.The first Lord stated that the German acoustic minehad presented a very interesting but very grievous problem.It had come as more of a surprise to us than the magneticmine and a relatively long time had gone by before we hadbeen able to obtain a sample.     Nevertheless, after three or four weeks of slow progress, we had- recovered one acousticmine, and now had three altogether.   Progress now was most encouraging and we had actually in operation two types of vessel which could detonate the mine at a safe distance.   Thenumber of vessels so equipped was, at the moment, small butthis number would be rapidly expanded.The First Lord also drew attention to the menace ofthe E-boat, which he felt sure would play a considerable part in the naval war.     He mentioned the torpedoin- of%eJAVELIN as an instance of the tactics for which these boats were peculiarly suited.     It had to be admitted, that at the
moment we were behind in the development of this weapon,,largely because it had always been consiaered suitable only for powers who could count on relatively calm waters formany of their naval operations.     In order to help make up this lee-way, a Flag Officer had just been appointedespecially to organise our fast motor craft.     He would notonly watch deliveries, but plan the organisation and trainingof these craft, and develop their tactical employment.Their had been certain successes recently, which were ahopeful sign for tho future, but the First Lord felt boundto warn the meeting that the high casualty rate in suchcraft meant that only a small proportion of the total strength was operationally effective at any one time.     Theloss of our orders of Isotta engines with the entry of Italyinto the war had put back our own programme of 3,1. T. B.building and Merlin engines could not be released from aircraft production in replacement.     We were thereforedriven to obtain engines from various sources in America,but deliveries were still slow, and few.
