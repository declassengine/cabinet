Morals ia the german army, particularly among the troops stationed in occupied territory, soosst to ho deterioratingAa regards Italy the morale of the prisoners of warrecently oapturod was had.    There wore stories of troublebetween Blaekshirts and the Army.    The civil populationrealised the extent of Italian defeats and theft aorale waslow, but there was nothing to show that the country was on theverge of an internal collapse.    TUB secretary of statereferred to a useful iseaMng which ho had rooeatly had withthe Minister for Economic warfare and the Minister ofSnferatatlen about Italian propaganda.    It had boon decided atthe nesting that propaganda should bo concentrated against theregies and should leave the Pans and too Sing oals&amp;i    it wasalso decided that our propaganda should bo reasonably politeabout the dinssvm mwvm Sritroa m*. mm mM that Italian, reaiataaeehad/
had been expected on the Korea Ridge but no resistance had been encountered there there and it seemed possible that we would be able to advance as far as A ? Asmara. This was most encouraging.

As regards Ayssinia MEE EDEN referred to the problem of presented by the large number of Italian women and children in the country and said that General Wavell was exercised about it. Provided that the Italian Army surrendered to us we would be ready and willing to protect these people and if possible get them away.

FRANCE.

 Opinion in France appeared to be steadily stiffening,we were secretly in contact with Marshal Petain, our usual channel being the United States Ambassador. we were also in contact with General Weygand. The verbal assurances received from ?him had been satisfactory and he had asked us for military supplies. It had been reported that the French had moved a certain number of aircraft from Moscow to Tunis. The attitude of the Church in France was unsatisfactory as a number of French bishops seemed to have come out in favour of co-operation with Germany. Mr. EDEN said that he had Just seen Cardinal Hinaley who had promised to do what he could in the matter. Spain

MR. EDEN said that although German pressure on the Spanish Government was continuous there was no actual evidence of an impending German move through Spanish territory. He thought, that there was at present no alternative to the policy that we were pursuing was the right one. We were giving the Spaniards a little food and if we reached a satisfactory settlement about Tangier we would give them some more.


The situation in the Balkans was disquieting. There were already at least nine German divisions in Roumania and it was thought that before long there would be as many as twenty. Our intention was to stiffen the Turks and Yugoslave as much as possible. MR. EDEN then gave a short account of the attitude of both Turkey and Yugoslavia towards a German advance through the Balkans and of what we had asked them to do. He said that the possibility was being considered of a frank approach to the Turks with an offer of air support if that would enable them to declare their position more clearly. If they refused to do so it seemed possible that the situation might slip. In answer to a question from the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA, MR EDEN said that Bulgaria would make no move if the Germans advanced through Yugoslave.

Greece had accepted General Wavell&apos;s visit with ? but had then got frightened. She was most unwilling to do unwilling to do anything the considered might provoke Germany.

SOVIET RUSSIA.

The policy of Soviet Russia was governed by feat that although she disliked German penetration into the Balkane, she was unlikely to do anything that might lead to an open elash with Germany. The Russian Military Attache in Angora had recently stated that, if was broke out between Germany and Turkey, Russia would preserve a benevolent neutrality towards Turkey. This was ? the best that we could hope far.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA asked whether it was our intention to attack Tripoli. The occupation of Tripoli seemed to him the only way of clearing the Straite. If we did not do so, Malta might become untenable. Success there would enable us to give really serious military support to the Greeke.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that the situation seemed to be satisfactory there. The visits of Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Willkie were most useful. The President&apos;s gesture in going to meet Lord Halifax was most welcome and he thought that great credit should be given to the Prime Minister for his brilliant suggestion that the President might like to see H.M.S. "King George V"

 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that Mr. Hopkins had been most helpful over the important question of radio personnel.

FAR FAST

 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that the Japanese had communicated an unpleasant memorandum to the Netherland Government in regard to the Netherland Eeat Indies.

The Netherland Government appeared to be unmoved and intended to spin out their discussions with the Japanese and play for time. MR. EDEN said that we were making every effort to get into closer touch with the Netherland Government about the situation in the Far East and to convince them that it was a question of our sinking or swimming together. In reply to a question from the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA he said that the Netherland authorities had appreciable forces an their disposal in the Netherland East Indies.

General Metaxae had bees very candid and said that he did not like to take the risk of inviting Britishtroops to land in Greece unless they could do so in veryconsiderable forces&quot;.    If9 for instance, we could send503*000 men that would be a different matter, but if it were only 20,000 he feared that the only result would be animmediate German advance which neither ha nor we wo&amp;d beable to steiee   U&amp;, eden than mentioned in confidence the fact of General Metaxes6 Illness.the secretary for mines asked what foroee would bereleases in the event of an Italian collapse in Eritrea, and abyssinia.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that approximately six divisions would be available In addition to naval forces now stationed at Aden.In answer to a question from the PRESIDENT of THE boardOF EDUCATION about the Italian position in the Dodecanese,MR.
