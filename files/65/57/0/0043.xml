A Meeting of Ministers was held in Lord Halifax&apos;s room at the Foreign Office at 6*15 p.ra. on December 14th, 1959*There were present:Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsLord President of the CouncilLord ChancellorSecretary of State for India and BurmaSecretary of state for the ColoniesChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of FoodSecretary of State for Scotland -President of the Board of TradePresident of the Board of SdueationMinister of Health,Minister of Labour and of National ServieeMinister of SupplyMinister of Agriculture and FisheriesMinister of TransportMinister of ShippingMinister of InformationMinister of Economic WarfareSecretary for MinesMr. MalletTHE LEAGUE The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs began by -MEETING, explaining the instructions which he had given to Mr. Butlerfor the League Meeting.   His view had been that the meeting was unfortunate but he had told Mr. Butler that it was essentialso to act that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not appearundecided in their policy.   He was instructed to resist theimposition of sanctions on Russia if this was proposed and to try to get a Resolution condemning Russian aggression whichwould leave everyone free to do what they could.   He was to try to avoid the question of the expulsion of Russia, but if&apos;&apos;-,\        this were raised should vote for it as if we liked its in the\      hope that we should not lose very much with Russia, and would\     gain with Spain, Italy and the &apos; 9*9*A*\ The Lord President remarked that news had now come; that the\ League&apos; had decided to expel Russia.A FINLAND
FINLAND and scandinavia.Lord Halifax said that the evidence regardingHus so-German, collusion in Finland wee contradictory.There had been talk of the Germans withholding supplies for Finland, but the Norwegian Minister for ForeignAffairs had now reported that the Germane were lettingthem through.   There was also a report that Field MarshalGearing was In favour of helping the Finns.   The Finnishmilitary position did not appear to be desperate and our military experts thought that the defence of the isthmuswas more important than the defence of the regions Inthe waist-line of Finland.   The Finnish Minister had said that his country could hold out if they had munitions,but could only last for a month or two if they did not get them.The President ef the Board of Trade asked how muchcourage the Swedes were showing in providing munitionsfor the Finns and Lord Halifax replied that he had reasonto believe that they had been apprehensive at the publicity given to our promise of aeroplanes, but had recently become more courageous.   It was almost impossible.Lord Halifax continued, to say what was likely to happen,but it seemed clearly in our interest to give the Finnsall the help we could.In reply to the Lord-Chancellor9 Lord Halifax gave an account of the extent to which we hCd^eon able to meetthe Finnish requests for armaments..CIBEBY.Lord Halifax then read to the meeting a summary ofthe questions which he had put to the Secretary-Generalof the Turkish Foreign Office on December 8th and of the replies which he had received on the subject of t-M
So(a) Turkey*a attitude in the event of a SovietAttack on Bessarabia;(b) The recent request of the Roumanian Ministerfor an extension of our guarantee to Roumaniato cover an attack by Russia;(c) Roumania&apos;8 attitude in the face of a Russianattack on Bessarabia;(d) Turkey&apos;s attitude if a Russian attack wentbeyond the Danube.In reply to a question from Lord $tanhope as to whetherMo Numan had expressed any views as to what Bulgaria would do in the event of a Russian attack. Lord Halifax said thathis personal view was that Bulgaria would wish at least to try to resist.    Continuing, Lord Halifax aaid that M. Humanhad expressed some interesting views about Italy&apos;s attitude^towards the formation of a Balkan bloc   He had said that turkey would have no objection to Italian association in this work but that it would be a mistake to try and force Italyalong too quickly.Lord Oajdeeote asked the Secretary of State whether hehad any information as to the extent of Russo-Germancollaboration in South East Europe.Lord Halifax Bald that this was one of the greatuncertainties.   No one knew what German-Russian relationsreally were and they might well be different in the balkans and in Scandinavia.    It seemed that Germany had more or leasagreed that Finland was to be In the Russian sphere, thoughthe actual Russian attack had no doubt taken Germany bysurprise.   As regards the Balkans, a joint Russo-German drivewas conceivablet but it was difficult to believe that germany could want to force Italy too fast any more thearwe did or that Russia wanted Germany in Roumania on the Blaek Sea.
the Minister of Health asked whether the Turks were merely trying to get what they could out of us or whetherthey really Intended to fight.   He thought that they might be fearing that they had taken on more than they couldmanage and he could not understand why they should want tocome into the war.Lord, Halifax said that the Turks were anxious not tohave to fight until they were stronger.   His discussions with the Secretary-General about the Suspense Clause had turned on anti-tank guns, of which we had none to spare.We hoped, however, to be able to let the Turks have some which Dr.. Burgin explained - would be from the balance of gunswhieh the French had promised us.   On the whole Lord Halifaxfelt that, even if the Turks had been a little discouragedabout our reception of their demands for armaments, they were unlikely to back out of their engagements to us.    ihat they wanted was to be able adequately to defend, with modernweapons, their short hand frontiers.   Moreover, the FirstLord had told General Orbay that if the Turks were threatened by Russia we should be able to help her with the fleet andthis had undoubtedly encouraged the Turkish Government.The Minister of Transport asked whether the Secretaryof State had any further Information about Germany&apos;s ideasfor the future conduct of the war and Lord Halifax read tothe meeting a recent secret report on this subject?The Secretary of State for Scotland said that it seemed clear that the Germans were anxious to avoid being bombed andLord Halifax agreed that information from various sources ledone to suppose that if war at close quarters were possiblethere might be a new mentality introduced into Germany.The
Tho, Lerd Chancellor said that at a previous meetingthe Prime Minister had said that it was the French attitude which had largely led us to refrain from air attacks on germany and enquired whether this was still the position.Lord Halifax replied that both we and the French were agreed about the important effect which bombing of the Ruhrwould have, but that we were also agreed on the importanceof not drawing down attacks on ourselves until we were on more equal terras.The Minister of Supply remarked that one of the biggestFrench steel works was within gun range of the Luxemburgfrontier.   M. Daqfcry had said that these works were vital to french armaments;   they had not yet been shelled.The Minister of Transport enquired whether theevacuation of the eastern provinces of France was causingill-feeling which reacted on the morale of the French troops;and the Lord Chancellor asked a similar question.Lord Halifax said that he had no information to showthat the evacuation waa having an adverse effect on Frenchmorale.   It wea, however, the intention of the Prime Ministerto discuss shortly with M. Dalediar the question of an anglo-French agreement not to conclude a separate peace.   Wehad felt that the matter waa largely academic, as it was obvious that neither country could conclude peace separately.But there waa something to be said both against as well as forsuch an agreement from the point of view of German propaganda,which might also be embarrassing for the French.   He had therefore merely put the suggestion to the French ambassador and had told him that we did not feel strongly either wayabout it.ItOBWAY.
6.the liln^ater of Agriculture asked whether the Chiefs ofStaff had considered the possibility of our landing a forcein Norway and Lord Halifax replied that we were patting tothe Chiefs of Staff a list of political possibilities onwhich they would advise what we could do.   One possibilitywas that part of Scandinavia slight become a protectorateunder stronger Powers and this, though it would have othergrave disadvantages, might conceivably make it easier for usto deal with the question of the port of Narvik.The Minister of Information said that he was anxiousto counteract German statements comparing the standard ofliving of the German working classes with those in thiscountry and in Prance.   He had ample material for thls* but had been told that it might not be advisable from the pointof view of our relations with France to talk too much about our high standard of living.Lord Halifax suggested that a reference to our standardof comfort might be coupled with assurances of our readiness for any sacrifices;   while the Minister of Labour felt thatit would be useful to take up mis-statements made by Dr. Leyand to prove their inaccuracy.Tha y,lnif^,!arir[o,f, Health asked whether there was anychange in Italy* a attitude since the outbreak of war and theLord Chancellor enquired whether the basis for Sir P.Loralne&apos;8 pre-war prophecy that Italy would remain neutralhad astered.Lord Halifax read to the meeting certain recent reports by Sir P. Loraine which were to the effect that, so far from becoming
becoming hostlie, Italy&apos;a attitude tended to become morefavoumble.     The attitude of signer Mussolini himself was,of course, an enigma, and there might be trouble with Italyabout shipping questions, while if things went badly for us3ignor Mussolini might attempt to come in against us, butpopular opinion, the King and the army were in our favour.The President of the Board of Trade asked whether wewere making it wasy for Italy to be friendly towards us andLord Halifax replied that we were hoping to spend  25*000,000in that country.   He believed that the Italians knew thatthey were unready militarily and financially for war andfelt that they would welcome some years of peace.The President of the Board of Trade asked about Busso-Japanese relationa.Lord Halifax said that he believed that the Buaso-Japaneae talks were principally concerned with minor matters such aa the fisheries question.     There were, of course,Japanese who wanted a sweeping agreement with Huaaia, butneither here nor in the United state did informed opinionbelieve that it waa natural for either Japan or Russia to wishto make the other stronger by removing causes of anxiety.Russian action in Finland and the line recently adopted bythe United States had made Japanese opinion more inclined to look for accommodation with us.   What the Japanese reallywanted waa to liquidate the Chinese epieode.   We hoped toget the Chinese Government to agree to our prpposala aboutsilver,   we.should, no doubt, have trouble with them In thematter but Lord Halifax felt that, as we were not askinganything, vital of them, we could properly press them.
8.Lord Halifax agreed with Mr. Stanley that a Russo-Japanese agreement would wreck the position of Dr. Wangwho was first and foremost an anti-oommuniat.The Minister&apos; of Supply asked whether the Secretaryof State had any information about the position InsideSpain and whether that country*s contacts with germany were still considerable.Lord Halifax thought that there was some reason tobelieve that Spanish harbours were being used against us,but he had seen a report that Germans in Spain were losingground and his general impression, which was confirmed byLord Lloyd&apos;s report of his recent visit to General Franco,was that Spain was pre-ocoupled with her internal affairswhileand that/it might be a long process, the country wouldgradually go our way.Dr., MBur^in, said that he was wondering whether more could not be done by way of getting minerals from Spain toFrance by land or short sea haul.     He said the French didnot appear to be making very much headway in Spain, butthe President of the Board of Trade remarked that our trade negotiations with that country now seemed to be going better.
