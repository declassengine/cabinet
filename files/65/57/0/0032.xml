18th March 1940.SECRET;My dear Edward,I enclose for your records acopy of the minutes of the Meeting ofMinisters held on Thursday last.Yours sincerely,Sir Edward Bridges, K.C.B., M.C.
A Heating of Ministers wee held at 10, downing street at 5*30 p.uu on Thursday, 14th March, 1940.There were presentsPrime Minister (in the Chair)Lord  resident of the CouncilSecretary *f State for the ColoniesMinister of poodseeretary of state for ScotlandPresident of the Board of SduoationSinister of HealthMinister of labour minister of AgricultureMinister of shippingMinister of InformationMinister of -Eeonoraie bartersSeeretary for Mines.$he PRIME MINISTER said that he thought ministers would wish to have a summary of resent events In Finland.It had teen a greet disappointment that the oollapse ofthe Finns had some so suddenly and had been so eoejpletetAlthough m knew that the effect of Russian bombing of civilians in Finland had injured morals, we had hoped thatthe Unas would be able- to hold out longer.,    theu*however, it was learned that the Finns were sending a delegation to Moscow we had feared that they were con-contemplating giving in, and the terms whioh they had evsntse^ly eeoepted were very onerous.    When pease had been madeeveryone else started, as was to be sheeted, to &quot;throwrend&quot;.    Beutral countries had shewn a strong disposition to suggest that that had happened was all our fault.    Itwas, therefore, right that we sheeld ask ourselves whether-we had in feet dene ell that we oould do.    He would giwe IMinietews a brief reeums of what we had dene, and hethat we-had- nothing with wbieh
The B&amp;processes-finmlsh war began on loyembsr 30th*    Bsferethe was? started the. Finns feat/been asking us to ssgsftfttdelivery of war material which they had ordered In&apos; thiscountry.    At that time, we had heavy demands to moot both for our own needs and for those of our Allies and othercountries?    it was quite impossible to satisfy all thosedemands, but we did our best to settle reasonable priorities and to give ell the help we eeuld to the Finns.    By January17th we had sent 10 Blenheims to Finland.    At this early stage the Finnish Government were asking for fighter-aircraft and not for men.    Accordingly, on February 8th,we sent 84 gladiators.    Subsequently bombers were needed and on February 83rd, 18 Blenheims were sent.    these aircraft were not provided without a protest from the AirMinistry. Who were naturally alarmed at the prospect of weakening our own position.     In February much other warmaterial was sent to Finland, including 12 ant1-aireraftguns plus ammunition, 100 anti-tank rifles plus ammunition,100 machine guns plus ammunition, 40,000 hand-grenades and10,000 anti-tank mines. &apos; The Finnish. Sovernmemt then saidthat their chief need was for field artilleryj   accordingly,about the middle of February we sent 85 howitzers with1,000 rounds of ammunition for each, and 30 eighteen-pounder field guns with 1,000 rounds of ammunition per gumThe transport of all this material was, of course, difficult,and the guns did not reach Finland until the beginning ofMarch.    The Finns then asked for more and better fighters *It was very difficult for us to spare any fighters as wehad ourselves only a percentage of the numbers we required.However, we sent them 10 Hurricanes *    They asked also for s,A*A*    We sent weekly shipments, and by March 1st theyhad had 3,000,ooo rounds.The * * *
The question of men was first raised as early as aauary.    At that period the Finnish  overatnent anticipatedthat they would he able to hold their lines until the thawearns, hut they were alarmed about the position In which theywould be plassd after the thaw.    Accordingly, they asked us to prepare to send them 30,000 most in May.    arrangements were made to open a Bureau for the recruitment of volunteers,but it was soon obvious that this would not lead to a varyeffective foroo, and we deei&amp;ed that the problem moat betaekled in a more businesslike way*    A plan was prepared and disoassed at a meeting of the Supreme Ihr Council heldon February Sth, and it was agreed that preparations shouldbe made to provide the largest fores which could be transported to Finland.     Shis force would have to proceedvia larvik and Trond^hejm, but as there is only one limefrom tfcese places to Finland, Its size had to be limited*Moreover, we had to guard against a German attack upon our communications.    It was, therefore, arranged that theAllied troops would confine their operations to thenorthern part of Finland.fhe possibility of basing a force on Fetsamo and soavoiding passage through Norway and Sweden was examined, butit was quite olear that sueh a plan would not be practicable.The question of fighting our way through Horway and sweden was also examined.    Bat it was agreed that this aleswould be impracticable because the railway from Barvik isan electric railway* easy to sabotage and, owing to thegeography of the country, easy to block.    She use of therailway would he essential as there was no road from .*a*tt fcacross the aeuntelns*It
It thus appeared that the success of our plans would depend upon the assent of lerway and Sweden and consideration was given to the best moans of securing their assent.    Itwas agreed that the Finns should he asked at the appropriate time to make a public appeal for help.     $hen that appeal wasreceived, the Allies would seek the consent of Horway and sweden to the passage of troops.    At the time when the plans were being examined by the Supreme War Council, it was thought that Norway and Sweden would be unable to resistsuch a request.     It was recognised, however, that Swedenwould be afraid that if she gave her consents Germany woulddeclare war upon her.    Accordingly, we thought it necessaryto provide help for Sweden against Germany, and our plansincluded the provision of a force to assist the Swedes tohold a line across southern Sweden against a German invasion.The force to be made available for all these operationswas the largest force which we thought it was physicallypossible to send to Scandinavia.     It totalled about100,000 men. including troops for communication lines.Of this total the French were to provide about 16*000 men.On February  5th there was evidence that the finnish government were becoming anxious about their position.     Wetherefore instructed our local representatives to inform them of the plan.     She Finnish Government consulted theSwedish Government, and the result was a flat refusal toallow the passage of troops.    Accordingly it was suggestedthat the appeal for help should be made without delay andthe Swedish reaction definitely tested.    Heavy pressurewas, however, put upon Finland by Sweden, and it becamedoubtful wbather the Finns would make an appeal.    Shisplaced us in a most embarrassing position as troops whichwere ...
were to hava gone to ^ranee had tees stopped, and  onerous other preparations were in train.    We, therefore,asked the Finns to decide at onoe whether or not to make their appeal.    They requested permission to postpone adecision until March l th.    Then they said that they did not want an expedition hut 100 homhers and erews to enablethem to attaek the excellent ground tsrgste offered bythe Butsslams.    The Air Ministry took the view that froma military point of view w%were not justified in sendingfarther aircraft to Finland.    We were, however, influenced by the pathetic position of the old Field-Mar aha! whodeclared that he could not continue the struggle withoutmore aircraft, and the Chiefs of Staff were invited toexamine the problem *     They said that if 50 bombers wouldenable the Finns to hold out until our expat it leu could reach them then the despatch of these bombers would bejustified.    But, by this time,no one really believed that norway and Sweden would let an expedition through.Accordingly, it was decided to tell the Finns that we wouldwatt until March 18th.    If they then appealed for help wewould send at onoe 50 bombers with crews, but in the absenceof an appeal we would not send so large a force.    We did,however, undertake to send 8 immediately., though peace had,in fast been -made before they could be deepstehed and so- - - ...they were net sentIt would be seen from this summary that we had dene allthat we could to help the Finns at great expense to our-selves and that we had nothing to repreaeh ourselves with.

Therewas no doubt that Sweden had been oonatattly warned by germany of the consequences which would follow if she allowed allied troops te&apos; pass.    The dseisioa&quot;which she had to take &apos;sms difficult-;iand it was Germany&apos;who had made it difficult.    Germany was indeed the cause of the trouble.    If it had not been for germany Finland would never have been invaded at all..After all that had happened Morway and Sweden would.hein a mood to resent bitterly outside reproaches.    Our coursetherefore was to refrain from reproaches and to try and improve our position with the Scandinavian countries.    We couldreceive jaush help from Norway both in ships and ores.    It wouldbe greatly to our advantage to have a friendly Sweden.

the visit of Mr. Sumner Welles. Mr. Welles was very reserved, but the better one knew him the more one liked him. His (the Prime Minister&apos;s) impression was that he had liked him more than any American he had met in recent years. He appeared to be completely straight and to be approaching his task in much the same spirit that we ourselves would approach it had it been our task. It was evident that Mr. Welles had not been impressed in Berlin. In Italy he had had a long conversation with Mussolini and Mussolini&apos;s attitude had appeared to be that the war was likely to become very unpleasant quite soon; that he (Mussolini) believed that the Germans would win it; that the war would impose heavy losses and injure civilisation; that Mr. Welles had, therefore, done right to visit Italy first because Mussolini could give him good advice; that Hitler was after all really a very nice person and would go a long way to meet the other side; that he was prepared to set up an independent Poland and Bohemia and Moravia, and ready to discuss disarmament, but that he must have guarantees against malefactors such as Mr. Winston Churchill.

In Berlin the attitude adopted was that of poor old England.

In this country Mr. Welles had had contact with many different people and had received very varied views. As a result of his journey it seemed clear that he had not been impressed by the German and Italian attitude, but that nevertheless he thought that something might be done, and that when he returned to America President Roosevelt would have to take some steps. We ourselves had explained our position very frankly to Mr. Welles and had made him understand that we could never accept peace until it had been made clear that the Hitler policy had failed.
