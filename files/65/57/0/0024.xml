As requested I enclose -for your records,a copy of a note of theFirst Lord&apos;s meeting with Ministersyesterday afternoon.       tYours sincerely,W.D. Wilkinson, Esq., D.S.O., M.C.
Notes of the First Lord*s Meeting of ministers at 5.59 p.m. on July 15th.The First Lord said that he presumed hi^^ colleagues would not wish him to repeat details ^ich they would already have obtained from circulated papers, thepress, Or broadcaststatements.   Instead he proposed to give them in strict confidence information with which most of them would probably not be familiar.The First Lord described the various measures to counter invasion in which the Navy had been concerned:-(a) Coast Guard. The coast-guard had been&apos; t? -  over from the Board of Trade, doubled in strength, and armed, so thatthe maximum patrol beat between posts was now only I an hour.(b) Naval Assistance in Fixed Defences.   The Navy had greatly assisted in strengthening fixed defences outside the recognised defended ports.   In the last 7 weeks 1^0 Naval gunshad been installed in fixed mountings, most of them alreadyprotected against air attack, to cover the beaches.   In addition7,000 to 8,000 Naval ratings and Royal Marines had been lent toman these guns until the Army could provide trained guns crews.The First Lord also mentioned the mounting of torpedo tubes;atViarious points on the shore, and the prbgress in thf IhStallatiohof mine loops in the; estuariea.   Aehart was^the great; strides which had been mfde^      t&amp;e,;j^rj i.^pointed out that although the cover was still a good 4eslthinner on tl^e south-west and west Coasts, similar defences is
: i:e^.^iau^lia^-r^t^o2:s.     As a result of the lessons learned at Ihahkirk, very large numbers of small craft have vbeleh taken up and allocated into groups inorder to provide close antirinvasion patrols.   Of thesepossibly 8tK3 would have sufficient armament. to enablethem to. be used fof the interception of craft attemptingtp land troops.(d) Naval Forces available in Home Waters.Capital Ships.   Thanks to the timely completion of therepairs to the KELS01J and BAJRHAM, we had been able todetach a strong capital ship force to deal with the french fleet, while keeping 5 strong capital ships at home.   Thefirst Of the new Capital Ships would hardly be ready for effective service before the end of October.   There was ofcourse the &quot;danger&quot;-&quot;that the BISMABK was &quot;already fit for service, but there was no evidence as yet from reconnaissancethat she had been at sea.Cruisers.      The demands of the various ocean troop convoys and other special convoys had sorely taxed our strength incruisers.   Ie how had, however, 15 cruisers available in home waters &apos; s^ wiibin:r;i^e&apos; next: few: weeks 2 new ones of the DUX)Class would be added.   0^ the French ;. Ships., a number of thesmaller ships including one Contre-Torpilleur, had alreadyteen commissioned        British crews; others would be mannectwith French crews when ^e personnel were ready.  The two Jdld

The ships had stocks ofammunition on boardjand the organisation of replacementsupplies was being investigated.Gbrvettes. These were coming along well, 19being already in commission while the programme provided for 6*0 by the endof the year. The First Lord lioped that thejr would be coming in at a rate of 2 to 2  per week before long. He emphasised that their characteristics, which he described, made them verysuitable for escort work.Destroyers.    Partly on account of the omission of destroyersfrom the 1938 programme, we had been faced with very serious difficulties, when, as a result of the Dunkirk and otherevacuations, abnormally high casualties were suffered.   A fewweeks ago there were as many as JO destroyers in dock, butthis number had now been reduced to 28 or ^D, and our worstdifficulties seemed to be passing.   At the moment there were50 destroyers available in home waters, though they had many different tasks to perform.Submarines.    The First Lord referred to the relatively heavysubmarine losses in the last few WSeks, but these were merethan balanced by various une^ected -and&quot; -i0y&apos;ln&amp;c(ii&amp;-replejnishmehts; firstly, the Polish subaarines, and then theButch, several of which were already oh duty, and finallythe French, of which 9 had cOrae under pur control.   He hopedthat we should complete the construction of12 new subaarihes
by the en4 of the year.   In passing the First Lord &apos;mentioned the value of submarines for reconnaissancepurposes, especially as&quot; a check on aircraft&apos; reports.(e)   German Torpedo Boats.    The First Lord said thatthese were a source of some anxiety.   Like other shallowJira $ vessels they might, en joy a high degree of immunity fromminefields at certain states of the water.   We knew germany was producing them in numbers and she might at the momentpossess anything from 5P tp 100.   In the view, of the naval staff, destroyers would not be of great use against thesecraft, and owing to a recent change of front on the part ofthe United States, we should now be deprived of 20 M.T.Bs.which a few weeks ago we had hoped to obtain the near future.% taken of the, .;very great increase in-the numbers of small eraft which.mightused, a^ftli^^ejo^^^^, ,..gnd jfehe ^^%j0^dje^^r^jp&amp;particular to .the FairmiXe motor launches, with their 3-rpdj?gun.   Of these craft, 8 were already in commission, 10 wereejected, to complete .thi!S/.-month;, and thereafter deliveryshouM-be. at the/jrate of     a month.,- -(f) iMining in home waters.    The First Lord referredto the- re-siiting-of the %rtb.ern Barrage and stated, that a,,trial lay on the hew line; had already been made.   After thatit was proposed to strengthen the east Coast barrage at the:%northern end.  Later, wh^ the nights /were longer^ the
Already however the more dangerous points in this area were being strengthened and Dutch and British minelayers had already completed one particularly hazardous operation in the Channel.

MEDITERRANEAN.

In response to a number of questions, the First Lord also reviewed the position in the Mediterranean. The main points of the review were as follows:-

(i)On the first sweep made by the Mediterranean Fleet, the Italians had virtually no Warships out nor were our ships attacked from the air.

(ii) The primary object of the sweep which had led to the recent brush with the Italian Fleet had been an attack on an Italian Naval base. The second object was to cover a fast and a slow convoy from Malta to Alexandria : this object had already been achieved. The First Lord described the encounter with the Italian Fleet in some detail and explained that the Naval Base was not attacked because the Italian Fleet had left it.(iii) The First Lord described the heavy air attack to which the Mediterranean Fleet had been subjected on this occasion, and emphasised that it would be most dangerous to underrate the Skill, determination and materiel of the Italian Air Force. So far we had been very fortunate, but the bombing experienced showed how essential was the adequate air protection of the Fleet. This problem was being examined.

(iv) The defection of France made it much more important for us to use Maltas as a Fleet base. The length of the sortie from Alexandria made it very difficult to cut Italian communications from Libya. The possibility of strenghthening the air defences of
of Slalta, where a&quot; handful pi^ pilots had performed wonders,was also &quot;being considered.(v) The First Lbr&amp; also referred to the new contraband control problems created by the loss of French co-operation,and mentioned that in order to keep italy s trade with the black sea and the Dodecanese down to the minimum very drasticmethods might be needed.   In his opinion much better air coverwould be required for the Fleet before any direct operations against the Dodecanese could be undertaken.
