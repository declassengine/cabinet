I enclose a note ofthe discussion at the recent meeting of Ministers which youwill like to add to the set.Yours sincerely,Sir jstiv/ard Bridges, K.C.B. , M.O.,Offices of trie War Qp.oi.xiet.15th January,  1940.Dear Edward,
The Prime Minister presided at a Meetingof Ministers held at No. 10, Downing Street, at 5.30 p.m.on Thursday, January 11th, 1940.There were presentThe Rt. Hon. The Earl StanhopeThe Rt. Hon. Viscount OaldecoteThe Most Hon. The Marquess of ZetlandThe Rt. Hon. Malcolm MacDonaldThe Rt. Hon. W.S. MorrisonThe Rt. Hon. John GolvilleSir Andrew DuncanThe Rt. Hon. Earl De La WarrThe Rt. Hon. Walter ElliotThe Rt. Hon. Leslie BurginThe Rt. Hon. Sir Reginald Dorman-SmithThe Rt. Hon. Sir John GilmourSir John ReithMr. Ronald CrossMr. Geoffrey Llqyd.The Prime Minister said that before beginninghis main observations it would perhaps be useful for himto say a few words about the recent changes in theGovernment.     He did not think he need say much aboutthe changes at the Board of Trade and the Ministry ofInformation.     The new President and Minister werepresent, and all that it was necessary for him to dowas to welcome them most warmly to their new offices.The ....
The Ministers might like, however, to hear something from him about the change at the War Office.     He thought noone would deny that it was the duty of the Prime Ministerto make any changes in the Government which he might consider necessary.     Unfortunately, as the Press hadnot had anything else to talk about, they had sought tomake a sensation out of the retirement of Mr. Hore-Belisha.For this purpose many fanciful suggestions had been made,as, for instance, that the retirement of Mr. Hore-Belishawas due to the fact that the Military had put pressure upon the Prime Minister or to a disagreement uponquestions of Army policy, such, for example, as theso-called democrat!sation of the Army.     There was nofoundation for rumours of this kind.     There had been no pressure or even suggestions from the Military thatthere should be a change at the War Office.      It wasnonsense to say that there was any disagreement on policy.In fact the reforms made in the Army had been suggestedby the soldiers themselves.     More than this he thoughtit was unnecessary for him to say in advance of the debate, which was to take place the following week.The war position still remained fluid.Evidence of a more or less reliable character continuedto give the impression that there were divided counselsin Germany.     The position on the Vtfestern Front seemedto be such as to offer to the Germans no prospect of a decisive victory there.      But every weekfsinactivity enabled us to strengthen our position.    Itmust, therefore, be expected that Germany would desiresome action.     This might take the form of an attemptto turn the Maginot Line by an attack on the low countries.     We now knew that this had in fact been intended in November but that the orders for it werecountermanded .
countermanded at the last moment.   There was reason tobelieve that the explanation of this change of plan wasthat Belgium had said that if Germany attacked Holland,Belgium would fight, and that this had induced the generals to hold hack.     We knew that the proposal had been discussed again on subsequent occasions andthat there had been a critical period in December.We were now told that the attack might come a littlelater.     We had also received reports which suggestedthat there might be a risk of a Scandinavian adventure.The Germans were said to be providing ships and troopaeroplanes and practising parachute descents whichmight have as their object an attack on Scandinavia.In any case, it was clear that Germany had one great interest in Scandinavia, namely, the Swedish Iron-orefields.      It was therefore unlikely that Germany wouldattack Sweden unless she could get a firm hold on hermines, and there was always the possibility that theRussians would forestall her.     Thus, the position wasin doubt, and it might be that the preparations which germany appeared to be making were only a demonstration.Yet another possibility was that Germany would attack the Balkans, and we were constantly receiving storiesof a Russo-German alliance for that object.     His ownbelief was that all these stories came from a Germansource and that their object was to keep the Neutralsin a &quot;dither&quot; in the hope that they would be toofrightened to give any help to us.The Finnish war had already greatly changed the attitude of the world towards Russia.     Before sheinvaded Finland, she had been able to preserve the myththat she was a powerful military nation.     But thefighting
fighting that had taken place had already disclosedher as a Colossus with feet of clay.     This had hada resounding effect throughout the world which had been favourable to us.      Those in Germany who did not likefor what purpose they had been dragged into friendship with Russia.     Moreover, so long as Russia was asupposedly formidable foe, Germany might well havehoped to induce Sweden to seek her assistance toprotect their mines against Russia, but Sweden wasnot now so frightened of Russia as she had been.Again, the Balkan States were now alarmed, and italy was beginning to take a more positive line.     The-recent Italo-Hungarian talks seemed to be very satisfactory from our point of view.     Thus, theprospects in the Balkans seemed better, for the extensionof the war to the Balkans did not offer to us an attractiveprospect, as it would involve increased demands on our shipping.     In Spain,  the effect of the Russian fiascohad been favourable.     Internal conditions in thatcountry were bad, the economic situation was serious -there was even starvation.     But the proved weakness ofRussia might help to prevent trouble.     In India alsothe disclosure of Russian weakness had been a help.Nevertheless, while the Finns had done wonders, wemust not be too optimistic.     Compared with Russiathey had a tiny population.     The best way of avoiding the overrunning of Finland by Russia was for us to give to the Finns all the assistance we could.     We were a&amp;sk giving substantial material assistance, and thethe pro-Russian policy must now be asking themselves0question of volunteers was now being examined.Nevertheless, it would seem that our official lineought ...
ought to be one of non-intervention, as it would notassist us or the Finns for the Soviet to declare war or if we were to quarrel with Norway and Sweden.     Atthe same time, the longer the Finns could keep Russiabusy the better, as the Finnish war meant that theRussians were rapidly using up material.     It was satisfactory that the Finnish Labour Party had askedLabour interests in this country to send a?deputation and that this&apos; invitation had been accepted.We were about to publish a Blue Book givingthe history of our negotiations with Russia.     We had deliberately-refrained from making the story &quot;too hot&quot;,but the Blue Book would show clearly that Russia hadwanted all through to invade the Balteaw States.     TMeay we might he very glad that we had not allowed ourselves to be involved.The Prime Minister then referred to hisMansion House speech.     He said that he had thoughtit desirable to warn the country that they must takethe war more seriously.     He believed the danger of inflation to be very great.      It would no doubt beimpossible to avoid some increase in wages, but itmust &amp;te*s) be realised that some lowering of the standards of living would also be necessary.     He believed that many of the Labour leaders were themselves afraid of inflation and realised the risks of creating a viciousspiral.     Unfortunately, Mr. Bevin was taking the otherview and had already distorted and denounced the MansionHouse speech.     Nevertheless, he did not believe thatMr. Bevin would achieve much, and he had no doubt thathe had been right to give a lead which he thought other ministers
Ministers might like to follow in their speeches.     Thebest way to impress ideas was steady repetition.-The Lord Chancellor asked whether it was thought likely that Finland would be able to repel oreven defeat.Russia.     If it was considered that russia was bound to win, then the more help we gave to Finlandthe greater would be our loss of prestige.     On theother hand, it might be thought that unless we were determined to do nothing to enlarge the war, Swedenmight be a better alternative to the Balkans.      ThePrime Minister said that the question whether Finlandcould hold up the Russians or even defeat the Russianswas not only a military question but also a politicalone.     All he could say was that the longer the Finnscould hold out the better would be their chance of enforcing a satisfactory peace.     While he naturallyshrank from deliberately bringing anyone else into thewar, he thought that the entry into the war of the scandinavian countries might n&amp;lii&amp;*4M6*t&amp;&amp;&amp;8 be an advantage to us.Lord Stanhope asked whether there had been any further move in the contemplated action againstNorwegian waters.     The Prime Minister said that thematter had been further considered.      By itself actionagainst the territorial waters of Norway would not be worth the risks involved, but if it were regarded as a preliminary to a general stoppage of Swedish ore supplies,it might be worth while.     He thought the matter largelydepended upon the attitude of Sweden, which was now beingexplored.Lord Stanhope asked what action Germany was likely to take.     The Prime Minister said that he djld
not think Germany would be likely to attack Norway oreven invade Sweden.     They were more likely, in his view,to threaten Sweden.The Minister of Health asked the Prime Ministerwhat his impression was of the present attitude of the left Wing in this country towards co-operation with theGovernment.     The Prime Minister said that he did notthink there had been much change in Left Wing opinion,nor did he consider that there was any ground for anxiety.     He had had several talks recently withMr. Attlee, and had found him more friendly and forth-coming than on previous occasions.     Nevertheless, therewas obviously no real truce with Labour.      Sir WalterCitrine had made some unfortunate speeches, but he hadbeen very helpful in the speech which he had maderecently in France.     Much would,  of course, depend upon future events.     He did not believe in a longcontinuation of the present stalemate.      If, however,this &quot;war of nerves&quot; did continue, no doubt the politicalsituation might become difficult.      There were, however,many ways in which the present state of affairs mightbe altered, e.g. an attack by Germany on the western front, an air attack on this country, which he did notconsider very probable, a coup d&apos;etat in Germany, anattack on the Balkans, or an attack on Scandinavia.Mr. MacDonald asked whether there was any evidence of an expansion of German control over Russia.The Prime Minister said that it was notoriously verydifficult to get any information out of Russia.     he believed, however, that the Russians were keeping theGermans at bay.Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd said that he had recently had a conversation with Monsieur de Monzie, who was incibse touch with Russia.     M. de Monzie thought thatGoering&apos;s ...
Goering&apos;s recent appointment meant that an attempt wasto be made by Germany to get her hands on Russia.     Therewere reports of trouble in Russian factories, and it mightbe that Stalin was now ready to fall more freely into german arms.     The Prime Minister said that this mightbe so.     There was no doubt that if Russia wanted help from Germany, Germany would see that she received herprice.     He thought, however, that even if Germantechnicians did go to the aid of Russia, it would bea long time before their aid would be effective.Lord Stanhope said that Sir Edward Mellanbyhad been making some experiments to see whether theGerman rations were adequate for the maintenance ofhealth.      These experiments showed that they were, andthat the Germans had learned a good deal about foodvalues since the last war.     Moreover, their vitalstatistics seemed to be satisfactory.     The PrimeMinister said that we did not really desire to defeatGermany by starving her people.      The purpose of theblockade was to bring about a shortage of war materialsrather than a shortage of food.Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd spoke of the difficultyof determining the oil position in Germany.     The french had had a very different picture of this ^^Msfsm^&amp;M^s, ^1**and 1si5^ were hoping now to arrive, in discussion withthem, at an accurate figure.The Secretary of State for Scotland askedwhether the Prime Minister could give any indication of the position in Japan,     The Prime Minister saidthat he thought the position was very fluid.     TheJapanese Government appeared to be about to fall.     Itwas unlikely to be replaced by a Government more favourable to us - indeed the reverse of this was possible.     He was
not, however, much afraid of a Russo-Japanese pact onthe Russo-German model.     It was also satisfactory thatUPat ibesw&amp;t the Americans had stiffened their attitude.The Ministers present expressed to thePrime Minister their warm thanks for g*9**?*g timeto the meeting.     The Prims Minister indicated that lord Halifax would preside over the next meeting, whichwould be held at the Foreign Office at 6 p.m. on Thursday,January 18th.
