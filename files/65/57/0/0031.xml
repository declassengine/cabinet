8th April,  1940.Dear Bfl rii e,I enclose a record of the Meetingof Ministers over which, the Prime Ministerpresided, which was held here on the 4th April.Will you arrange for it to be circulated tothose concerned?Yours sincerely,R.M.J. Harris, Esq.,Offices of the War Cabinet.
The Prime Minister presided over a Meetingof Ministers; held at No. 10, Downing Street, onThursday, the 4th April, 1940were presents-The Prime Minister (in the chair)The Lord President of the council the Lord chancellor the Secretary of State for india the Secretary of State for the ColonieszThe Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Secretary of State for scotland the President of the Board of trade the President of the Board of education the Minister of health the Minister of supply the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the Minister of transport the Minister of PoodThe Minister of shipping the Minister of Information!The Secretary for Mines.
The Prime Minister said that since the last meetingof Ministers there had been a number of changes in theGovernment.     He wished to welcome to the Governmentthe new Ministers who were present.     He had been, verysorry to lose the services of Lord Chatfield but ithad become clear that the functions of a Minister forthe Co-ordination of Defence were peace time functionsrather than war time.     Matters which in peace time were appropriate for the consideration of a Ministerfor the Co-ordination of Defence had in war time tobe decided by the Cabinet as a whole.     He had there-fore felt that he would not be justified in askingLord Chatfield to remain in office.     In the confidentialatmosphere of a meeting of Ministers he was entitledto say, as he could not properly say in public, thatthe change in Sir Kingsley Wood&apos;s office had been madeat Sir Kingsley&apos;s own request.     The work at the AirMinistry had been very heavy and he had been feelingthe strain of it, so it was obviously no longer rightto keep him in that Department.     Sir Samuel Hoare,in taking his place, would be returning to an office which he Knew well.     They would all welcome theappointment of Lord Woolton to a post which none ofhis colleagues would envyJ     Certain Ministers had,in the process of the re-arrangement of the Government,accepted offices of less importance than those whichthey had previously held.     He was extremely grateful to them for the help they had given him in accepting
so willingly the changes made and he trusted that theywould not feel that these changes implied any reflectionupon their work.     Certainly he himself had had no suchthought in his mind.Ministers might he interested to know that before deciding upon the changes in the Government he had asked the Leader of the Opposition whether the Oppositionstill held the view that they did not wish to join theGovernment.     Mr. Attlee had told him that this was a subject on which there was not a unanimous view in theLabour Party, and unless the Party was substantiallyunited on the matter, it was evident that no-one could accept office.     In these circumstances, he, the PrimeMinister had not made any formal approach to theOpposition and he thought that it was unlikely that hewould do so unless the situation became so serious as tomake everyone feel that they would wish to come intothe Government unconditionally.Despite the fact that the Opposition did not wishto joinv.the Government, the Prime Minister thought therehad been a distinct improvement in the relationship between the Government and the Opposition in the last three or four weeks.     This had shown itself in thefact that it is now almost cert aim that it will be possibleto arrange a series of meetings which would be attended by all three Parties.     The intention was that at eachmeeting there should be one principal speaker and thatthe votes of thanks should be moved by speakers belongingto one of the other two Parties.     He could not yet say..... definitely
definitely that this scheme would he supported by theLahour Party hut there was every reason to believe thatit would.Ministers would wish to have some account of theSupreme War Council meeting.     This was the firstmeeting attended by M. Paul Reynaud.     M. daladier had been very well known to all the members of theCabinet:     Reynaud had been less well known to someof them.     Before the meeting was held there had been some indication that Reynaud, having taken officeunder the flag of a more vigorous prosecution of thewar, might urge on the British Government imprudentor inopportune projects.     A communication had in fact been made to us before the meeting which had confirmedsuch expectations.     In this memorandum proposals had been advocated for attacks upon main sources of enemy supplies of&apos; iron ore and oil.     The proposals relating I Swedish iron ore did not seem to presenttoo serious difficulties^but the action contemplated in Soutfe-East Europe had seemed to be action which itwould not be wise to take without full considerationof all that was involved.     Me Reynaud had said that war with Russia would be immensely popular in Prancebut he, the Prime Minister, had replied that it wouldnot &quot;be so popular in this country.     The general attitude of the Cabinet had been that we had alreadysufficient on our plate and that it would not be wise to take on much more.       We had therefore been a littledoubtful how we ^ould get on at the meeting of the..... Supreme
Supreme War Council.     In fact the proceedings had gonevery smoothly.At the meeting an operation known as R.M.O. had &quot;beendiscussed.     He could give no particulars of this operation, beyond saying that it was directed againstGermany and was not of a character which would belikely to raise difficulties with neutrals.     It was an operation which had been planned over here and discussed with France^but we had failed to secure their approval and we had hoped that the change ofgovernment in Prance might lead to better results.M. Reynaud said at the meeting of the Council thathe himself was in favour of this operation, hut that before Prance could agree to it, he must discuss it with his War Cabinet.     He thought, however, thatif the British Government were prepared to show signs ofvigour in Scandinavia, he would he able to secure agreement to R.M.O.As regards South-East Europe the War Councilagreed that there was nothing we could do to stop the overrunning of Roumania if the Germans undertooksuch a project.     At the same time, the invasion of roumania by Germany would be likely to result in thedestruction of the oil field and it was thereforeprobable that the Germans would seek to get what they wanted by economic pressure rather than by militaryactionu     In fact the French were more interestedin the project of an attack upon Baku.     It was clear,however, that they had underestimated the difficulties.
If 1Baku could only be attacked by air and the best basefrom which to launch an air attack was Iran.     TheIran Government was not, however, Very reliableand we should therefore prefer some other base.If Iraq or French Syria were used, it would be necessaryto fly over Turkey.     The French said that the Turks would not object but our information was that theywould object and object strongly, especially if we did not ask them first.      In view of these difficultiesit was agreed at the War Council that no immediate action should be taken but that a Joint study of theproblem should be immediately begun.     The PrimeMinister said that his own view was that we were unlikely to undertake this operation unless Russiaattacked us.     It would require air forces which webadly needed in this country and might well lead toretaliation which a night cause embarrassment.When the French delegates returned to Paris afterthe meeting, the Councilfs opposition to RoM.0. wasnot withdrawn but strongly maintained by M. Daladierwho feared an attack on French aircraft factories andthe French air forces.   There was undoubtedly some reason to think that the matter was complicated by therivalry between M. Daladier and M. Reynaud.     It wastherefore agreed that the First Lord should go over to paris and see whether he could persueLde the French toaccept the project.     The Prime Minister feared, however,that he was not very likely to be successful.     He verymuch regretted that this should be so because he hadrelied upon ReM.Oe to help us to put into operation
our other project In Scandinavian waters.     nevertheless he thought we should go on with this other project in any event.     It was true that it was now ratherlate to obtain the full advantage from this.     Neverthe-less, if we did nothing at all, there would undoubtedly bea feeling that our deeds did not equal Our words andit was important not to leave out of account the psychological effect of taking some action.     the scandinavian project would also &quot;be of value when thetime came to lay a Worth Sea barrage.The position of the new French Government wasnot as yet secure.     The attitude of the Radicalswas still very dubious and M. Bonnet had recentlyviolently attacked M. Reynaud.     *t was quite possiblethat the Government would not survive the debateswhich were to take place during the coming week.Although we had been inclined to prefer M. Daladierto M. Reynaud, nevertheless we should be sorry if theReynaud Government were now overturned, as constantchanges made negotiations difficult.In Japan Sir Robert Oraigie had been doing wonderfulwork and had shown extraordinary skill, patience andtact in dealing with a Government who was unable tocontrol its own army and navy.     Unfortunately the wording he had used in a recent speech had not been quite so happy as usual and this had led to some difficulty.     It was also unfortunate that When wehad wished to take a strong line with the Japanese,the Americans had pursued the opposite tack and now thatwe were seeking some solution, America was becomingstiffer.     We hoped, however, to be successful in pursuing a middle course and to improve gradually ourrelations
our relations with Japan without quarrelling with theU a 3 o AoIn Italy it was clear that Mussolini was nowdefinitely pro-German and that we owed to him many ofour difficulties.     We had been on the edge of securing a good agreement with Italy when Mussolini hadintervened and destroyed our hopes.     The Prime ministers aid that he was nevertheless convinced that Mussolinicould not bring Italy into the war against us:   hewould have the King, the Church, the army and thepeople all against him and there was a considerablevolume of evidence that if he sought to join Germany,he would be overthrown.     The Prime Minister wasnot therefore afraid of war but there was no doubtthat Mussolini could make things uncomfortable for us and it was regrettable that he had failed to show anyresponse to our efforts to friendliness.     The positionof Count Ciano was in some doubt.     It had beenreported that Mussolini was thinking of sending himaway but the last news suggested that his position was more assured.     The time might come when we shouldhave to speak more firmly to Italy and make it clear toher that she could not continue indefinitely to sit on the fence but before we could contemplate any action of that kind we must know where we stood with theFrench Government.Ministers would have seen that arrangements arebeing made for the visit to this country of our representatives in the Balkan states and Sir percy loraine would be here at the same time.     A good deal
of publicity was being given to these visits and thatwas perhaps just as well.     Nevertheless it was notat present contemplated that we should discuss withthem, any definite plans.     The intention was merely to consider the whole situation in South-East europe and it was of course possible that some plan mightevolve from the discussion.     It was obviously likely that Germany would seek: shortly to increase her economic pressure on the South East European states and we had thought that it would be helpful to have the opinionof our representatives in those states on the reactionsthat were likely to any such move on the part of Germany.Lord Stanhope asked whether we could do anything to stop the Adriatic trade in bauxite.     The PrimeMinister said that this trade was not of first class importance and that we could not stop it because theships carrying bauxite could keep within territorial waters.Captain Euan Wallace asked whether, if M. Reynaudwere overthrown, M. Daladier would return to thePremiership.     The Prime Minister thought that this was doubtful.     The time was not yet ripe for M. Daladier&apos; return.     It was possible that M. Herriot or M. Chautenrpsmight form a government.Sir Reginald Dorman Smith asked whether theJapanese were likely to object to our interfering with trade to Vladivostock.     The Prime Minister said thatwe believed that the Japanese would only resent suchaction on our part if we were to stop ships in close proximity to Japan.
Lord Caldecote asked whether we had any authenticinformation ahout internal conditions in Germany.The Prime Minister said that it was difficult to saythat we had authentic information.     We received manyreports, a large number of which were encouragingthough there were some of the other kind.     In hisown view, things were becoming increasingly bad inGermany.     In particular we had received reports of trouble in Hamburg.Mr. Colville asked whether Holland had shown signsof being more prepared to play with us.     The PrimeMinister said that they had not but that it was clearthat if they were invaded they would want our help.Mr. Walter Elliott asked if there were any freshindications of a German move in the west.     The PrimeMinister said that the German forces were all ready foran attack, but the last information he had receivedwas; that the question of an attack had been put offfor a months     There were indications that germany was making preparations to invade south Scandinaviaif we took action against Narvik.Mr. Burg in asked whether we had any information about an increase in production of synthetic oil inGermany.     The Prime Minister said that there was no definite information on this subject but that he didnot think production was On a large scale.     Mr. Burginpointed out that a production plant offered excellentair targets.     The Prime Minister agreed and said-thatencouraging reports had been received about the extent
of the damage done in the raid on Sylt.In general it seemed to him that the situation wassteadily improving, though we must of course he preparedfor any developments.Lord Caldecote expressed the thanks of theMinisters present to the Prime Minister for his very interesting statement.
