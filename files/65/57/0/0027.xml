With Lord Halifax&apos;s Compliments.A meeting of Ministers took place in the Secretary ofState1 e room in the Foreign Office on May 2nd, 19u1, at 6 p.m.The following were presentThe Secretary of State for Foreign AffaireThe Lord chancellor the Secretary of State for the colonies the Secretary of State for Scotland.The Minister of Labour and National service the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the Minister of transport the Minister of shipping the Minister of Economic warfare the First Commissioner of works the Postmaster-GeneralThe Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Secretary for MinesMr. R. C. Skrlne Stevenson.SCANDINAVIA.THE SECRETARY of STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS began by sayingthat he had Just explained to Lord Snell and Lord Strebolgi the motives which had Impelled H.M. Government to make landings inthe neighbourhood of Trondhjem and why it had been necessary towithdraw our troops south of that city.    He said that theGovernment had had no illusions regarding the military hazardsof the operations against Trondhjem but, in face of the urgentappeals from Norway and Sweden and their laesuranoee that both countries would collapse under the weight of the German attack,It had proved impossible to refrain from helping so far as wewere able to do so.   There were critics who said that a navalattack on Trondhjem ought to have been undertaken.   The Chiefsof Staff after due consideration had advised against this operation and he (Lord Halifax) was not competent to decide the truth of the matter.   The reason for the lightness of the forcessent to Central Norway had been that, if we were to act at all,it was necessary to act with the greatest speed.   We had hoped for
IIS2.for considerable demolitions of^,means&quot; of eommunlcation by the norwegians themselves but had been disappointed.   The effect of concentrated air action by the Germane had been decisive in viewof the primitive landing facilities at our disposal.    Thequestion had. therefore, rapidly arisen whether to reinforce our troops in Central Norway.   It was doubtful, however, whether wewould be able to support them or defend them against air bombardment.    In view of the lack of landing grounds, aircraft carriers were the only means of providing air defence, and this meant keeping these large and valuable vessels hanging about asan easy mark for torpedoes.   We had tried to use a frozen lakeas a landing ground and had sent 18 Gladiators there.   TheGermans had rapidly discovered these and had destroyed 16 of themby bombing.    It had, therefore, become clear that the scale of anti-aircraft defence necessary to maintain our troops in CentralNorway was prohibitive and it had been decided that the soonerthey were withdrawn the better, despite the damage to Alliedprestige.On the credit side of the balance-sheet, the position was not too bad.    At the beginning the Air Staff calculated that 1055 ofGermany&apos;s bombing forces was being employed in Norway.   Kecentinformation had, however, brought them to the conclusion that25% of Germany&apos;s bombing forces was now being used.   Action by our boisbers and the state of Norwegian aerodromes had caused avery large number of crashes among the German aircraft.   Germany&apos;snaval losses had been enormous.   The King of Norway and theNorwegian Government had been successfully evacuated from CentralNorway.   Narvik would shortly fail into our hands.   Finally, wehad not fallen into the trap of engaging ourselves heavily in scandinavia and thus wsateshtig ourselves in more vital areas.In
In reply to a question from the SINISTER OF TRANSPORT.     %fjLORD HALIFAX said that the Germans had evidently found it possibleto repair 8tavanger Aerodrome as, although greet damage had been caused by our air end naval bombardment, a subsequent air reconnaissance had shown that the Germans had 150 aircraft thereshortly afterwards.In answer to a question from the FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS,LORD HALIFAX said that M. Reynaud&apos;e position would probably be weakened by the withdrawal from south of Trondhjem.    It wasimpossible to say how far 1. Reynaud had gone in the recent secret session and it might be that he had promised more than he could  &quot;tJi jL    it -3a oTHE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he didnot under-rate the damage to Allied prestige which would result from the decision to withdraw.    On a long view, however, it was undoubtedly the best thing to do.    If, as seemed likely, we were able shortly to capture Narvik, this would counteract to someextent the effect on Sweden.    It would undoubtedly be better forus if Sweden were at war with Germany.   Therefore it was probablethat Germany would not push her too far.   However she would behemmed in and great pressure would certainly be brought to bearon her to increase shipments of iron ore.   The question would thenarise whether we could interfere with the shipments of the ore from the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia.In reply to a question from the LORD CHANCELLOR, the SECRETARYOF STATE said that steady progress was being made in the advance on Narvik, and Lord Cork was confident that, as soon as the snowmelted
melted and conditions became a little easier, he would be ableto capture the port.    It was not yet fully surrounded but it was-**a*e%,3T&apos; reported that the Germans had only food for about aweek.   Two places for aerodromes had been found in the vicinityand work had been started on them.   Anti-aircraft guns hadalready been sent and it was hoped to despatch fighter aircraftshortly.ITALY.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then read to ministers Sir Noel Charles&apos; telegram No. i.1+3 and expressed theopinion that an immediate move by Mussolini did not seem likely-THE MINISTER OF SHIPPING asked whether in these circumstances it would not be a good thing to allow a few merchant ships to go through the Mediterranean.    The SECRETARY OF STATE agreed.As regards Spain, our information went to show that Francowas not anxious to Join Mussolini in any adventures.LORD HALIFAX then referred to the despatch of a battle-fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean and, in answer to a question from theMINISTER OF LABOUR, said that the Admiralty expected to have twoor three new battleships this summer and a new aircraft-carriernext month.Some discussion then ensued in regard to the application of contraband control to Italy.   The present intention was to goslow in this matter, except in regard to oil imports.   It waspointed out in this connexion that the French desired to double the pipe-line to Haifa.   Their reasons for this proposal were discussed and it was decided that their idea was to put themselvesin a better economic position after the war.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIR8 said that thepossibility of re-opening commercial negotiations with Italy wasbeing considered and. in particular, a proposal that Italy shouldbuild0   j.        &apos;-   1
build some ships for us.   The advantage in this would be that thenecessary raw materials, particularly steel, would not be requiredfor two or three months and, if Italy in the meantime turnednasty, no harm would have been done.   It was perhaps worth trying.In the view of Sir K. Graham, It was advisable to show the NorthernItalian industrialists that money would come in.   This would make them even less anxious than they were at present to supportMussolini in any adventures.THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE pointed out that the leakin the blockade caused by Italian imports and exports was a veryserious one.   Italy might not be a great danger now in view ofher unpreparedness but in a year&apos;s time the position might wellbe very different.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he hoped the Minister of Economic Warfare would not hesitate to let himknow if at any time he did not agree with the Foreign Office on questions of policy as regards Italy.THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE said that the trouble wasthat any action to tighten up our contraband control would beregarded by the Italians as the application of sanctions.   The nextstep in the ordinary course of events would be the production in italy of statutory lists of importers and exporters and then of black lists.    It was Impossible now to keep track of goods landedthe administration and the friendly feelings of the people.   in italy, however, this was not the case, and the Italians coulddeceive us with the greatest ease.THE SECRETARY OF STATE agreed that there appeared to be avery strong case for tightening up our contraband control, though he supposed that there was some consolation in the thought thatour blockade was now, after only eight months of war, as effectiveee it had been after two-and-a-half years in the last war.in Italy.    In other countries we could trust the integrity ofThe
6.The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC WARFARE said this might be truebut no progress had been made for many months and. not onlywas there the leak through Italy, but there was an almostequally serious one through Vladivostock, particularly as regardscopper and rubber.    He intended to produce a summary of thegeneral position for the Cabinet.FAR EAST.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that theJapanese Government, having sent emissaries to cajole the localJapanese military authorities at Tientsin, now seemed to beready to clinch the agreement reached.We were anxious to come to some arrangement with Japan forthe restriction of German imports through Vladivostock, but wewere waiting to receive the views of the United States on our proposals.   The Japanese appeared very anxious to talk, as theywere in great need of raw materials.SHIPPING.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that theNorwegian Minister had laid on the Ministry of Shipping the blame for the delay in making the Norwegian merchant fleet available.THE MINISTER OF SHIPPING said that the delay was due to thefact that there were two parties on the Norwegian side, first thegovernment and secondly the ship-owners, who were represented by Mo Olsen.    The latter was proving difficult and was being encouraged by shipping agents in the City of London.    It was,however, hoped that the difficulties would be cleared up soon.THE LOW COUNTRIES.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that therehad been many reports recently of imminent attacks on holland and
7.and Belgium.   We had drawn the attention of the netherlands government to the possibility of a German incursion into the frisian Islands, particularly Texel, where an aerodrome might prove to he the kind of temptation which the Germans showedthemselves incapable of resisting.It was still the case that neithe r the Dutch nor the belgians would commit themselves to help the other in the eventof a German attack.THE SECRETARY FDR MINES said that one satisfactory thingwas that the Dutch were decreasing their stocks of oil.
