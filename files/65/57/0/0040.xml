With Mr. Skrine Stevenson1scompliments.FOREIGN OFFICE.January 22nd, 1%0.
A meeting of Ministers was held in Lord Halifax&apos;s room at the Foreign Office at 6 p.m. on January 16th, 19h0.   *The following were presents-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Lord President of the Council.Secretary of State for India and Burma.Secretary of State for the Colonies.Minister of Food.Secretary of State for Scotland.President of the Board of Trade.President of the Board of Education.Minister of Health.Minister of Labour.Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.Minister of Transport.Minister of Information.Minister of Economic Warfare.Secretary for Mines.Mr. R. 0. Skrlne Stevenson.the LOW C0UKTRIE8.THE SECRETARY OF STATE&quot; FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS referredto the week-end scare regarding an imminent German invasion of Belgium and of Holland.     It was not at all certain whatlay behind it.   The circumstances in which the informationfell into the hands of the Belgian Government were highlyauspicious.    If the whole thing were a fake, it might bethat it was an example of the German technique of repeatedscares leading to nothing, with a view eventually to lullingus and the French into a false sense of security.    In replyto a question from the LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, theSECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that anotherpossible explanation was that the Germans desired to provokethe Belgians into issuing an Invitation to us and the french to
&amp;WWMrtrti K .       &apos;:;vi::;/   V%  v-.-.&quot;7v ^$to help them and using that as an excuse for invading theLow Countries themselves.   King Leopold had heen muchdisturbed, but when it came to the point he left matters tohis Government and would not take the responsibility of inviting Allied troops to enter Belgium.   Time would showwhether hie action had been wise or not.    In answer to questions from the MINISTER OF TRANSPORT and the PRESIDENT OFTHE BOARD OP EDUCATION, Lord Halifax explained that there was considerable military advantage to the Allies in getting into belgium before Germany got there, and if we were given the choice wh$her or not- we desired the invasion of Belgium, itmight well be that the balance of advantage might lie in having Belgium invaded if we had got there first and on ourown terms.THS MINISTER OP LABOUR asked what the attitude of holland had been.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthe Dutch considered that the Belgians had been more scared thanthey ought to have been.    He thought that the Dutch wouldfight if Holland were invaded and moreover that Belgiumwould assist Holland to resist invasion.   The general effectof the 8care had been to move the Low Countrlea in ourdirection.    The position was not yet quite clear but he hoped that the result would be that we should get more information from the Belgian General Staff, who had hithertorefused to consider any question of Staff conversations.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA asked whether we hadreceived any news of Mr. Stevens and Captain Beet.   THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that so far aswe knew&quot;-they were still alive.   It seemed possible that theGerman Government had intended to etage a second Reichstagtrial
trial but bad found the difficulties greater than they had anticipated.SCANDINAVIA.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then spoke of the situation in Scandinavia.   He said that a week agoSweden and Norway had been very forthcoming on the questionof help to Finland and on the subject of volunteers.   Theywere now, however, hanging back, probably under pressure fromGermany and Russia.   Brigadier Ling, who had recently visitedFinland, had said that Field-Marshal Marinerheim was not very anxious to have volunteers now, in view of the rigours of the climate which would probably make them useless.   We were inclined to agree with this view.   Field-Marshal Mannerhelmdid, however, require ironed! ate help in aircraft and anti-aircraft guns and was anxious to have a force of men at his disposal in May when he expected a general Russian offensive.The possibility of despatching such a force would depend onthe attitude of Sweden and Norway, and whether at the time theywere sufficiently alarmed at the prospect of a Russian invasion,or whether they were more frightened at the prospect of findingthemselves at war with Germany.   A good deal of aircraft and war material had already been supplied to Finland.     She would shortly have received about 169 aircraft of different kinds,of which the British share had been 99 aircraft of different kinds, including some released by South Africa, and we were trying to persuade the United States to release further supplies.A certain number of 3 inch anti-aircraft guns would bs released by us for Finland.     In reply to a question from the MINISTEROF TRANSPORT, Lord Halifax said that it was believed by theGeneral Staff that the Finns had actually cut the Murmansk railwayGERMANY.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then spoke of Germany where, according to our reports of internal conditions, there was a good deal of depression among the older people, although the young were In general fanaticallyhappy.   There was no sign of disintegration.   The latestof the peace feelers from Germany had he en received throughthe Vatican.    It was on the usual line, viz. that there were certain generals who were prepared to stage a coup d*etat.His Holiness the Pope did not vouch for the report and it did not appear to amount to anything serious.ITALY.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatwe seemed to be passing through one of the periodicaldepressions in our relations with Italy.   This was largely due to difficulties over shipping and contraband controlQuestions.   Count Ciano appeared anxious to help, butMussolini remained sulky.   Great ham had been done by therecent article in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, but lord Halifaxthought that the King, the Army and the people remainedsteadfastly opposed to intervention in the war against theAllies.THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION said that apologies hadbeen received from the Editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; forthe article which had been mentioned, and that the editor had said that he would take advantage of an offer by the ministry to advise him on such matters in future.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT asked whether the Italiansstill held large numbers of troops in North Africa.fHB;
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIR8 said thatno great danger was expected from that quarter, and in any event we were how in a much hotter position to resist than we had heen.SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthe recent talk between Count Ciano and Count Csaky had been satisfactory.   It seemed very clear that Mussolini really diddesire not to see the war extend to the Balkans.   The recentTurco-Bulgarian declaz*ation had been most encouraging and hethought it right to say that the successful negotiation of itwas due in a large measure to Mr. Rendel, our Minister atSofia.   We had concluded a number of subsidiary agreements with Turkey with the result that the Suspense Clause in themain Agreement had been cancelled.BLUE BOOK.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS then spoke of the suggested Russian Blue BOok.   The French heartilydisliked the idea of the publication on the grounds that itwould give an opportunity for ill-disposed persons to criticise the French and British Governments, either for hanging backtoo much or for going so near to selling the Baltic Statesand Scandinavia.   In these circumstances it had been suggestedthat a memorandum might be issued Instead of publishing the correspondence.   There were, however, grave objections tothis.   The Prime Minister intended to talk the matter overwith Opposition Leaders and explain to them why it was notdesired to publish anything.   Perhaps a mistake had been madein
in undertaking in the House of Commons to publish it without having first consulted the French Government.   He gathered that the Ministry of Information would he on the wholepleased if nothing were published, hut that the newspaperswould be disappointed,   fhe Prime Minister would have tomake a statement in the House, In the course of which he would say that, after consultation with the French, we had decided not to publish the Blue Book.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he thought that itwould be a mistake to give the impression that in notpublishing, we were trying to placate Russia.    It would bebetter to say that, after consultation with our Ally, we had found the moment inopportune for publication.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggested thatit might be worth while sending a message to Count Cianoexplaining that, in refraining from publication, we were notintending to placate Russia.BALKANS.General discussion ensued on the advisability of extending the war to the Balkans.    LORD HALIFAX said that, asat present advised, we were against such an exteneion.    to begin with, we were not favourably placed witbour externallines of communications against the German internal linea.Germany would not encounter much resistance in making herway down to the Mediterranean with the result that we mighthave to face air action agalnat our shipping.       It waspossible that Germany might turn her attention South-Eastwards,but there was no doubt that the Finnish example had had astiffening effect on the Balkan countries.UNITED STATES.6.
7.UNITED STATES.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked whether the attitude ofthe United states had changed recently in a sense unfavourable to us.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he did not think that there wee any definite development inthat direction.     The question of the proposed security zonewas a little difficult, hut it seemed that the american states realised that they had gone rather too fast in thematter, and if the difficulties of carrying out their proposal were put to them in polite language, it seemed likely thatthey would drop the idea.    LORD HALIFAX also explained thatthere was a very fer-reaching scheme on foot with the objectof controlling the supply of certain metals to &quot;dangerousMcountries.   We were all in favour of keeping such metalsout of Germany and Russia, hut the scheme might raise some difficulties for us in our relations with Japan, who was alsoregarded &quot;by the United States as a &quot;dangerous&quot; country.   Wevould go as far as we could in this matter, keeping in step with the United States, but would avoid, if possible-, anydegeneration in our relations with Japan.JAPAN.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked what our views were on thenew Japanese Government.THE SECRETARY OF 8TATK FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that it did not seem to be very secure.   It was satisfactory, however,that Mr. Arlta had been appointed Minister for Foreign Affaireas he was opposed to any extension of German influence inthe
the Far Best.     Lord Halifax added that Japan&apos;s action inopening the Yangtse and Pearl Elvers was probably due tothe pressure exercised on her by the unsatisfactory state ofher commercial relations with the United States.
