: TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET., frEH JULY. 1940. COPY NO.HOME DEFENCE.A Meeting of Ministers, was held at No. 10 downing street, on FRIDAY, 5TH JULY, 1940 at.0  p.T!l.The Prime Minister was in the Chair, and therewere present;-?The Lord Presiolent of the council the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord Chancellor.The Secretary of State for the Home Department,and Minister of home Security.The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Secretary of State for Scotland..-The President of the Board of Trade.The President of the Board of Education.The Minister of Health.The Minister of Labour and Minister ofNational Service.The Minister of Supply.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries^The Minister of Transport.The Minister of Shipping.The Minister of Information.The Minister of Economic Warfare.The First Commissioner of Works .....The Postmaster-Gerieral.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The Secretary, Petroleum Department.The C.6mmander-in-Chief, Home Forces.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff,Sir Findlater Stewart.Sir Edward Bridges,Lieut.-Colonel E.I.C. Jacob.THE MINISTER OF HOME SECURITY said that, at a recent meeting of the Civil Defence Committee - over which he hadpresided - certain Ministers had expressed a feeling ofremoteness from contact with the planning of Home defence measures, which impinged very much upon their daily work:.
They had felt that further opportunities should be created for then to obtain information of what wasbeing planned, and of the part that they wore expectedto play in the general scheme.     As an example, theSecretary for Mines had circulated a Paper on theinportance of the South Wales industrial district, andthe concern of the population at    the apparent lackof defences.     The Minister had found it very difficultto give an effective answer to representations made from that part of the world., since he lackedauthoritative information.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that he found himself in a similar difficulty, not only in satisfying the many enquiries which he received from industrial organisations in different parts of the country^ butalso in carrying out his own task of allocating labour.He felt that steps were necessary to keep ministersmore in touch with the general scheme of Home Defence,so that they woula know how best to play their part.The Minister then quoted various examples toshow the kind of uncertainty which prevailed in the minds of industrial organisations and others, which he found it very difficult to allay;   and thought that now that the war had been brought so close, it was essential to take all those in responsible positionsmore into the confidence of the military authorities,so that they could have assurance   in answering the doubts which they heard expressediTHE PRIME MINISTER said that there was muchunderstandable anxiety throughout the country, and eachperson thought that his own beach was the one on whichthe enemy would land.     It was essential that people should have confidence, however, in those who were responsible for planning the defences.    Explanationscould not be given to all and sundry.   Wo guaranteecould possibly be given that any particular part of thecountry was safe.    All that could be done was toestimate where the enemy&apos;s main blow was likely to fall, and to make certain of countering that.     TheNavy would play its part, but people should not beallowed to suppose that landings could be entirelyprevented.     Nevertheless, a landing would be thebeginning of the action, not the end of it.     although there might.be, and in fact certainly would be, muchdestruction, and terrible events of a kind never beforeknown in this island, people should be confident thatthe enemy would be thrown back.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that there was a feeling in Wales, particularly in the remoter districts,that there was    e.o    adequate system of observation forparachutists.     People were willing and ready to take part in a system of observation posts, but were doubtfulwhat thej should do.
tooSIR EDMUND IRONSIDE said that the system ofobservation was on the whole very...complete-, and wasbacked up by a system of mobile colunns which couldimmediately isolate -/any force which landed.     It shouldbe realised, however., that in the remote districtsthere was less danger of such landings.   , The enemy would prefer to place his force near a vulnerableobjective.   However, an extension of the system ofobservation would certainly be welcome, and all thatwas necessary was for the people to join the local defence Volunteers.TEE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed outthat only a month had been available for the organisationof Home Defence, since the British Expeditionary force had been evacuated from Dunkirk.     During that time.,the whole of the British Expeditionary Force had had tobe sorted out, re-forned, re-equipped, and absorbed into the defensive system.     Nearly every Division andBrigade in the country had had to move to new positions.In spite of the short time available, however, this had all been done.     The Array had no complaint to make on the score of the shortage of labour.     In fact, insome cases, the supply of labour had been in advance ofthe planning of the work.Some further discussion took place upon the lay-out of the defensive system in view of the changed situation on the Continent ?, and attention was drawn tothe difficulty of satisfying people that there were adequate defences for the areas in which they worked,unless they got visible proof by seeing guns, aircraft,etc.It was pointed out that it would be fatal todisperse our defences in an attempt to give confidence to the inhabitants of every district.     It was theduty of all those in responsible positions to explainthis fact, and to assure those who were doubtful that work was going on day and night, with the object ofmaking the best use of all the resources we had at our disposal. *Discussion then turned on the organisation forthe planning and direction of Home Defence.THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY asked to be assured that co-operation between the three Services was on a sound basis - the more so since it had appeared during theNorwegian campaign that our system was not abovereproach.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the basis from which any such discussion must start was that, in war, manythings would go wrong, misunderstandings would occur,and mistakes would be made. This was inevitable.It would be quite wrong, however, to draw conclusionsfrom the Norwegian campaign, where we had been- forcedto throw small forces ashore in an attempt to strengthen
ft:       tftlthe Norwegians, who had done nothing either to protectthemselves, or to facilitate our task.     Things wouldhe very different in this country.     Very completemachinery existed for advising the War Cabinet on general policy at hone and abroad.     The Chiefs ofStaff, with their Joint Planning and Joint IntelligenceSub-Committees, consisting of special Officers drawn from the three Service Departments, were constantlyat work on all aspects of the war.     For the conductof the operations we had the Commander-in-Chief, whoseposition was the same as that of the Commander-in-Chiefof the British Expeditionary Force.   He received his general instructions from the War Office, who assistedhim in every way, and placed such forces as might benecessary under his command.     He then made the plan for the operations.It was clearly impossible that any one man couldcommand all three Services.     Very careful steps,however, had been taken to ensure that the Commander-in-Chief would have the fullest co-operation from theRoyal Navy and the Royal Air Force.     A Rear-Admiraland an Air Vice-Marshal had been placed on his staff.Fifty per cent, of the medium bombers in this country had been placed at his disposal, and he could call onthe rest as necessary.The machinery of co-operation between the services had been built up over many years, and was working verysmoothly.    A typical example was provided by thework of the Admiralty with the Coastal Command of theRoyal Air Force.     There must, of course, be considerableimpingement on the civil life of the country by our military preparations.     Some were inclined to saythat there was too much, and that junior military officers were usurping powers which they had no rightto possess.     Others said that more control should begiven to the Military, so as to ensure that their wisheswere carried out.     The matter was regulated, however,by the appointment to the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief of a Civil Staff Officer (Sir Findlater Stewart),whose duty it was to act as his link with the civil departments.     The whole of this Staff, under theChairmanship of the Conmander-in-Chief, comprised the .Home Defence Executive.In the course of discussion, it was stated thatthe machinery of the Home Defence Executive was working on the whole very well, and in the case of suchDepartments as the Post Office and the PetroleumDepartment, liaison with the military authorities rightdown the chain was well established.THE PRIME MINlSv???5. s%gi?ested that it would beT&amp;luableif the Ministers of Civil Departments could haveperiodical meetings, say once a week/ with the service ministers in rotation, to discuss matters of common interest, and to ensure close touch on Home Defence
natters.     He also made the suggestion that similarmeetings might from tine to time be arranged to discussother fields of activity, for example, supply and labour.In the meanwhile, Ministers would be much assisted in their task if they were supplied with a. statementof the organisation of the Home Defence Executive, andits relation to the Government and the Chiefs of staff organisation!   if they were given an explanation of thegeneral system of Command for Home Defencej   and ifthey were informed of the extent to which administrativefunctions normally dealt with by the War Office had beentaken over by Headquarters, Home Forces, and of thenature and scope of the adiainistrative responsibilitiesentrusted to Army Commands, Corps, and DivisionalHeadquarters.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,5TH JULY, 1940.
