April 13th, 1940.Foreign Office, S.W.\,
MEETING OP MINISTERS.A meeting took piece in the Secretary of 3tete*a room at the Foreign Office on April 11th at S.15 p.m.     Thefollowing Ministers were presents-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Lord President of the Council.Secretary of State for India and Burros.Secretary of State for the Colonies.Secretary of State for Scotland.Minister of Health.Minister of Labour and National Service.Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.Minister of Food.Minister of Transport,Minister of Shipping.Minister of Information.First Commissioner of Works.Postmaster-General..Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.Secretary&amp;f Mines.Mr. Stevenson.SOJIIIM, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatin his view Hitler had embarked on an extremely hazardousoperation.     The outcome would naturally depend to a verygreat extent on the attitude taken up by Norway and Sweden.We were doing what we could to encourage the norwegian government.     We did not expect, however, any very effectiveresistance $md tfee**gh* that there might be -seme- sporadicfighting and that the Norwegians would be able to hinder theGermans by destroying, so far as they could, railcommunication.LORD HALIFAX went on to speak of the situation at narvik and pointed out that it would probably be difficult&apos; / the.for the Germane who were thwe to cut railway in view of thelarge amount of snow on the mountains.In general he thought that if we could manege to get afoothold In Norwsy we could eventually turn the situation to-our/.
our advantage.     Things would be very much easier for ub IfSweden were to co-operate with us.     We oould then probablycist off the supply of Iron ore to Germany entirely as theport of Lulee was W*y strong end eoa&amp;ly defended-.An Anglo-French Mission was leaving on April 11th forStockholm with a view to stiffening Swedish resistance toGermany.     The Mission oould not of course promise that theAllies would be in a position to give really effective help to Sweden but it was hoped to encourege the governments the MINISTER CP? SHIPPING asked whether a suggestioncouia be made to the Swedish ship-owners to the effect thatthey should warn the masters of their ships to make for allied ports or control bases in the event of an attack onSweden by Germany end that ship-masters should not believecontrary orders which ship-owners might eventually be forcedto send to them under German duress.     This proposal was accepted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and atelegram was sent to Stockholm by the hand of Major-oeneralLewin of the Anglo-French Mission.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND asked whether therewere any signs of a move by Soviet Russia towards the atlantic coast of Norway.THE 8K0ROTARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that hethought It doubtful if the Russians would make such anattempt, at any rate by land,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE PUOHY OF LANCASTER asked whether there were any visible effect on Soviet Russia of the Germanaction in Scandinavia.     He suggested that it might not betee pleasing to the Russians to see Germany too powerful inthe Baltio.- THE/
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthe attitude of Russia was laewgr obscure.    The Soviet union had made suggestions to us for trade talks and the Ministryof Economic Warfare were studying the possibility of some kind of a war trade agreement.     LORD HALIFAX then referredto the message sent by Sir Stafford Grippe (washington telegram No. 481).     He doubted whether Sir Stafford Crlpps&apos;views were altogether correct.The question of Turkey&apos;s attitude figured largely inthat of our relations with Soviet Russia.     He thought itwas true to say that the Turks would not like us to make an offensive war against Soviet Russia now.     They mightJo *U-wcAnot; however, mind aagt later in the summer.THE CHANCELLOR OF THS DUCHY OF LANCASTER asked what wasHitler&apos;s aim in his attack on Norway.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ssld thatthere were three possible explanations:-1.   Hitler really believed that we were going to force (a) landing at Narvik.2.   Hitler was carrying out a scheme which had been planned for a long time to provide himself withbases for air and sea attack on us.8.   Hitler&apos;s action in Scandinavia was mostly acurtain-raiser for a frsrge-scale offensive on theWestern front or through Belgium and Holland-la answer to a question from THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOESCOTLAND he said that the Dutch had been very nervous twoir-or three days ago but were less so now.    A German eruptioninto Holland might be very awkward for us.    The Chief of theGeneral staff thought that Hitler did mean to ettaokthrough/
:. O)ITALY.through Holland and that his move would probably involveBelgium as well.    The Belgians still did not like the ideaof calling on ue for assistance until they were actuallyinvaded.    The Butch seemed to be generally in good heart.LORD HALIFAX then mentioned our offer to protect theFaroe Islands end its acceptance by the local authorities.He also said that we had offered to protect Iceland.    we might need to establish bases there later on, but probablywould not have to occupy the Island unless of course Germanytried to do so.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FORFIGN AFFAIRS said thatthe position as regards Italy was uncomfortable.     Mussoliniseemed to be out cf temper end there was disquietinginformation from fairly good sources in regard to his attitude and intentions.     He personally^oubted whetherMussolini meant to do anything serious, but he was evidentlyin a state of trepidation about Qesm&amp;n strength.     A badreverse for us might tip the balance and bring Italy in on germany&apos;s side.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIR8 said thatthe reports from Turkey were extremely encouraging.    Theattitude of the Turkish Government was firm and veryfriendly to us.The Bulgarian Government appeared firmly to believethat we intended to invade Bulgaria in order to carry out our guarantee to roumania.     They were therefore in a stateof some alarm.    They did not want to be involved in the war on either side.The general feeling in the Balkans appeared to be thatGermany would not win but there was some dou^t whether we
LORD HALIFAX eald that the Balkan Stetea did not appearaltogether to share Mussolini&apos;a exaggerated view of Germanstrength hut it was clear that they were impressed and the thing which they most wanted from us was a plentiful supplyof armaments.THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS said that it was amatter of appreciation end that it might he more necessary and have stbetter eventual effect if we concentrated on building up our own strength rather than on providing arrasfor other countries.JAPAN. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS referred tothe agreement which now seemed to be in sight in regard toTientsin.     He said that the United states were fairlyheppy in regard to our relations with Japan but had been somewhat shocked by Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s recent speech.SCANDINAVIA. THE  SINISTER OF FOOD asked what was the position of denmark.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatGermany appeared to be in complete possession of the countryand had seised Danish gold.THE SECRETARY FOR MINES said that there were about250,000 tons of oil in Denmark which the Germans would presumably take.     In Norway there were about 300,000 tons,one-third at Oslo, one-third at Stadtland, end one-thirdin the North.     In Sweden there were about 550,000 tons.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA asked what action wewere taking to counteract Germany&apos;s attack.( , THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that thefirst thing we were going to do was to occupy Narvik^THE MINISTER OF SHIPPING raised the question of Danishships/
snipe and said that so far aa we knew there were ISO Banishships in Danish harbours eueeefe.A^ The masters of Danishships were In a difficult position because If they did notobey instructions to return to Denmark the Germans wouldprobably carry out reprisals on their wives and families.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthe question of Swedish iron ore was vital.     If Swedencame in on our side we could cut off the supply of ore toGermany altogether.     It might have been wiser for Hitlerto welt until the Gulf of Bothnia was open to initiate hisattack on Scandinavia.     In answer to a question fromTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that the effect of Hitler&apos;s action in scandinavia on the rest of the world had been veryconsiderable.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND referred to theruse which the Germans had employed in Norwegian ports of having soldiers concealed in German merchant ships.LORD HALIFAX said that it was possible they might play thesame trick in Dutoh harbours and we had warned theNetherlands Government accordingly.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked whether our aircraft hadbeen successful in recent fighting over the North Sea.In reply LORD HALIFAX said that the -experts were wbsp meshpleased with the results of the recent raid on Scape Flow.An Intensification of German air action was to be expected.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH* asked whether the norwegian government were In a position to mobilise.    In reply lord halifax said that they oould not do very much although,aa he had previously said, they might be able to hinder theGermans by destroying their railways.
