On the outbreak of war the Royal Australian Navy had been placed at the-disposal of the Admiralty. At the beginning the 1941 the following Australianships had been on duty away from Australian waters :- 1&quot;       United Kingdom Station 1 8-inch cruiser.Mediterranean 1 6-inch cruiser.4 destroyers.Red Sea 2 sloops.All, or virtually all, these ships had distinguished themselves in action.The present Australian Naval Construction Programme, which would be-complete at the beginning of 1942, included 3 Tribal class destroyers.1 boom vessel.48 anti-submarine and minesweeping vessels, of which 20 were for theRoyal Navy and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.1 oil lighter.1 floating dock.The principal Naval Work in hand was a Battleship Graving Dock at Sydney.It was estimated that this would cost  3,000,000, and would take three years tocomplete.AUSTRALIAN ARMY WAR EFFORT.The Commonwealth Army effort fell into two main parts, the provision of an imperial Force and the provision of Home Defence and Militia Forces.A ustralian Imperial Force.The first Australian Corps consisted of : Headquarters, 1st Australian Corps.6th Australian Division.7th Australian Division.8th Australian Division.9th Australian Division.Corps Troops.Base and Line of Communication Units.The total personnel of this Corps amounted to some 130,000, of which about half were in camps in Australia, and the rest overseas.The 6th and 7th and part of the 9th Divisions were in the Middle East.Part of the 8th Division was in Malaya.A armoured Division.Training and other arrangements had been put in hand for the formation,during the period the 11th July-31st October, 1941, of an Armoured Divisioncomprising two Armoured Brigades, a Support Group, Armoured DivisionalTroops and Ancillary Troops.The total strength contemplated, including first reinforcements, was 11,084.Reinforcements. ;The average monthly reinforcement required for the First Australian Corps,based on estimated battle casualties, was 5,172, all ranks.
- HomeDefence and Militia Forces.The Commonwealth Government, aimed at maintaining a Home Defence-, Force of 250,000, comprising 210,000 Australian Military Force and 40,000-Imperial Force. The Australian Military Force&apos;s establishment of 210,000 wouldbe reached soon after the middle of 1941.The strength of the Militia Forces in December 1940 was about 166,000.Universal Service has been re-introduced by Mr. Menzies&apos; Government.AUSTRALIAN AIR WAR EFFOET.At the outbreak of war, the personnel of the Home Defence Units of theRoyal Australian Air Force had totalled 3,489.&apos;   The present strength was 8,311.The ultimate strength (on a 32-Squadron basis) would be 13,474.The aircraft strength (initial equipment and immediate reserve) of the HomeDefence Units in December 1940 was Hudson ............... 96Wirraway       ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 85Other types    ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 42Total    ......      ...      ...      ...        223The following aircraft with squadrons serving overseas were included inthis figure of 223:  United Kingdom: 8 Sunderland Flying Boats.Middle East and Far East: 36 Hudsons, 18 Wirraways.Empire Air Training Scheme.As at present contemplated, Australia&apos;s contribution to the Empire air training Scheme would be the output by the 31st March, 1943, of the followingpilots, observers and wireless operator-air gunners :  -   Training in Australia      ...      ...      ...      14,344Training in Canada ......      ...        4,730Training in Southern Rhodesia   ...      ... 87019,944When the scheme reached maturity the output of fully-trained personnelevery four weeks would be :  ,In Australia ...      ...      ...      ...... 646.In Canada     ............      ...        .160806In December 1940 the air-crew personnel under training, including^personnel awaiting embarkation for Canada or Rhodesia, were : In In In !Australia.

AUSTRALIAN MUNITIONS WAR, EFFORT.In the year before the war the Commonwealth expenditure on defence had ,been  14 millions, of which  3^ millions had been in respect of munitions. Inthe current year the expenditure on defence would be  200 millions, of which some  60 or  70 millions represented expenditure on munitions. This showed the enormous strain on the industrial resources of the country. They had beenfortunate in getting very competent men to direct this programme. Thewhole programme was being directed by eight men, under the charge ofMr. Essington Lewis, each of these eight men was the leading man in australia in his particular line of business, and all of whom were serving without pay.In 1914-18 Australia had manufactured rifles, Small Arms ammunition and uniforms. She had been dependent on the United Kingdom for the remainder of her military supply. At the peak of 1914-18 the number of employees engageddirectly in munitions production had been 2,737. By the second half of 1914 itwas estimated that the number directly engaged in munitions production wouldbe 80,000. To these might be added the estimated number of persons indirectlyengaged in munitions production, 70,000.Production in Government Munitions Factories.The types of munitions made only in Government factories included Small-Arms Ammunition, rifles, machine guns and aircraft bombs.Production in Industry.Of all other types of munitions, industry was undertaking the greater proportion.   Seventy-four &apos;&apos; Armament Annexes &apos;&apos; had been created.Range of Munitions.The range of munitions now being manufactured in Australia was far greater than in the last war.  Particulars were given of the following :-25-pdr. Field Gun. Would be in production by June 1941 at the rate of10 equipments per week.3-7 A.A. Gun. Was in production at the rate of two a week, and would soon be raised to three a week. About half this production had so far been sent overseas. The decision to release these guns h?d been influenced by the non-delivery of predictors ordered from the United Kingdom. There was a seriousdeficiency of anti-aircraft guns in Australia.  The need for predictors was acute.2-pdr. Anti-Tank Gun. Production would begin in June 1941 at the rateof 20 per week.  In September 1941 the rate would be increased to 30 per week.2-inch Mortars.In production at the rate of 6 per week (to be raised to 40 per week by theend of 1941).Bren Guns.Production began in January 1941. By the middle of 1941 production should reach 40 per week and by the end of 1941 100 per week.Vickers Guns.In production at the rate of 50 per week.Rifles.In production at the rate of 50,000 per year. A rate of production of 200,000per year was aimed at for early 1942.Small A rms A mmunilion..&apos; In production at the rate of 300 million per year. The rate should reach600 million per year by December 1941. This rate of production should enableAustralia to render substantial help to other parts of the Empire.
Aircraft Production.The following items were mentioned by Mr. Menzies : Elementary Training Aircraft (including Tiger Moths with Gipsy engines).In production at the rate of 2 per day.Wirraway A aircraft.In production at the rate of 1 per day, including Wasp engines of 650 h.p.Beaufort Bombers.Difficulties had been experienced but production would begin by the end ofApril 1940. The programme was 180. This ought to be completed by February1942A factory had been set up to produce the twin-row Wasp engine of 1,050 h.p.Total A ir craft Production.By the middle of 1941 aircraft production (i.e., both frames and engines) inAustralia ought to be over 90 per month, and there was no reason why the rate should not reach 250 per month before the end of the war, provided a bold policy was pursued- The manufacturing population of Australia was now some 750,000,as compared with some 370,000 ten years ago.FUTURE  POSSIBILITIES  OF  THE  AUSTRALIAN  engineering industry.Mr. Menzies said that technical training in engineering was being greatlydeveloped in Australia. There was no reason why Australia should not produce the heavy bombers or whatever type the British Empire required east of Suez.For this, however, they would need both technical and financial help from theUnited Kingdom.He thought it would be to the common advantage if a United Kingdom firmwith considerable experience of both motor and aircraft production would enterinto a kind of partnership with the Commonwealth Government. The experience,of such a firm would be invaluable in helping the Australian aircraft industryover the difficult peinod which must follow the war. So far as he could see, the thing to do with the industry would be to turn part of it over to motor production.There was no reason why the United States car should be allowed to capture theAustralian manufacturing possibilities.Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 10, 1941.
