A Meeting of Ministers was held at 4, RichmondTerrace at 6.15 p.m. on Thursday, 21st December, 1939.There were present:Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence(in the Chair).Lord President of the Council.Secretary of State for India and Secretary ofState for Burma.Secretary of State for the Colonies.Secretary of State for Scotland.President of the Board of Trade.President of the Board of Education.Minister of Health.Minister of Labour and National Service.Minister of Supply.Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.Minister of Transport.Minister of Shipping.Minister of Information.Minister of Economic Warfare.Secretary for Mines.Paymaster-Captain R. C. Jerrara.strategical situation. LORD CHATFIELD expressed some diffidence in attempting himself to deal with the activities of all three fighting Services, since descriptions of such could only bewoir a- adequately dealt with by the Service ministers themselves. He felt, however, it might interest ministers to give them a general strategical outlook covering as widea range as he could in the time available.2* Western Front.Starting with the Western Front, LORD CHATFIELDexplained that the Germans had about 94 divisions disposedalong their Western frontier from Switzerland to the sea,of which more than half lay behind Luxemburg, Belgium and holland.     They also had about 41 divisions in Central and eastern Germany.     Opposed to them were the 78 divisions ofthe Allies, of which 5 were British.     In addition theFrench had 13 fortreaa divisions in the Magihot Line whichwere part of the fortress and could only act on the defensive.-1-
In reply to a question by Mr. Stanley whether theGermans had any equivalent fortress divisions which could he written off from the offensive aspect, Lord Chatfield said it was not exactly known how the Siegfried Line was manned,hut it was probable that all the German divisions wereequipped to enable them to take offensive action.Continuing, Lord Chatf ield said the French had -also 6 divisions and 2 fortress divisions on the italian frontier and also considerable forces, mainly coloured troops, in North Africa.     He understood the C. I. G. S.considered the Allies held a very strong line on theWestern Front and it certainly seemed that it would bevery difficult for either side to start any really effectiveoffensive.     It was true that the French position on theLuxemburg frontier was not so strong as in the other partsof the line, but, since the declaration of war, work hadbeen proceeding steadily to strengthen that portion.If the Germans attacked through Holland, the Dutchview was that the Germans could not, in existing conditions,operate their air forces effectively from that countryexcept in the south-west corner.Whether Belgium would come in if Germany attackedHolland was not known, but it was probable that they would,although up to date the Belgians had not agreed to hold anystaff conversations with us. Should the Germans make suchan attack our intention was to move up our forces to certainlines j, and the general feeling was that we could hold thosepositions.As regards our own forces, we should have 5 furtherdivisions ready to go to France, the last one by the end ofFebruary next.3. The Balkans.If Germany decided not to attack in the We8t,she might stage an offensive towards the Balkans, a
possibility which had been under close study between ourselves and the French and had been one of the most urgent and important problems discussed at the Supreme War Councilon Tuesday last in Paris.     The French favoured a more forwardpolicy in this matter than we at present considered advisable,but general agreement had been reached in Paris that staff conversations could not be held with the Balkan countries concerned before we had ascertained through diplomatic channels the Italian reactions.The French view was that a German offensive in the balkan direction might well take place in the Spring andthat if we were to help we must make preparations now.Their proposal was to form a defensive front on the Thracianfrontier.     It would be, of course, a very great undertaking to send forces to Greece or Turkey, involving considerablepreparations in advance in such matters as administrative arrangements, and equipping and defending the necessary ports and bases.     We and the French had   certain forces inPalestine, Egypt and Syria, but no active steps could be takento send troops unless we were assured of Italian neutralityat the least.     Should, for instance, Italy come in on theGerman side, the pre-war staff view remained that we should first have to knock-out Italy and leave the Balkan countriestemporarily to their fate.      Should, however, Italianreaction to our diplomatic representations be not unfavourablewe could start to put in hand our preparations now whichwould enable us by next March to move our forces to hold thefront referred to.Meanwhile the Turks were at present disinclined toenter fully into staff Conversations with us, holding thatthey would not be threatened unless Russia or Germany crossed the Danube.     They further felt confident they could hold their frontier in the case of a Russo-German drive south.They had said, however, that if Bulgaria attacked Roumania
with the intention of obtaining the   Dobrud;ja, the Turks would attack Bulgaria.4. Scandinavia.LORD GHATFIBLD then referred to the position in scandinavia and remarked that the Russian attack on Finlandappeared at present to be held up, but it seemed inevitable that the Russians would eventually drive through to theSwedish frontier.     A difficult problem would then be presented to us and the Chiefs of Staff were now examiningwhat we could do in certain eventualities, such as forexample if Germany, alarmed at Russian incursion, were toput a protective hand over Sweden.     Lord Chatfield also referred to the steps now being considered to prevent ormaterially decrease the export of iron ore from Scandinavianports to Germany.5. Naval Dispositions.Lord Chatfield then gave a description of thepresent naval dispositions^ covering the Northern Patrol,the forces disposed to hunt German raiders and supply ships,the Atlantic and Scandinavian convoys.6. Submarine Warfare.In reply to a question by Mr. Elliot, LORD CHATFIELDsaid there was no further news of the rumour of Russiansubmarines proceeding through the Kiel Canal and he doubted whether Russian submarines would be effective under the tremendous strain of modern submarine warfare.MR. ELLIOT, referring to the morale of german submarine crews, said that despite heavy losses german submarines appeared to be continuing to come out regularlyand it seemed that their morale had not been much affected and that they were being gallantly handled.
LORD CHATFIELD said that undoubtedly our Navy had given the German submarines a very bad time.     The latter had started their campaign near our coasts and had been attacked so heavily that they had been driven out to the atlantic.     Successes had then been scored against them inthe latter area and now they were operating again near ourcoasts, probably with smaller vessels.MR. STANLEY observed that despite the steadysinkings announced by the First Lord, there did not appearto be any falling off in the number of German submarinesoperating.     LORD CHATFIELD doubted very much if that wasthe case;   his information was that there were rarely now more than five operating at sea compared to twice that number in the early part of the war.At the request of Mr. Euan Wallace, LORD CHATFIELDgave a description of the Asdic method and of its success,pointing out that the difficulty lay not so much in locatingthe submarine as in exploding the depth charges in theposition best calculated to effect mortal damage.7. Magnetic Mines.Lord Chatfield summarised the situation regardingMagnetic Mines and explained the various devices now inOperation to counter them, and also the trials being carriedout in regard to the demagnetisation of ships.MR. STANLEY asked as to German capacity for manufacturing and laying^mines.       LORD CHATFIELD said thatthe mines appeared capable of mass-production.     he explained that it was difficult, of course, for the germans to lay them in the&quot;correct positions, especially when dropped by parachute from aircraft.     The bigger type were probablylaid by submarines, as were the ones which had been laid onthe West coast.
8. MR. STANLEY referred to our recent air raids overthe German coast, the results of which appeared ratherdisappointing and valueless.LORD CHATFIELD felt that such operations must beregarded from the general point of view.     We had to buy our experience to a certain degree in war and test the enemydefences, otherwise nothing could be learnt to ensure greatersuccess on succeeding occasions.     The War Cabinet decision was that we should not send bombers into the &quot;hornet&apos;s nest&quot;unless there was a definite military objective to attack and on the occasions referred to by Mr. Stanley there was such military objective.     Lord Chatfield added his own view was that air attacks on strongly defended ports and baseswere bound to be very expensive, and he had full confidence that that would prove to be the case should the German airforce attack our Naval ports.9. Bombing.MR. ELLIOT observed that the whole experience ofthe war so far seemed to show that bombers were veryvulnerable, and he had been wondering whether the assumptionswhich the Government had adopted before the war, in regard tothe effects of air attack, were still valid.LORD CHATFIELD remarked that the danger by day mightwell be less than previously anticipated, but by night thedanger remained, as in the dark hours it was very difficult for our fighters to make contact with enemy bombers.      Itwas true, of course, that enemy bombing by night might not do any damage of military importance, but it might have a severe effect on the population.     His information, however,was that the Germans were disinclined to risk coming hereto bomb and were distinctly fearful of our retaliatorybombing of their vulnerable areas.
THE COURSEOFjffHE        10.        In a final general discussion as to the course of the^ war and the measures most likely to ensure the defeat of theenemy. Lord Chatfield gave his view that despite conflictingreports as to the economic position in Germany, it would beby Blockade that Germany would eventually be brought to suefor peace.     There was no doubt she was already in certaineconomic difficulties.Several Ministers referred to our own economic difficulties and MR. STANLEY wondered whether we were notdevoting too much of our national productive effort to putting into the field 55 perfectly equipped divisions.LORD CHATFIELD remarked that the equipment of ourdivisions did not differ greatly from the French, but he agreed that it was very improbable that all of the vast numbersof German divisions could be fully equipped.CONCLUSION,  ll. In conclusion, Lord Chatfield suggested that as hehad inevitably to range over a very wide field, it would be helpful both to him and to Ministers if he were furnished beforethe next meeting with a note of any important questions which ministers might wish to ask him.     General agreement was expressed with this suggestion.
