A meeting of Ministers was held on Thursday,February 22adp at No. 10 Downing Street.The Prime Minister was in the Chair, sad there werepresents&quot;-the - fet* Hon*. the fisoount caldeeoteThettost Hon.- the Jgsrajoees of Zetlandthe it. Hon* w. s. norrison$he lit. Hon. John eelvllle-SnVlLt. Hon. Walter &quot;Blliot-She St.. Hon. Suan Wallacefhe Ets Son. Sir .7ohn Giinsourfhs at. Hon.- Sir John EeithMr*&quot;K. H. Gross- itrv Gaoffrey LloydsThe Fyima .,,ljjfoniater said that the outstanding event in international affairs during the previous week ted-been thecontinued war in Finland.    There was no doubt that thegallant resistance which the finns were offering to theRussians was having a profound Influence upon world affairs.According to the latest information, the Hussions had sofar failed to pleree &quot;the- Mannerhelm Line.    The Finns hadehowever * been compelled to retreat about 8 miles.    Itwas understood&apos; that they had -had to fall back upon their second line, which was as strong, if not stronger than their first line.    It did not therefore follow that theRussians would make further progress at present.    In anyease, there was no.doubt that their losses were fabulous*Saverthelsssf It was obvious- that the danger of a breakthrough had not yet been averted.&apos;   Happily * there -wore -reports of a blissard having oeourre&amp;t and it was possiblethat this was a forerunner of the heavy falls of snowwhich were common in Finland about this time of year*    in normal years a period of fine weather usually follows thesnow and that fine period&apos;might he s time of danger*north .
north of Lake Ladoga the Finns wore continuing their very successful operations?    Sines the war began theyhad already exterminated 4 Russian Divisions and therewore prospeets of their wiping out a furthsr &amp; Divisions?We were doing all that we oould to help the Finns?we had already sent to them all the war material we had,,,,:,available which was surplus to our own requirements,and we were now beginning to send them supplies whichwere, in fact, needed for our own Forces.    Some peoplethought that we should send even more, at the expenseof the equipment of our Forces on the Western Front.It had to be realised first of all that it wasimpossible to ship war material across Hurope quicklyand9 in the second place, that Gorman Forces were standingready on the Western Front for an attack which could be ordered at any moment, and any depletion of our strengthIthere would therefore be a serious risfe.    We had not. as yet? reached a final judgment on the matter, but theproblem was one of balancing risks.     There was no doubt that;jany more far reaching campaign in Scandinavia would beimpossible without the willing co-operation of Norway and sweden?    At the moment it looked loss and less likely thatthese countries would be willing to risk their ownsafety?    At present, therefore, the future was somewhatobscure?All that could be said was that it was clearly toour advantage to do all that we could to maintain the resistance of the Finns.    The war in Finland was draining -   jthe life blood out of Euesla very rapidly and was reducingRussian prestige throughout the world?    It was, therefore,also weakening Germany?    Those considerations were astrong Inducement to us to help Finland?    This was theview ..?
view both of the Government and of the French.The &quot;Alttaark&quot; incident had alee had aconsiderable effect.    Meet of the story had been told in public but there were some matters which had not beenmade public as we had not been sure of all the details.For examplej reports had reached us, the truth of which. -&amp;a,ar mot yet fully confirmed, that the Norwegians had failed to make any search of the &quot;Altmark&quot; and hadescorted her with their own torpedo boats while she was; flying the Norwegian flag.    It was also alleged thatthe Norwegian torpedo boats had trained their torpedoeson as,when the wAltraarkM entered the Joseling Fiord.Fortunately, they had not fired.   In any event, it was clear that the incident raised the whole questionof the neutrality of the long strip of Norwegian coastal waters.    The Norwegian lawyers relied on Article 10 ofthe Hague Convention and said that no-one had been more insistent upon these provisions than the BritishGovernment.     It was true that we did consider the doctrine of geSe * innocent** passage to be important j ^bvexample, we should hold that such neutral waters as thestrait between Italy and Sicily should always he opento belligerent ships proceeding on a direct course.This was a very different thing from using a long stripof neutral waters as. a kind of communication trenchin which to convey ships of war and prisoners of warsafe from attack.    Such a conception had certainly notbeen in the minds of the draughtsmen of the hague convention and it woiild seem that the Norwegians were trying to twist the law owing to their fear of Germany *The ....
Ths) previsions of Article 12 of tho Covenant were also ?eleventh    fhia Article provides that in default of speeiafc previsions to the contrary in the legislation of a neutral powere belligerent warships are not permitted to remain in the ports, roadsteads or territorial waters of the said Power for more than twenty-four hours, exceptin the oases covered by the present Convention.At first sight these provisions seemed to hoooaelnsiwlil hut it had to he admitted that the Articlereferred&apos;in fact to ports and it would he straining itsmeaning to say thSrft forbade belligerent ships to remain for mere than 84 hours in neutral waters, if they weretravelling..     The Prime Minister added that he thought thenot result of the exaainatian of the whole position wasthat the use made by Germany of Norwegian waters wasa violation of neutrality and that our violation ofSforwegiaa neutrality had boon justified.fhe, Prime Minister then referred to the forthcoming visit&apos;of Mr. $alias.    There was little more to sayon this topic at present, as Mr. ifellee had not yet arrived in Europe.    He thought, however, thattho dangers which might have followed from the visithad largely been averted by the clear indicationsgiven %n behalf of the American Government that there &apos;was no suggestion that the visit was a peace move or was likely to result&apos; la a Peace Conference.we had been closely watching events in Italy.,At the&quot; moment, when we had- hoped to secure a trade agreement with Italy, Mussolini had &quot;jibbed&quot;.   Sir percy loraine thought that this was due to German pressure.It now seemed possible that Mussolini had not even yetsaid his last word.     In taeVevent a new situation might arise --iff we stopped the importation into Italy of german coal.   ...
coalA    The general position seemed to he that Mussoliniheld the key; that he took no advise and that his gamewas to avoid if possible giving any advantage to eitherbelligerent.    He might now be foreed to come to adecision to support one side or the other at an early date.The Prime Minister than gave Ministers a short,account of the coal situation at home and explained the steps which he had taken to avoid a public debate onthe matter, which would have disclosed to the Germanethe considerable measure of success they had achieved instopping coastwise shipping.     Though he hoped that thisimmediate danger was now over, there was no doubt thatthe shortage of coal would give us anxiety for some timeyet.&apos; The Prime Minister then referred to therecent Debates in the-.gar Cabinet on the man-powerproblem.     It was. he said, obvious that big changesin the labour position would be needed.     The Cabinet&quot;hoped to obtain more regular and more detailed statements of the true labour position and other aspects of the imn-power problem Here being worked out. IThe Prise Minister referred to .the speech which ;. -he was to make in Birmingham on February 24th, and expressed his gratitude to those $misters who had suppliehim with material.   He explained that as the shape of the jspeech had had to be somewhat recast it was now possible,that he would not bo able to make as full use of this - j - -material on taia occasion as he had hoped.Finally, the Prime Minister asked the ministers present what their views were on the present trend cEpublic opinion in this country.   He thought that therewere possibly some indications that the public werebeing- a&apos;little bit restless end uncomfortable.    It was)%. possible; ... ,&apos;;
possible thai German propaganda was having some effects on the whele* however, ho believed that the spirit ofthe country was very good and that there was no needfor any real anxiety.    He had been favourableImpressed with the first broadcast of *0alookerw and.thought that the right line te take about Lord &quot;law-Haw&quot;wbb to keep pointing out that he was an enemy *The ^n^ffjtsr,. information said that he fullyagreed with the Prime Minister&apos;s commendation of&quot;Onlooker*sM broadcast.    He would like to see a broadcast by *i$alo0kerw every night and was discussing the possibilities with the B.B.C.   The ^nl^t^r ,,0-ffli^i^pr^ said that it had been suggested to htmthat it would he very useful if &quot; onlookerB were to broadcast at regular times 5ust as Lord &quot;Haw-Haw&quot;did.The See^tarr. of aflate f,or. ffootLand said thathe did not believe Lord ^Saw-Haw&quot; had much effect,as he was commonly regarded as a joke.The Minister of; Health aaid that Lord &quot;Haw-Haw&quot;had said recently that &quot;the 5/- pension4&apos; in thiscountry had been withdrawn.    He- was - surprised that theGermans should think it worth while to make suchobviously foolish statements.    He thought that there might be -advantage in popularising even moresome of our successes s*g. by placing on view capturedenemy aeroplanes.The Lord Chancellor asked whether it was our -intention to atop the importation into Italy ofGerman coal, or whether there was any likelihood ,that the importation of our own coal would be curtailed owing to Italian difficulty     making payment^He wondered what the results of either of these courses$Mk would .M
would bo.    would it be possible for us to buy more. of -other commodities from Italy in order to-enable her to purchase eoal*Mr. Orosji said that we were doing all that weoould., but that we had included in the agreementeverything that we could purchase from Italy.    Goalowners, were beginning to refuse to supply coal toItaly, but steps had been taken to prevent this difficulty arising for a month.^he -Lord ,jgrea^cnt suggested that if Italy were unwilling to supply us with war material, she mightbe prepared to sand it to Finland.gbe, .Pr,fep i&amp;tnlatsr then gave the Ministers presenta short account of.a recent incident in which we had captured a merchant ships   firing a few shots at herbridge had prevented her from scuttling herself.Finally, attention was drawn to the fact that our losses at sea had been somewhat heavier recently.The Lord Chancellor expressed the gratitude ofthe Ministers present to the Prime Minister for havingreceived them.
