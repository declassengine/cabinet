AIR MINISTRY, WHITEHALL- ON WEDNESDAY, 8TH JANUARY, 1941.Present;Secretary of State for Air (in the Chair)Mr. L.S. AmeryColonel J.T.C. Moore-BrabazonMr. M. MacDonaldMr. H, MorrisonMr. R.H. CrossMr. R.S. HudsonDr. H. DaltonLord WooltonCaptain H.H. Balfour.Secretary;Mr. R.H. Melville.A summary of the topics dealt with by the Secretaryof State is as follows..Fi ght e r C ommand *The last three months a period of little fighting andof building up at home.      Some 70 squadrons operational now as opposed to some 64 in September and a surplus of pilots&apos; on thestrength of Fighter-Command at the present time.      Fighter Commandnow stronger than ever before and the position therefore satis-factory so far as it goes. . (See reference to pilot and crewsituation later on.)iighter Command definitely much stronger -in rolatiowp-Irethe Cermansyin relation to the coming Spring battle.      Changesin the ^V^nTQn of Commander-in-Chief .-e** Sir Hugh Dowding&apos;s mission to America.      Changes in Group Commanders.Cur main effort now concentrated on night interception.The German beams and our counter measures^Jlecoy fires.      The-other forms of night interception.     Fighter developments.      &apos;^heBsaufighter and 8-gun fighters.      Guns with&quot;G.L.&quot; Aerial mines.Some slight success on all these lines.      We can definitely saythat our scientific devices are of great and increasing value.Three bottle-necks :-    (i) training;    (ii) engineering; and(iii) maintenance.&apos;     &quot;Ye .have squadrons formed and equipped withthe new devices and a number operating, but we are expending .    . - &apos;at the present time less effort at night in order to carry outtraining by day.      Pilots&apos;  initial lack of faith in the newinstruments.      Better apparatus how on the stocks.;Coastal Command.Reference/Government decision that it should remainan integral part of the Air Force, operational control beingas always with the Admiralty; the main development an increase,in the number, of squadrons.      14 attacks on submarines carriedout during the past,two months.      This not perhaps a very largefigure but to keep a submarine down is half the battle.Activities against the Focke Wulf.     Attacks on Bordeaux(the Focke Wulf base) and Lorient (submarine base).      attacks by the squadrons from Wick on the Oslo - Bergen railway.
Succeeded in possibly putting it out of aiiftek for several months the Botha a great disappointment. :. SBomber Command.- . &apos; /&apos;The Air Staff aim still directed principally atGermany&apos;s oil reserves, but subject to frequent diversionas required for other targets, for example submarine bases,naval bases and on Mannheim and Bremen.     these two being: adirect attack on civilian-morale designed partly to satisfypublic opinion in this&apos; country.     A further concentration of&apos;the oil attack due to be discussed by the DefenceCommittee on Operations.     After oil communications comessecond In order of importance as a target and power third.Difficulties of effective attack on Berlin owing todistance and weather.The expansion of the Eomber Command.      No actualincrease In squadrons largely owing to the necessity to send a number of aircraft and squadrbns abroad to the Middle East,but definite, increase in bomb-dropping capacity, say 14 %.Halifax,&quot; Stirling and Manchester now in squadrons but not .operational.      Day bombing in a European theatre of wardifficult unless air&apos;&quot;mastery obtained.     That effective daybombing is not always out of the question is, however,  shown by our operations in the Middle East.      The relative effective-&quot;ness of .our bombing attack on Germany and theirs on us.Their&apos; weight of attack certainly greater but our aimingmuch more accurate.      Dr. Dalton agrees.      Our damage to german war effort definitely.greater than their damage toours.     The effectiveness of bombs, in relation-to reportsof failures. Light calibre bombs are needed for certaintargets, e.g. the hydrogenation plants.    If these hit a road,for example, they appear Ineffective.      But general trend inthe Air Force now towards using heavier bombs.    Failure ofNaples raid due to faulty maintenance  of bombs and aircraftowing to suddenly improvised arrangements at Malta.Middle East.iJhis primarily a success for the Army but definitelya victory for the Air Force as well.     Steady decrease in italian strength since 9th December and their serviceabilitynow not more than 50^.      On the contrary our force has increased during    the fighting.      NeVerthefess we are still the weakernumerically.     At the beginning of the battle we were in anumerical inferiority of four or three to one.      Our inferiorityis now something less than two to one, but we have colossal&quot;moral^ and also technical superiority.Latest number of Italian aircraft destroyed In the-air or on the ground in the fighting Is 156,  ours is 16.This partly achieved by the fact that we got our attack in first and destroyed a number of aircraft on their aerodromes.Italian air tactics^ attacking forward troops instead of communications and^back areas.     No German aircraft yetoperating in the battle..    Some German aircraft in Italybut no sign that they will be manned by German pilots.In Greece owing to weather and topographicalconditions, fighting ijr$-a different order and forces. operating on each side more even.     The Greek Air Forceitself extremely small. ,    Strength of R.A.F. now operating in Greece. -   We have withdrawn the personnel of oneGladiator Squadron to form a new Hurricane Squadron in Egypt.
The question of diverting a.much greater air effort to greece in view of success in Libya is now under consideration.Casualties in Greece in air fighting two to one in our favour.Production.In spite of air attack on the industry, an improve-ment since September although some setback in December.     Theprincipal effect of enemy bombing is to damage the morale ofthe workers.     Material damage not very considerable.American imports 90 a month in November and some increasein December.     Likely to reach 1,250 by the end of the year as ,an optimum figure.     Problems of getting them across...German production definitely on the increase andthe Air Ministry in&apos;conjunction with M.E.W. have recentlyrevised their estimate.     Possibility of reaching 2,400 amonth by April.Italian production at the outside 450 a month buttypes of inferior quality.Dominion production.      Australia making Beaufortsand Vsfirraways, Canada making a variety of types.      Canadacontributing to the E.A.T.S.Relative strengths of British and, German Air forces as between May and December showissg. increase in tne &apos;ti,A.b&apos;.and a decrease in&quot;the German figures, but the German figuredcannot be taken as 100% accurate and there is correspondingdifficulty in determining what British figures should be quoted to compare with them.      The whole question of thestrength of the German Air Force now being enquired intounder a committee under an independent chairman.     pilots and crews.      On 28th December a surplus of all types of&quot;&quot;crew personnel in all Commands but the situation for thefuture not satisfactory in relation to the great expansionrequired.      Output of pupils being delayed by weather andthe weather affects also the aerodrome construction programme,^shortage in advanced trainers.     The setback to the Cheetahengine.      The many various expedients being undertaken to overcome the shortage of trainer aircraft.     The necessityfor ploughing back trained pilots into the Instructionalstaff.     No reserves of trained pilots in existence.     Winterwastage certainly less than Summer, amounting to perhapsbetween 350 and 400 a month, but it is the expansion forwhich provision has to be made.
