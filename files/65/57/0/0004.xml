The view was expressed by some Ministers that it was undesirable to issue any Communiqufe on the matter until we sawwhat the Germans put out.     The general view of the Meeting  .was, however, that it was desirable on balance to issue a communique to forestall the Germans, but that the Comiiiuniqueshould be very much shorter than the draft proposed.^ It was arranged that a shorter version of theCJ Communique should be prepared, and submittedto the Foreign Secretary in the course of the afternoon, for approval.armistice with ITALY.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.I.,8th September, 1943
