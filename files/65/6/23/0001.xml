The air situation.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 3.)R.A.F. activity.Enemy activity.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that bad weather hadinterfered with the effectiveness of air operations in general duringthe previous three days. A number of bombs had been dropped on enemy Flak ships in the course of operations by our bombers, but without result.On the morning of the 31st March, three or four enemy aircraft had appeared over Scapa. Ships and shore batteries had openedfire and fighters had been sent up, but without result. No bombs had been dropped.On the same day an enemy reconnaissance had been intercepted by our fighters 80 miles to the Eastward of Southend, and one enemy aircraft had been damaged.In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for Air undertook to make enquiries as to the German claim, reported in the press that morning, to have shot down seven French fighters in an airbattle on the Western Front without sustaining any loss.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 4.)Frenchsubmarinesunder british control.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it had beenfound necessary to run the homecoming Norwegian convoy in two parts, consisting of 40 and 36 ships respectively. The escortingof these large convoys involved a considerable strain on our destroyerforces.The mine-sweeper Sutton had been damaged by a mine on the30th March.   She was now safely at Immingham.La Sibylle, the first of the six French submarines which would operate from Harwich under British control, was now on patrol.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 5.)Supreme WarCouncil: 6thMeeting.Royal marine operation.proposed operation in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing-of importance to report.4. The Prime Minister said that intimation had been received on the previous day, through M. Mandel, that the French war committee had failed to endorse the resolution of the Supreme WarCouncil on the subject of the Royal Marine Operation. Later inthe day, the French Ambassador had asked for an interview.He (the Prime Minister) had discussed with the foreign secretary and the First Lord of the Admiralty the line which heshould take with M. Corbin, and it had been decided that he shouldpoint out that we had agreed to the plan for action in norwegian territorial waters, and the Royal Marine Operation, as a whole.If we were to carry out the former plan only, we should be accused of violating the neutrality of a small nation. We could, however,overcome this criticism if, at the same time, we took vigorous and effective action against Germany herself in her own waters.He had seen M. Corbin, who had been in a gloomy andapologetic mood. M. Reynaud had instructed him to say that hehad, unfortunately, failed to convince the War Committee of the advisability of reversing, their previous decision on the subject ofthe Royal Marine Operation. The objection had come from[21086] b 2
M. Daladier, on the grounds that the Germans might take reprisals against French munition and aircraft factories. M. Corbin had read to him a Note which contained the conclusion of the war committee, and which proposed a postponement for three monthsof the execution of the Operation. Apparently the delay of threemonths would enable the French to disperse their factories.In reply, he had put forward to M. Corbin the reasons whya delay of three months would be undesirable, and had stressedparticularly the importance of surprise. In three months a leakagemight well occur. He had then spoken on the lines previously agreedupon, and had pointed out that, if the Royal Marine Operationwere not to be carried out, we must reconsider our decision withregard to Norway.M. Corbin had enquired whether, in that case, we proposed todo nothing; and he had said that this was so, and had pointedout how embarrassing this would be for M. Reynaud. M. Corbinhad then said that M. Reynaud thought that if he (the PrimeMinister) and the Foreign Secretary were to go to Paris for anothermeeting, they might succeed in removing the objections of the war committee.In reply, the Prime Minister had pointed out that it wouldbe very unfortunate to meet with another disappointment. On thewhole, he was inclined to think that the French objections were probably, in part, the results of political manoeuvring in which case the statement he had made to M. Corbin that the two operationsmust stand or fall together ought to have a salutary effect.Discussion ensued as to whether we should proceed with that part of the programme agreed to at the Supreme War council which consisted of the presentation that day by the French andBritish Governments of analogous Notes to the Governments of norway and Sweden.There was general agreement that the presentation of the Notesshould be held back until the French reaction to the Prime Ministerscommunication to M. Corbin were known, since otherwise the FrenchGovernment would argue that we would be bound to follow up the notes with early action, and would therefore maintain their refusal to carry out the Royal Marine Operation. At the same time, inview of the leakage of our intentions which had already takenplace in France, and of the general expectation, not only in thiscountry but elsewhere, that we were about to take some drastic action, it would be necessary to proceed with the plan for actionin Norwegian territorial waters without too much delay. Theright procedure, therefore, would be to wait for a day or two, inthe hope that the French attitude would change, and then to proceedwith the original plan, unless something unforeseen occurred inthe interval.The Secretary of State for War enquired whether the Frenchveto on the Royal Marine Operation extended to that part whichwould be carried out by us from the air.It was pointed out, in discussion, that we had devoted much time to preparations for this operation, and it would be undesirable to establish the principle that we must consult the French before embarking on every offensive act.The Prime Minister thought that it would be unwise to proceed in defiance of the French attitude, and might have most unfortunate results on Allied unity. We should, of course, make a strong case to the French for carrying out the project from the air.The War Cabinet then considered a Report by the Chiefs ofStaff covering a directive issued to the Service Staffs&apos;(W.P. (40) 115),The terms of this directive were approved.
The War Cabinet then considered a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P.. (40) 116),containing : (1) A draft message to neutral shipping on German internalnavigable  waters   for  broadcasting  by  the   british broadcasting Corporation.(2) A draft public declaration regarding action against german shipping for broadcasting by the British broadcasting corporation and French stations.In regard to both documents the Foreign Secretary said that,in consultation with the First Lord of the Admiralty, he had worked out a provisional time-table. In view, however, of the decision that the Notes to Norway and Sweden should not be presentedthat day, this, time-table might have to be reconsidered.The Prime Minister agreed, but thought that, it was neverthelessdesirable to settle the text of these two documents at the present meeting.The first document contained in the Foreign Secretary&apos;sMemorandum was approved without amendment, but with regardto the second document (Draft Declaration to be broadcast by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation and French stations) thefollowing amendments were agreed : Paragraph 3. To insert at the beginning, before the words&quot; On the other hand,&quot; the following sentence : &quot; Allied operations have never been aimed at putting in jeopardy a single neutral shipor neutral life.&quot;Paragraph 5, line 6. Instead of the words &quot; restore the balancewantonly disturbed by the&quot; to substitute the words &quot; to counter the.&quot;Paragraph 7, page 5, line 3. The sentence beginning &quot; TheAllies, however, will certainly . ...&quot; to the end of the paragraph to be redrafted as follows : &quot; .... If the successful prosecution of the war&apos;now requiresthem to take such measures, world opinion will not be slow to realise both the necessity under which they are constrainedto act and the purpose of their action. Their purpose in this war is to establish principles which the smaller States ofEurope would themselves wish to see prevail and upon whichthe very existence of those States ultimately depends. TheAllies of course will never follow the German example ofbrutal violence, and any action they decide to take will always be carried out in accordance with the dictates of humanity.&quot;Paragraph 8. To begin &quot; 8. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomand the French Government have accordingly resolved to denythe continued, use by the enemy of stretches of territorial waters . . . .&quot;The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the communication received from the FrenchGovernment asking for a postponement of the royal marine Operation, and approved the reply made by thePrime Minister.(ii) Agreed that the presentation of Notes to the Governmentsof Norway and Sweden should be postponed until thefurther reactions of the French Government were known.(iii) Approved the Report by the Chiefs of Staff, and the directive issued by them (W.P. (40) 115).(iv) Approved the draft message and draft public Declarationprepared by the Foreign Secretary (W.P. (40) 116),subject to the amendments agreed upon in discussion.
(v) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to concert with the Foreign Secretary his time-table forinforming the Dominion Governments of the action beingf       taken.Turkey.Proposed visit by the foreign secretary.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad received a telegram from our Ambassador in Ankara, on thesubject of his proposed visit to Turkey. The Ambassador was somewhat doubtful of the advisability of the step. His chiefobjections were, first, that the visit might not lead to concreteresults, and, secondly, that it would give the Turks an opportunityfor asking for more credits or munitions. He also reported thatthe Turks, although they deplored the fate of the Finns, were notin any way depressed about their own situation.In view of the Ambassador^ remarks, the Foreign secretary said that he proposed to defer a decision on his visit until he had had an opportunity for conversation with Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, who would be home by the end of that week.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Norway.Chartering ofNorwegiantankers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 68thConclusions,Minute 2.). 6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to aproposal, which had previously been before the War Cabinet, that,in our negotiations with Norway to secure additional tankers, we might consider bartering AA. guns, of which the Norwegians stood in great need. The proposal had not been accepted, but he had now received a suggestion that something might be done if wecould offer them Gladiator aircraft. He proposed to take thequestion up with the Secretary of State for Air.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.(previous references:W.M. (40) 74thConclusions,Minute 4, andW.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 6.)precautions against possiblechange of policy.7. The Secretary of State for War referred to a letter datedthe 31st March, 194.0, which (in common with the other service ministers) he had received from the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, on the subject of the Italian situation. In this letter theForeign Secretary had said that, although the recent information from Italy was not in any way conclusive, he felt, after duereflection, he could not guarantee that Italy would not at once join the Reich as a belligerent, should the Germans launch their&quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; and obtain what might be interpreted as an initialsuccess. He (the Secretary of State for War) enquired what degreeof publicity might be incurred in preparations and moves in theMediterranean area.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his letterhad not been intended to be more than a danger signal. information from Italy was somewhat conflicting, and the general impression was that Signor Mussolini would not take any violent initiative,unless military events appeared to be going against the Allies.While we should of course avoid any action which might lookprovocative, or betoken alarm, he did not think we need be toosensitive of Italian opinion in any precautionary steps that we might consider it necessary to take, partictdarly as the Italians themselveshad strengthened their forces in Libya.
British Land 8.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theForces in Secretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 113) setting out the revisedFrance. draft instructions for the Commander-in-Chief of the british position of the Expeditionary Force in France.:Oommander-in- The Secretary of State for War said that the position of theChief in relation Commander-in-Chief vis-a-vis the French High Command had nowto the French Deen cleared up by the exchange of letters between the Chief of high Command, Imperial General Staff and General Gamelin.

(40) 73rd fresh instructions in the event of the present delegation of theConclusions, command of the British Expeditionary Force by General GamelinMinute 8.) to General Georges being modified.The War Cabinet: (a) Approved   the   revised    draft   instructions   for   theCommander-in-Chief of the British ExpeditionaryForce in France contained in W.P.
