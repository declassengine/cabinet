Sweden: Pro-posed AlliedMission.Swedish gold reserves.Swedish oil stocks.British repre-sentatives.1. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that a message had been received from the British Embassy, Paris, theprevious night, that the French Government had decided to send a mission to Sweden immediately consisting of M. Coulondre andGeneral Mittelhauser. The object of the Mission was to encourage the Swedes to maintain a firm attitude against German demands.The British Ambassador had informed the French Governmentthat, in his view, it was essential that, if any such Mission was despatched, it should be an Allied Mission. It had been arranged that the French Representatives should travel via this country inorder that His Majesty&apos;s Government might be consulted, and thatarrangements should be made, if it were so decided, for british representatives to proceed with them to Sweden.The Prime Minister said that, accompanied by the foreign secretary and the Service Ministers, he had seen the french representatives that morning just before the Meeting of the WarCabinet. It had been agreed that British Representatives shouldbe added to the Mission. He had agreed with the French viewthat everything possible should be done to stiffen Swedish resistance to German pressure. He thought that our Mission should be instructed to say that, if Sweden was prepared to fight Germany,the Allies would support her to the maximum extent within their power. At the same time in present circumstances, now that the ports of Bergen and Trondhjem were in enemy hands, we should not give specific assurances as to any action which we could take insupport of Sweden. We could tell the Swedes, however, of the narvik expedition. We should also press on the Swedes theimportance of preventing the Germans from capturing the ore fieldsand of not allowing the Germans to use Swedish railways. Weshould also point out to them that the threat to destroy all plantin the ore fields would be a powerful weapon in their hands in resisting German demands.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that some ofthe Norwegian railways passed through Swedish territory. It was important that the Swedes should prevent the Germans from usingthose portions of the lines. He thought that we should do all wecould to persuade the Swedes to declare war on Germany; and weshould make it clear to the Swedes that, if they took up arms intheir own defence, we would make common cause with them. Atthe same time we should not make them any specific promises suchas the immediate bombing of Berlin if the Germans bombedStockholm.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that we should make sure that the Central Bank of Sweden placed their gold in a safeplace. It seemed certain that the Germans had seized the gold reserves of Denmark and also, possibly, of Norway. He proposedto arrange with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for thenecessary warning to be given to Sweden on this point.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that the Swedesshould be pressed to destroy their oil stocks, if there was dangerof their falling into German hands.The Prime Minister said that the French representativeswished to fly to Sweden during the coming night. They had arrived in a French aircraft and it had been proposed that theAllied Mission should all go to Sweden in this machine.In the course of discussion, however, it was agreed that it was desirable for the party to be split up and to travel in two aircraft.The Chief of the A ir Staff undertook to provide a british aircraft for the purpose.The War Cabinet were informed that the British representa-tives of the Allied Mission would consist of Admiral Sir EdwardEvans, Major-General Lewin and the Air Attache in Stockholm.[21142]b 2
The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 87thConclusions.Minute 1.)Operations overScandinavia.Attacks onU-boats.Air attack onScapa.Air attack onStavangeraerodrome.2. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War cabinet of the results of the reconnaissances of Norwegian Ports carriedout on the previous day. At Bergen a. cruiser had been seenalongside the wharf. A large oil patch had been seen, which gaveground for believing that the second cruiser at this port, which hadbeen attacked on the previous day, had been sunk. Two cruisers anda number of destroyers and transports had been sighted atTrondhjem, and large numbers of aircraft at Stavanger.On the previous day aircraft had dropped bombs on two U-boats off the coast of Norway and on a U-boat east of Duncansby Head.The last-named attack had appeared promising.Successive waves of German aircraft had carried out anabortive raid on Scapa on the previous day. Four enemy aircraft had been brought down by our fighters and two more were thought to have been destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. A considerable numberof bombs had been dropped in the Flow and on the Islands, but no damage had been done.A long distance Blenheim fighter had attacked German aircraft on the ground at Stavanger. One German bomber had been destroyed, and a number of machines were thought to have been damaged. The British aircraft had been heavily engaged by anti-aircraft fire but had returned, safely.The First Lord of the A dmiralty raised the question whether,in view of the successful operation of this single aircraft, further attacks on a greater scale should be launched against Stavangerwhile the base was still, to a certain extent, disorganised, and before the anti-aircraft defences had been fully established.In further discussion the view was expressed by the Secretaryof State for Air and the Chief of the Air Staff that, while therewas much to be said for an attack on this aerodrome in suitableconditions, a daylight raid carried out in a clear visibility was not likely to result in damage to the enemy which would justify the casulties that it might be expected would be sustained, bearing inmind especially the need for conserving our bomber force.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 87thConclusions,Minute 2.)H.M.S. Renownand the scharnhorst.3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it had now beenlearned that in the early morning of Tuesday, the 9th April,H.M.S. Renown, in a very heavy gale with intermittent snow storms,had sighted what was probably the Scharnhorst, and a cruiser ofthe Hipper class, near the Vest Fjord. She had opened fire at18,000 yards. The enemy had replied three minutes later. Hits hadbeen observed on the forward superstructure of the Scharnhorst, and her armament had immediately stopped firing. Later, the afterturret had fired with local control, and it was clear that the centralfire control had been shot away. A vertical column of black smokehad then been seen to rise from the Scharnhorst, probably indicatingfurther hits, and the Hipper cruiser had then turned between thecombatants, laying a smoke screen. Both enemy ships had succeeded in making their escape Northwards.The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to bearin mind the points raised in discussion in preparing thedraft instructions for the Mission.I&quot;See also Minutes 6 and 7 below.]
One shell had gone through the Renown&apos;.? foremast, shootingaway the wireless aerial, but otherwise doing no damage, andanother right through the hull near the water-line withoutexploding.   There had been no casualties.No further news of the action at Narvik had been received,other than the account given to the House by the Prime minister the previous afternoon, which had made it clear that we hadinflicted very considerable damage. One destroyer had probably been sunk by torpedo and three had been seen to be on fire when our destroyers had withdrawn. A German ammunition ship, whichhad been approaching the harbour, and six merchant ships in the harbour, had also been sunk. It was hoped that the stores andammunition of the German force had been destroyed. The latest reports estimated the strength of the German detachment asbetween 1,000 and 3,000 men.The First Lord then gave the War Cabinet details of proposed naval action in this area.The Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm had attacked a Germancruiser at Bergen the day before, and had secured three hits by dive-bombing. Subsequent reconnaissance had shown that the cruiserhad been sunk as there had been a patch of oil a mile long where she had been lying.The First Lord then gave details of proposed future action bythe Fleet Air Arm.Our submarines had been active in the Skagerrak and theKattegat.H.M.S. Triton had attacked a convoy of 15 ships and had heardfour hits.H.M.S. Sunfish had sunk two merchant vessels.Both these submarines and others had been heavily attacked by enemy anti-submarine vessels, but without success.H.M.S. Spear fish had reported sighting a German battle cruiser South-bound off the Skaw at 12-30 a.m. on the 11th April.The First Lord then gave details of the movements of the mainfleet.Destroyers were systematically combing the West coast of norway for German ships, and had intercepted the Europa,3,767 tons, and the Alster, 8,514 tons. The latter had been captured in spite of attempts to scuttle herself.The First Lord said that, as already reported by the Secretaryof State for Air, the German air raid on Scapa the night beforehad been a complete failure. The Germans had lost 10 per cent,of their force, and had done no damage. The defence of fighters and batteries was evidently getting into good working order.The First Lord then &quot;informed the War Cabinet of the stepsbeing taken to occupy the Faroe Islands.The First Lord thought that the naval situation was, on thewhole, encouraging. The German cruiser force had almost been destroyed, and when the situation on the Norwegian coast had been cleared up we should experience some relief. This would enable us to take any steps which might be necessary vis-a-vis Italy in theMediterranean. On the other hand, the fact that Herr Flitler hadsacrificed his Navy to bring off this coup in Norway indicated thatit was only the prelude to more serious operations designed to finishthe war.There was general agreement with this view.
The Secretary of State for Air hoped that an appreciation ofthe situation on these lines would be sent to Rome to strengthen the hand of His Majesty&apos;s Minister in countering the adverse reportsappearing in the Italian Press.The Foreign Secretary undertook to see that adequate material was sent, both to Rome and Tokyo, if this had not already been done.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 84thConclusions,Minute 3.)4.   The Secretary of State for War said that the Frenchreported that they had observed precursive signs of attack in theWest, such as increased wireless traffic, the movement of tanks,No particular area was specified, but they were drawing attention of the Belgian Staff to the facts.Apart from this, there was nothing to report.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.&amp;c.theOperation 5.   The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinet&quot;Rupert.&quot;        information of the progress in the preparations for Operation&quot;RUPERT.&quot;A record of his statement is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of WTar Cabinet Conclusions.6. The Prime Minister drew attention to TelegramNo. 187 (R.), dated 10th April, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Stockholm, in which Mr. Mallet reported having heard from an absolutely sure source that the King of Norway and his Governmentwere then negotiating with the German Minister at Elverum.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that on theother hand, Mr. Mallet had reported on the same day (TelegramNo. 194 (R.)) that the Norwegian Legation in Stockholm hadtransmitted a message to him that President Hambro had put beforethe Norwegian Government the question of co-operation with theBritish and French forces, and that the Government had given instructions to the military authorities for such co-operation. TheForeign Secretary added that the Foreign Office were temporarilyout of touch with Sir Cecil Dormer, but were trying to re-establishcontact. Even if the Norwegian Government were to collapse,however, there would be no need for us to change our present plans.The Minister without Portfolio said that the present footingof the German detachments in Norwegian ports must be precariousand that any measure of resistance which the Norwegians could put up would be of great value. Every effort should be madeto establish contact with the Norwegian Government and tostrengthen their morale.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff agreed with this view,and added that even in summer the railway lines from Oslo toTrondhjem and Bergen were highly vulnerable. The railway was now deep in snow.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that admiral Evans, on completing his Mission in Stockholm, should proceed to Norway with the object of putting fresh heart into theNorwegian Government. This suggestion met with general approval.Norway: atti-tude ofNorwegianGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 87thConclusions,Minute 5.)
Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 87thConclusions,Minute 9.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams containing indications of how italian policy might develop : Telegram No. 286, Saving, dated the 9th April, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris. Dr. Weiszmann had communicated the following, which had been received from hisanti-Fascist friends : (i)signor mussolini was ready to enter a tripartite agreement with Germany and the U.S.S.R., and had so informed Herr Hitler at the meeting on the brenner; it was M. Stalin who had subsequentlyrefused to have anything to do with the plan,(ii) Signor Mussolini was anxious to enter the war on theGerman side, but was held back by the knowledge that the King and the bulk of the Italian people were against it; none the less, he was sufficiently strong to impose his Will on the country in the last resort.Sweden. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention      185Reported to the following telegrams, dated the 10th April, 1940, from Hisdemands of Majesty&apos;s Minister, Stockholm, as to the demands on the SwedishGerman Government alleged to have been made by Germany : Government. 1(,nTelegram No. 178.Mr. Mallet reported that the Swedish General Staff were very depressed and that certain notes had been presented by .the German Government. Whether one of these contained a request for the use of the Swedish railway via Gothenburg toOslo or through Sweden to Narvik could not be disclosed. the swedes were nervous and felt that if they refused any demandmade by Germany, they would be attacked by the German and soviet air forces. Sweden was believed to be carrying out asecret mobilisation.Telegram No. 179 DIPP.Mr. Mallet had learnt from a most reliable source that theGerman Government had that morning informed the swedish government that they would respect Swedish neutrality,provided that the Swedish Government, if requested, allowedthem to control the Swedish harbours, railways, telephoneservices, and air ports. Mr. Mallets informant consideredthe only hope of the Swedish Government refusing to complywith this demand lay in the immediate receipt of a definiteplan of Allied assistance on a substantially large scale.Telegram No. 188 DIPP.Mr. Mallet reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairswhom he had just seen, categorically denied that any demandfor transit facilities, &amp;c, had been received from the GermanGovernment, though he admitted that he feared that this mightbe Germany&apos;s next step. M. Guenther&apos;s personal opinion wasthat the Swedish Government would meet such demands witha blank refusal and would fight if attacked.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[See also Minute l above.]
Telegram No. 10 from Geneva, dated the 10th April. 1940,forwarding a report from Mr. Walters that the YugoslavDelegate at Geneva,, who was known on occasion to be wellinformed, bad stated privately that he had reason to believethat Italy intended to make a move against Salonica in thecourse of the week.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.TheMediterranean.Reportedpresence ofGermansubmarines.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Representative, Berne, reporting that the Swiss Government had learnt that there were german submarines in the Mediterranean. These submarines were reportedto be in the port of Malaga, and their crews, dressed as tourists,were said to have recently visited Madrid. It would be recalled thatthe French Government had already indicated that they proposedto take up with the Spanish Government the question of the allegeduse of the port of Vigo as a German submarine base.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Western Front.Attitude ofBelgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 87thConclusions,Minute 10.)Warning to theNetherlands.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris (telegram No. 71DIPP) to ask M. Reynaud to ascertain the views of general gamelin on the suggestion that the Belgian Government would bemore favourably disposed to co-operate with the Allies if given an assurance that the Allied forces would take up a more advancedposition. M. Reynaud had informed Sir Ronald Campbell thatGeneral Gamelin had replied : &quot; We can promise to do everything in our power to give satisfaction to the Belgian desideratum.&quot; Itwas necessary, however, for M. Reynaud to obtain M. Daladier&apos;concurrence before returning a definite reply (telegram No. 97,DIPP).The Foreign Secretary also drew attention to telegram No. 62from Brussels, reporting that an official Communique had beenissued after a meeting of the Belgian Cabinet that &quot; The Govern-ment was again unanimous in its desire resolutely to pursue thepolicy of independence and neutrality which had been followed sincethe outbreak of the war.&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that he had instructed our Ministerat The Hague to warn the Netherlands Government that, judgingby what had happened in Norway, it might be wise that the netherland authorities should keep a close watch on german merchant ships, of which a number were said to be present inNetherland ports.The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider whether it wouldbe an advantage that our Minister at Bucharest should drop asimilar hint to the Roumanian Government.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Trading withthe Enemy Act.Extension of area affected.11. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view ofevents in Scandinavia, it was desirable to issue an Order under the trading with the Enemy Act defining the area to which that Actshould now be extended; on such an Order being made, the ForeignOffice would make the necessary notifications to Foreign Missions.He suggested that under this procedure action should now be takento put the metropolitan territory of Denmark in precisely the same-position as Czecho-Slovakia and other countries which had beenoverrun by Germany. The Order would need to be carefully drafted in order to exclude from its scope Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and
possibly Gi^eenland. He would be opposed, at the present time, tothe inclusion in the Order of any reference to Norway. For themoment, the question was purely academic, since in fact no countries were now trading with Denmark; but it was desirable that theposition should be regularised.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he under-stood that the issue of such an Order would be likely to strengthen our position in Prize Court proceedings.The War Cabinet agreed That an Order should be made under the Trading with theEnemy Act applying the Provisions of the Act to themetropolitan territory of Denmark.Shipping.Treatment ofNorwegianshipping.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 87thConclusions,Minutes 11and 12.)(W.M. (40) 86thConclusions,Minute 3.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theMinister of Economic Warfare had informed him that he had understood that the War Cabinet, on the previous day, had reachedthe conclusion that steps should at once be taken to intercept allNorwegian ships, in the same manner as had been agreed upon in the case of Danish ships. Instructions to this effect, however,had not been included in the Conclusions of the Meeting.It was explained that at the second Meeting on Tuesday,9th April, the War Cabinet had approved of action being taken to detain all Norwegian ships which were in our ports, and to divertNorwegian ships at sea into Allied ports. Action on these lines should, of course, be continued with full force until the position ofthe Norwegian Government became clearer, and the conclusions reached by the Cabinet on the previous day should be read in this sense. The War Cabinet had already decided that, in the eventof the capitulation of the Norwegian Government, the conclusionsrecorded as to the seizure or the detention of Danish vessels should apply to Norwegian vessels.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Press. 13    The Lord Privy Seal referred to the large headlines whichFalse reports of had appeared in most of the newspapers that morning reportingevents in the recapture of Bergen and Trondheim by British forces.   TheseScandinavia.      reports, which were without foundation, had given rise to a difficult situation, and were also damaging to the prestige of this country.It was explained that these reports came from a telegram received in the course of the night from New York, repeatingunconfirmed Press messages from Stockholm. Unfortunately, aconsiderable section of the Press regarded it as in - their interests to publish news of this kind without troubling whether it wasaccurate, in the hope that, if the report turned out to be true, theymight obtain an advantage over more scrupulous journals. Giventhis motive, it was difficult to see how action of this kind couldbe prevented by liaison between the Government and the Press.The Government could only stop this kind of action, if they took the extreme step of forbidding the publication of reports which hadnot been submitted for confirmation.It was pointed out that the B.B.C. were perhaps partly to blame on the present occasion, since on the midnight News theyhad announced the recapture of Bergen and Trondheim, and had only indicated at the end of the announcement that this report wasonly based on a telegram from New York.[21142] &quot; c
The Prime Minister suggested that the Lord Privy Seal, inconsultation with the Minister of Information, should seerepresentatives of the Press, and bring home to them the unfortunateconsequences, from a public point of view, of publishingsensational reports without taking steps to ascertain whether theyhad any foundation. If, after this meeting, the Lord Privy Sealthought that further action was called for, he would no doubtinform the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion, and invited the Lord Privy Seal to act on the lines proposed.Diversion ofShipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 60thConclusions,Minute 2.)14. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda onDiversion of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (40) 82, Revise, and 83).The Minister of Transport stated that the two papers now before the. War Cabinet showed the action which had been takento carry out the conclusions reached at the meeting referred to inthe margin. He was most grateful to Lord Chatfield for the helphe had given in supervising the action taken by a number of departments, and had found the authority of a member of theWar Cabinet invaluable in this matter. His own report and itsappendices dealt mainly with details, while Lord Chatfield&apos;sMemorandum was in the form of a commentary on his paper.In paragraph 8 of Lord Chatfield&apos;s paper the view was taken that no single factor, except perhaps the matter of deep-waterberths at West Coast ports, could be considered as a bottle-neck.A few such berths were being provided, but they necessarily tookmany months to construct. In paragraph 10 of his Report LordChatfield summarised the principal factors in the situation and stated that all these had been taken into account in his (the Ministerof Transports) paper.There was general agreement with the view originally expressedby Mr. Burgin, when Minister of Transport, that complete diversion of shipping from the East Coast would inevitably result in seriouscongestion on the West Coast, and that consequently diversionought not to be ordered, except in case of absolute necessity.As regards the three specific points on which Lord Chatfieldhad recommended further action in paragraph 12 of his paper,the following was the position : (i) Officers were being appointed the following week by theMinistry of Supply for the superintendence of theremoval of goods for which that Ministry were responsible; meanwhile their Movement Officers would act on their behalf.(ii) He had that morning heard from the Minister of Healththat he was prepared to exercise, if necessary, thepowers of compulsory billeting which he possessed &quot;underthe Defence Regulations for the purpose of securing the accommodation required for transferred dock labour.(iii) He was awaiting the authority of the Chancellor of theExchequer to enable the Board of Customs and Excise to waive any customs revenue which might be lost as aresult of dispensing with customs examination on thequays and docks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he understoodthat no difficulty was likely to arise in reaching a decision on thispoint, but he thought that it might be left until the situation which required it actually arose. He undertook to look further into thematter and to inform the Minister of Transport of his decision atan early date.
Chartering of The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that anDutch coasters, approach had been made to the Netherlancl Government with a view(previous reference:W.M. (40) 60thConclusions,Minute 2 (i).)to securing the chartering of additional Dutch coasters and that,in agreement with the Minister of Shipping and t)he Admiralty,he had offered to disclose to the Netherland Government the methodsadopted in this country for the demagnetisation of ships as an inducement to facilitate the provision of the coasters required. a reply from the Netherland Government was still awaited.The Minister of Shipping said that his predecessor had notbeen altogether happy about the position in regard to this mattergenerally, and that, while he had not yet himself been able to lookclosely into it, his professional advisers took the view that theestimate of the probable effects of diversion given in w.P. (G.) (40) 83 was perhaps rather too optimistic, and that insufficient account had been taken of the effect of a major diversion of shipping upon the export trade and upon our coal trade with france.He accordingly suggested that the matter might be remitted to a small meeting of Ministers whose Departments were concernedin the question, who might present a joint report to the WarCabinet.The Prime Minister thought that nothing had emerged fromthe discussion which need reverse any conclusion at which the WarCabinet had arrived, or which they were proposing to reach.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that theposition would be safeguarded by the fact that the War cabinet would not order a large-scale diversion of shipping, except in circumstances in which it appeared that worse results would occurby retaining the use of East Coast ports in the face of intense enemy air attack.The Assistant Chief of Naval Staff enquired whether theMinister of Transport was satisfied that he had sufficient powersto resolve difficulties, now that he was no longer able to rely onthe authority of a member of the War Cabinet to override depart-mental objections should these arise.The Minister of Transport replied that only one case had arisen since the outbreak of war where a difficulty had been experienced which had not been susceptible of settlement in theShipping Diversion Room when it arose. It was true, however,that in present circumstances he had now no specific authority to resolve difficulties without reference to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the Report by the Minister of Transport,setting out the plans and arrangements for dealing witha major diversion of shipping (W.P. (G.) (40) 82).(ii) Took note that no additional powers were now required toenable rapid progress to be made with the necessary preparations.(iii) Took note that, in the event of circumstances arisingrequiring the waiving of customs examination, thematter should be referred to the Chancellor of theExchequer, who would give a decision on behalf of theWar Cabinet.(iv) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to examine with theMinisters concerned the points raised in discussion bythe Minister of Shipping at &quot; A &quot; above, and to reportto the War Cabinet what, if any, amendments shouldbe made in the Memoranda submitted to the WarCabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,April 11, 1940.
