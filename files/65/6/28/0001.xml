The air situation.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 82ndConclusions,Minute 2.)RA.E. activity.Spreading offalse reportsregardingquality ofE.A.F.machines.1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that very bad weather hadhampered air activity on the previous day, but the usual patrols and escorts had been sent out.Nine Blenheims had been despatched on an offensivereconnaissance in the Jade and the Weser estuaries to locate and attack enemy warships, and particularly any German submarineswhich might be detected going seawards. The weather had been so bad that the leader had sent his formation back. He had himself gone on at a low height, and had penetrated to the SchilligRoads. Low cloud, however, had prevented him from confirmingprevious reports of the presence of enemy warships.Security patrols had been carried out over enemy seaplanebases during the night. Nothing unusual had been observed, exceptwell-lit ships 76 miles East of Spurn Point, probably neutrals.Two Blenheims had been sent out on reconnaissance in theearly hours of that morning. One had unfortunately crashed ontaking off. The other had got as far as Terschelling, but had turnedback as there had not been sufficient cloud cover. A special highaltitude photographic reconnaissance aircraft had since been sent out to try and take advantage of the good visibility.A number of special patrols had been flown the previous day to investigate a report of 60 small ships seen preceding Northwardsfrom Wilhelmshaven. The whole area in which they might havebeen found had been searched, but nothing had been seen.A Telegram had been received from the Commander-in-Chief,China, to the effect that the Manager of the American AircraftWorks in China, who had recently returned from the United Statesof America, was spreading reports that German fighters were muchsuperior to ours, and that, on a recent occasion, 27 British aircraft on an operation over Germany had all been destroyed.It was suggested that immediate counter-action should betaken : otherwise the report would spread throughout the East,and might be believed.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to investigate thematter and, in consultation with the Foreign Office and Ministryof Information, to set on foot the necessary action.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 82ndConclusions,Minute 3.)U-boat reportedoff Eire.2. The First Sea Lord gave the War Cabinet information about the movement of British and French naval forces, and ofcertain instructions sent to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.A report had been received from the High Commissioner in dublin that a German submarine was in Dingle Bay. destroyers had made a search, but had found nothing.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 82ndConclusions,Minute 4.)Distribution ofGermanDivisions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 74thConclusions,Minute 3.)Possible german intentions: theLow Countries.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that one more German Division had appeared opposite the MaestrichtPeninsula, and one was believed to have been moved from theextreme South.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to telegram No. 59 from The Hague, which conveyed rumours ofimpending German action against Denmark, Holland, and Belgium,which were regarded seriously by the Dutch. The Naval Attachehad been told that, according to information received by the Dutch,a serious move by the Germans was to be expected the following week.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thought the germans would be very rash to undertake an invasion of Holland and Belgiumon a very large scale, unless they could be certain of a spell ofreally fine weather. The number of troops they had deployed inthat area was about the same as in 1914-namely, 56 Divisions but these Divisions were mechanised to a much greater extent, andtheir movement would be seriously handicapped in the low countries, if it came on to rain hard.The Prime Minister thought the position was the same as ithad been for some time. An attack by the Germans was possibleany day, and, though it might not be an operation which would beundertaken by a reasonable man, the possibility of it being ordered by Herr Hitler could not be excluded. The important point was totake advantage of the situation to try and press the Dutch to takeus more into their confidence.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs thought that littlewould be possible in this way through political channels.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the military attache was doing his best to get information from the Dutch.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Peace Aims.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 07thConclusions,Minute 7.)U.S.A.suggestion foran Allieddeclaration.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 459 from our Ambassador at Washington, reporting that he had had an interview with the President of the UnitedStates, the Secretary of State and Mr. Welles. Discussion had turned on the fear which was universally prevalent in Germany,as a result of German propaganda, that an Allied victory impliedthe break-up of Germany into fragments. The suggestion had beendiscussed that the Prime Minister and the French Premier shouldmake some kind of joint declaration which would dispel this idea.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought that the discussion had been promising, and that the suggestion deserved furtherconsideration. He would examine the matter further, and bring it before the War Cabinet again on a subsequent occasion.
Roumania. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadSupplies of oil had a talk the previous day with the Roumanian Minister, whoto Germany. seemed very satisfied with the oil situation in Roumania.(Previous Dr. Clodius had put forward a number of requests to the reference:        Roumanian Government.   These demands had all been refused, andW.M. (40) 77th Dr. Clodius had not tried to exert any pressure. The Minister didConclusions,      not think that the Germans would be able to lift as much as 130,000Minute 1.)        tons of oil a month, and he thought that they contemplated sendingsome of the oil by sea to Italy for transit over the land frontier.The Roumanian Minister had remarked incidentally that the figureof 130,000 tons a month in the agreement with Germany was dueto a typist&apos;s error, the figure which had been agreed being 113,000tons a month.  The higher figure had been typed into the agreement which had been signed by the Roumanian Foreign Minister withoutthe error being noticed.As an indication of Germany&apos;s acute oil situation, theRoumanian Minister.had said that Dr. Clodius had pressed for the exclusion of the oil consumed by barges and trains from the total exports to Germany under the Agreement. The total amount involved was insignificant; nevertheless, the Germans evidentlythought that it was of sufficient importance to be discussed.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Scandinavia.Proposed actionin Norwegianterritorialwaters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 82ndConclusions,Minute 6.)Presentation ofBritish andFrench Notes.Reactions of theNorwegianGovernment.Reactions of theSwedishGovernment.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theBritish Note had, on the previous evening, been communicated : (a) By himself to the Norwegian and Swedish Ministers inLondon.(6) To the Norwegian and Swedish Foreign Ministers direct,at Oslo and Stockholm. In both capitals, the Britishand French Ministers had acted together in presenting the Note.The text of the Note, as presented, was contained in telegrams nos. 109 to Oslo and 131 to Stockholm, dated 4th April, andfollowed the lines of paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of W.P. (40) 112.The Foreign Secretary said that M. Colban had appeared tobe much upset at the terms of the Note. He had asked no questions about it. His comment had been that he feared our policy woulddrag his country into the war. He had apparently assumed thatwe had it in mind to carry out something on the lines of the Narvikoperation. He understood that M. Colban had said to Mr. Noel-Baker that, if we did so, the Norwegian Government would probablybe compelled to denounce our Shipping Agreement and that theGerman reaction might very likely be to seize one. of Norway&apos;ssouthern ports.No news had as yet been received from Sir Cecil Dormer as tothe Norwegian Foreign Minister&apos;s reception of the Note.The Foreign Secretary said that the Swedish Minister&apos;principal observation had been that the Norwegian and swedish governments would now have to consult together. M. Prytz had assumed that he was not expected to say anything at the moment,but he had expressed the opinion that one or two points in theAnglo-French Note were academic. M. Prytz had been quick tomake the point that his Government might revise their attitudetowards their War Trade Agreement with us. He had askedwhether we had any reason to be dissatisfied with his Governmentsobservance of the Agreement.
Three telegrams had come in from Mr. Mallet at Stockholm(Nos. 165, 166 and 167, dated 5th April). The substance of these telegrams was as follows : Telegram, No. 165 contained certain observations on theAnglo-French Notes made by Mr. Mallet before he had seen the Swedish Foreign Minister. He said that he knew that theSwedish Government were anticipating some demands from usregarding the iron ore question. His general impression wasthat they were in a mood to respond favourably to diplomaticpressure from us, even to the extent of agreeing to furthercontrol of their iron ore exports. Alternatively, they mightnot reject a clear demand from us that they should take certain specific action.If the Swedish Government chose to publish the Note,Mr. Mallet felt sure that their public opinion, now definitelyfriendly, would swing violently against the Allies.Telegram No. 166 described the presentation of the note to the Swedish Foreign Minister, by Mr. Mallet and the french minister. The Foreign Minister had asked certain questions and made certain comments, including the following : (a) His first remark had been &quot; This brings our countriesvery close to war.&quot;(b) He had asked where, when and how the Allies would exercise their &apos;&apos; right&apos;&apos; to stop Swedish exports of iron ore. Mr. Mallet had undertaken to refer thisquestion to the Secretary of State.(c) If we were merely intending to intercept at sea the shipments from Narvik, it was not so important,but why, in that case, were we threatening Sweden ?(d) He had wished to publish the Note at once.  Mr. Malletand the French Minister had persuaded him to wait until they could obtain their Governments&apos; con-currence, which he (the Foreign Minister) askedthem to request without delay.(e) He could not understand our point of view.   He had never expected to receive such a Note from twoGovernments which he had always regarded asSweden&apos;s friends.Telegram No. 167 contained Mr. Mallets comments made after the interview with the Swedish Foreign Minister. Hethought that the Swedish Foreign Minister&apos;s remark aboutbeing close to war should not be taken lightly, and that hisanxiety to publish the Note was probably to provide justifica-tion for a general mobilisation, which Mr. Mallet would not be surprised to see ordered on the following day, the 6th April.The effects of publication in Sweden would be disastrous.Mr. Mallet hoped that M. Prytz could be persuaded torecommend his Government not to publish it.The Foreign Secretary said that, in the light of these telegrams and of the reaction to which our Notes had given rise in Sweden, hehad given further consideration to the question whether the Notesshould be published. He thought that the best course would be toattempt to dissuade the Swedish Government from publishing the note, at any rate at the present time.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with this view.It was pointed out, however, that, as soon as action had been takento lay a minefield in Norwegian Territorial Waters, the norwegian government would be asked whether we had given any notice of our intention to take this action. This would probably lead to publica-tion of the Note.   There Avould, however, be less objection to the
publication of the Note when it had become clear that the only actionwhich we were taking for the time being was the laying of a mine-field in Norwegian Territorial Waters.The Foreign Secretary said that he thought that our Note had given rise to some misunderstanding. It even seemed as if the swedes thought that we contemplated landing forces in theircountry. He concluded, therefore, that we ought to send a sedativetelegram to Mr. Mallet. We should also try to follow upMr. Mallefs impression that the Swedish Government might beprepared to yield to diplomatic pressure.The Prime Minister suggested that a telegram should be sentto Mr. Mallet on the following lines : He should see the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs without delay, and tell him that he had reported the effect of his interview on the previous day. He should explain that the purpose of our Note had been to free our hands to meet the necessities of the future. He could give an assurance that we hadno intention of landing forces in Scandinavia unless the Germansforced our hands by taking such action themselves. He should not,therefore, allow his judgment to be influenced by anticipation of a situation which might never arise.Mr. Mallet should also be asked, by reference to paragraph 3 ofhis telegram No. 165, whether the Swedish Government would beprepared to take measures themselves to assist in reducing suppliesof iron ore to Germany.In conclusion, Mr. Mallet should say that he hoped that, asa result of the reassurance now given, the Swedish Governmentwould not press for hasty action in regard to publication.The following further points were made in discussion : (i) Mr. Mallet should be told for his personal information ofthe operation in Norwegian Territorial Waters, and thetime-table. He should also be told what use he could make of this information.(ii) The Foreign Secretary pointed out that, from Sweden&apos;spoint of view, there was an important difference betweenthe two ways in which it was open to us to use force inorder to interfere with her exports of iron ore toGermany : (a) by an operation at Narvik, and (b) by an operation in the Gulf of Bothnia. The second method would, he thought, certainly lead to a denunciation ofour War Trade Agreement with Sweden. In thisconnection the War Cabinet were informed that theChiefs of Staff would be considering early next week the implications of the latter operation.(iii) The Chief of the Naval Staff drew attention to para-graph 5 of telegram No. 167 DIPP from Stockholm.According to this, it did not look as though the Swedeswould allow the Germans to make an unopposed landing in their country.(iv) The Foreign Secretary thought it was important that, inany further interview which Mr. Mallet had with theSwedish Foreign Minister, he should make it clear thatour actions were directed entirely against Germany andwere the consequence of German disregard of Inter-national undertakings.Discussion in regard to detailed instructions for the proposed operation, and the conclusions reached, is recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
The War Cabinet-(i) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to send a telegram to our minister   at   Stockholm  on  the   lines  indicated   in discussion, and particularly at &quot;A.&quot;_j(ii) Agreed that publication of the Note should, if possible, be deferred for the present, at least until the operation in norwegian Territorial Waters had been carried out.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,April 6, 1940.
