Supreme WarCouncil: 8thMeeting.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 99thConclusions,Minute 6.)Operations in norway:discussion between theC.I.G.S. andGeneralGamelin.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 99thConclusions,Minute 4.)Operations in norway:discussion at theFirst Session ofthe Council(April 22nd).1. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account ofthe sessions of the Supreme War Council on the 22nd and23rd April. He had anticipated considerable difficulties, but theFrench had given us complete satisfaction and had accepted our views on all points discussed. The atmosphere throughout had been most cordial and friendly.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff had seen general gamelin before the session of the Supreme War Council on the22nd April. General Gamelin had agreed that we should use theFrench troops at whatever points we thought best in Norway,stipulating only that when we had passed beyond the stage ofnumerous small landings, we should, if possible, concentrate theFrench troops in one area in order to simplify administration.General Gamelin had informed the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff that M. Reynaud had at one moment been inclined to be critical of the British handling of the Norwegian operations.General Gamelin had been most appreciative of our attitude inrefraining from any reproaches in regard to the withdrawal of theA.A. cruiser from Namsos by the French Admiral. The PrimeMinister had thought it best to avoid any reference to this episode.Second Sessionof the Council(April 23rd).Air action in theevent of attackon holland and/or Belgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 99thConclusions,Minute 5.)At the session of the Supreme War Council on the 22nd he had explained that the limiting factors to the employment of allied troops in Norway were the lack of bases and aerodromes, and notshipping or man-power. At the same time, he had expressed our appreciation of the generous scale on which the French wereprepared to supply troops. The French had appeared to be quite satisfied that we were doing all that could be done.The French were content to leave the strategy of the operations to us. As would be seen from Resolution 2 of the First Session ofthe Supreme War Council (contained in W.P. (40) 135), the capture of Trondhjem was set down as the first objective. M. Reynaud had made it clear, however, that he realised that the main objective ofour operations was to deprive Germany of her iron ore. the capture of Trondhjem would, however, have an important psycho-logical effect.The Prime Minister said that he had brought home to theFrench the great difficulties of the operations and had emphasised that the Germans were still able to reinforce their forces in Norwaymore rapidly than we could.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in conversationwith M. Reynaud and General Gamelin, he had rather over-stated the seriousness of the situation in the Trondhjem area and had warned them that they must not be surprised if operations therewent badly for the Allies.The Prime Minister then gave an account of the session of theSupreme War Council on the 23rd April.The main point dealt with had been air action in the event ofa German attack on Holland or Belgium. On this point, where wehad anticipated considerable difficulty, the French had accepted our point of view.The Secretary of State for Air expressed great relief at thedecision reached. He thought that the French had been influencedgreatly by the offensive operations carried out by the Royal AirForce in the past two weeks.
Allied policyvis-a-vis Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 100thConclusions,Minute 5.)Possible allied action in theCaucasus.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 99thConclusions,Minute 6.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 11.)French morale.Two extremely optimistic telegrams had been received by theFrench from their Ambassador in Rome, normally the mostpessimistic of men, as to Italy&apos;s attitude. M. Francois-Poncet had had two conversations with Count Ciano, who had given a veryconfident account of his own position and had stated emphaticallythat the crisis was now passed. Count Ciano had said that italian policy had not changed, and had scouted any idea of adventure inthe direction of Yugoslavia or Corfu. The Supreme War council had agreed that, while the Allies did not want to provoke Italy, theywould have to take immediate action if the Italians committed any act of aggression. The French favoured an immediate landing salonika provided that we could obtain Greek assent. He (thePrime Minister) had pointed out, however, that Greek assent mightnot be forthcoming. It had been agreed that a joint approach should be made to the Greek Government as to their attitude inthe circumstances envisaged, and that, meanwhile, the practical implications of a landing at Salonika should be studied on theassumption that the Greeks would be in agreement.W7ith regard to operations in the Caucasus, the Prime ministers aid that he had pointed out that no action could be taken at ariearly date. At the moment, we could not spare bombers of the type which could operate against the Russian oil fields from Alliedterritory, while bombers of shorter range could only be operatedfrom Turkish territory. The French had agreed that it would be essential to obtain Turkey&apos;s assent to our aircraft flying overTurkish territory. In the meantime, the very fact that air attackon the Caucasus was a possibility would no doubt influence theattitude of Russia towards the Allies. The French had beeninformed of M. Maisky&apos;s approach and of the discussions whichwere taking place with regard to a trade agreement.In conclusion, the Prime Minister said that M. Reynaud was confident that the morale of his country had greatly improved duringthe last month and was now as high as it had ever been. the personal relations of M. Reynaud and M. Daladier also seemed tohave greatly improved, and M. Daladier now seemed to have over-come the humiliation which he had felt at seeing his almostunassailable position in France crumble overnight. The positionof the French Government appeared now to be very strong.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 101stConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.R.A.F. activity.Westerlandaerodrome.2. The Secretary of State for A ir said that during the previous day a few tracks had been plotted, two in the Wick area, one offYarmouth, one off Lowestoft and one off the Belgian coast. fighters had been despatched, but no interceptions had been made.The attack on the Westerland aerodrome, in the Island of Sylt,on the previous day by Wellingtons had been very successful. Ofthe twelve aircraft despatched eleven had attacked the target.Hits on the runways had been reported and many fires hadbeen started. Opposition had not been intense although A.A. firehad been encountered during the attacks. Some Messerschmitts 110had been seen but had made no attack. One of our aircraft had reported that the aerodrome had been lit up with the flare path inoperation. All our aircraft had returned. It had also been reportedthat very few machines had been observed on the ground.  The Air
Aalborgaerodrome.Trondhjem.stavanger aerodrome.Oslo.Staff thought that our attacks on these aerodromes were forcing theGermans to make more use of aerodromes in North-west Germany.Mine-laying. Twenty Hampdens had successfully carried out mine-laying operations, mainly in the two Belts, during the previous night.Three Hampdens had carried out 1&apos; Security&apos;&apos; patrols duringthe previous night and one of them had attacked two large motorboats which had opened fire. The pilot had reported that he hadhit these motor boats and thought that he had sunk one of them.A second pilot had been attacked by two Flak ships, one of whichwas believed to have been sunk.  All our aircraft had returned.Six Whitleys had attacked Aalborg aerodrome, but full reports were not yet available. The aerodrome had been bombed but noaircraft had been seen on the ground. One of our aircraft had notreturned.Six Whitleys had been despatched for an attack on JonsvatnetLake, near Trondhjem, which had been reported to be in use by theenemy, but no reports were yet available. All our aircraft had returned.Lack of cloud cover had prevented an attack on stavanger aerodrome by day.Six Blenheims had been despatched to carry out a night attackon this aerodrome, but reports were not yet available. All our aircraft had returned except one.Four Wellingtons had attacked the shipping in Oslo Fjord.One had reported a large warship in the Skagerrak which had not,however, been attacked. This aircraft had previously attacked two ships of 1,500 tons in Oslo Fjord. One ship had turned towards the shore after the attack and might therefore have been hit. aircraft had descended to 150 feet and machine-gunned the ships. All our aircraft had returned.Western Front. A reconnaissance over the Munster-Paderborn-Ruhr area theprevious night had reported considerable illumination and railwayactivity at Hamm, but none elsewhere.   There had been several, enemy reconnaissances over the B.E.F. area.In the Advanced Air Striking Force area six Hurricanes hadengaged a number of Messerschmitts 110. One Hurricane had been shot down but the pilot had escaped by parachute. Another machinehad made a forced landing at Metz, the pilot being wounded. OneMesserschmitt 110 was believed to have been damaged.Nineteen patrol aircraft had carried out a night reconnaissance of the Rhine Valley between Metz and Speyer.Coastal A Hudson aircraft on reconnaissance at Bergen had reportedCommand. six merchant vessels which had been observed at anchor, and alsothat the petrol tanks there had appeared to be undamaged as a resultof the attack on the previous day. This Hudson had also engageda Heinkel floatplane off Haugesund and the enemy aircraft had lastbeen seen gliding down to the water.An. Anson machine had attacked an enemy submarine some100 miles west of the Shetlands, but results were unknown. Thismachine had later sighted another U-boat approximately twentymiles nearer the Shetlands, but had had no more bombs left.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 101stConclusions,Minute 2.)Enemymine-laying.3. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that a largenumber of enemy mines had been laid along our coast on the previous day, which had caused certain delays to East Coast traffic. the humber, however, was now open and some ships had been able toleave the Downs, though 121 ships were still there.Twelve floating mines which had been sunk in the Middle KnockDeep had had features which suggested that they might be minesof a new type.
Attacks on S.S. Lolworth (1,969 tons), bound from Portsmouth to the Tyne,shipping. had been mined and sunk three miles east of North Foreland.Twenty survivors had been landed.Submarine H.M.S. Triad&apos;s patrol had confirmed that one steamer of operations.        4,000 tons had been sunk on the 11th April.   They had also reportedone certain hit, with the possibility of a second, on a convoy on the19th April.Submarine The Germans had claimed to have sunk two of our submarines,losses. and as H.M. Submarines Tarpon and Sterlet were overdue and hadnot reported, it was feared that they must be regarded as lost.Operations in Three  French  contre-torpilleurs   had  been  sent  into   thethe Skagerrak.    Skagerrak to carry out a sweep on the previous night, but no reports had yet been received from them.   A flight of three Hudsons hadbeen detailed to escort these vessels, but they had failed to find them.Two of the Hudsons had been shot down by enemy fighters.Rendezvous Some discussion followed on the great difficulties that ourbetween ships aircraft were experiencing in making a rendezvous with ships at and aircraft. sea. The German shadowing aircraft seemed able to summonreinforcements very quickly and accurately to their position.Development of some homing device was an urgent need. The WarCabinet were informed that the Air Ministry were closely studying the problem in consultation with Sir Flenry Tizard. The problem was partly one of scientific devices and partly one of organisation.The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to a regrettableincident which had occurred on the previous day when a BattleFlight of three Hudsons, flying over Pomsdals Fjord, in order toprovide air protection and support for our own forces, had beenfired on and one machine shot down. The First Lord gave suchdetails as were available regarding the occurrence and said that theNaval and Air Staffs were consulting together in order to prevent a repetition of such an accident.The Secretary of State for A ir said that these patrols had long-distances to cover and were only capable of patrolling for about40 minutes to an hour when they arrived at the patrol area. Further,the chances of intercepting enemy aircraft were very slight and he doubted whether the patrols were worth while. A patrol ofBlenheims was due to leave almost immediately. It was agreed thatits flight should be cancelled, and the necessary orders were given.The War Cabinet (i)(ii)(iii)(iv)Took note of the above statements.Invited the Naval and Air Staffs to consider further whether aircraft patrols should be carried out for inter-ception purposes off the coast of Norway.Took note that consultations were taking place betweenthe Naval and Air Staffs with a view to improving themethods of recognition of our own&quot; aircraft by naval andother units operating A.A. defence in the northern area.Invited the Secretary of State for Air to take steps to expedite the production of a more effective homingdevice to enable aircraft to locate ships at sea.(previous reference reference:Operations in 4.   The War Cabinet were given the following information asNorway. to the position in Norway : No news had been received from Lord Cork as to operations against Narvik.    Possibly operations were handicapped by theW.M. (40) 101st frequent heavy snowstorms. A report had been received that it was conclusions,      now estimated that the Germans had lost 11 warships in Narvik.Minute 3.) H.M.S. Furious was returning home.   She now had only eightNarvik area.      aircraft fit for action.
Namsos area. A considerable further quantity of stores had been unloadedthe previous night. It was difficult, however, to clear the stores,since only three small store-sheds were left standing and there wasno local labour. Further stores were due to arrive at Namsos that evening, while a ship loaded with stores and Bofors guns had leftLeith for Namsos the previous night.An officer was being sent out by air to investigate the position.It was reported that Brigadier Phillips&apos;s Brigade had been roughlyhandled by mortars, light artillery, machine-guns, aircraft and destroyers, and was retiring on the French bridgehead at Bangsand.The Lincolnshires and King&apos;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry hadbeen cut off by German ski troops, who had crossed the fjord fromInderoy to Steinkjaer, but they appeared to have extricatedthemselves. It seemed curious that the French mobile troops had apparently not moved out from the Namsos area, although they hadbeen there since the morning of the 20th April.Trondheim area. The destroyer patrol outside Trondheim had had to be temporarily withdrawn, but other destroyers were being despatched to continue the patrol at the earliest possible moment. It seemed unlikely that the Germans would be able to get ships intoTrondheim in the interval.Aalesund area. H.M. ships glasgow, Sheffield and Galatea, with six destroyers,had landed 2,000 troops at Molde and Aandalsnes during theprevious night.Southern front. Brigadier Morgan&apos;s force had withdrawn to the Tretten area.He had reported the previous evening that the day had been quiet,but he had been warned that the Norwegians would be retiringfurther back during the night. There were still no British troops on the eastern railway line from Oslo to Trondheim. It would befor General Paget, who had landed the previous night, to decide whether he should push the 15th Infantry Brigade up from Dombaason to the eastern railway.Further discussion as to the plan of campaign which should beadopted in Norway is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Sweden.Transit ofmaterial for theGerman forces.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 101stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 354, dated 23rd April, 1940, from Stockholm. TheBritish Minister reported a public announcement by the swedish government that their policy of neutrality did not permit of permission being given either for passage of troops or for transitof war material of any kind to any Power involved in the war. As areport had been received that food and medical stores for theGerman Forces were passing over the Swedish railways, he had had the matter investigated in the Foreign Office. He was advised that a distinction was drawn between &apos;&apos; consignments &apos;&apos; and&quot; convoys,&quot; and that it was not consistent with neutrality to allowtransit of &quot;convoys &quot; (e.g., of food) to troops engaged in warlikeoperations. In view of the attitude adopted by the swedish government, our Minister in Stockholm was being instructed tomake the strongest possible protest.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Spain. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theConclusion of Labour Party proposed to raise in the House of Commons that commercial afternoon the question of the Anglo-Spanish Commercial Agree-Treaty. ment.   It was clearly undesirable that publicity should be given toany strong criticism of this Agreement or of the Spanish Govern-ment. The position had been explained to the Opposition andMr. Shinwell had promised to make a moderate speech. It had also been arranged that the Press should not give prominence tothe discussion.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Western Front.Action to betaken if theNetherlands or belgium is invaded.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 93 DIPP from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Brussels, asking for guidance as to theaction to be taken when the time came to hand the agreed com-munication to the Belgian Government in the event of a german invasion of the Netherlands. Was he entitled to give them a few hours&apos; respite, if he were asked to do so? The Poreign secretary said that this matter was being taken up with the Service Depart-ments.The Prime Minister said that he had been told privately on theprevious evening that in two recent scares of German invasionBritish troops had crossed the frontier into Belgium and that notrouble had been raised.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff very much doubted if this information was correct, but undertook to make enquiries.The War Cabinet took note of these statements and invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider the points raised in telegram 93 DIPP from Brussels.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 100thConclusions,Minute 5.)Allied policy.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that the French Government had recently receivedmore encouraging reports on Italian policy from their ambassador in Rome. Signor Mussolini was reported to have said recently :&quot; Germany is trying to drag me into war by the hair : luckily Iam bald.&quot;He also drew attention to telegrams Nos. 419 DIPP and423 DIPP, from Rome. Sir N. Charles&apos; impression from an interview with Count Ciano was that the message which the latterwished to convey was &quot; For heaven&apos;s sake leave us alone : we arenot really changing our line.&quot;The War Cabinet also had before them the following reports by the Chiefs of Staff Committee : Measures to deter Italy from entering the War against theAllies (W.P. (40) 130).The implications of possible Italian action in theMediterranean (W.P. (40) 134).The Prime Minister said that the discussions which had takenplace at the recent meeting of the Supreme War Council (see minute 1) had covered most of the questions referred to in thesecond of the two Reports. The French and British governments were in agreement on what the Allied policy in the Mediterraneanshould be. He did not think that any detailed discussion of therecommendations of the Chiefs of Staff was required. As to themeasures which might be taken to deter Italy from entering the war,the main step would be a redistribution of our naval strengths.This was being dealt with by the two Admiralties.   The Supreme
War Council had at the same time agreed that the two Govern-ments should also consider whether there were any furtherunprovocative measures which they could take to deter Italy fromcoming into the war against us. No doubt the Chiefs of Staff would look again at their paper (W.P. (40) 130) in the light of the presentsituation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed, and thoughtthat the Chiefs of Staff might also usefully keep in mind alternative courses of action in case of an Italian attack on Yugoslavia. the greeks might not consent to an Allied expedition to Salonika.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that in any case thenaval forces in the Eastern Mediterranean would not be sufficientto secure the lines of communication of such an expedition.The War Cabinet Invited the Chiefs of Staff to re-examine their Paper(W.P. (40) 130) in the light of the present situation andof the discussion in the Supreme WTar Council on the23rd April.9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on economic relations with italy (W.P. (G.) (40) 109), and a Note by the President of the Boardof Trade, covering a Note bv the Secretary for Mines on the subjectof coal supplies for Italy (W.P. (G.) (40) 111).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained that thequestion had been considered by the Departments concerned, whichhad reached the conclusion that we now had a choice of adoptingone or other of the following policies : (a) to make a further attempt to reach an agreement with theItalians; or(b) to abandon any idea of reaching an agreement, and instead to make our contraband control and economic warfareat least as effective in regard to Italy as a non-belligerentas in regard to minor Powers as neutrals.The Foreign Secretary had no doubt that the wise course would beto adopt alternative (a), even though by pursuing this policy wewere strengthening Italy if later she were to turn against us. the wisdom of the course proposed had been strongly urged bySir Ronald Graham, who favoured increased expenditure by thiscountry, more particularly in Northern Italy, as a means of influencing Italian public opinion against intervention in the war on the side of Germany. The steps which could be taken to giveeffect to the proposed policy were set out in paragraph 8 of his memorandum; the main elements were the negotiation of a clearingagreement, and the placing of orders in Genoa and Trieste for thebuilding of merchant ships.The Prime Minister agreed; our present military resources,combined with our military obligations, did not permit the adoptionof a strong diplomacy. He did not exclude altogether the possibilityof our obtaining some armament supplies from Italy, since therewas evidence that the Italian attitude in this matter had undergonea change in the previous week.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that the French were still obtaining armaments from Italy through their dummyPortuguese company. The Italians were not prepared to acceptfresh orders, but seemed willing to extend existing ones. It mightbe possible for the Minister of Supply to purchase armaments from italy through this channel. On the general question, our presentcontraband control in the case of Italy was entirely ineffective, andItaly.economic relations.(previous references:W.M. (40) 81stConclusions,Minute 2,and 87thConclusions,Minute 8.)
recently had seriously deteriorated. He hoped, therefore, that therewould be a change in policy as soon as strategic considerationspermitted. In-the meanwhile, he hoped that the Inter-departmentalCommittee which had produced the present report would be kept in being to consider from time to time legitimate means for tighteningour contraband control. In particular, he was anxious shortly to seize one or two tankers bound for Italy containing oil consigned to Italian firms known on previous occasions to have forwardedsupplies to Germany.The Prime Minister said that a question of this kind could besettled by the Minister of Economic Warfare and the foreign secretary in consultation, without specific reference to the WarCabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in agreementwith the general thesis of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum,which was that we should make no unnecessary concessions toItaly, which would serve merely to strengthen her as a potential enemy; but that at the same time we should avoid risking a politicalexplosion by taking action which could be represented to Italianpublic opinion as a form of economic sanctions. As regards the two questions in paragraph 8 most closely affecting the Treasury, theposition was as follows : (a) Instructions had already been sent to the Treasury repre-sentative in Rome authorising him to conclude a clearingagreement on the basis proposed (point (iv)); it was essential that the rate of exchange at which trade wasto be done through the clearing should not, as at present,be a rate based on the unofficial rate of sterling in new york, but a rate based on our official rate of 4-02 dollars to the  ;(b) As regards the supply of coal to Italy (point (v)), France was now asking us to supply coal at the rate of 2,150,000 tonsa month. If this were conceded, there would be verylittle coal for export to other countries. The main-tenance of coal exports to countries outside the franc-sterling block was of great importance, in view especially of the fact that expenditure by Departments in that area already exceeded by  24 millions the Departmentalforecasts made in January. Moreover, the cutting-off of coal exports, for example, to Greece and Egypt, ifthis was necessary, would raise strategic and politicalquestions. In view, however, of the fact that, as shownin the Note by the Secretary for Mines, Italy could notat present take more than 100,000 to 150,000. tons amonth, the guarantee suggested in point (v) of theForeign Secretary&apos;s Memorandum was largely academic.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that, as regardsthe clearing agreement, it was agreed that efforts should be madeto avoid further transactions being carried out at the New YorkBlack Rate; as regards Italian purchases of coal, the proposal tomaintain the guarantee facilities for 4 million tons had been putforward merely to avoid hurting Italian susceptibilities by reducingthe rate of importation. In practice, coal exports to Italy wouldbe very small.The War Cabinet-Approved Alternative (a) put forward by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in W.P. (G.) (40) 109, namely,that a further attempt should be made to reach an agree-ment with the Italian Government on economic questions.
TheMediterranean.Protection ofBritish shipping.(previous reference erence  :W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 5.)10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (40) 110), giving particulars ofthe action now being taken to give effect to the decisions reached by the War Cabinet at the meeting noted in the margin, txndindicating, in order of priority, the next steps to be taken, if itwere decided further to reduce the volume of British shipping in theMediterranean.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the Memorandum bv the Minister of Shipping(W.P. (G.) (40) 110).(ii) Agreed that for the present no further action should betaken to reduce the volume of British shipping in theMediterranean.NorwegianTankerTonnage.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 93rdConclusions,Minute 14.)Allied control.11. In connection with the discussion recorded in Minute 10above, the War Cabinet Invited the Minister of Shipping to furnish a report onthe extent to which we and the French were succeedingin bringing Norwegian tanker tonnage under Allied control,with special reference to the extent to which such tonnagewas still being used to meet Italian requirements.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.April 24, 1940.
