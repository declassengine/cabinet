Italy. l.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs invited the(Previous attention of the War Cabinet to Telegram No. 50 DIPP from reference: Mr. Osborne at the Vatican stating that, at a meeting betweenW.M. (40) 105th Mussolini and his Military advisers, it had been decided to postponeConclusions, a decision on Italy&apos;s entry into the war until it was seen moreMinutes 5 clearly how matters were going in Norway.  For what it was worth,and 6.) this telegram was somewhat reassuring.The Prime Minister pointed out that Count Grandi had statedin a speech that Italy could no longer stay out of the war, and thatthe Italian people must give blind obedience to the Duce. this statement tended to confirm the previous telegram (No. 45 DIPPdated the 26th April, 1940), stating that Signor Mussolini had decided on war.The War Cabinet took note of this information, andproceeded to consider what action should be taken to dealwith the contingency of war with Italy (see Minutes 2-6).&apos;TheMediterranean.Protection ofBritishshipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 105thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Ministerof Shipping setting out the action which had already been taken,and the further steps which could be taken, to reduce the volume ofBritish shipping in the Mediterranean (WP. (G.) (40) 114).The Minister of Shipping said that, with the exception of mailsteamers, all shipping proceeding to and from the Far East, India,the Persian Gulf and East Africa, was being routed via the Cape.As regards mail steamers, there were two between Colombo andAden, homeward-bound, and one, in the Mediterranean, which had left Gibraltar on the 25th April, outward-bound.The Minister emphasised that the steps which had already beentaken would have fairly serious results. A month&apos;s delay would be caused in the progress of our import programme, and the Admiralty&apos;sescort arrangements would also be considerably affected. any additional steps would, however, mean even graver disadvantages.On the other hand, we could not afford to lose shipping at present inthe Mediterranean, where there were no less than 49 British tankersand 149 other British merchant vessels a total of over one million tons registered tonnage, quite apart from a large amount of Frenchand Norwegian tonnage. The loss of the tankers would be a majordisaster.The Prime Minister thought that the measures which hadalready been taken, while fraught with grave disadvantages, were essential in the present circumstances. From the political point ofview, however, it was undesirable to take measures which wouldproclaim loudly that we either proposed to attack Italy, or feared that she would declare war on us. The steps which we had takenwere undoubtedly already known, but he did not think that theywere sufficiently drastic to make Mussolini think that we had reached a decision. He did not think that the crisis would be reached for atany rate three or four days and, as the more drastic measures couldbe put into effect at any moment, he felt that the right course wasto take no action beyond what had already been done by the Ministryof Shipping, unless and until the situation became more critical.In the meantime, the amount of British tonnage in theMediterranean would be progressively reduced.The War Cabinet-(a) Approved the action alreadv taken bv the Ministry ofShipping as set out in WP. (G.) (40)&quot; 114.
(b) Agreed that no action should be taken at present to imple-ment any of the further steps set out in paragraph 5 of w.P. (G.) (40) 114, but that the Ministry of shipping should be ready to put any, or all, of these steps intoeffect immediately, on instructions from the WarCabinet.Ita&apos;y* 3.   The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled that, at theNaval dis- previous meeting of the War Cabinet, it had been left to hispositions in the discretion to decide whether the two battleships at Gibraltar shouldMediterranean, be moved to Alexandria. This matter had been further discussed(Previous at ^he meeting of the Military Co-ordination Committee on the reference:        previous evening  (M.C.   (40)&quot; 34th  Meeting,  Minute  2).    HisW.M. (40) 105th provisional conclusion was that the two battleships H.M. shipsConclusions,      Royal Sovereign and Malaya should not be sent through them mute 6.)        Mediterranean until they had been joined by H.M.S.  Warspiteabout 2nd May.  All three ships should then be sent to Alexandriatogether, escorted by all available destroyers and accompanied, ifpossible, by a French Force.   He feared that if H.M. ships RoyalSovereign and Wlalaya were sent through the Mediterranean withoutH.M.S. Warspite, the temptation to Signor Mussolini to attackthese comparatively weak battleships might prove too great.On the other hand, a squadron consisting of the Warspite,Royal Sovereign and Malaya, and possibly three French battleshipsand destroyers, would be a very formidable force which should beable to fight its way through, if the worst came to the worst. if italy declared war before the ships had sailed and when thereforeItalian attack was a certainty, it might be necessary to wait until a stronger escorting force of destroyers could be sent out from england.The Chief of Naval Staff said that Italian wireless traffic wasnormal and that the Italians had not diverted any of their shipping.H.M.S. Warspite would reach Gibraltar about 2nd May, and could reach the danger point between Sicily and Tunis about the4th or 5th May. H.M. ships Royal Sovereign and Malaya, ifthey sailed as soon as possible, could pass through the danger zoneon the 1st or 2nd May. He ha,d been informed that the threeFrench battleships had to be sent to Bizerta, where they wouldrequire three days to effect minor repairs and take in stores. Hehad, however, asked Admiral Darlan whether it would be possiblefor the ships to miss Bizerta and go straight to Alexandria. TheFrench firmly intended to send their three ships to Alexandria,whether or not we sent H.M. ships Royal Sovereign and Malaya.There was a good chance of getting our two battleships past the danger point before the situation became critical and in hisopinion this was the right course. The French squadron wouldmake the passage at the same time and within easy supportingdistance, but not actually in company with our ships. If thesituation became critical before the two battleships reached thedanger point, there would still be 48 hours during which theycould be ordered to proceed to Algiers or return to Gibraltar.As regards the First Lord&apos;s statement that a strong force couldfight its way through after war had been declared, the Naval staff had always held the view that, while this could be done, it was most undesirable to attempt it, if it could possibly be avoided.In discussion, the following points were made : (1) From the political point of view, the advantage of havingcapital ships in the Eastern Mediterranean was verygreat. The Foreign Secretary therefore favoured makingthe attempt to slip the two battleships through whilethe chances were still good.   From the Italian point ofview the critical period would, no doubt, be about the2nd Mav.
(2) In reply to a question as to the probable effect on Italianoperations of the presence of two battleships at alexandria, the Chief of the Naval Staff said that he doubted whether the Italians would in any event risksending their capital ships to Alexandria, more par-ticularly since the latest reports of ships which had just passed their trials indicated doubts of their fightingvalue. If, however, there were no British capital ships at Alexandria, the Italians might send 8-inch Cruisersinto the Eastern Mediterranean to bombard Alexandriaor Haifa, or to support attacks on Crete or Cyprus. Theoccupation of Crete and the possession of its aerodromemight well be an Italian objective.(3) Reference was made to the air risk in attempting to send aFleet, however strong, through the danger area betweenSicily and Tunis after war with Italy had broken out.The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that the passageof ships through waters in reach of Italian shore-based aircraft was too long to be made in the hours of darkness.The Chief of the Naval Staff added that the lesson of fighting in the North Sea was that Fighter protection for our heavy ships was essential.(4) This, perhaps, pointed to the conclusion that we shouldhesitate to send a force of capital ships through theMediterranean, even if reinforced by HALS. Warspite,after war with Italy had broken out.(5) On the other hand, it was argued that strategically itmight be dangerous to divide our forces. The weakerthe force, the greater the temptation to Signor Mussolinito obtain a cheap success. The presence of a reallystrong force at Gibraltar might well prove a strongdeterrent.The Prime Minister said that, after hearing the views expressed, he personally favoured sending H.M. ships RoyalSovereign and Malaya to the Eastern Mediterranean at once, andsending H.M.S. Warspite to Alexandria via the Cape if thesituation had deteriorated by the time she reached Gibraltar. Hewould not, however, wish to set his view on this matter against thatof the First Lord, and would leave the matter to be determined atthe First Lord&apos;s discretion.The War Cabinet-(a) Took note of the views expressed in the discussion.(6) Agreed that a decision whether the two battleships now at gibraltar should be ordered to sail through theMediterranean should be left to the First Lord of theAdmiralty.4. The Secretary of State for War said that the War office had considered the question of the withdrawal of British Servicefamilies from the Mediterranean. The numbers involved would be1,700 from Malta and 1,400 from Gibraltar. The necessary shipping was available at Marseilles. As, however, the situation had appeared easier up to the previous day, the War Office had notproceeded; beyond the stage of enquiries.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he under-stood that the plan was that families at Gibraltar should be evacuated to Tangier. The Foreign Office felt that, if Italy wereto come into the war, Spain might become involved simultaneously,in which case Tangier would become a zone of operations.Italy.Withdrawal of families ofServicepersonnel from malta and gibraltar.
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that familiesfrom Gibraltar should be sent to French Morocco.The Secretary of State for Air expressed the view thatwithdrawal from the Mediterranean would create an extremely-unfavourable impression in Italy, and that it should not be orderedexcept in the very last resort.After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed That the Service Departments, in consultation withthe Foreign Office and the Colonial Office, should take all preliminary steps, including the retention of thenecessary transports, for the withdrawal of british service families from Malta and Gibraltar, on theunderstanding that every endeavour should be madeto keep these preparations secret, and that the order for withdrawal should not be given without further reference to the War Cabinet.Italy.Attitude ofTurkey in theevent of anattack on yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 103rdConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he proposed, subject to the concurrence of the Chiefs of Staff, to telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, instructing himto make a communication to the Turkish Government on thefollowing lines on the subject of a possible Italian attack on yugoslavia :  His Majesty&apos;s Government are grateful to the TurkishGovernment for the explanation of their attitude towards thismatter, and consider it necessary for the three General Staffsto investigate the action open to us in the event of an Italianattack on Yugoslavia. If, as appears, the Turkish Govern-ment are also of this view, we should be glad to learn whereand when the Turkish Government consider that the proposedStaff conversations should be held. In the meantime, we are examining the problem from what appears to be the same angleas that from which the Turkish Government are consideringit, namely, that the political damage likely to result fromfailure on our part to react to an Italian move should be judgedin relation to what is militarily practicable. We propose tocommunicate the result of our own studies to the TurkishGovernment as soon as possible, and we hope that, for their part, they will lose no time in completing their own examina-tion of this question.The First Loral of the Admiralty suggested that it should bemade clear to the Turkish Government that, if we became involvedin war with Italy, it was our intention to place a Fleet in theMediterranean capable of fighting the Italian Fleet.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy- 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadViews of Italian received a report from the Military Attache in Rome reporting a director of conversation he had had with General Carboni, the Director ofMilitary Italian Military Intelligence.   General Carboni, who was said toIntelligence. De j[n Very close relations with Signor Mussolini, had suggested thatthis country and France should try and come to terms with Italy.The Foreign Secretary said that, having discussed this suggestionwith Sir Percy Loraine, he thought that if Signor Mussolini threwin his lot with Germany it would be because he thought germany was going to win the war. This attitude was unlikely to be shaken;indeed, it might be reinforced if we now offered to meet long-standing Italian claims. He would prefer to test Signor MussolinFsmind by seeing how he reacted to the suggested trade negotiations.
The Prime Minister said that he strongly agreed with thisview. He added that there was a strong body of opinion in theFrench Senate in favour of an accommodation with Italy. M. Lavalthought that, given the necessary powers, he would be able to bringabout a settlement.The War Cabinet approved the views expressed by theForeign Secretary.Supreme WarCouncil:Account ofNinth Meeting.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 105thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account ofthe proceedings at the Meeting of the Supreme War Council held the previous day. The main points made by the Prime minister were as follows : (1) When the French Ambassador had called in the evening ofthe 26th April, he had brought a letter from M. Reynaud,who had appeared to be disconcerted at our change of plans in Norway. As on previous occasions, however,M. Reynaud had proved much more amenable at theconference table, and had agreed that the change of plansrested on sound grounds. No difficulty had been foundin reaching complete agreement.(2) M. Reynaud had made it plain that he attached greatimportance to the capture of Narvik. This was some-what surprising, as in his letter M. Reynaud had taken the view that if the Germans were able to established themselves in Trondhjem, this might react unfavourablyon our plans to control the Swedish ore-fields.(3) Discussion had ensued on the steps to be taken if we wereto find ourselves at war with Italy. M. Reynaud had agreed that in this event Italy should be dealt a hardblow. He (the Prime Minister) had suggested that thisshould be done by air attack on industrial establishments in north-west Italy. The French had expressedpreference for naval bombardment of the Italian coast.The French had agreed that the Allied Staffs should consider the possibility of using French aerodromes toattack military objectives in north-west Italy, and,although no agreement had been reached on the point ofprinciple involved, their reluctance to consider attack ofthis kind seemed to be diminishing.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 105thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.R.A.F. activity.8. The Secretary of State for Air said that bad weathergenerally had prevented flying operations on any scale the previous day.There had been little enemy activity. One cloud flying Germanreconnaissance aircraft had flown up the Thames Estuary theprevious afternoon, crossing the coast in Essex at a height of 15,000feet. It had flown over London towards Reading and, turningsouth, had crossed the coast at Shoreham. It had crossed Francenear Abbeville and had then flown over Arras and had finally crossed the Belgian frontier. This enemy machine had flown in cloud foralmost the entire journey and had not been intercepted.A strong force of Blenheims had attempted to reach Stavangeron the previous morning but clouds from sea level to a great heighthad prevented them from carrying out their task. With thisexception there had been no activity by the Bomber Command or theBritish Air Forces in France.
With the exception of a few routine patrols and one flight to&apos;Norway, no operations had been carried out by the Coastal Commandon account of the weather. A Sunderland had conveyed a HurricaneSquadron Commander and had reached Andalsnes late the previous,afternoon. At Andalsnes the flying-boat had been forced into theair by a bombing raid. It had been attacked by a Messerschmitt 110twin-engined fighter which the Sunderland had immediately shot down. The Sunderland had returned to the Shetlands early that morning.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Naval 9.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the tankerSituation.

Arrangements had been made, however, forone submarine at a time to be sent to operate against traffic pro-ceeding south of the Belt.H.M. submarine Tetrarch, about which some anxiety had been felt, had now reported herself and would arrive in harbour that day. If H.M. submarine Sterlet did not report by that morningshe would be 24 hours overdue.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 105thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The War Cabinet were given the following informa-tion : Narvik area.(1) Ballangan had been occupied by our troops on the previous day and forward movements were continuing. the weather had got worse but our ships off Narvik had had some success in destroying gun positions.(2) A convoy with Chasseurs and artillery had arrived anda second convoy was on its way. Lord Cork had asked that the Foreign Legion troops should be sent to Tromsowhere they would be more readily available for opera-tions.(3) The plan was to turn Narvik into a miniature Scapa andalready 60 or 70 anti-aircraft guns were available. Itwas of the utmost importance, however, that aircraft should be sent at the earliest possible moment.Namsos area.(4) There was nothing to report.Andalsnes area.(5) The enemy had attacked again on the evening of the 26thand had been repulsed with a loss of one medium tankdestroyed. The total casualties to the 15th infantry brigade for two days&apos; fighting had been estimated at 150.This Brigade had expected to establish itself theprevious evening with two battalions in the Otta

Four or possibly five enemy aircraft hadbeen shot down, but the ships had now expended nearly all their HA. ammunition. One hundred and twenty-fivebombs had been dropped on a convoy as it had approached the harbour, but no damage had been done.(7) At various times on the previous day, ships in the harbour at Andalsnes and Molde had been bombed. the destroyers on patrol oft&apos; Trondhjem had also been bombed,as had. been the S.S. Empire Ability en route to Narvikand S.S. Chrobry en route to Namsos. No hits had beenobtained.(8) Up to date the enemy had succeeded in obtaining only twohits on important ships with casualties amounting toabout 70.Further information as to operations in Scandinavia are con-tained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.April 28, 1940.
