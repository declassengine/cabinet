1. The Secretary of State for Air said that during the period from the 21st to the 25th March weather conditions had not beenvery suitable for flying and there had been little enemy activity.Whenever possible, offensive reconnaissances had been carriedout in the Heligoland Bight, and a number of Flak ships had been bombed and machine-gunned.On the 22nd March, 5 Hurricanes from the Air Component inFrance had had an engagement with 6 Messerschmitts 109. It wasclaimed that one Messerschmitt had been shot down, but this hadnot been confirmed.Leaflets had been dropped on the nights of the 22nd/23rdMarch and 23rd/24th March.Two submarines had been attacked by aircraft of the coastal command to the Westward of the Orkneys on the 22nd, but theresults of the attacks were not known.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Chief of theA ir Staff said that the recent reconnaissance activity over germany was mainly for training purposes for a particular operation.Leaflet dropping had now taken second place.Discussion ensued as to the extent of the damage caused by ourraid on Sylt on the night of the 19th/20th March. The Secretaryof State for Air read out a telegram from the Air Attache,Copenhagen, giving a report, from a source thought to be reliable,of very extensive damage, including partial destruction of theHindenburg Dam, the destruction of a considerable number of sea-planes and 115 casualties at Hornum.The Prime Minister suggested that, in order to counteract theeffects of German propaganda decrying the effect of the raid, weshould state in general terms that we had received reports whichwe had reason to regard as trustworthy showing that the damage caused by the raid was even more severe than we had at firstsupposed. The extent of the damage reported should be stated ingeneral terms.   General agreement was expressed with this view.The Lord Privy Seal thought, however, that it would be better not to mention the casualties.The Secretary of State for Air undertook to issue a statement on the lines suggested.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M.

The Chief of Naval Staff informed the War Cabinet of therecent movements of the Home Fleet in support of the operation ofa cruiser squadron and eight destroyers in the Skaggerrak.On the 21st March H.M. Submarine Ursula had sunk theGerman S.S. Heddernheim (4,947 tons), with a cargo of iron-ore,in the entrance to the Cattegat.On the 23rd March, the German S.S. Edmund Hugo Stinnes(2,129 tons), with a cargo of coke, had been sunk by a submarine off the North-West coast of Denmark. The submarine in question was probably H.M. Submarine Truant.Judging by Press reports from Geremany these two exploitshad had a considerable effect on the German High Command, whohad recalled all German shipping from the area.   This probablyb 2
accounted for the fact that the sweep by cruisers and destroyers had,so far as was known, yielded no results.U-boat activity.        There appeared to be a concentration of U-boats in the Orkneyarea.   The only other German submarine known to be out wasoperating in the Bristol Channel.    This submarine had been attacked with hopeful results on the 25th March.Danish shipping        Danish shipping had suffered very heavily in the last few days,losses. The Danes had so far been reluctant to join our convoys, but were now showing signs of a change of policy.   The following Danishships had been sunk by submarines : March 19-S.S. Minsk (1,229 tons).S.S. Charkow (1,026 tons).March 20-S.S. Bothal (2,109 tons).S.S. Viking (1,153 tons).March 21 S.S. Christiansberg (3,270 tons).S.S. A Igier (910 tons).March 25-S.S. Britta (1,146 tons).Shipping losses. Our own shipping losses during the period were as follows : March 25 British Tanker Daghestan (5,742 tons).The Norwegian S.S. Svinta, damaged in the German air raidon the 20th March, had been torpedoed and sunk in the Orkneys onthe 25th March while in tow by a tug.The Italian S.S. Conte di Savoia, with Mr. Sumner Welles onboard, had been stopped at Gibraltar on the 22nd March and asearch made for Dr. Schacht, who had been reported from Frenchsources to be travelling in her with false papers. He had not beenfound.The Soviet S.S. Mayakovsky, intercepted East of Japan on the15th March, had developed defects. After repairs at Mirs Bay nearHong Kong, she would be handed over to the French and taken toSaigon.On the 25th March, H.M. Submarine Unity, proceeding east-wards across the North Sea, had rescued 8 Dutch seamen who hadbeen six days in an open boat since their ship, the trawler Protinus,had been sunk by German aircraft. The survivors would remain on board the submarine during her offensive patrol in Germanwaters.In reply to a question, the Chief of Naval Staff gave informa-tion of the movements of the S.S.
