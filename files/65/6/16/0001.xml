The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that a number situation. air attacks had been made on our shipping off the East coast on(Previous the previous day.   Two enemy bombers had been engaged by ourEeference: fighters, but had not been brought down.W.M (40) 70th ^  War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Conclusions,Minute 1.)Attacks on east coast shipping.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that about 15 enemy aircraft had attacked the Fleet at Scapa at dusk on the 16th March.There had been 6 minutes&apos; warning of the attack and fighters had gone up within two minutes of the receipt of the warning. Theyhad been unable to operate over Scapa, however, owing to theintense anti-aircraft fire, and no contacts had been made.H.M.S. Norfolk had been hit by a bomb and holed by a nearmiss.   Three officers had been killed and six ratings injured.H.M.S. Iron Duke had been slightly damaged by two near misses.Bombs had also been dropped on shore at Hatston Aerodromeand at places on shore to the Eastward and Westward of Kirkwall.One civilian had been killed and seven wounded, including twowomen.   Five cottages had been damaged.It was possible that one or two enemy aircraft had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security added that some 120 high explosive and500 incendiary bombs had been dropped on land. Ten per cent,of the incendiary bombs had failed to ignite and the total damage caused by the remainder had been the burning of one haystack. Itwas clear that bombs had been deliberately dropped on land, the targets aimed at being the bridge at Waith on the Stromness-Kirkwall road, and two landing grounds East of Kirkwall(Craigiefield and Crossiecrown).The First Lord of the Admiralty said that our anti-aircraft fire had not proved very effective on this occasion, but theCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, had remarked on the efficiency of the searchlights, and it was hoped to give the German aircraft much warmer reception next time they came.The First Lord then explained the various steps which werebeing taken to increase the efficiency of the defences.The defences against low-flying attack would shortly be strengthened by 30 Oerlikon guns, deliveries of which were nowbeing made by Switzerland. Further progress had also been madein the development of the U.P. Weapon, and it was hoped that production might begin in about two months&apos; time.Proposals for Continuing, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that the counter-action. Germans now admitted that they had attacked military objectiveson land in this country. There was considerable feeling in thecountry that while the Germans used bombs we only dropped leaflets.There seemed ample justification for an attack on a militaryobjective such as the island of Sylt, which might cause civilian casualties.The Secretary of State for Air said that he was consideringthe question of a suitable immediate reprisal.General agreement was expressed with this view. It was also agreed that it would not be necessary to consult the French before taking any such action.We should announce, immediately the action had been taken,that it had been taken in reprisal for the German action at Scapa[21018] b 2The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 70thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air Attack onthe Fleet at scapa, 16thMarch.
The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 70thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report.Action on these lines would not open up the whole question of airobjectives.The Prime Minister thought that the incident strengthened ourhand in pressing the French to agree to the carrying out of theRoyal Marine operation at an early date.Shipping losses. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there had been nolosses of British merchant vessels.Enemy aircraft had attacked a number of small vessels off theEast coast on the 17th, but there had been no serious damage, andno casualties.The S.S. Slava (Yugoslav, 4,712 tons) had been mined and sunkin the Bristol Channel on the 16th. The ship had not been in convoy,and had been navigating out of the swept channel in a prohibitedarea.The S.S. St. Annaland (Dutch, 2,248 tons), not in convoy, hadbeen mined and sunk 20 miles East of North Foreland.The S.S. Capitaine Augustin (French, 3,173 tons), not in convoy, had been mined and sunk 2 miles East of The Tongue lightvessel.H.M. Drifter Maida, when minesweeping, had been mined and sunk about 10 miles East of North Foreland. There were sixsurvivors and six of the crew were missing.The S.S. Egton (British, 4,363 tons) and S.S. Caverock (British,1,332 tons) had been in collision off the South-West corner of Wales.Both ships were in an outward-bound Gibraltar convoy, and it wasnot yet known to what extent they were damaged.H.M.S. Intrepid (Destroyer) had been in collision with theLowestoft trawler Ocean Drift, which had sunk. Eight survivorshad been picked up. H.M.S. Intrepid, which had sustained damage to her stern, had proceeded to Invergordon.The Aguitania had gone aground on leaving harbour atFreetown.  It was hoped to refloat her on the next high tide.Soviet S.S. The&quot; Armed Merchant Cruiser Cantimbla was escorting theMayakovsky.      Russian S.S. Mayakovsky towards Hong Kong.The 10th Minesweeping Flotilla, escorted by two Frenchdestroyers, had carried out a searching sweep East of NorthGoodwin light vessel. One German mine had been swept up and traffic bound East for the Thames and the Downs had been stoppeduntil sweeping was completed.Practicability In reply to an enquiry by the Prime Minister, the First Lordof Naval of the Admiralty said that it would be quite possible to concentrateconcentration a Fleet in the Mediterranean if developments in the situation madein the this desirable.   We had a standing arrangement with the FrenchMediterranean, for dividing the Mediterranean into two theatres of operations. Thechief problem, however, would be destroyers. If operations had tobe undertaken in the Mediterranean, there would not be sufficientdestroyers to undertake convoy duties, and it might be necessaryto close the Mediterranean to traffic.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the above statements.(2) Agreed that an air attack should be carried out on a suitablemilitary objective in reprisal for the German air attackon 16th March.
Italian-german relations.Meeting betweenHerr Hitler andSignorMussolini.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 70thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 242, dated the 17th March, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Rome, reporting that Signor Mussolini had left Romeby special train at 1 - 30 P.M., apparently for the North, theinference being that he had gone to meet Herr Hitler on the Brenner.Sir Percy Loraine had added that Count Ciano had not accom-panied Signor Mussolini, but all the London newspapers that morning said that Count Ciano had accompanied the Duce.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.U.S.S.R.Forthcominginterview of theSovietAmbassador atthe ForeignOffice.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 70thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thatM. Maisky had asked urgently for an appointment at the ForeignOffice, and arrangements had been made for him to be received byMr. R. A. Butler, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, that afternoon. It was probable that the Ambassador wished to raisethe question of the interception of the Soviet S.S. Mayakovsky,which was being escorted to Hong Kong with a cargo of 4,000 tonsof copper on board. This copper was consigned to Soviet nationalsat Vladivostok, but the amount was so great that it was suspectedthat its real destination was Germany.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Western Front. 6.   A discussion took places regarding the possibility of aPossible German German attack on the Western Front directed either againt heattack on the Netherlands singly or against the Netherlands, and BelgamNetherlands or together. A record of the discussion and of the Concisionsthe Netherlands reached by the War Cabinet, is contained m the Secretary sand Belgium.

The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War CabinetGerman imports Qf a plan for hindering the supply of iron ore from Sweden tofrom Sweden. Germany   which   was   being   examined   by   the   Naval   btatt.(Previous Particulars of this information are recorded in the Secretary reference: Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that atCouncil. his interview with M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, on Friday,Proposal for a the 15th March, he had raised the question of an early Meetingmeeting. of the Supreme War Council being held in this country.   Speaking(Previous personally, M. Corbin had thought that such a Meeting would be reference: helpful, provided the ground was carefully prepared in advance.W.M. (40) 69th He did not think, however, that it would be possible for M. DaladierConclusions, to be absent from Paris until after the debate in the Chamber which minute 6.) w,as due to be held on Tuesday, the 19th March, and might well[21018] b 3
be continued on the following day. As regards the place of theMeeting, he thought that M. Daladier would be willing to come tothis country. He had promised to report to his Governmentimmediately and to reply as soon as possible.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Soviet-FinnishTreaty.Need for actionto meet thesituationcreated.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 70thConclusions,Minute 5.)Views of theFrenchGovernment.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad considered the steps open to us to offset the damage to our prestige resulting from the collapse of Finnish resistance. neutral opinion in many countries was feeling a sense of discouragement,as could be seen in telegrams received from our representatives in the Balkan countries, notably Roumania, and in South America,and in a despatch from Budapest. As the Cabinet were aware,M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, had handed to him on Friday,the 15th March, a Note in which the French Government had suggested that consideration should once again be given to theproposal for the Allied Control of Scandinavian territorial waters and, if necessary, the occupation of certain Norwegian ports. he proposed to circulate this Note in the course of that afternoon andhe suggested that the whole question should be considered by theWar Cabinet at their next Meeting.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Finland.Suggestedcontributiontowardseconomicreconstruction.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that,provided the Chancellor of the Exchequer saw no objection, hethought it would be helpful if in his speech the following day the Prime Minister were to give some indication that we shouldbe willing to give financial assistance to Finland to help her inthe reconstruction of her economic life. He had informally raised with the Finnish Minister a few days previously the questionwhether such an offer would be well received; and M. Gripenberghad said that help of this kind would have a most heartening effect in Finland. It was in his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) view mostimportant that we should do everything possible to recreate moralein Finland and to prevent the Finns from losing heart.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if we were to makea contribution, it was important that the French Government should do likewise.The Prime Minister suggested that in his speech on Tuesdayhe should say that Finland would no doubt require financial help from other countries for tJhe reconstruction of her life; and thatwe, for our part, would be prepared to make our contribution.The War Cabinet :-Approved the line which the Prime Minister proposed totake on this matter in his speech on the following day.
Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 69thConclusions,Minute 4.)The PrimeMinister &apos;sSpeech in theHouse ofCommons.11. The Prime Minister said that in his speech in the Houseof Commons the following day it would be necessary for him to dealwith the scale of assistance which we had been prepared to renderto Finland; and he intended to make it clear that marshal mannerheim himself had not asked that troops should be availableuntil May, and, further, that the number he had asked for was30,000, whereas we and the French had been prepared to send100,000 troops in all, the first contingent to start in March. Therewas not the slightest justification for the allegation that we hadbetrayed Finland, with whom we ha,d never entered into any obliga-tions; but, however good our case, the present mood was such thatit would be difficult to secure general acceptance of it. For thisreason, he proposed to deal with other matters also in his speech.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.Stoppage ofmilitarysupplies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 69thConclusions,Minute 5.)War materialloaded in shipsstill in british ports.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 68thConclusions,Minute 5.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that onthe 15th March M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, had been unable to give any indication of the French attitude towards the stoppage of military supplies to Finland, but on the following day had produced a statement of General Gamelin&apos;s views on thismatter, which subject to confirmation by the French Government were as follows : -(a) that no attempt should be made to recover military supplies which had actually reached Finland;(b) that no attempt should be made to endeavour to secure thereturn of military supplies now in transit, except in &quot; afew cases of very modern material.&quot;When he (the Secretary of State) had seen M. Gripenberg, hehad made it clear that he was not making any formal request at that stage for the return of any of the war material we had furnished;but he had indicated that he thought that we might make a request for the return of specific items for which our own need was verygreat, and had undertaken to furnish M. Gripenberg with a list ofsuch items in due course. His own feeling was that if, as appearedprobable, the French proposed to ask for the return of only verysmall quantities of war material, our wisest course would be to dothe same. He was averse from making a request for the return oflarge quantities, since such a request was not only bound to fail, but would inevitably lead to misapprehension and bad feeling.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, inaccordance with the request of the War Cabinet, he had arranged that ships loading war material for Finland in British ports shouldbe stopped and the war material unloaded. This procedure hadbeen applied to three ships loading British war material and to one ship containing 4 French 12-inch guns and mountings.In addition, there were a number of Finnish ships (eg.,S.S. Lena) which had on board small quantities of war material inaddition to general commercial cargoes. In one case this cargoconsisted of 800 tons of steel bars and a quantity of galvanisedwire. It was very difficult for him to ascertain the exact positionin respect of these vessels, and it might well be that in some casesthe value of the war material was so small that it was not worthincurring the expense of unloading the vessel and of the demurragefees involved. These matters were known to the Service Depart-ments, however, and he accordingly suggested the appointment ofa small Committee consisting of the Controller of the Navy and officers of corresponding rank from the War Office and the AirMinistry, together with representatives of the Treasury, the Boardof Trade and the Export Credits Guarantee Department.   Such
a Committee would be able to investigate the facts in regard to suchcases, and should be empowered to decide whether or not the ships should be unloaded and the war material on board reclaimed.The Prime Minister said that he thought discretion should begiven to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to obtain advice in this matter and&quot; to decide whether certain ships should beunloaded. He hoped consideration would not necessarily be confined to war material in the narrowest sense, but would cover such material as steel bars, the order for which might well have beengiven in connexion with the Finnish conflict and of which, in anycase, we ourselves stood in great need.The War Cabinet :-(a) Took note that the final views of the French Governmenton the subject of the recovery of French war materialconsigned to Finland were not yet available, but thatit appeared likely that they would only ask for thereturn of very small quantities of special kinds ofmaterial;(&amp;) Authorised the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence toobtain the assistance of a small Inter-departmental Com-mittee, as suggested in the passage marked &quot; X. &quot; above,for the purpose of determining whether any particularship should be unloaded in order to recover materialon board, it being understood that consideration wouldnot be confined to war material but would cover other materials of special importance to this country.13. The Secretary of State for War raised a question inconnection with the Staff Conversations which were taking place with the Turkish General Staff.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that staff conversations had been arranged between the Chiefs of Staff ofour Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East and the TurkishGeneral Staff. The first question which the Turks had raised hadbeen what we should do in the event of Italy becoming hostile. our representatives had instructions not to discuss this question, buthe (the Chief of the Imperial General Staff) was afraid that, ifthey adhered to this instruction, the conversations would breakdown. The Chiefs of Staff were not at the moment in a positionto give instructions to the Commanders-in-Chief on this hypothesis,since all our plans for assisting Turkey had been based on theassumption of the assured neutrality of Italy.The Prime Minister said that if, as a result of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, Italy took sides with Germany, thewhole situation would be altered and our policy would presumablytake the form of a concentrated attack upon Italy. He himself,however, was inclined to think that the contingency which theTurks wished to discuss was an unlikely one. It was more probablethat Germany and &apos; Italy might tell Roumania that, as she wasfrightened about her frontiers, Germany and Italy would guaranteethose frontiers until the end of the war, provided that she suppliedGermany with oil, and, that if she did not fall in with thesuggestion, she would come in for a great deal of trouble. ThePrime Minister, continuing, said that it might be possible toimprove our position vis-a-vis Roumania if, during the forthcomingconversations, Turkey showed herself more forthcoming. Turkey was the key, and we should endeavour to persuade her to stiffenRoumanian resistance to any demands that might be made on herby the Axis Powers. As regards our Staff Conversations with theTurks it was important to find out what particular situation theTurkey.staff conversations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 61stConclusions,Minute 8.)
Resume by chiefs of Staff.Frequency ofsubmission.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 46thConclusions,Minute 4.)14. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee (W.P. (40) 97) suggesting that the Chiefsof Staff Resume of the Naval, Military and Air situation shouldrevert to its original form and be presented as a weekly document.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff had found that less work was entailed in compiling the Resume weekly.Further disadvantages of a monthly Resume were that the informa-tion contained in it would be out of date, and that the Resume would assume considerable proportions, and would therefore not be suitable for Ministers who had little time to devote to its study.A suggestion was made that certain material contained in the weekly Resumes for example, charts, tables, &amp;c. might with advantage be submitted monthly.The War Cabinet agreed To revert to the previous practice whereby the Chiefs of staff&apos; weekly Resume on the Naval, Military and air situation was prepared weekly, subject to the proviso thatcertain of the information contained in the Resume,e.g., charts, tables, &amp;c, should be submitted monthly.DepartmentalReports.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 30thConclusions,Minute 13.)15. The Prime Minister said that he had come to theconclusion that steps should be taken to reduce the volume of Reportscirculated to the War Cabinet. He proposed that in futurePeriodical Reports should be circulated as follows : Weekly. Reports on (1) Oil.(2) Shipping.(3) Economic Warfare.Turks had in mind, when they asked for information about our attitude in the event of a hostile Italy.In discussion the view was expressed that it was very important not to take too rigid an attitude, which might have a discouragingeffect on Turkey. Further, these talks between the staffs wereexploratory only, and no question of entering into new commitmentswas involved at this stage.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Chiefs of Staff to telegraph to our repre-sentatives at Ankara on the following general lines : (1) that it is important that they should not adopt toonegative or rigid an attitude in the conversations with the Turkish representatives, and that they areat liberty to extend the scope of these conversationsto include the hypothesis of a hostile Italy :(2) that detailed instructions would be sent to them as soonas possible as to our plans in the contingency ofa hostile Italy :(3) that, pending receipt of the instructions promisedin (2), they should (a) endeavour to ascertain and report the exactmilitary situation which the Turks have inmind; and(b) proceed on the basis that our general policy, if italy became hostile, would be to concentrateagainst her and to keep her out of theEastern Mediterranean.
Fortnightly. Reports on (1) Coal.(2) Analysis of German Propaganda.Monthly (1) A single Paper including the (hitherto separate)reports on the Dominions, India, Burma, and theColonies and Mandated Territories.(2) Supply and Production (War Office and Ministry ofSupply).(3) Supply and Production (Air Ministry).(4) Civil Defence, including, if necessary, a section on civil Defence Supplies.(5) National Service and Labour.(6) Food Supplies.(7) Analysis of Shipping Employment.(8) Propaganda : Appreciation of action taken and of its effect.(9) Publicity in Enemy Countries.Quarterly Report on Supply and Production (Admiralty).The War Cabinet-Approved the Prime Ministers proposals,  subject tofurther consideration being given to the question whetherthe Report on National Service and Labour should besubmitted fortnightly or monthly.*War Finance. 16.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposedEesult of first to announce in the House that afternoon the result of the issue ofWar Loan. the first War Loan. The loan had been over-subscribed. This was(Previous satisfactory, but the result might have been an even greater successReference: but for the announcement on the morning of the 13th March that.M. (40) 60th  Finland had come to terms with the U.S.S.R.Conclusions, The Chancellor said that he also proposed to state that minute 7.)        afternoon that we aimed at making 3 per cent, the standard of our war finance.   At the outbreak of the war the Stock Exchange hadNew minimum   fixed minimum prices for gilt-edged securities, below which suchprices for gilt-    stocks could not be sold.  Owing to the rise in market values sinceedged securities. th.e outbreak of war, these minima were no longer effective, and itwas now proposed that new minimum prices should be fixed, on ahigher level, corresponding broadly to a 3 per cent, yield.The main argument against the course which he was adoptingwas that, if prices of Government stocks were to decline, Govern-ment securities would become frozen. He had no doubt, however,that the course proposed, which had been very carefully considered,was right, on balance. It was a clear sign of confidence, and woulddeter possible investors to future issues of War Loan from holdingback in the hope that they might thereby obtain better terms from some later issue.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,March 18, 1940.* It was later decided that this Report should be submitted monthly.
