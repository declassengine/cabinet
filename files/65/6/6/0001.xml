The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that there had beenSituation. little activity by the enemy on the previous day.   During daylight(Previous 3 enemy aircraft had been reported some distance out to sea betweenReference: Arbroath and Yarmouth. An aircraft of doubtful identity had alsoW.M. (40) 60th been observed in the evening, off Selsey Bill.  Fighters had been sentConclusions, up in each case to investigate.   The usual patrols for ChannelMinute 3.) escorts and convoy and shipping protection had been flown.Enemy activity.Patrols over Patrols over the seaplane bases in the Heligoland Bight hadGerman been continued during the previous night.   The clouds had beenseaplane bases,   very heavy and visibility poor;  light opposition by anti-aircraft fire had been encountered.  One aircraft, whilst returning, had seena large number of lights, possibly a Dutch fishing fleet, approxi-mately 60 miles north-east of Cromer.Leaflet raids. A night reconnaissance by 2 Wellingtons had been carried out over Bremen and Hamburg, during which leaflets had been dropped.Both aircraft had returned safely.The usual anti-submarine patrols, reconnaissances and convoy escorts had been flown by Coastal Command aircraft. One aircraftDetection of had observed 5 mines south-west of Beachy Head directly in the mines by path of a large Dutch merchant vessel.   The aircraft had tried to aircraft. warn the vessel by light signals, but these had been disregardedand the aircraft had had to fire across the bows of the vessel to persuade it to alter course.   A destroyer in the vicinity had beeninformed and had signalled the presence of the mines to theDutch ship.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 60thConclusions,Minute 4.)Attack onU-boat.german merchant ships in Dutch ports.2. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that no enemy attacks on shipping had been reported on the previous day.The tanker Charles F. Meyer, damaged by an explosion offDungeness (as reported the previous day), had been safely towed toCowes. It was now thought that this vessel had probably strucka floating mine. It might have been a British mine, the mooringrope of which had become fouled in the propellers.H.M.S. Leith and H.M.S. Wild Swan had attacked a goodcontact 50 miles south-west of the Scilly Isles in the early hours ofthe 5th March. At 6-45 A.M. the target had moved and Wild Swanhad again attacked. The target had then become stationary and oilhad been seen leaking out. An enemy submarine had been sightednear this position on the evening of the previous day.The German ships Seattle (7,369 tons), Mimi Horn (4,007 tons)and Vancouver (8,269 tons) had sailed from Curagao during the night the 4th-5th March. From the information received, it seemed clear that the Germans were in a great hurry to get these shipsaway from Dutch territorial waters. This was significant, since itmight indicate that something would shortly happen to upset thepresent relations between Holland and Germany. Either theGermans might be contemplating an attack on Holland, or theymight be afraid that the Dutch would seize their vessels inretaliation for attacks on Dutch shipping.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[20967]
The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 60thConclusions,Minute 5.)Western Front.Finland.3. The Secretary of State for War said that no details had yetbeen received of the German raid on one of our positions reportedin the Press that morning. In view of the fact that 16 men were reported missing, it seemed likely that the whole of the detachmenthad been surrounded and captured. He undertook to give the WarCabinet further details of the incident next day.In Finland the military situation was little changed. TheRussians appeared to be attacking in some strength near Pollakkalaon the Vuoksi River in the centre of the Isthmus. This was rather a danger-spot, since a break-through here would turn the easternhalf of the Finnish line, which ran along lakes and was naturallystrong. There were, however, other prepared positions in its rear.Russian air attacks on back areas were continuing.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.U.S.S.R.Visit ofSir stafford cripps.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 35thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad received a telegram* from Sir Stafford Cripps, who had now returned to Chungking after his visit to Moscow. The general effectof this telegram was that Sir Stafford Cripps believed that theGovernment of the U.S.S.R. were anxious to improve their relationswith us, and not to become too closely tied to Germany. A message had also been received from M. Munters, the Latvian ForeignMinister, to the same effect, and adding that he thought that the finns would soon make terms with the U.S.S.R.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not think that this change in the attitude of the U.S.S.R., assuming that it was as reported, should have any effect on our present policy. If, however,the Finnish Government made terms with the U.S.S.R., it might be worth while exploring the possibility of detaching the latter fromGermany.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 60thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. A discussion took place in regard to the question ofassistance to Finland. A record of the discussion, and of theConclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.Italy.economic relations:German sea-borne coal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 59thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegrams Nos. 12 and 13, dated the 4th and 5th March, 1940,respectively, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, The Vatican, reporting(a) the anxiety of the Vatican regarding the increasingly pro-German course set by Signor Mussolini during the last few weeks,and (b) a statement made by the Cardinal Secretary of State toMr. Osborne on the serious damage to Anglo-Italian relations whichthe stopping of Italian shipments of coal from Germany might involve. The Secretary of State drew attention also to telegramNo. 198, dated the 5th March, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Rome, stating that Count Ciano&apos;s &quot; chef de cabinet&quot;had that day informed the Roumanian Minister, in reply to aquestion regarding the effect on Anglo-Italian relations of the coaldifficulty, that there was no tension between the two governments and that relations were unchanged.   His attention had also been* No. 87 (Tour Series) from Sir A. Clark Kerr (Chungking).
Royal marine operation.(previous references:W.M. (39) 95thConclusions,Minute 3,and 110thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the First Lordof the Admiralty on a Royal Marine operation (W.P. (40) 84).A record of the discussion which took place, and of theConclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.drawn to a telegram, received from the Coal Monopoly in Italy,pressing the point that some of the coal despatched from Rotterdamafter the 1st March would have been despatched some time before that date had it not been for the exceptionally bad weather.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been consulted as to theattitude to be taken by the Foreign Office Representative at ameeting that day of the Enemy Exports Committee. He had saidthat the War Cabinet would, in his opinion, certainly maintain theposition which they had taken up on grounds of principle. Hesuggested, however, that it might be worth considering whetherinvestigation of the facts would show that, on the analogy of theaction taken by the Ministry of Economic Warfare in other cases,there might be justification for making an exception in regard toany of the vessels concerned. He was anxious to avoid getting intoa serious dispute with Italy on &apos;&apos; sanctions &apos;&apos; lines, and the situation might be eased if it could be announced in the Italian press that,while, say, twelve Italian ships had been seized, it had been found possible, without sacrifice of principle, to authorise the release ofone or two.In discussion, the following points were made : (i) There might well be something to be said for an arrange-ment on these lines if it formed part of a bargain withthe Italian Government. In that event, a concession in regard to certain ships would be analogous to our action in returning some of the Germans taken from theS.S. Asama Maru as part of a general bargain with theJapanese Government. But it would not be right tomake such a concession merely in the hope that later we might reach some agreement.(ii) We had made a definite rule that we could not distinguish between one country and another in the administrationof contraband control, and we must maintain that position. There was nothing in recent Italian action tocall for an indulgent attitude on our part.(iii) The 1st March, 1940, had been fixed as the date on whichthe shipment of German coal to Italy should cease, anda public announcement to this effect had been made. Ifthe Ministry of Economic Warfare were now to findgrounds on which some of the Italian ships which hadbeen seized could be released, this would throw us opento the charge of inconsistency.The War Cabinet agreed That, except as part of some general arrangement withthe Italian Government, no action should be takeninconsistent with the decision that vessels putting out from port after the 1st March, 1940, with cargoes ofGerman coal should be intercepted and their cargoes taken as prize.
Turkey.allied assistance.(previous references:W.M. (39) 66thConclusions,Minute 10; andW.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 82), proposing that, in viewof the forthcoming Anglo-French Staff Conversations with theTurks at Angora, the War Cabinet should (a) authorise the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to agreewith the Turkish General Staff and General Weygandon a plan for the development of the communications from Kilia to Edirne on the basis that the Turks should provide the maximum labour and material, &amp;c, and thework be carried out forthwith, construction being under-taken by the British, and the incidence of cost being settled between the three Governments concerned at alater date;(b) invite the Secretary of State for  Foreign Affairs to approach the French and Turkish Governments andarrive at an agreement with them on the proportion of cost to be borne by each;(c) invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give interimapproval to expenditure up to  710,000, so that thework might be started forthwith.The Secretary of State for War said that the Staff Conversa-tions with the Turks were now to begin on the 11th March. In theabsence of communications, we were quite unable to render assistance to the Turks by land, should they be attacked in Thrace,and we should still be unable to do so in the spring of 1941 unlessthe work of construction were put in hand immediately. The Turksthemselves would be using the only existing practicable line of communications, by rail and road, from Istanbul to Edirne. Theline which.the Turks had allotted for Anglo-French use followedan existing road (which was hardly more than a track) from theDardanelles to Edirne.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Force problem was one of improving existing aerodromes and finding sites for new ones. A survey was being carried out at the present time.Preliminary plans indicated that, as a minimum, 8 main aerodromes and 6 satellite landing grounds would be required for our air forcesin Western Anatolia. When our full military forces were devolped in Thrace, an additional three aerodromes and three satellitelanding grounds would be required there. Until the work wasfinished, only a very limited force would be capable of operating,and even that force could only operate in summer. It had beenapproximately calculated that the cost of the air force works inTurkey would be in the neighbourhood of  1,010,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had threecomments to make : (1) The incidence of cost should be settled between the three governments before the work began. In particular, weshould have a clear understanding with the French thatany expenditure falling on the Western Allies should beborne in the proportion of 60 : 40 agreed between. Reynaud and himself.(2) He saw no reason why France and Great Britain should find money for these improvements. So far as these improvements involved the supply of equipment and machinery from this country or from France, this mightwell be covered by a credit. It would be necessary,however, to ascertain what equipment was involved, andfrom what source, and how soon, it could be madeavailable.
(previous reference:W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)So far as concerned expenditure in Turkishcurrency, this should be met by Turkey. It must be -remembered that we had handed over to Turkey 15 millions of gold for the express purpose of providingcover for any necessary expansion of her currency. Ifwe were to make sterling available for meeting expen-diture in Turkish currency, such sterling would be liableto be sold in America, to the detriment of our dollaraccount.(3) Presumably there was a good deal to be done in the way of preliminary surveys and preparations. These might beauthorised forthwith, without prejudice to the subjectof payment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer as regards the incidence of costbetween France and ourselves. The matter was, however, one ofgreat urgency, and he suggested that, if the French would agreethat any expenditure falling on the Western Allies should be borne on the 60 : 40 proportion, we ought to reach agreement with theTurks without further delay, making the best terms we could.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that it was heldin some quarters that Thrace was our liability, just as Salonika wasFrance&apos;s liability. It might not be to our advantage to commit ourselves to meet 60 per cent, of the common expenditure at.Salonika.The Prime Minister took the view that we were committed tothe 60 : 40 proportion, and that we ought not to attempt to vary itin particular cases.The Secretary of State for War said that, in the light of thediscussion, he would not now press the Chancellor of the exchequer to give interim approval to expenditure up to  710,000. He would,however, let the Chancellor of the Exchequer know within the nextfew days what preliminary expenditure would be required in thecourse of, say, the next month.The Secretary of State for Air said that he also would let theChancellor of the Exchequer have a figure of the preliminary expen-diture which would be incurred in respect of aerodromes during thecoming month.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that it was notyet clear whether the Turks would welcome the despatch of con-siderable British and French forces to Thrace. The Chiefs of staff report of the 5th December, 1939 (W.P. (39) 148), stated that &quot; theTurks consider that they can hold their Thracian frontier provided they receive adequate material and some supporting units from theAllies.&quot; He thought it very desirable that the Chiefs of staff should now prepare for the War Cabinet a further Report on military policy in the Balkans.The Chief of the Air Staff said that a further Report was in course of preparation.The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theextent of the aid which Turkey would require from the Allies in thrace was one of the points which would be dealt with in the staff conversations starting on the 11th March.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (i) to approach the French Government and to obtain their assent to any expenditure falling on theAllies, in respect of improvements to commuhi-
cations in Thrace and for the purpose of constructing aerodromes in Western Anatolia,being borne by the French and British Govern-ments in the proportion of 60 : 40;(ii) thereafter, in consultation with the French Govern-ment, to approach the Turkish Government witha view to reaching a settlement as to the propor-tion of the cost of the improvements and works tobe borne by that Government.(b) Authorised the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to agreewith the Turkish General Staff and General Weygandon a plan for the development of the communications from Kilia to Edirne on the basis that the Turks providethe maximum labour and material. &amp;c., and the construc-tion is undertaken by the British.&quot;(c) Authorised the three Commanders-in-Chief in the middle east to inform the Turkish representatives at the forth-coming Staff Conversations that the development of plans for works of construction may be proceeded with withoutawaiting the conclusion of the financial discussionsreferred to in (a) above; and that the financial aspect of this matter would be taken up with the TurkishGovernment by the Foreign Office, concurrently with thedevelopment of plans.(d) Invited the Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for Air to communicate forthwith to theChancellor of the Exchequer particulars of the amountof preliminary expenditure which would be incurredduring, say, the next month, with a view to authoritybeing given for such preliminary expenditure, inadvance of a settlement of the general financial issues involved.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 6, 1940.
