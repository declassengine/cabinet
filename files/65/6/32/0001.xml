The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that there had beenSituation. little enemy air activity off the British coast during the previous(Previous day.Reference: During the morning of the 9th April 8 Blenheims had carriedw.M. (40) 85th out an offensive patrol in the Heligoland Bight and southern NorthConclusions.)     Sea.   No objectives had been found, but a large vessel, believed tobe a hospital ship, had been reported at Heligoland.Operations over        During the evening 24 heavy bombers had attacked enemyScandinavia.      warships at Bergen.  A direct hit had been obtained with a 500-lb.bomb on one &quot; K &quot; class cruiser, and there had been several near misses. Considerable anti-aircraft fire from ships and shore batteries had been experienced, but all aircraft had returned safely.A Sunderland flying boat on a reconnaissance off Oslo had notyet returned and must be presumed lost.A Wellington had reported an &apos;&apos; Emden &apos;&apos; class cruiser in the afternoon 25 miles north of Karmo and a Konigsberg cruiser with small craft in Bergen. Other reconnaissances reported a &quot;K&quot;class cruiser and 2 destroyers in christians and at about 6 p.m., anda &quot;Hipper&quot; class cruiser in Trondhjem harbour earlier in the afternoon.Reconnaissance A reconnaissance of the Faroe Islands had been carried out,of the Faroes.    but no enemy craft had been sighted, although all fjords had been examined.Enemy aircraft Early that morning a Coastal Command aircraft on a specialconcentration at reconnaissance had broken wireless silence to report intense enemyStavanger.        aircraft concentration at Stavanger airport and seaplane station.The enemy aircraft consisted of Junker bombers, twin and singleengined fighters, and twin and single engined seaplanes, all inconsiderable numbers.Some discussion ensued as to what action should be taken torender Stavanger aerodrome unsuitable as a base of operations forthe Germans. The Secretary of State for Air said that he under-stood that heavy casualties were likely to be sustained in attacking the target.The Chief of the Air Staff&apos; said that aircraft on aerodromeswere not normally a very good target, and, if the Germans had considerable numbers of fighters at Stavanger, an attack on it mightnot prove a profitable operation.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 85thConclusions.)Operations offthe coast of norway:destroyer attackat Narvik.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that no reports hadbeen received from Renoivn of her engagement with two enemy vessels the previous morning, though she had broken wireless silenceand was evidently all right.An attack had been made by destroyers on the German ships at Narvik at dawn that morning. It had been realised that this operation might be a hazardous one owing to the possibility thatthe Germans might have gained possession of the two 8-inchNorwegian coast defence vessels. In the event it had been foundthat these two vessels had been sunk, but that there was a Germancruiser in the fjord. Our attack had been carried out by 5 destroyers,which had been repulsed with the loss of Hardy (ashore) and Hunter(sunk).The Captain of the flotilla had presumably collected the^remainder of his force and would be joining Renown and Rcpidse..These two vessels would shortly have to refuel, but another force was being sent up to replace them.Consideration had been given to a naval attack on the german ships in Bergen, but in view of the possibility that the germans had obtained possession of the coast batteries, it had heen decided not to carry out this operation.  The Royal Air Force had attacked.[21141]b 2
the ships in port, as had already been described by the Secretaryof State for Air, and in addition 14 Skuas of the Fleet Air Armhad attacked that morning, scoring 3 hits. All, except one, had returned safely.The Fleet with the Commander-in-Chief had been heavily bombed for 3 hours during the afternoon. Rodney had been hit by a 1,000-lb. armour-piercing bomb, but had sustained no damageof any importance. This was a very satisfactory indication ofthe success of our deck armour. 2 cruisers had received minor damage from near misses, but were not in any way out of action.Aurora had also been heavily attacked, and the destroyer Ghurkaaccompanying her had been hit and sunk. Most of the crew hadbeen saved.The Commander-in-Chief with his Fleet was closing up withthe advanced units which he had off the Norwegian coast. Warspiteand Furious were now with him, and it was intended to carry out a torpedo attack from the air on the Hipper cruiser in Trondhjemjust before dark.One of our submarines claimed to have hit a &apos;&apos; koln &apos;&apos; classcruiser with 3 torpedoes and, in spite of having been heavily depth-charged, was returning with only multiple minor damage. Zulu,which was escorting 2 destroyers damaged in collision, claimed tohave sunk a U-boat.An S.O.S. from a German ship which had suffered severe damage from coastal batteries had been intercepted.The Prime Minister drew attention to the fact that theAdmiralty communique had stated that in the air attack on theFleet no battleship had been damaged.The First Lord of the A dmiralty undertook to consider whetherit would be desirable to include in a subsequent communique astatement to the effect that one battleship had been hit but had suffered no damage.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Royal Air Force.Instructions to aircraft to attackshipping in theSkagerrak with-out warning.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 86thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Secretary of State for Air asked that authority mightbe given to our aircraft to attack without warning all shipping seen in the Skagerrak on the lines of the authority given to our submarineCommanders the previous day.The First Sea Lord said that the Germans had announced thatall traffic in the Skagerrak had been stopped. Any merchant shipsmust therefore be either troopships or storeships.The War Cabinet :-Authorised the Secretary of State for Air to issue instruc-tions on the lines proposed.Supreme War 4.   The Prime Minister said that at the Meeting of theCouncil: 7th Supreme War Council the previous day M. Reynaud had emphasisedMeeting. the vital importance of securing Narvik.   At that time it had not(Previous been known whether or not Narvik was occupied by the Germans,Reference: and it had been decided that while all preparations should be madeW.M.

It would be necessary to counter criticism ofthis kind.The Prime Minister said that the Secret Session on economic warfare, which had been arranged for the following day, was nowobviously out of date. Subject to the agreement of the Opposition,he suggested that its place should be taken by an open debate, atwhich the First Lord of the Admiralty should make a full state-ment, and should speak first.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he proposed to deal in his speech particularly with the naval aspect of recent events.A discussion ensued on the line which should be taken in answer to criticisms of our failure to forestall or prevent theGerman occupation of Norway. The following were the main points which were made : (i) There had been a wholesale abuse of Norwegian territorial waters, which had been entirely to the advantage ofthe Germans.(ii) Bad weather had acted in favour of the Germans.(iii) A completely unscrupulous enemy enjoyed the advantageof being able to prepare and execute plans without regard to international law or the decencies ofcivilisation.(iv) The popular notion was that the Germans must have sentexpeditions comprising transports and battleships to each of the points where they had landed. In fact, this had not been so. Only in the case of Oslo had the transports and vessels travelled together.   In all other[21141] b 3Debate in theHouse ofCommons.
cases the men-of-war alone had been seen in the opensea, and the transports must have moved surreptitiously-through Territorial Waters, over which we had no control.(v) It should be made clear that the blame attached not tous but to the neutrals, and we should take every opportunity of bringing this point home.A discussion ensued on our strategical plans for dealing withthe Scandinavian position, a record of which is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.German Ocou- 6.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theEconomic War Cabinet that a small Committee, under the Chairmanship of relations. the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had been set up(Previous to consider the results of the conversations on economic mattersReference: which had been conducted in Rome by the Master of the Rolls andW.M.

Italy.possible intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 84thConclusions,Minute 6.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs invited theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 334 DIPP of the7th April, from Sir Noel Charles, at Rome, recording a conversation between the Duke of Aosta and Lady Loraine, and summarising the duke&apos;s impressions of Signor Mussolini&apos;s feelings at the presenttime : Italy&apos;s situation was difficult and dangerous. She feltthreatened on both sides, and her object was to stay out of awar which would mean ruin. He was afraid that the AlliedStaffs might wish to get at Germany on the flank, throughItaly. He likewise feared that if the Germans did not attackon the Western Front, they would enter Italy. In his view,the Allies were too confident, their military preparations werenot developed fast enough, and they were insufficiently aware of the strength of the German military machine. Accordingto the Duke of Aosta, Signor Mussolini was aware of, andshared, the hatred of the whole country for Germany, butfeared German military strength.In the discussion which ensued, it was pointed out that,, onthis showing, Signor Mussolini was more kindly disposed to theAllies than according to other recent reports. At the same time,this account accorded with other recent reports in leading to theconclusion that Signor Mussolini would join the side which hethought would win. If this account was true, however, signor mussolini was not deliberately trying to bring Italy into the war on germany&apos;s side.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement and discussion.Western Front.Attitude ofBelgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 85thConclusions.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to theWar Cabinet telegram No. 60 DIPP from Brussels, replying tothe communication which the French and British Governments had sent to the Belgian Government as the result of the Supreme WarCouncil Meeting held the previous day (see also Minute 4 above).The main point in this reply was that the Belgian Minister forForeign Affairs had expressed himself as emphatically opposed to aceptance of our proposal, but had said that the military advantageinvolved would not satisfy public opinion that the BelgianGovernment would be justified in departing from their policy of neutrality. The Government might, however, be prepared toconsider our proposal more favourably if they could be assured thatthe Allied forces would take up a more advanced position and thusprevent the war being fought in the heart of Belgium. The minister had said, in reply to a question, that the Belgian Government would,of course, invite us to enter their country the moment they were certain that an attack was imminent.- The War Cabinet took note of the above Statement, and agreed that the first step was to consult the French Govern-ment regarding the suggestion in this telegram as to theposition which the Allied forces would occupy in Belgium.
German Occu-pation of denmark:treatment of danish Ships.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 86thConclusions,Minute 3.)11. The Minister of Shipping recalled that on the previous day the War Cabinet had approved the action which had beentaken to detain or divert to Allied ports Norwegian and Danishships. Since then the situation had clarified, so far as Denmarkwas concerned, and that country must now be regarded as havingpassed completely under the control of Germany. It followed thatshe must be regarded as the equivalent of an enemy; and the WarCabinet would no doubt now wish to give instructions that Danishships should be seized, and not merely detained or diverted. his department had already discussed these matters with the ForeignOffice.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that,if Danish shipping was to be seized, it would have to be decided whether an exception was to be made for shipping chartered to theUnited States, Italy and Japan. On the one hand, it would be most undesirable to make exceptions which would result in any consider-able proportion of Denmark&apos;s shipping escaping from our hands.On the other hand, we had to consider our relations with the threeimportant neutral countries which he had named.The Minister of Economic Warfare pointed out that, if thisway of escape wxere provided, large numbers of Danish ships would at once take refuge in neutral ports, in which event we should be deprived of their use for the whole period of the war. In replyto a question, the Minister agreed that a solution to the whole problem might possibly be found in our chartering Danish ships,at rates well below the current charter rates, rather than seizingthem. There were, however, objections to this expedient, includingthe serious financial objection that Germany would probably acquire a certain amount of foreign exchange as a result of the charters.In discussion it was pointed out that Danish shipowners were no longer free agents. There could be little doubt that they were already under strong pressure from the Germans to give instructionsto their vessels to take refuge in neutral harbours.The best solution with regard to Danish shipping charteredto the three neutrals might be not to seize it, in the technical sense of the word, but to divert or detain it on Contraband or EnemyExport pretexts.   This view met with general acceptance.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that the ContrabandCommittee after consultation with him had decided to seize allcargoes in Danijsh^vessels, whatever the ownership of such cargoes.Arrangements weH* afterwards be made for the release of the cargoes, in cases where these were neutrally owned.The Minister of Shipping said that the question would arise in due course how we were to man the Danish ships which we hadseized.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that there wouldbe cases in which the Danish crews would prefer to work their ships, under our orders, rather than to return to their own country.The Minister of Shipping said that such offers of service wouldbe very useful. Nevertheless, the fact must be faced that we should require additional trained personnel (certificated engineers, &amp;c.)and his proposal was that the Service Ministers and the Ministerof Supply should be invited to release a certain number of qualifiedmen who were now serving in the Forces, or employed in dockyardsand munition factories.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he would gladlydiscuss this point with the Minister of Shipping. Prima facie,however, he would find it difficult to release men from the dockyards,which were themselves badly in need of additional personnel.   It
273 W.M.87 (40).might be found on enquiry that the situation as regards the Danishvessels could be met to a certain extent by drawing on men of the mercantile Marine who were out of employment, owing to their ships having been sunk by enemy action.It was generally agreed that no immediate decision was required as to the manning of Danish vessels. At the present stage the important thing was to make sure that the vessels themselves didnot escape from our control.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, in conjunctionwith the Minister of Shipping, the Minister for economic warfare and any other Ministers concerned, to issueimmediate instructions for the seizure of all Danishvessels which came into our hands, with the exceptionof vessels chartered to the United States, Italy, and japan.(ii) Agreed that in the case of vessels chartered to the UnitedStates, Italy, and Japan, the instructions should be forthe time being to divert and detain the vessels onContraband Control or Enemy Export pretexts.(iii) Took   note   that   the   Contraband   Committee   afterconsultation with the Minister for Economic Warfarehad decided to seize the cargoes of all Danish vessels- that came into our hands, whatever the ownership ofsuch cargoes; but that arrangements could afterwardsbe made to release cargoes in cases where these wereneutrally owned.(iv) Invited the Minister of Shipping, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the other ministers concerned, to arrange for action similar tothat authorised at (i) and (iii) above to be taken by allied, Dominion and Colonial authorities.(v) Left for determination at a later stage the question of theuse to be made of vessels seized under (i) above, includingthe possibility of re-allocating certain of them to neutral countries.(vi) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty and theMinister of Shipping would examine, in consultation,the question of the manning for our own purposes ofseized Danish vessels, should the present crews be unwilling to continue to serve.German Occu-pation of norway: Treat-ment ofNorwegianShips.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 86thConclusions,Minute 3.)12. The Prime Minister pointed out that the prospect had tobe faced that the Norwegian Government might capitulate toGermany at any moment. This being so, a decision was required asto the treatment of Norwegian ships in that eventuality.The Minister of Shipping said that, in the event contemplated,he would recommend the immediate seizure of all Norwegian ships(or their detention, if they were on charter to the United States,Italy or Japan), even if such seizure or detention involved someinterference with our imports programme. It was essential to ourprosecution of the war that the Norwegian tanker fleet, or aconsiderable part of it, should be at our disposal.This aspect of the problem was so important that it might be worth while, even at the eleventh hour, to make a. strong bid to persuade the Norwegian Government to transfer the whole of theirMercantile Marine forthwith to the British flag, under guarantee that it would be returned at the end of the war.It was generally agreed that, although the prospects of successmight be slight, the Norwegian Government ought to be strongly pressed to accept this proposal.
The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to issueimmediate instructions to His Majesty&apos;s representative in Norway, with a view to the Norwegian government being persuaded to transfer the whole of theirMercantile Marine forthwith to the British flag, underguarantee of its return at the end of the war.(ii) Agreed that, in the event of the capitulation of theNorwegian Government, the conclusions recorded in minute 11 above, as to the seizure or detention of Danishvessels should apply mutatis mutandis to Norwegianvessels.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,April 10, 1940.
