Tne Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that on Saturday,Situation. 6th April,  there had been little enemy air activity and no(Previous interceptions had been made.   The usual patrols and escorts had reference:        been provided. In France an engagement had occurred between nineW.M.

Command, and a force of Blenheims had been despatched to attackthem. They consisted of the Battle cruiser Gneisenau, two cruisers of the &apos;&apos; Leipzig &apos;&apos; class, a vessel of type unidentified, and fourteendestroyers. Between 1-20 and 1-30 p.m. bombing attacks had beencarried out on the battle-cruiser and one of the smaller cruisers.No direct hits had been observed although there had been severalnear misses, one of which had been very close to the Gneisenau.On Sunday morning reconnaisances had been sent out by the coastal Command. At 8-45 a.m. one cruiser and six destroyers,accompanied by eight Messerschmitts 110 aircraft, had beenreported thirty-two miles west of Horns Reef steaming north. At12-30 three destroyers had been reported seventy-five miles N.N.W.of Horns Reef steaming south. They had still been on this course at 2 p.m. A striking force of twenty-three Wellingtons had takenoff at 1-15 p.m. to attack the enemy force reported above. TheWellingtons had searched an area to the west of Jutland Bank,but had not located the enemy. Their rear section had been engaged- by three Messerschmitts 110 aircraft, and in the course of the engagement two Wellingtons and one Messerschmitt had been shot down, and one other Messerschmitt was believed to have been hit.While the Wellingtons were on their way to their objective theyhad sighted a submarine ninety miles South-West of Oberstadt at12-50 p.m. The submarine had dived immediately, on the approach of the aircraft.There had been two inconclusive engagements between Hudsonsand Dornier 18 flying boats south of the Naze. One of the Hudsonshad sighted a stationary merchant vessel painted grey with whitesuper-structure sixty miles south of the Naze. On the approach ofthe aircraft the vessel had got under way, and had opened fire with two machine guns, and when last seen it was steering north atsix knots.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 83rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Laying of mine-fields in norwegian territorial waters.German fleetactivity.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the minefieldin the Vest Fjord had been laid between 4-30 and 5-30 that morning. The force engaged on the operation consisted of HisMajesty&apos;s ships Renown, Birmingham, and 12 Destroyers. One ofthe latter, H.M.S. Gloivworm, had had a man overboard during the night, and had stopped to search for him. She had become separated from the rest of the force, but had followed later.As reported by the Secretary of State for Air, a German Fleet,consisting of a battle cruiser, 2 light cruisers, 14 Destroyers, andanother ship whose identity had not yet been established, but whichwas thought to be a transport, had been located the previous daymoving towards the Naze across the mouth of the Skagerrak.[21122]
It had been hard to believe that this force could possibly beintending to go to Narvik, although a report from Copenhagen on 6th April had indicated that it was Hitler&apos;s intention to seize that port; and it had been thought that the German ships wouldprobably turn into the Skagerrak. However, the following move-ments had been ordered : British naval The fleet consisting of His Majesty&apos;s ships, Rodney, Repulse,counter- Valiant, 2 cruisers, and 10 Destroyers had sailed from Scapa atmeasures. 8-30 p.m. on 7th April.The second Cruiser Squadron, consisting of 2 cruisers and15 Destroyers, had sailed from Rosyth at 10 p.m. on 7th April.The outward bound Norwegian convoy had been ordered toproceed West of the Shetlands, and the homeward bound convoydue to leave Norway had been stopped.The force which was to have laid the Southern minefield hadbeen ordered back until the situation could be cleared up, and the armed merchant cruisers on the Norwegian patrol had been withdrawn.The fleet had set a course parallel to the Norwegian coast.At 8-30 a.m. that morning H.M.S. Glowworm, in a position about 150 miles South-West of the entrance to the Vest Fjord, had reported being engaged with an enemy Destroyer to the southward.The enemy had appeared to be concentrating with anotherDestroyer, so H.M.S. Glowworm had withdrawn to theNorthward to draw them that way. Shortly afterwards she had reported seeing another Destroyer ahead of her, and at about 9 - 45she had become silent since when nothing had been heard from her.From this, it appeared that the German force was undoubtedlymaking towards Narvik. It was calculated that if they wereunopposed, they could reach there about 10 p.m.; but they would no doubt be engaged by His Majesty&apos;s ships Renotvn and birmingham, and the Destroyers which had been laying the mine-field, and an action might take place very shortly.It was impossible to foretell the risks of war, but such an action should not be on terms unfavourable for us.The Commander-in-Chief in the Home Fleet, who would be approaching the scene of action from the South, would now be aboutopposite Statland, and would be fully aware of the situation though he was naturally remaining silent. The Germans wouldalso know that the Fleet was at sea, since a German submarine near the Orkneys had been heard to transmit a long message as the fleetleft Scapa.Meanwhile, the Second Cruiser Squadron, which was offKinnaird&apos;s Head moving North, reported that it was being-shadowed by aircraft, -and expected to be attacked about noon. Allpossible measures were being taken to bring fighters to the scene.The Admiralty had judged it desirable to do everything theycould to ensure that the German ships would not be able to return home.  Everything possible had therefore been ordered out.The First Cruiser Squadron, which had been taking on troops at Rosyth for the possible operation of occupying Norwegian ports,had disembarked the troops and explosives, and would be sailingshortly without them.H.M.S. Aurora and 6 destroyers, which were in the Clyde inconnection with the same operation, had been ordered to sail roScapa.The Commander-in-Chief had been told of these moves, andhad been asked to give orders if he found himself in a position todo so. If no orders were given by 3 p.m., the Admiralty would issuethem themselves.No aircraft carriers were available, but flying boats were operating. The weather was thick in places, but was believed to bebetter in the North, and to be improving.
247 W.M.84(40).      JgJIn the ensuing discussion there were speculations as to theobject of the German move. It was thought quite possible that herr Hitler might have ordered Narvik to be seized,preparatory measure to the occupation of Lulea when the ice melted.It might also be the intention, when the force had been landed, tosend the Gneisenau out into the oceans as a raider. In any case, thewhole operation seemed to be a most hazardous venture.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that the norwegians might be told of what was going on, not through the diplomatic channel, but by the Admiralty. This was agreed to. Afurther suggestion was made that we should link the German movewith the laying of the minefield. On this it was felt that it would,on the whole, be best to let the German move speak for itself.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the statement by the First Lord,(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to pass on to theNorwegian naval authorities the information we hadreceived as to German naval movements.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for War said there was nothing ofimportance to report.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the sequence of events in regard to the Operation in norwegian territorial Waters, so far as the Foreign Office were concerned, hadbeen as follows, in the period immediately following the actuallaying of the minefield at 4-30 that morning : &apos;5-30 a.m.British and French Representatives presented to theNorwegian Foreign Office a Note informing the norwegian government of the action taken.5 a.m.The B.B.C. began the broadcasting of the AlliedDeclaration.Action being taken that morning.Circular communication in regard to the action takenbeing distributed to all Foreign Missions in London.His Majesty&apos;s Representatives abroad making a communi-cation to the Governments to which they were respectivelycredited; their French colleagues were acting in concert withthem.The following was a summary of a wireless communicationissued from Berlin at 8-30 that morning : The Allied action in laying mines in norwegian territorial Waters had created consternation in Oslo; theNorwegian Prime Minister and M. Koht, the Foreign Minister,had at once conferred together; and a Meeting of the ForeignAffairs Committee of the Norwegian Chamber had been called for 10 a.m. The French and British Ministers at Oslo were reported to have called at the Norwegian Foreign Office at a.m.[21122]b 3

The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 83rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Scandinavia.Action in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W.M.; (40) 83rdConclusions,Minute 6.)3.

As regards Stockholm, no official announcement had yetbeen made and the news had arrived too late for inclusion inthat morning5s papers; it was added, however, that the allied action was regarded flagrant breach of neutrality.&quot;The &quot;War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Royal Marine 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to theOperation. War Cabinet a letter from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, in(Previous which Sir Ronald Campbell gave further particulars regarding the reference: circumstances in which the proposal relating to the Royal MarineW.M. (40) 82nd Operation had been shelved at the request of the French Govern-Conclusions, ment. Particulars of this information are contained in the minute 6.)        Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.In discussion, the War Cabinet were informed that it was common knowledge in France that a second Operation had been contemplated. There seemed, however, to be more than one version of what constituted the second Operation.The Minister without Portfolio said that he was seeing theDominion High Commissioners that afternoon, on behalf of theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs; so far as he was aware,they had not yet been given any information on the subject of theRoyal Marine Operation.The Prime Minister said that he did not think that any communication on this subject was necessary at the present time.The War Cabinet-(a) Took note of the above discussion.(b) Agreed that no communication on the subject of the royal marine Operation should at present be made to theDominion Governments.Italy.possible intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 81stConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Rome : Telegram No. 335 DIPP, dated 7th April, 1940, reporting that the Military Attache had that day been informed by theGreek Military Attache that he had obtained reliable information that the Italian Fleet was concentrated at Taranto.The Military Attache feared a coup against Corfu. Sir NoelCharles added that the object of the concentration might beto discourage British warships from entering the Adriatic or,alternatively, to provide a naval demonstration if the projectedvisit of the King of Italy to Albania materialised.Telegram No. 332 DIPP, dated 6th April, 1940, reporting that reliable information had been received that afternoon thatconscripts of the 1915 and 1916 classes had been called up inaddition to reservists. It was estimated that the numbersconcerned were between twenty and thirty thousand men.These telegrams should perhaps be set against the information regarding the shortage of food-stuffs, &amp;c., in Italy, reported in SirNoel Charles&apos;s Telegram No. 63 (Saving) of the 4th April.In reply to a question by the Lord Privy Seal, the First Lordof the Admiralty said that no naval action of an exceptionalcharacter was being taken in the Adriatic, though the german merchant ships moving up the Yugoslav coast inside territorial waters were being kept under observation.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, when he saw Sir Percy Loraine later in the day, he would consult with himon the question whether it would be advisable to make any com-munication to the Italian Government regarding these navalmovements.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Neutral Terri-torial Waters.Instructions toHis Majesty&apos;s ships regardingattacks on enemy warvessels.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 94thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on Instructions toHis Majesty&apos;s ships regarding attacks on enemy war vessels in neutral Territorial Waters (W.P. (40) 119).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his memorandum had perhaps been a little superseded by the swiftcurrent of events. Moreover, it would be recollected that the WarCabinet had first considered this question in connection with theDeutschland last November. The First Lord of the Admiralty had then issued orders, with the concurrence of the War Cabinet, that ifthe Deutschland were found in Norwegian Territorial Waters bythe Fleet, the latter should be allowed to attack her. Subsequently,in the Altmark case, orders had been issued that if enemy surfacevessels took refuge in, or were found inside, the Territorial waters of Norway, the Faroes or Iceland, they were to be attacked, exceptwhen this would endanger life in towns and villages. these instructions added that an endeavour should be made to engage the vessel before she entered Territorial Waters.It had been pointed out that these orders went beyond the WarCabinet decision in November in the Deutschland case. TheMemorandum now put before the War Cabinet, which had beenapproved by the First Lord, sought to regularise the position, andto widen the instructions given in the Deutschland case by extendingpermission to attack German ships in Territorial Waters (i) To surface vessels other than the Deutschland.(ii) To submarines.(iii) To the Territorial Waters of Iceland and the faroe islands as well as those of Norway.If the War Cabinet were to agree to these three extensions, Xh&amp;ywould serve as a basis for standing orders to the Fleet. No public announcement of them would be made. Situations calling for actionoutside the scope of these instructions would have to be dealt withas special cases.The First Lord, of the Admiralty expressed concurrence.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the  amplification  of  instructions  regardingattacks on enemy war vessels in Neutral territorial waters as proposed in W.P. (40) 119.(ii) Agreed that cases calling for action beyond the scope ofthese instructions would require special authority.Norway.Chartering ofNorwegiantankers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 78thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping on the negotiations for securing the use ofadditional Norwegian tankers (W.P. (G.) (40) 98).The Minister of Shipping said that, in spite of the events whichhad occurred since he had prepared his Memorandum, he thoughtit better that his representative should leave for Norway that evening as planned to continue the negotiations for charteringtankers, rather than that by suspending the negotiations we should
seem to anticipate that the Norwegians would make difficulties. Arepresentative of the Norwegian shipowners whom he had seen that morning had not shown any sense of hostility because of our mine-laying operation. On the contrary, he had been in a very friendlymood and had asked for the formula for degaussing.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the admiralty would be ready to supply this.There was general agreement that the negotiations should, ifpossible, be continued as planned.Continuing, the Minister of Shipping said that the negotia-tions would have to cover (1) the rate of hire for the tankers already covered by theexisting agreements; and(2) the chartering of additional tankers.On (1), he thought that the threat of reducing coal supplies wasthe most useful bargaining factor; on the second, that the most powerful inducement would be the offer of Gladiator aircraft.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out the very close connection between these two aspects of the negotiations, since the securing of additional tankers would deprive the Norwegian ship-owners of a very powerful lever for forcing up the rates of thetankers covered by the existing agreements.As regards coal supplies, the Under-Secretary for Mines&apos;pointed out that we were under no treaty obligation to keep up oursupply of coal, though the Norwegians had to some extent a moralclaim to expect this from us. The threat to withhold coal supplies would be very valuable for a time, as, although Germany was anxious to compete with, us in this market, it would take some timefor her to organise supplies.It was generally agreed that the utmost possible use should bemade of this bargaining counter.As regards the supply of aircraft, the Secretary of State forAir said that it would be possible to supply twenty-four Gladiatorsin about a month&apos;s time. He was advised by the Air Staff that, as this type of aircraft was going out of use, this number could be spared without detriment to our own position, or to our prepara-tions for the possibility of operations in Scandinavia.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that the representa-tive of his Department associated with the negotiations had been authorised to offer the Norwegian shipowners that we shouldexempt their ships from calling at Kirkwall, if we were allowed toappoint cargo examiners. The Norwegian Government had been opposed to such appointments, and it would, therefore, be very valuable if we were able to offer some inducement to the Governmentto take a more accommodating attitude. At one stage, for example,the Norwegians had expressed the hope that we would undertaketo use our influence with the French against a policy of forcibleaction in Norwegian territorial waters. No such undertaking had,.of course, been given. At the present stage, the offer of Gladiatoraircraft ought to weigh very heavily with the norwegian government.The Minister of Shipping suggested that, as the Gladiatorswere to be paid for by the Norwegian Government, and as theywere strictly the concern of the Government and not of the ship-owners, the offer of these aircraft should more properly be conveyedthrough the British Minister at Oslo, rather than through those concerned with the shipping negotiations. The same would applyto the threat to withhold coal supplies.
Norway.Action to betaken if theshipping agree-ment isdenounced.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hewas anxious to obtain a decision of the War Cabinet, with a viewto preparations for such action as might be necessary, if the norwegians should denounce their shipping agreement with us, asa result of the laying of mines in their territorial, waters. It mightbe necessary in such circumstances to exercise our right of angaryover Norwegian shipping within our jurisdiction. If this were approved in principle, it was contemplated that His Majesty&apos;governments in this country and in the Dominions, and the colonial governments should take steps to hold all Norwegian shipping inBritish ports or contraband stations, which was either on charter to us or acting freely, or chartered to neutrals other than the UnitedStates, Italy or Japan. Norwegian shipping on the high seas otherthan that chartered to the United States, Italy or Japan should bebrought in to British ports. An immediate decision on the questionof principle was desirable, so that the matter could be examined bythe Dominion Governments and preparatory action taken. steps were needed to ensure that we received timely intelligence of the movements of Norwegian vessels, and plans had to be made to dealwith such questions as the rates of hire to be payable, provisionof crews, and possible measures to ensure that British ships werenot detained in Norwegian ports. There was also the possibilityof having to take similar steps in regard to Swedish shipping. no action other than preparatory measures would, however, be taken without a further decision by the War Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that we might haveto take action on the lines suggested, and that it was reasonable to make the necessary preparations, but he doubted whether itwould be wise to justify our action by reference to the doctrine ofangary. In any case, this was not applicable to shipping on thehigh seas.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed, and undertook to send an appropriate message in regard to the aircraft,if the Air Ministry would provide the necessary material.The War Cabinet (i) Authorised the Minister of Shipping to convey to therepresentative of the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Associationtechnical information as to our methods of de-magnetisation.(ii) Authorised   the   Minister   of   Shipping   to   send   arepresentative to Norway to continue negotiations as tothe chartering of additional tankers, and as to the ratesof hire for tankers covered by existing agreements : theprogress of the negotiations to be reported to the WarCabinet in due course before the conclusion of an agree-ment.(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Afairs, afterconsultation with the Secretary of State for Air, to send a telegram to the British Minister at Oslo, authorisinghim to inform the Norwegian Government of our readiness to supply up to twenty-four Gladiator aircraft for early delivery, if a satisfactory conclusion were reached to our negotiations with regard to tankers.(iv) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, afterconsultation with the President of the Board of Trade,to inform the British Minister at Oslo of the position inregard to British coal exports to Norway, and toauthorise him to make such use as he might think fit ofthis factor in the negotiations.
The Prime Minister suggested that it would be valuable to convey a hint to the Norwegians that we might take such forcibleaction to secure the use of their vessels, if they were to break their shipping agreement.The Minister of Shipping said that he would bear this pointin mind. He suggested that our preparatory action in this matter should be co-ordinated with that of the French Government.The War Cabinet-(i) Authorised   the   First   Lord   of   the   Admiralty,   inconjunction with the other Departments concerned, toput in hand preliminary measures in preparation for apossible decision to take forcible possession of Norwegianshipping, other than that chartered to the United Statesof America, Italy or Japan, in the event of theNorwegian Shipping Agreement being denounced.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tocommunicate with the French Government, with a viewto co-ordinating British and French preparations in thismatter.(iii) Agreed that no action, other than preparatory measures,should be taken without further reference to the WarCabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,April 8, 1940.
