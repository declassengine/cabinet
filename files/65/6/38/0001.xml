The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Royal Air Forceactivity.Night mine-laying operations.Attacks onStavangeraerodrome.German troop-carryingaircraft.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that the reconnaissance and offensive sweep of Wilhelmshaven and Schillig Roads byBlenheim aircraft had been abandoned owing to lack of cloud cover.Twenty-three Hampdens had been despatched on a night mine-laying operation in the Great and Little Belts. Eight aircraft were known to have completed their tasks successfully, but theremainder had not found their objective. One Hampden wasmissing; one had come down in the sea off Ramsgate; one hadcrashed on the beach in Northumberland; but the remainder had returned safely.The Secretary of State said the weather had been very badand, in the last three or four days, we had lost 14 big machines.He thought that the carrying out of these mine-laying operationsmust depend to a certain extent upon the weather.The First Lord of the A dmiralty agreed.The Secretary of State for Air, continuing, said that consider-able shipping activity had been seen in the Erederich Roads, atMiddlefart and at Nyborg. Reconnaissance of the norwegian coast had been continued the previous day.The previous night six Hudson aircraft had been despatchedon a night bombing attack on Stavanger aerodrome. The first two had reached the objective and it was believed that a hangarhad been hit and other bombs had exploded on and around the aerodrome. The &quot;black-out&quot; had been intense and the extent ofthe damage had not therefore been seen. Intense anti-aircraft firehad been encountered. The remaining four aircraft had been unableto penetrate owing to very bad weather and one of them had notreturned.Considerable numbers of German reinforcements were arriving in Norway by air. He understood that the Germans had some500 troop-carrying aircraft which carried between 20 and 30 meneach.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Naval activity.The Fleet air arm attack onBergen.Submarineoperations.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave particulars of the movements of the Home Eleet.A strong naval force was operating in the Tromsoe area andto the Northward. Part of this force was proceeding to Kirkenesto capture an ammunition ship containing explosives and H.A.guns detained by the Norwegian authorities. Another part of itwas covering the arrival of the Convoy into Vaagsf jord.H.M.S. War spite and destroyers were in the approaches toVest Fjord.&apos; H.M. ships Kimberley and Ivanhoe had operated in NarvikBay and H.M.S. Kimberley had reported that the harbour was nowstrongly held by machine gun posts.H.M.S. Penelope had been badly damaged and would have tobe beached.H.M.S. Eskimo was being towed by H.M.S. Bedouin and was expected to arrive at Skjel Fjord at 3 a.m. that morning.The Fleet Air Arm had attacked Bergen at 7-15 and 8 -15 theprevious morning and had obtained hits on one transport alongside,and had damaged the jetty.Reports from submarines had been received from time to time.H.M. submarine Narwhal had reported the previous night that[21156]e 2
her mines had been laid without incident, but that she had beenhunted and had expended 6 torpedoes without result.At 5 o&apos;clock that morning H.M. submarine Snapper had reported that she had attacked a convoy off the Skaw and had obtained two hits and possibly four. The Snapper had nowexpended all her torpedoes.H.M. submarine Sunfish had reported sinking 4 merchantvessels and had only one torpedo left.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had seen the Netherlands Minister, who had told him that we hadbombed a Dutch submarine. The Minister had been quite friendly and had even apologised for the submarine being outside DutchTerritorial Waters. He had explained that this was a privateintimation, but that he would probably follow it up with a formal protest. The Foreign Secretary had explained that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would, of course, express their regret.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 4.)Norway.3. The Secretary of State for War said that in the Oslo area the Germans had made some progress towards the West and werein occupation of Larvik, Konjsberg, Honefoss and Gjevenlaker, andwere gradually spreading out.The Norwegian Naval unit at Trondhjem had reported thatthe Germans had captured the West Battery at the entrance to theFjord. Norwegian troops in the neighbourhood were holding theirown. A German force was reported somewhere betweenTrondhjem and Stenkjaer, which was still in Norwegian hands.Namsos was held by Norwegian Regular troops, but not strongly,and the nearest Germans were believed to be 60 kilometres away.General Mackesy reported that Harstad was clear of the enemy,who held the South shore of Gratangen Fjord with about 400 men.The enemy strength at Narvik was estimated at about 2,000.The Norwegians were said to be in contact with the enemy east of the Gratangen Fjord. Headquarters Norwegian 6th division was at Bardu, and one Brigade was concentrated in the area Lund-Forsbrakkon. One Norwegian Battalion was reported to be holding position on the railway East of Narvik at Hundalon.A Norwegian official source had reported from Stockholm thattwelve German transport vessels, not in convoy, were proceedingNorth along the Norwegian coast.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Sweden.Return toLondon of AlliedMission.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 3.) .4. The War Cabinet again had under consideration certainprojected operations in Norway. A record of the discussion, andof the conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theAllied Mission to Stockholm was returning to London that day.He had arranged to see the Mission at 3 p.m. that afternoon, andit would be useful if a representative of the Chiefs of Staffs could also be present.The War Cabinet :-Invited Major-General Ismay to attend this Meeting andto report on the points raised to the Military Co-co-ordination committee at its Meeting later in the day.
325W.M.93 (40).Germany.Attack onScandinaviaundertakenagainst advice of the high command.State of opinion in Berlin.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadreceived a report from the Polish Intelligence Service in France,which the latter regarded as reliable, which stated that the Germanoperations in Scandinavia had been undertaken against the adviceboth of the German High Command and of the German Admiralty.Subsequent events had widened the split between the Governmentand the High Command. The report stated also that the german troops operating in Norway belonged to mountain infantryformations.Telegram No. 90 DIPP dated the 14th April, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, The Hague, contained a report from the netherland Naval Staff to the effect that the Germans had originally intended to invade Denmark, Norway and Sweden simultaneously onthe 15th May, 1940, and that it was on account of the danger to german morale that it had been decided to expedite the attack onthe two first-named countries.The Foreign Secretary drew attention also to telegram No. 131,dated the 14th April, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Representative,Belgrade, stating that a high official in the Yugoslav Ministry forForeign Affairs had informed him that a telegram had been received that da)?- from the Yugoslav Minister in Berlin reporting that therewas great consternation there among the public.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Denmark. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a return of His telegram had been received from Mr. Howard Smith, His Majesty&apos;sMajesty&apos;s Minister, Copenhagen, stating that he was arriving at FolkestoneMinister, at 4-30 p.m. that afternoon and adding that he had destroyed hisCopenhagen.       cyphers.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 10.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams bearing on the probable intentions ofthe Italian Government: Telegram No. 371 DIPP, dated the 14th April, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Minister, Rome. The Air Attache had heard from a good source that there had been a heated discussion inhigh circles regarding the entry of Italy into the war. MarshalBalbo, the Duke of Aosta and Air Marshal Tedeschini (andSir Noel Charles was inclined to add Count Ciano) were statedat present to be against participation. Signor Mussolini was stated to have been displeased with their attitude and to havegiven instructions for the intensified training of air personnel.The Italian Staff was so greatly impressed by false information given in the press and by local German sources that they were beginning to believe in the certainty of a German victory.Members of the Air Staff had asked the British Air Attachelegarding recent British Air and Naval activities and had been relieved when they heard how successful these had been.Telegram No. 38 DIPP, dated the 13th April, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Minister, the Vatican. The Cardinal Secretaryof State had that morning stated that he was slightly moreoptimistic than he had been a week ago regarding the prospects of Italy staying out of the war. The Cardinal had qualifiedhis statement by adding that developments were unpredictableand that his mild optimism was based on a short range viewof the future.
TheNetherlands.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 4.)Preparednessagainstinvasion.allied occupation ofNetherlandEast Indies inthe event of the invasion of theNetherlands.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the netherland Minister had informed him that morning that the netherland Government was rather less anxious. On the13th April, 1940, a full scale trial had been made of the defence measures, which had worked very satisfactorily. The NetherlandGovernment felt that the country was fully ready to defend itself.The Foreign Secretary drew attention also to telegram No. 519,dated the 13th April, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Washington, as to the probable reaction of opinion in the UnitedStates if the Allies were to occupy the Netherland East Indies inthe event of a German invasion of the Netherlands. Lord Lothian&apos;view was that opinion was unlikely to be intensely critical providedthat the matter was approached on the right lines.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Western Front. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that asAction to be arranged at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin,taken if the he nad sent for tlie Bej-belgian Ambassador the previous afternoonNetherlands or    (14th APri1&apos; 1940)-Belgium is The Foreign Secretary had said that he was astonishedinvaded. that any section of Belgian opinion should try to make mischief(Previous about our having reinforced the British armies in France.  WeReference: were at war with Germany, and at any moment we were.M. (40) 92nd expecting a violent attack. Further, if as seemed probable,Conclusions, Belgium herself was invaded, she would want us to have everyMinute 6.) man available to help her that we could.   Baron de CartierAttitude of the had at once begged the Foreign Secretary not to overestimateBelgian what he had said to Sir Alexander Cadogan on this subjectGovernment. at his interview the previous afternoon; 98 per cent, of thepopulation of Belgium was, he said, pro-Ally, but they hada tiny minority among the Flemish population who were out to make all the trouble they could, both for the Allies andfor the Belgian Government.The Secretary of State had then said that Germany would act with lightning speed, and we must be prepared to takecounter-action immediately. This was all the more difficultbecause neither Belgium nor the Netherlands had thought fitto consult us. Our security was vitally bound up with thatof both countries, and we should always give the utmostconsideration to the position of Belgium. Certain aspects ofthe matter had already been agreed upon between our twoGovernments : (i) In the case of Germany invading Belgium, the BelgianGovernment had already stated that they would invite us to their aid. The Secretary of State wasin a position to repeat that we should immediatelyrespond to this appeal;(ii) In the case of a German invasion of the Netherlands,and Belgium coming to the assistance of the latter,we should also give all the help in our power.As regards other hypotheses, the Belgian Government couldnot reasonably expect us to answer questions which might coverdifferent situations, unless at the same time they themselves
327 YV.M. 93 (40).were willing to answer questions which, with just as muchright, we might put to them on matters affecting our own security, e.g. -(a) What would Belgian policy be, if Holland was invaded 1(b) What would the Belgian Government do, if Hollandaccepted any proposals by Germany to establishherself to a greater or lesser degree in Holland, onthe Denmark model?(c) Would the Belgian Government expect us in such an event to do nothing?Baron de Cartier had replied that he thought our attitudevery reasonable. We were fully entitled not to answer questionsput to us as long as the Belgians refused to answer similarquestions of ours. He thought it would be helpful if he couldbe given a further letter which incorporated what the Secretaryof State had said and included a statement that we realised that, as the war developed, new circumstances must arise, butthat we had no intention of going back on our guarantees to belgium. He asked that a sentence might be included in thesame letter regarding the reinforcement of the British Armyin France.Later in the day the Foreign Secretary had accordingly written aletter to the Belgian Ambassador on the lines indicated above.-Communication At an interview that morning (15th April, 1940) with theto the Nether- Netherland Minister, the Foreign Secretary had taken theland Minister in opportunity of outlining the gist of what had passed between himLondon. and the Belgian Ambassador the previous day.   The NetherlandMinister had received this information well.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Soviet Union. 11.   The Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs drew attentionPossible Allied to Telegram No. 298 Saving from Paris. M. Reynaud had toldoperations in our Ambassador that morning that the French Ambassador tothe Caucasus. Moscow had warned him to keep a very watchful eye on Soviet(Previous Russia, since he thought it not unlikely that the Germans wouldEeference:        offer her Narvik if she liked to come in and take it.  M. ReynaudW.M. (40) 77th  had then referred to the decision taken at the 6th Meeting of theConclusions,      Supreme War Council and had asked that the study of the suggestedMinute 1.)        operation in the Caucasus, which was already being made inaccordance with that decision by the Chiefs of Staffs in London,might be expedited; he thought that this operation would be theright rejoinder to any hostile move by the U.S.S.R. M. Reynaud had made it clear that he still shared the British view that the allies should not force war with the U.S.S.R. and had added that he onlycontemplated putting the Caucasus operation into execution after some hostile act had been committed by the Soviet Government.The Secretary of State for Air said that in view ofM. Reynaud&apos;s request he would examine the matter again; but his view was that we could not now do more than bring to as higha state of readiness as possible, such forces and equipment as we might already have in the Middle East.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.
13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, setting out the action whichthe French Government were taking to secure the return of Frenchwar material which had been dispatched to Finland, and suggesting that we should not ask for the return of anything actually supplied(W.P. (40) 125).The Memorandum drew attention to 50 tons of cartridge cupswhich were outstanding on an order placed by Finland before thebeginning of the war, and proposed that this equipment shouldbe released if necessary on credit.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his paper had been prepared before the German invasion of Norway, and thatits conclusions were affected by the present situation in which itwas impossible for goods to pass to or from Finland. He thought,however, that the Finns might be told that they could have the50 tons of cartridge cups (which he understood were not requiredby the Service Departments) if they could take them away.Africa.Proposal totransfer WestAfricanContingent to east Africa.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)Finland.Supply ofmunitions.(previous references:W.M. (40) 65thConclusions,Minute 6,and 71stConclusions,Minute 12.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War setting out the present strength of theforces in East Africa, with the commitments which they might haveto undertake, and recommending that the Contingent of sixbattalions with supporting units, which had been held ready in west Africa since the beginning of the war, should be shipped to east Africa as soon as shipping could be made available(W.P. (40) 129).The Secretary of State for War explained that the transfer ofthe West African Contingent, which had always formed part of ourpeacetime plans for the security of East Africa, had been postponedby the War Cabinet when they had considered it in January. TheWar Office had now received an urgent request from General Wavellfor these troops to be sent, since otherwise the forces in East Africawould be ten battalions short of the total required for external defence, for internal security and to provide a Contingent for theprotection of the Anglo-Iranian oilfields until troops from india were ready to fulfil this task.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that there was now no political objection to the move, though he hoped that the division from India, which would eventually take on the defence ofthe Anglo-Iranian oilfields, would be ready to take over this com-commitment as early as possible. The employment of African troopsin the Middle East would not be a very satisfactory expedient.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that hewould like to inform General Smuts if this move were authorised,as it might help him to accelerate the despatch of the brigade from south Africa. The provision of air equipment, which had previously been an obstacle to the move of South African troops,had now been cleared up.The Secretary of State for War said that he would welcome an earlier arrival of South African troops in East Africa.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the West African Contingent of six battalionswith supporting units should be transferred to EastAfrica as soon as shipping could be made available.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs would tell General Smuts that this move was about totake place.
The following points were made in the ensuing discussion : (i) It would be highly undesirable to permit any equipment to go to the Finns unless they paid cash for it. Finlandhad never been in the commercial credit category, though we had supplied her with a great amount of equipment for which she could not pay cash, in order to prolong theFinnish struggle to our advantage. In this connection,the statement in paragraph 3 of the Memorandum that egypt and Afghanistan could place arms orders here on credit was incorrect.(ii) Although it was undesirable to hurt the feelings off inland, it would be foolish to supply her with anyfurther equipment, even if it were physically possiblefor it to be delivered. We should be receiving heavy demands from Norway, which we should rather meet.(iii) It seemed doubtful whether Finland could take delivery ofthe 50 tons of cartridge cups. The question was probably therefore rather academic. If, however, the finns could pay cash and could arrange delivery, we neednot object to releasing this order. But we could hardlyhold 50 tons of brass indefinitely at their disposal.The War Cabinet(1) Agreed in principle that no further equipment should besupplied to Finland subject to Departments havingdirection to agree to supply unimportant items whichcould easily be spared.(2) Agreed that any further supplies should be on a cashbasis.(3) As to the 50 tons of cartridge cups, invited the foreign secretary to see the Finnish Minister, and to inform him as to &apos;&apos; A &quot; above.Shipping.Control of neutral ships.(previous references:W.M. (40) 87thConclusions,Minutes 11 and12, andW.M. (40) 88thConclusions,Minute 12.)Banish vessels.14. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping reviewing the action taken as regardsNorwegian, Danish and Swedish vessels, and other vessels tradingto Scandinavian, Baltic and Arctic ports, and as &quot;regards othercontrol of neutral tonnage (W.P. (G.) (40) 104).The Minister of Shipping reminded the War Cabinet that allDanish vessels were now being detained and were being put inprize, with the exception of those chartered to the United States,Italy or Japan. He suggested that the exceptions should now be withdrawn. If maintained, they would seriously lessen the amountof Danish tonnage brought under our control.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concurred in thiscourse. He assumed that, if and when complaints were receivedfrom the three neutral countries in question, the Minister wouldbe prepared to consider re-chartering to them a number of the vessels in question, provided that this did not conflict with our ownnecessities.The Minister of Shipping said that he would be prepared toconsider such re-chartering, on the understanding that our own
Case of a Danishtanker now at gibraltar.Norwegianvessels.Norwegiantankers.Norwegianvessels proceed,ing to Allieddestinations.Norwegianvessels on certain neutralcharters.necessities were considered first. Under the procedure which he proposed, no payments made in respect of vessels re-chartered to neutrals would find their way back to Denmark or Germany.Alternatively, we could put equivalent tonnage at the disposal of thecharterers in neutral countries.The Prime Minister thought that the Italian Government wouldcertainly resent the withdrawal of the exception in their favour.On the whole, however, it was unlikely that they would treat this as a first-class issue.The War Cabinet accepted the suggestions made by theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Shipping.The Minister of Shipping described the steps which were beingtaken to influence Danish vessels to proceed to Allied ports. he mentioned the case of a Danish tanker, with 12,000 tons of oil onboard, destined for Spain, which had come into Gibraltar. Theship&apos;s crew refused to sail to Spain. He proposed to seize the cargo, but to promise to replace it later.   This course was agreed to.The Minister of Shipping said that the Norwegian Minister inLondon was endeavouring, at his instance, to obtain authority fromhis Government to control Norwegian shipping. So far the minister had received no answer. In the meantime all Norwegian ships werebeing detained in British ports or, if found on the high seas,diverted to Allied ports. In the case of Norwegian tankers itwould hardly be practicable to apply this policy in its full rigour,since the oil supplies of the world could hardly be maintainedwithout their assistance. On the whole, he thought that, unlessthe situation became much clearer in the next two or three days, weshould have to consider taking the risk of allowing Norwegiantankers time-chartered to United States interests to proceed tolimited destinations, to be agreed in detail with the Foreign Officeand Ministry of Economic Warfare, but not to Chilean, Mexican,Spanish, Italian or Japanese ports beyond any point (eg.,Gibraltar) at which they could with certainty be stopped. TheSecretary for Mines was in agreement with the course proposed.The Minister undertook to act in close consultation with theForeign Office.This proposal was agreed to.The Minister of Shipping recommended that Norwegian vesselsen route to Allied destinations should be permitted to proceed underarmed guard, so as to prevent the master making for a neutralport. Guards should be placed on board such vessels irrespective of whether they were chartered to neutral or Allied Governments.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister the Minister saidthat, in his view, tankers as well as other Norwegian vessels shouldbe provided with an armed guard while they were in a dangerousarea such as the Mediterranean. Mr. Hysing Olsen, the representa-tive of the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association, who was now inLondon, was in agreement with this proposal.This proposal was agreed to.The Minister of Shipping thought that it would be expedient toallow certain Norwegian vessels, other than tankers, to proceed on certain neutral charters. He proposed to deal with these cases ontheir merits, but in a very cautious way.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that theWar Cabinet should consider giving still further latitude toNorwegian ships (other than tankers) chartered to United Statesinterests. There must be many cases where it was exceedinglyunlikely that the ships in question could or would proceed to a neutral port for the purpose of putting themselves into German
Swedish vessels.Iceland, Green-land and theFaroe Islands.Holland andBelgium.Effects on british trade.Coal exports.clutches. On the other hand, every time a ship was held up, Britishinterests suffered directly or indirectly, owing to the reactions onthe world-wide shortage of tonnage. The Commanders-in-Chief onthe different stations might be authorised to allow such shipchartered to the United States to proceed at their discretion. they and the local Naval Control authorities would be in the best positionto decide both as to the master&apos;s reliability and as to the chances of picking the ship up, if it should wilfully go astray. Twomessages had been received from the American. Embassy in thisconnection; the Embassy had been told that we would do everything possible in the circumstances if they would let us know the names of the ships in which the United States Government were interested.The proposals of the Eoreign Secretary and the Ministerof Shipping were generally approved.The Minister of Shipping said that he was about to discuss with the Swedish authorities the setting up of an organisation tocontrol sailings of Swedish ships.The few vessels registered in Iceland and Greenland were beingdetained for the moment, in the interests of their own safety, andwould not be seized. The Faroese trawlers were no longer beingdetained.Vessels now in the United Kingdom on passage to holland and Belgium were being detained on contraband or other pretext.It had been thought best to make no communication to the dutch and Belgian Governments regarding our action. Sailings of british vessels to Holland had been suspended by the Admiralty at noon on the 13th April. British vessels were still being allowed toproceed to Belgium, although in the case of vessels entering the scheldt this meant passing through Dutch territorial waters.In discussion, it was pointed out that, in the present uncertainsituation, there was strong objection to allowing further ships toproceed to these countries. On the other hand, the existing tensionmight be very prolonged and it might not be possible to maintain therestrictions. The best course might be to maintain our restrictions to a modified extent, allowing, for example, one ship to proceedto Dutch or Belgian ports for every two ships leaving those ports.This would progressively reduce the number of vessels liable toseizure in the event of a German invasion of Holland or Belgium.The War Cabinet were in general agreement with thissuggestion.The Minister of Shipping said that it was too early to attemptto assess the effects on British trade of the stoppage of dealings with Denmark and Norway, and of the other restrictions whichwe had imposed. One result would be to set more colliers free forour trade with France. As a whole, however, there could be little doubt that the restrictions would operate as a further impediment toBritish trade. The extent to which our import programme wasbeing adversely affected would appear in two or three months&apos; time.Sir Alfred Faulkner said that, so far as could be ascertained,the cessation of British coal and coke exports to the scandinavian countries would leave an additional 400,000 tons a month free for disposal elsewhere. Coal production in the United Kingdom was now showing a satisfactory increase.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was no longer possible to make an exception,in favour of vessels chartered to the United States, Italyand Japan, to the decision that all Danish vessels cominginto our hands should be seized.[21156]d
(2) Gave discretion to the Minister of Shipping, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister for Economic Warfare, where Danish vesselshave been seized under the conclusion at (1), to putequivalent tonnage at the disposal of the charterers in neutral countries to the extent that such vessels are notrequired for our own purposes.(3) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, in consultationwith the Minister of Shipping, to make arrangements whereby Norwegian vessels (including tankers), whetherchartered to neutrals or to Allied Governments, should proceed to Allied destinations under armed guard.(4) Gave discretion to the First Lord of the Admiralty, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Minister of Shipping and the Minister for economic Warfare, to allow Norwegian tankers&apos; time-chartered to United States interests to proceed to limiteddestinations, but not to Chilean, Mexican, Spanish,Italian or Japanese ports beyond any point at whichthey can with certainty be stopped.(5) Gave discretion to the First Lord of the Admiralty, inconjunction with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Minister of Shipping and the Minister for economic Warfare, to allow certain Norwegian vessels,other than tankers, to proceed on certain neutralcharters, where there seemed to be no appreciable risk that we should thereby lose control of the vessel.(6) Agreed that Norwegian vessels, other than those coveredby (3), (4) and (5) should continue to be held.(7) Authorised the Minister of Shipping, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Minister for economic warfare, to discuss with the Swedish authorities the setting up of an organisation to control sailings of swedish vessels.(8) Gave discretion to the Minister of Shipping, in conjunctionwith the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister for economic Warfare, to control sailings between thiscountry, Holland and Belgium during the present stateof tension, on the basis of securing a progressive reduction of the number of vessels in Dutch and Belgianports.(9.) Invited the Minister of Shipping, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and&apos; the other ministers concerned, to arrange, when appropriate, for action similar to that authorised above to be taken by allied, Dominion and Colonial authorities.Diversion ofShipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 88thConclusions,Minute 14.)15. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by theMinister without Portfolio on Diversion of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (40)102), which was presented in accordance with the conclusions of themeeting referred to in the margin.The Minister without Portfolio said that his recommendations,which were summarised in paragraph 21 of his Report, were asfollows : (a) That the War Cabinet should approve the plan for the diversion of shipping dealt with in W.P. (G.) (40) 82(Revise) and W.P- (G.) (40) 83, subject to the remarksContained in paragraph 20 of his Report.   These were
to the effect that such differences as existed between those concerned in this matter were in emphasis ratherthan in principle and that he was confident that theWar Cabinet would not underrate the long-rangedangers of wholesale and prolonged diversion.(b) That the Port and Transit Standing Committee should giveimmediate attention to the suggestion of the Minister ofShipping that a strong effort should be made to clear the ports on the West Coast and should take up thequestion of grain transport, mentioned by the Ministerof Food.(c) That the War Cabinet should invite one of their colleagues to act as a referee to whom departmental ministers could come for assistance in any case of difficulty.The plans set out in the Memoranda did not pretend to be complete to the last detail. Improvements were, however, constantlybeing made. This gave grounds for confidence that the situation would not get out of hand and that the machinery of the Port and transit Committee which had been soundly constructed would be operated steadily.At the same time it was right that the War Cabinet shouldnot lightly order a major diversion of shipping without being fully aware of the consequences which were likely to ensue.He had, however, suggested the omission of the last sentence of paragraph 11 of Lord ChatfielcFs Paper (WP. (G.) (40) 83),which was in the following terms : &quot; By degrees we should adjustourselves to this slower rate of imports, and we should hope, after a, time, with increasing experience to effect an improvement on thatrate.&quot; While he had no grounds for disagreeing with the opinionexpressed by Lord Chatfield, he felt it somewhat undesirable to anticipate what was likely to happen in circumstances whichcould not be clearly foreseen.The Minister commended the suggestion of the Minister ofShipping that the West Coast ports should now be kept as clear aspossible. By this it was not meant that goods should be passed through the ports regardless of the trade machinery required for particular commodities, but that the movement should be done ina reasonable manner. For example, large consignments of woolshould not be allowed to block the port of Liverpool, but should be passed on to their destination without delay.The Minister of Supply confirmed that all who were concernedin this matter were agreed that it was desirable to increase as faras possible the tempo of the passage of commodities through the ports.The Minister of Food reported that instructions had been given that all consignments of dry food-stuffs that could be moved inland,towards the areas of consumption, should be passed forward as rapidly as possible.The Lord Privy Seal said that the First Lord of the admiralty had asked him to raise the question whether the member of theWar Cabinet who would keep in touch with this question underi*ecommenclation (c), should be invested with executive powers,especially in relation to the movement of perishable stores, such asfood-stuffs.The Minister without Portfolio said he did not favour the idea that a War Cabinet Minister should be given power to overridethe responsibility of the departmental Ministers concerned; he wouldcertainly exercise powers of arbitration in the event of a conflict of views, but he thought that in an emergency of the kind con-templated Ministers would be glad to be able to refer questions of difficulty to a member of the War Cabinet for advice and assistance.
The Prime Minister shared the doubts which had been expressed about the exercise of such executive powers. If it was found that such powers were needed to resolve a conflict between departments, the matter could always be referred to the WarCabinet for decision. He was disposed to accept the recommendationof the Minister without Portfolio on this matter.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Report by the Minister without Portfolioon his examination of the points raised by the Ministerof Shipping in the discussion at the meeting of the WarCabinet on the 11th April (W.P. (G.) (40) 102).(2) Approved the recommendations contained in theMemorandum by the Minister without Portfolio(W.P. (G.) (40) 102) as summarised above.(3) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to act as the refereeto whom Departmental Ministers could come for assist-ance in any case of difficulty in regard to this questionRichmond Terrace, S.W. 1.April 15. 1940.
