255 W.M.8S (40).The Chief of the Air Staff reported the situation, as it wasthen known to the Chiefs of Staff, as follows : Oslo Fjord. Four big German warships reported sailingup the Oslo Fjord at 2-25 a.m. and to have reached Tronsberg.These had been fired upon by Norwegian coast defences.Stavanger: One enemy ship reported to be approachingStavanger at 3-25 a.m.Bergen. Five enemy warships approaching Bergen at-25 a.m. At 6 a.m. the British Consul reported that the portwas occupied by Germans and that he had been unable to reach the quayside to investigate.Trondhjem. A report from Oslo stated that two enemywarships were at Trondhjem.Narvik. No German ships reported at Narvik.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that HALS. Renownhad had a short engagement off Vest Fjord with enemy warshipsearly that morning, and was in pursuit of these to the North. the wireless of the Renown had been shot away, and the weather wasvery heavy. British destroyers were covering the mouth of the VestFjord to stop enemy transports entering Narvik. In addition to theGneisenau, the Scharnhorst with two other enemy warships had moved into the North Sea. The Commander-in-Chief meanwhilewas concentrating a strong force, comprising 2 Battleships, 9Cruisers and 25 Destroyers, off Bergen. The position of the german naval forces was not known.Fifteen British submarines were operating in norwegian waters; one had been ordered into Oslo, and another into Stavanger.No further news had been received of the Gloivworm, and it was thought that she must have been sunk.There had been an air raid on Scapa that morning in fivewaves. It had been a complete failure, and at least one enemy aircraft had been brought down.The Secretary of State for War said that he had no news toreport.In the course of the Meeting, messages were brought in givingthe following additional information :(1) Air attacks were taking place on a number of places nearOslo.(2) German aeroplanes were over Stavanger and troops had landed at Egersund.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested that our first immediate action should be to go ahead with our plan forseizing Narvik. Our information was that the Germans were notin occupation there. One battalion could sail at mid-day that day and could be at Narvik in three days time. It was also mostimportant to prevent the Germans from establishing themselves atTrondhjem and Bergen. If the Norwegians were driven out ofOslo, they would retire on Bergen and Trondhjem. The german forces there could not be very strong, probably not more than 2,000men, and these had possibly accomplished little more than the taking of the docks. Now was the critical moment, and we should do everything to prevent the Germans from sending reinforcements,so as to leave these two places open for the Norwegians to fallback upon and to preserve them as ports of entry for ourselves.If necessary, the railway lines could be torn up to prevent any german advance from Oslo.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed. We should take immediate steps to have transports ready to proceed to both places.No large forces would be required in the initial stages.

Possible aii-action.Message toNorwegianGovernment.could be laid to prevent further access by German forces. Mean-while, he strongly advocated that we should proceed with theoperation against Narvik.The Chief of the Air Staff said that immediate air action could be taken by the despatch of bomber squadrons to Bergen andTrondhjem with the object of attacking warships and transports.These squadrons would be ready to leave at 9 a.m. and could reachtheir objectives between noon and 1 p.m. He pointed out, however,that the port in Bergen was in the centre of the town, and the bombing of ships alongside the quays would inevitably involvecivilian casualties.Meanwhile air reconnaissances were in progress with a view toclarifying the position.The Minister without Portfolio advocated that we should take immediate action at Oslo. So far as we knew, the forts had notyet been taken. The main German forces would be covering this operation. We should endeavour to find out the true position by air reconnaissance and should follow this up, if necessary, with allthe air action at our disposal to help the Norwegians to defendtheir capital.The Chief of the Air Staff said that Oslo was out of range ofour bombers, but that reconnaissances were taking place in theSkagerrak. As regards Stavanger, it would be possible to bomb the aerodrome, though its destruction could not be guaranteed fromthe air.The importance of the aerodrome at Stavanger was thendiscussed. This aerodrome was 11-^ kilom. outside the town andwas the most northerly aerodrome of any size in Norway. It wastherefore considered most desirable that we should take whateversteps we could to prevent it falling into the hands of the Germans,or, failing that, to make it unserviceable for them. It was pointedout that our original intention had never been to hold Stavanger,but to destroy the aerodrome. This could best be done by air action,renewed as necessary.The Chief of Naval Staff said that the Commander-in-Chiefhad been ordered to take the Fleet to Bergen and Trondhjem withthe object of destroying German warships and transports, to gaincontrol of the entrance to these ports, and to prevent any further reinforcements and military stores entering them. Whether this operation was feasible, however, would depend on whether theGermans had got control of the shore batteries.After further discussion, it was agreed that it would be a mistake to order bombing operations until more information was available. In the meanwhile, everything possible should be done to push on preparations for sending expeditions to retake Bergen andTrondhjem and to occupy Narvik. The French should be asked tomove the Chasseurs Alpins, who were originally destined forNarvik, to the ports, and to embark them as soon as possible. Suchnaval action as might be possible should also be taken against theenemy in the former ports.Discussion then turned upon what message should be sent tothe Norwegian Government.It was pointed out that it was essential for their own safety,as well as for our purposes, that Bergen and Trondhjem should befreed as soon as possible; otherwise there was no line of communi-cation open to the outer world. Further, unless we could take immediate and active steps to convince the Norwegians of our support, there was a grave risk that they might give in. the norwegians should therefore be told that we would do everything possible to free these ports, and should be asked to co-operate. Itwould be an advantage if the railways from Oslo to Bergen, and
Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)Royal marine operation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 84thConclusions,Minute 5.)The GermanDeclaration.Oslo to Trondhjem, could be cut, but it was thought unlikely thatthe Norwegians would do this as long as they held Oslo. the norwegians should be encouraged as much as possible, and told thatthe Allies would come to their assistance.The War Cabinet were informed that no news of importancehad been received from Stockholm. There was nothing to indicatethat the Germans had any intention of attacking Sweden. In thesecircumstances, no immediate question arose of sending a message to the Swedish Government.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that present eventsmight well be the prelude to the opening of a German offensive on land, and that we should press the Belgians to come into the openbefore it was too late, and to allow the Allied troops into theircountry.The Secretary of State for War agreed.It was suggested that the events of that morning had presentedus with an opportunity of raising again with the French thequestion of putting in motion the Royal Marine Operation. TheFrench might still maintain their opposition to the early inceptionof this operation unless, indeed, land operations on a large scaleshould develop on the Western Front. The Air objections to theRoyal Marine Operation, which had weighed with the FrenchGovernment, had still the same validity as before. Nevertheless,the point should be put to them.[The Minister of Information entered, the meeting at thispoint.]At this point the Declaration which the German Governmenthad put out by wireless was received and read to the War Cabinet.The Declaration was as follows : &quot; The German High Command of the German Armyannounces that, in order to counteract the actions againstDenmark and Norway and to prevent a possible hostile attack against these countries, the German Army has taken these twocountries under its protection.&quot; Strong forces of the German Army have thereforeinvaded these countries this morning.&quot;The War Cabinet then considered The message to be sent by His Majesty&apos;s Government tothe French Government.The Declaration to be issued by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin reply to the German Governments Declaration.As regards the latter, it was felt desirable to avoid conventionalexpressions of indignation. Such expressions had for long been thestock-in-trade of the German propagandists at moments when germany herself was about to commit some fresh act of aggression.Our Declaration ought to follow more factual lines, e.q., it shouldbe pointed out that so elaborate an operation, involving simultaneouslandings at a number of Norwegian ports, must have been plannedlong in advance, and that it had probably been launched before we had laid our minefield.The War Cabinet agreed (1) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should authorise theCommander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, to take all possible steps to clear Bergen and Trondhjem of enemy forces.(2) That the Chiefs of Staff should set on foot preparations formilitary expeditions to recapture Trondhjem and Bergen
and to occupy Narvik. These expeditions should not,however, move until the Naval situation had been cleared up.(3) That the Foreign Secretary should inform the norwegian government that we would take all possible steps tosupport them against the Germans, and, in particular,that we would take immediate action with a view todriving the Germans out of Bergen and Trondhjem.The Norwegians should be encouraged to resist to theutmost, and the local forces instructed to co-operate.The Norwegian Government should also be asked to give us information as to the position and as to their plans.The Norwegian Government should be informed thatwe attached particular importance to denying stavanger aerodrome to the Germans; i.e.. if the Norwegianscannot hold it, the aerodrome should be destroyed.(4) That the Secretary of State for Air should arrange forair reconnaissance to clarify the situation in theNorwegian ports and waters, in order to ascertain theposition of the German naval, military and air forces,and that until this had been done no bombing of german forces in Norway should take place.(5) That the Foreign Secretary should inform the French ofthe action which we were taking, and should ask themto consider whether it would be advisable, in view ofthe changed circumstances, to carry out the royal marine Operation forthwith.(6) That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should communicate with the French High Command and invitethem to make preparations for the force of ChasseursAlpins, originally destined for Narvik, to be embarkedas soon as possible with a view to their participating in the recapture of Bergen and Trondhjem.(7) That a draft Declaration, in reply to the GermanDeclaration, should be drawn up by the foreign secretary and the Minister of Information, on the linesdiscussed in the War Cabinet, and issued without delay.(8) That the Foreign Secretary should consider, in consultationwith the French Government, whether the present wasa suitable time for putting further pressure on theBelgian Government to declare their attitude.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,April 9, 1940.
