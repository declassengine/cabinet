Assistance to finland.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 55thConclusions,Minute 6.)The shipping situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 122ndConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLord Privy Seal on the Shipping situation (W.P. (40) 64), togetherwith a number of other Reports which are set out in the appendix to these Conclusions.The Lord Privy Seal thought that it would be convenient if befirst indicated the general conclusions which he had reached. these were as follows : (1) Shipping was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, bottle-neck in the whole of our war effort. It was greater, he believed, even than the bottle-neck created by our foreign exchange difficulties and our shortage of skilled labour.(2) Our programme for merchant ship building was of greatimportance.(3) No less important was the programme for the productionof a much greater quantity of home-grown food.(4) There was an urgent need for a much more drastic restric-tion of home consumption generally than had hitherto been contemplated. ^The figures on which these conclusions were founded had been carefully sifted in the course of a series of conferences and discussions. They were based upon a calculation of the time required for the particular voyages necessary in the period underreview, in order to bring to this country the imports specified in theimport programme. If the figures proved to be too pessimistic, weshould then have more shipping available, either for building upstocks and reserves or for meeting new contingencies. . As thingsstood, he believed that in the early days of a war, and moreparticularly of a war in which we had not yet taken part in activeland operations, the Government would be unwise to rely upon moreoptimistic figures than those given in his report. The most salientfigures in the situation were the following : British Shipping Available.Gross tonnage       ...       ...       ...Deadweight capacityCargo-carrying capacity ....Annual importing capacityImport Programme.Ministry of Food  ...Ministry of SupplyMiscellaneous and unallocated itemsTotal      ......Million tons.9-46713 19010-65032-719-823-93-347This left a balance of 14 million tons of imports to be brought to thiscountry in foreign ships during the first&quot; year of the war. His own view was that it was not likely that we should obtain more thanbetween 9 and 12 million tons of imports in this way. If so, we were faced with a deficit of between 2 and 5 million tons on our totalimport programme.1. A record of a statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs on this subject, of the ensuing discussion, and ofthe Conclusions reached by the War Cabinet is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
How uuuld the deficit be met ?(1) The Supply programme.The Ministry of Supply programme of 23-9 million tonsprovided, inter alia, for the Army and Air Force programmes which had recently been settled by the War Cabinet. He didnot think we ought to go back on those programmes, except tothe extent rendered possible through the reconsideration of the scales of equipment and wastage for the Army. It had beena complete surprise to him when be had ascertained that theMinistry of Supply were working to an import programmenot of 23-9 million tons, but of 30-6 million tons. If this was so, it was clear that the Ministry would not be able to obtainthe whole of the difference (6 million tons) in the remainingmonths of the first year of the war.If, as appealed, we could not hope to make any substantialcuts in the portion of the Ministry of Supply programmedesigned to meet the needs of the Fighting Services, we shouldhave to fall back upon the portion of that programme which provided the imports allotted for home consumption. It was,in his view, essential that these should be severely restricted.(2) Miscellaneous and unallocated items.The present programme provided for 3-3 million tons ofimports of a miscellaneous kind which should be severelyreduced. Moreover, a number of items at present comprisedunder this heading should be transferred to other parts of theimport programme and brought under control.(3) Ministry of Food programme.Comparing the position in 1917 and that to-day, it wouldbe found that our annual imports of food and animal feeding-stuffs were to-day 5 million tons greater than in 1917. If wewere now to make substantial cuts in the Ministry of food programme, it was essential that we should do what we had done in the last war, and greatly increase the acreage under cultivation. It was of the first importance that the ploughing-up campaign should be successful, and we must makeplans for an even more effective campaign in the following year.In 1917 we had only been able to reduce our food and feeding-stuffs imports by bringing nearly 3 million more acres under cultivation than we had at the present time. Since the last warour population had gone up (by 4 per cent., according to hisestimates, and by more according to those of others), and our national economy had been greatly changed through our havingbecome dependent to a much greater degree on imported animal feeding-stuffs and imported oils and fats. It must be realised,therefore, that substantial reductions in the import programmeof the Ministry of Food could only be achieved throughsubstantial increases in the amount of home-grown food.If we were to proceed on the basis proposed, two questions arosefor decision, namely : (1) How best could we make the necessary cuts in the import programme ?(2) How best could we control the situation in future and secure for the next year, and perhaps the year after, a programme within our means ?The right course was to make use of existing machinery, andto make it clear that the work must be carried through very rapidly.He accordingly suggested that the task should be broken into threesections : [a) The proper body for considering any reduction in theMinistry of Food programme was the Ministerial Sub-Committee on  Food  Policy,  of which Ihe was the
Chairman. The direction to be given to the ministerial sub-Committee should be to prepare for the War cabinet a plan under which consumption would be reduced to abasis which was 10 per cent, less than the figures includedin the import programmes.(b) The item of 3-3 million tons appearing in the import programme under the heading &quot;Miscellaneous Unallo-cated Items &apos;&apos; should be reviewed by the President of theBoard of Trade, in conjunction with the Treasury, theMinistry of Shipping and other Departments concerned.The instructions to be given to the President of the Boardof Trade should be to produce a plan for reducing this item by 1 million tons in a full year.(c) The Ministry of Supply programme should be investigated by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, with whom there might be associated one or two other Ministers.The instruction to the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence should be to examine the present supply programme, i.e., the programme for 30-6 million tonsmentioned by the Ministry of Supply (W.P. (G.) (40) 60),and not merely the approved programme of 23-9 million tons.The Lord Privy Seal, continuing, said that he thought thatthe plans for each of these sections should be produced as soon aspossible, and the War Cabinet asked to decide whether they wished the plans to be put into effect. It would be of value also if theMinisters responsible for preparing these plans were instructed tofurnish the War Cabinet with (1) periodical reports showing how the import programmes were in fact working out, and (2) anemergency programme for the following year, in case circumstance were to arise which would force us to reduce imports down to something like the 1917 standard.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, while he would not hesitate to agree to any sacrifices which might be necessary, he didnot feel that the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s estimate did justice to our resources.The difficulty was largely due to the way in which tonnage had first been allocated, and then re-allocated. Thus, in November, thefood situation had given rise to anxiety and the Ministry ofShipping had been pressed to expedite the imports of food. As aresult the imports required for the Ministry of Supply had beenreduced. The proposal now made was to reverse the position andto make large cuts in the food programme. This reinforced theLord Privy Seal&apos;s conclusion that a review of our whole import programme was required. It was essential to create a situation inwhich arrangements could be made for imports to be brought to thiscountry at a steady rate. Personally, he doubted whether the examination of the programmes by Committees was adequate. Whatwas required was a steady executive control from day to day overthe independent but connected operations of the considerable numberof Departments concerned.If the proper measures were taken it would, he believed, bepossible in the first year of the war to secure the import of thewhole of the 47 million tons included in our import programme and perhaps even more. The actual imports month by month sincethe beginning of the war were higher than the original estimateof the Minister of Shipping. Further, the summer months withbetter weather and longer hours of day-light were ahead of us,and this should still further improve the position. There were a number of powerful remedies at our disposal which should nowbe applied : (i) arrangements should now be made as to the amounts to be imported under the various parts of the programme,
and the amounts so fixed should not be subject to constantchange;(ii) there was considerable scope for speeding-up the turn-round of vessels in ports abroad. While in some portsthere had been a considerable improvement (e.g., atFreetown where the period had been halved since september 1939), in others there Avere still considerabledelays (e.g.; in the Plate, where the turn-round occupiedbetween nine and ten days). Selected experts should be despatched to the Plate and instructed to reduce thepresent delays;(iii) the working of the ports in this country should beintensively examined;(iv) as regards the Narvik ore trade, the Ministry of Shippingestimated that 50 days were required for the roundvoyage. According to an analysis prepared in theAdmiralty, this period could be reduced to 40 days;(v) as regards convoys, the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s estimate of the delays involved was exaggerated. It was true that hisestimate was based on a calculation prepared in theTrade Division of the Admiralty, but that estimate was based upon short voyages, and was not applicable to longvoyages. He proposed to circulate a paper to the WarCabinet showing that the delays due to convoys were much less than the figure (25 to 30 per cent.) estimated bythe Lord Privy Seal;(v.i) the number of ships coming to this country in ballast at thepresent time was higher than it should be, as a result, nodoubt, of constant changes in our importing plans;(vii) before reduction of food imports was decided on, other elements in the importing programme should be examined. For example, according to the Minister ofSupply&apos;s Memorandum (W.P. (G.) (40) 60), it was nowproposed to import timber at the rate of 6 - 5 million tons per annum, and paper-making materials at the rate of3-0 million tons per annum. In the last war we hadreduced our timber imports from ll-^ million tons to2  million tons and had cut down our own forests. Itwas true, no doubt, that timber planted since the last war was still immature, but there must be plenty of timber now mature which had not been cut in the last war, as it bad then been too young. We should,therefore, now embark upon a large-scale and ruthlesstree-felling policy in order to reduce our imports of timber;(viii) as a country we now ate less bread than in the last war.Wheat and flour formed the largest single item in our food import programme, and we should secure a sub-stantial relief if, by raising the rate of extraction orotherwise, we could reduce the demand for wheat forbread-making.The simultaneous application of the remedies outlined would greatly ease our difficulties, and enable us to achieve the whole ofour import programme of 47 million tons. While, therefore, he agreed with the Lord Privy Seal that a review of our import programme was desirable, he did so rather because of the risk ofunanticipated dangers in the future than because he felt that tbeactual programme was beyond our present strength to secure.The following were the main points made in further discussion : Ministry of Supply Programme.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that the effectof any economies which might be secured in the scale of epuipment
and wastage rates of the Army would be to secure the equipment of a larger force than would otherwise be possible in the time. Itwas not the intention that any reduction of imports of raw materials should be effected through this means.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the Ministryof Supply programme covered not only the requirements for rawmaterials of the Fighting Services, but also those of the home market and the export trade.The Lord Privy Seal agreed that this was so, and explainedthat it was for this reason that he had suggested that one or moreother Ministers should be associated with the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence in the examination of the Ministry ofSupply programme.The Minister of Supply explained that he wished to clear upa misunderstanding which had arisen in connection with his memorandum (W.P. (G.) (40) 60). The figure of 30-6 million tonsset out in that Paper represented the rate per annum at which itwould be necessary to bring in imports from the present date untilthe end of the first year of the war in order to implement theMinistry&apos;s import programme. The reason for this figure was thatthe imports in respect of the Supply programme had fallen farbelow the annual rate of 23-9 million tons, and it would thereforebe necessary to import at a considerably higher rate for the ensuingsix months in order to enable the programme of 23-9 million tons tobe achieved by the end of August 1940. He was sorry that his memorandum was so phrased as to give rise to misapprehension onthis point.Narvik ore traffic.The Prime Minister recalled that it had recently been decidedto put extra ships on the Narvik route in order to build up stocks of iron-ore. Nevertheless, stocks of iron-ore had diminished. Wasthat because it had not been possible to find the additional ships, or because the journey had taken longer than had been expected&quot;?Sir Cyril Hurcomb said that a large number of ships had beenput on the Narvik route, which should have more than sufficed tobring in the 250,000 tons of ore which it had been decided to import.In fact, however, this amount of ore had not been received. In thefirst place, there had been a number of losses, some of them due to enemy action, some of them to marine casualties. The voyage wasone of great difficulty, involving navigation for a considerable distance in Norwegian territorial waters in bad weather conditions.Delays had also occurred through the closing of ports in this country.The Ministry of Shipping felt bound to assume a longer period forthe voyage than the 35 days originally contemplated. They had therefore suggested from 40 to 50 days. The improvement inweather conditions in the summer would no doubt shorten the timeof the voyage, but it would be some time before the weather improved in the North of Norway. It must be remembered that, in view ofcertain possibilities, it had been decided that the ore import programme should be completed by the 15th April. Another factor which had to be taken into account was the great strain imposed onthe crews by the voyage. As a result, the Ministry always tried tosecure that no ship should make this voyage more than twice in succession.  This, too, involved delay.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that he had a case before him of a ship which had completed the round voyage in 33 days.The Admiralty had: allowed for delays of six days in suggesting40 days for the round voyage.
Exchange considerations and Food imports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he shared the viewthat what was now required was a survey of our import programme.In his paper (W.P. (G.) (40) 63) he had drawn attention to thefact that the exchange position would probably prove at least asserious a limiting factor to our power to import as would our shipping capacity. Exchange, as well as shipping, factors should therefore be considered when deciding where imports should be bought. For this reaaon he asked that the Treasury might be associated with the proposed enquiry. His paper gave, as an example, the strain on our exchanges caused by imports of food-stuffs from the United States. All our imports should be brought under control, either by making the Minister of Food the soleimporter, or by bringing imports of food which it would not be convenient for the Ministry of Food to buy itself, under the import licensing system.The Prime Minister thought that everyone agreed on thenecessity of licensing food imports. The difficulty was that a vigorous reduction of our food imports from the United states would lead us into controversy with that country.The Minister of Food said that in many cases a reduction inthe quantity of imports through the licensing system did not produce any substantial decline in the value of imports, owing to the consequent rise in prices. It seemed, therefore, that it was preferable, wherever practicable, for the Ministry of Food to become the sole importer of goods in these circumstances, so that the profiton the reduced imports should accrue to the Government. Neverthe-less, this was not a simple operation from the administrative pointof view, and caused a good deal of discontent among the commercial interests concerned. It involved the requisitioning of the stocksof goods already in the country, and their resale, possibly to their previous owners, at a substantially higher price; so that the tradewas robbed of what they regarded as a legitimate opportunity of profit. This procedure had already been followed in the case ofthose food-stuffs which were now controlled; and he was, in fact,preparing a scheme for application to certain less essential food-stuffs.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theDominions Office would wish to be associated with any enquiry into the food import programme, and the sources from which these imports should be drawn. Dominions interests were engaged, forexample, in the question whether sugar was to be shipped fromQueensland or from some nearer source of supply.The Minister of Food said that other considerations, which heAvas also asked to bear in mind when deciding where food-stuffswere to be bought, were the political interest of the Foreign office in the prosperity of particular countries, and the interest of theMinistry of Economic Warfare in denying supplies to Germany.He agreed that it would be necessary to review the food import programme in the manner suggested; and he had pointed out inthe paper which he had circulated to the War Cabinet (W.P. (G.)(40) 59) the cuts which would have to be made, if a reduction inour imports of food of 2 million tons a year were decided on.There was a general point on. the comparability of 1917 figureswith those for 1940. It had been suggested that our population to-day was only 4 per cent greater than in 1917. In Great Britain,and Northern Ireland: alone the increase in population was 13 percent. The difference between that and the 4 per cent, given in theLord Privy seal&apos;s paper was due to the exclusion of southern ireland. But Southern Ireland was largely self-supporting in food-stuffs, and its exclusion did not relieve our- import problem.
AnotJher point was that to-day we had 3 million acres fewer under cultivation than in 1917. Restrictions, if decided upon, wouldhave to apply to our cereal imports; and whether they could safely be applied would depend on the success of the ploughing-upprogramme.*The main reductions in the import programme would have tobe obtained by a reduction in imports of animal feeding-stuffs.This was a question which would have to be approached withcaution. There was no difference of opinion between the Ministerof Agriculture and himself on this point.The First Lord of the Admiralty urged that we should do our utmost to find some alternative restriction of imports before taking steps which would mean the slaughter of live-stock, which was an extremely valuable food reserve.The Prime Minister thought it was clear that we had very littlemargin in our importing programmes. In addition, we could notbe certain of having reached the peak of losses through enemy action, and we should take steps to provide ourselves with a greatermargin of safety. This involved finding out what unnecessaryimports were coming in, and reducing their quantity so as toprovide more space for essential imports. This meant restrictionson consumption which he was sure that the country would gladlyaccept. It would, indeed, be good for people to have to bear thisinconvenience, as their contribution to carrying on the war. TheFrench were about to impose rationing, and M. Reynaud, in announcing this, had recently made the point that it was essentialthat France should be on the safe side in the matter of her food supply. Fie suggested that the Lord Privy Seal and the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence should together be invited to examinethe Supply programmes, and that the Lord Privy Seal should beinvited, in consultation with the Ministers concerned, to makehimself responsible for the Food and Miscellaneous Importsprogrammes.There remained the question whether we were making the best use of the shipping available, or whether any steps could be taken,apart from increasing the quantity of shipping, to increase thevolume of our imports. He was not clear whether the enquiriescontemplated by the Lord Privy Seal would cover this point. Itwas not a further testing of estimates that was required, but an investigation into the facts of the existing situation and thepossibility of practical steps to improve matters, for example, bylocal action at particular centres.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the best procedure wouldbe for the Ministry of Shipping and the Admiralty to enquire into specific cases and into specific suggestions, for improvement,for example, the possibility of sending a representative to the RiverPlate to expedite the turn round of shipping there.The War Cabinet :-(a) Agreed that the import programme of 47 million tons forthe first year of the war should be reviewed as follows : (i) The Ministry of Supply Programme should be examined by the Lord Privy Seal, so far as concerned the Fighting Services in conjunctionwith the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence;and so far as concerned raw materials for manu-facture for export trade and for civilian consump-tion in the home market, in conjunction with thePresident of the Board of Trade and other ministers concerned :
(2) The Miscellaneous and Unallocated Items should be examined by the Lord Privy Seal in conjunctionwith the President of the Board of Trade with aview (i) to reducing the total from 3-3 million tons to not more than 2-3 million tons in a full year; and(ii) to arranging as far as practicable for theallocation of&apos; the items comprised underthis head to the Ministry of Supply orMinistry of Food Programmes, with a viewto such imports being brought under control.(3) The Ministry of Food Programme should be examined by the Lord Privy Seal, as Chairmanof the Food Policy Committee, with a view to reducing consumption to a basis which was 10 percent, less than the provisional figures indicatedin the Food Import Programmes.(b) Took note that the Minister of Shipping would examine, inconjunction with the First Lord of the Admiralty, the suggestions made by the latter for the better use of the importing capacity at our disposal.Diversion of 3.   The Prime Minister suggested that, in view of the limitedShipping. time available, the War Cabinet should defer consideration of the(Previous Memorandum bv the Minister of  Transport on Diversion  ofReference: Shipping (WP. (G.) (40) 57).W.M. (39) 106th Tjie Minister of Trans-port said that it would be of greatConclusions, assistance to him if he could receive immediate authority from them mute 2.) War Cabinet to proceed with the preparation of the necessary plans for dealing with the problems of diversion, as set out inparagraph 13 (d) of his Memorandum, as there was a meeting ofthe Standing Committee of the Port and Transit Organisation that afternoon, and he wished to be able to inform them what had beendecided.The War Cabinet :-(i) Approved the proposal, set out in paragraph 13 (d) ofWP. (G.) (40) 57, that the Ministers concerned shouldtake immediate steps to complete the necessary plans andarrangements for dealing with the problems of diversion of shipping from the East to West coast ports, shouldthe need arise.(ii) Agreed to defer consideration of the other proposals in the&apos;&apos;   . Memorandum to a later meeting.The Ail-Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 55thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air attacks on shipping. &apos;&apos;reconnaissance of heligoland bight.4. The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet thatthere had been little or no enemy air activity on the previous day,four unidentified enemy aircraft only having been reported off ourcoasts. Fighters had been despatched, but had failed to make contact.Two attacks had been carried out in the dark in the early hoursof that morning on a convoy north of Flamborough Head. fighters had been despatched, with what result it was not yet known.A special reconnaissance flight had been carried out of the heligoland Bight. Fog at sea level had prevented a sight ofHeligoland itself, but the aircraft had flown south to Cuxhaven and
The NayalSituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 55thConclusions,Minute 4.)Attacks on shipping.Attacks onU-boats.5. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the first of the attacks by enemy aircraft on the convoy North of FlamboroughHead (see previous Minute), had been made at 6-10 a.m. againstthe Latvian S.S. Katvaldis (3,206 tons) which had been bombed offWhitby. Subsequently, the S.S. Corbrook (1,729 tons) andS.S. Schieland (2,249 tons) had also been attacked. H.M.S. Stork,escort to the convoy, had reported hearing two bombs and machine gun fire at 6-45 a.m., but did not know whether there had been any casualties. This was the position as known at the Admiraltyup to 8 a.m.The Italian S.S. Mirella (5,340 tons), outward bound from the tyne, had been torpedoed or mined at 2 a.m. east of Lowestoft.One boat with thirteen survivors had been recovered by H.M.S.Wallace, but a second boat was still missing.The anti-submarine trawler Cape Portland had attacked whatwas believed to be a U-boat contact at 11 -10 a.m. on the previous day three miles north-east of Dunnet Head. Three depth chargeshad been dropped, resulting in four explosions and the appearance of a quantity of oil. The position had been buoyed and two anti-submarine trawlers were standing by. At 4-30 p.m. H.M.S. Electrahad attacked a good contact fifty miles east of Wick. Three trawlerswere continuing to hunt in this area.The destroyer H.M.S. Woolston had received damage in collision with a merchant ship, which had made it necessary forher to return for repairs.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 6.   The Secretary of State for War informed the War cabinet situation. that nothing of importance had happened on the Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 55thConclusions,Minute 5.)Western Front.Finland. The situation in Finland was changing so rapidly that he did not think it worth while reporting such information as hadbeen received at the War Office.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Brunsbuttel, where a number of good photographs had been taken from a height of 200 to 300 feet, including one of the entrance tothe Kiel Canal showing a warship being locked through towards theBaltic.One of our aircraft had been lost in the sea in an endeavour tofind a sister aircraft in distress.   The latter had returned safely.Leaflet raids. Eleven bombers  had flown over  Hanover,  Wilhelmshaven,Hamburg, Bremen, Kiel, Eubeck and Berlin by night and had dropped leaflets.   All had returned safely.There was nothing of importance to report from France.Coastal Command Aircraft had carried out the usual patrols and convoy escorts.S.S. Altmark. A special reconnaissance of the Joesing Fjord had shown thatthe Altmark was still in the Fjord with Norwegian destroyers in attendance.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
Dependants&apos; 7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the allowance. Secretary of State for War (W.P. (G.) (40) 62) drawing attentionto one of the conditions at present attaching to the grant of dependants&apos; allowance, namely, the incapacity of the dependant for self-support, which it was expected would be raised when army estimates came before the House of Commons the following week.The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (G.) (40) 67).The Secretary of State for War said that the questions dealtwith in his Memorandum had been satisfactorily settled, in consul-tation with the Departments concerned, and it was, therefore,unnecessary that the War Cabinet should be troubled with them.The Minister of Pensions had, however, asked that it should bemade clear that dependants&apos; pensions stood on a somewhat different footing from allowances paid to soldiers&apos; dependants.The War Cabinet:  Took note that no decision on the above Memoranda was now required.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 1, 1940.
