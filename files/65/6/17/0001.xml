Western Front: 1.   The War Cabinet had before them the text of draftPossible German telegrams to His Majesty&apos;s representatives at Brussels and the attack on the Hague, circulated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Netherlands or regarding assistance by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of on the a German attack on the Netherlands (W.P. (40) 101).Netherlands and        The drafts were examined paragraph by paragraph, and aBelgium. discussion took place on the following points : (previous reference:W.M. (40) 71stConclusions,Minute 6.)I. Draft Telegram to Brussels.  Paragraph 4.It was agreed that the opening phrases should be redraftedon these lines: &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government would be veryunwilling to assume that, in the event of German attack on theNetherlands, Belgium would not immediately give activeassistance to that country, but in the unlikely event of theBelgian Government deciding on such a course, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment think that (the sentence then to proceed as in the draft).It was agreed that the concluding phrase should be amended to read : &quot; not only to protecting themselves, but alsoto giving all possible assistance to the Dutch.&quot;II. Draft Telegram to The Hague.  Paragraph 2.In view of the amendment agreed upon to paragraph 4 ofthe draft telegram to Brussels, the concluding portion of thesecond sentence of paragraph 2 should be amended to indicatethat &apos;&apos; we should be glad to know what was likely to be theirattitude to a proposal that, in the event of a German attackon the Netherlands, the Allies should come to their assistance.&quot;The final sentence should be amended to indicate that thepre-requisite of Allied assistance to the Netherlands would benot only consultation between the Netherland Government andthe Belgian Government, but also between the NetherlandGovernment and the Allied Governments.Suggested The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum by theamendment to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 98) recalling the assurance given circumstances  in which, on  the  14th  January,   1940,  certain to Kmg Leopold assurances had been given to King Leopold.on 14th January,1940. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it seemed(Previous probable that we had been under some misapprehension as to whatReferences: had really been in King Leopold&apos;s mind when he had made hisW.M. (40) 12th inquiry of us, and that it was for this reason that the King of theConclusions, Belgians had been somewhat taken aback by the actual terms of theand reply we had given him.   Our intermediary in the negotiations atW.M. (40) 49th that time had now suggested three small amendments to para-Conclusions, graphs 1, 2 and 4 of our assurance to King Leopold, which he Minute 7.) believed would make the message acceptable to His Majesty. Ifthese amendments were adopted, the opportunity might also betaken to amend the first portion of paragraph 3, so as to give theKing the assurance that we would not open peace negotiationswithout the participation of Belgium, for which he had originallyasked. The text of the message as actually delivered to the King ofthe Belgians on the 14th January, and of the suggested revision ofthat text, were given in Appendix II to the Memorandum which hehad circulated.The three suggested amendments were accepted by the WarCabinet.  As regards sub-section (i) of paragraph 3, it was agreed[21025] &quot; b2Communicationsto be made tothe Belgian andNetherlandGovernments.
that we should undertake not to open peace negotiations without the participation of Belgium, but that, in view of the precedent whichmight be involved, it was undesirable that this undertaking shouldbe of a purely unilateral character. This sub-paragraph should,therefore, be amended so as to indicate that we considered that neither we nor the Belgian Government should open peacenegotiations without consulting the other.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Foreign Secretary : (a) to despatch telegrams to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Brussels, and His Majesty&apos;s Minister, The Hague, in theterms indicated in the drafts set out in W.P. (40) 101,subject to amendment as indicated in discussion;(6) to authorise His Majesty&apos;s Ambasasdor, Brussels, toexplain to King Leopold that there appeared to havebeen some misunderstanding as to the interpretationwhich should have been placed on the communicationsexchanged during the week-end of the 13th-14thJanuary, 1940, and then to hand to His Majesty a revised message in the terms set out in the third columnon page 4 of W.P. (40) 98, subject to the further amend-ment agreed to in discussion.Soviet-FinnishTreaty.Need for actionto meet thesituationcreated.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 71stConclusions,Minute 9.)2.- The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a despatch(No. 599) from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris covering a Note, received from theFrench Ambassador, containing French views as to the action whichshould now be taken by the Allies to meet the new situation created by the end of the Finnish war (W.P. (40) 100).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that itmight be useful if he briefly reviewed the general situation which now confronted us. There could be no doubt that the Allies, by the collapse of Finland, had sustained some damage, both psycho-logically, in the effect on their morale, and practically, in the loss ofthe opportunity to obtain control of the Galivare ore fields. the collapse of Finland, which had coincided rather unfortunately withthe visit of Mr. Sumner Welles, and the recent meeting of hitler and Signor Mussolini at the Brenner, all tended to spread a feeling of depression, which we should be careful not to exaggerate. Theultimate issue would depend on our own power to exert our strength at decisive points. Making full allowance for the ill-effects wehad suffered by the Finnish collapse, not the least of which wasthe effect on French morale, we had now to look round and see what positive action we could take. There appeared to be fourpossibilities : (i) The French were anxious that action should be taken against the Narvik iron ore traffic. This was a projectwhich had been considered on previous occasions, and,though it had much to commend it, the idea had not beenpursued. The French arguments for carrying out this project at the present juncture were not convincing,(ii) Action in the Caucasus against the Russian oilfields. it seemed very questionable whether a force of the sizeproposed would suffice to do serious damage. If we wereto do the job properly, it looked as if we should be committed sooner or later to an expedition in the black sea to Batum.
position vis-a-visScandinavia.(iii) The Balkans. Would it be wise to stir up trouble in this area ? It was doubtful whether either the Turks orourselves were yet ready.(iv) The Royal Marine Operation. This seemed much themost promising idea, and likely to have valuable effects.The French reasons against carrying it out wereunconvincing.As regards immediate diplomatic action on the French Note,the Foreign Secretary suggested that we should say to the French that, although we agreed with much of their argument, we felt thatit reached the wrong conclusions. We might propose instead thatwe should lay down in the most formal manner, for the informationof the Norwegian and Swedish Governments, what we should consider to be threats to our vital interests, e.g.: (i) if the Scandinavian Governments accepted the role of states under the protection of Germany or Russia;(ii) if they formed a defensive alliance from the patronage ofwhich we were excluded;(iii) if the export of ore to Germany increased to an unreason-able degree;(iv) possibly even the final collapse of the shipping negotia-tions with Norway.We should make it clear to the Scandinavians that, if these vital interests were threatened, we should feel ourselves completely free to deal with the situation in any manner we thought fit.The War Cabinet then considered the position in the Balkans,and the Foreign Secretary suggested that it might be desirable thathe should pay a visit to Turkey. The discussion on this point is recorded in Minute 3 below.Discussion was then resumed on the position vis-a-vis the scandinavian countries.(Previous The First Lord of the Admiralty again referred to the newReference: plan for hindering the supply of iron ore from Sweden to Germany,W.M. (40) 71st which was being examined by the Naval Staff.   The view was conclusions, expressed that it would be better to defer action against the NarvikMinute 7.) traffic until the plan now proposed was ready to be put intooperation.Royal Marine Further reference was made to the Royal Marine Operation.Operation. The view was expressed that the objections to it advanced by the(Previous French were inadequate.Reference:W.M. (40) 66th The Prime Minister said that he would be willing, if necessary,.Conclusions,      to write a personal letter to M. Daladier, urging that the FrenchMinute 3.) &apos;      Government should give their immediate consent to carry out this operation.The Secretary of State for Air thought that the French were moved by fear of retaliation in the form of air attack on theirindustry. He was in favour of carrying out the operation withoutdelay, but he thought that we should be unlikely to persuade theFrench to agree to this course without personal discussion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the difficultieswhich the French had made about this operation might serve as avery useful argument in our reply to the pressure which they hadbeen bringing to bear on us to take action in Scandinavia. Wecould, with justice, point out that here, ready to hand, was an operation which promised great results, and which could be put into execution at once, if they would agree.[21025] c
This led to a discussion as to the holding in the near future ofa meeting of the Supreme War Council.The Foreign Secretary reminded his colleagues that he had raised this matter with M. Corbin on the 15th March, and thatthe latter had said that he did not think it would be possible forM. Daladier to be absent from Paris until after the debate to beheld in the Chamber on Tuesday, the 19th, which might becontinued on the following day. He thought that he had better see M. Corbin again, and leave him in no doubt that we regarded the question of the Royal Marine Operation as urgent, and ask for some further indication of M. Daladier&apos;s plans. As regardsthe proposals set out in the French Note of the 15th March(W.P. (40) 100). he thought that the best plan would be that heshould not give M. Corbin a formal Note, but should explain our views to him orally.The War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs :  (i) to inform the French Ambassador as soon as possiblethat we were in favour of an early meeting of theSupreme War Council;(ii) to explain orally to M. Corbin the reasons why theBritish Government did not favour action in norwegian territorial waters, at this juncture, onthe lines proposed by the French Government intheir Memorandum of the 15th March.3. In the course of the discussion recorded in Minute 2,the Foreign Secretary said that he had been turning over in his mind whether it might not be a good thing for him to pay a visit to Turkey with the object of stiffening Turkish friendship with us.There was, of course, the danger that such a mission might end in anti-climax, and it would have to be made clear that the visit wasonly for the purpose of a frank exchange of views. It wOuld atleast have the merit of making Germany, Russia and Italy wonderwhat exactly was afoot.Considerable discussion followed on this suggestion, in whichthe following were the principal points that were made : (i) Such a visit would dramatise our influence in south-east europe, and might well do something to stop the driftaway from the Allies, which seemed to have set in afterthe collapse of Finland. On the other hand, care wouldhave to be taken that the visit should not be interpreted as having arisen from anxiety lest our hold on Turkey was weakening.(ii) Such a visit should have some definite object, and ought not to be of a merely exploratory nature.   It would beundignified for a great Power like ourselves to send our foreign Secretary to Ankara unless he had something to show for it on his return,(iii) The objects of the visit would presumably be : (a) to consolidate our friendship with the Turks;(&amp;) to explore further the Balkan position with them;(c) to discuss the subject of possible operations in the black Sea, and to discover what was in their minds on this matter.But it would be difficult to frame any very convincingcommunique on the conclusion of the visit, if discussions on all. these matters had only been exploratory in character.
(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 71stConclusions,Minute 13.)(iv) The Staff Conversations now in progress in Aleppo might provide an opportunity for the Foreign Secretary to go out in order to clinch some important matter. these conversations, which were at present on the level of theChiefs of Staff of our Commanders-in-Chief in theMiddle East, were being held up because the Turkswished to discuss in detail our action in support of themin the event of Italian hostility. Our Staffs had noinstructions on this matter, but had been ordered to explore what the Turks had in mind. The result wouldprobably be that negotiations would have to be taken upon the level of the respective Commanders-in-Chief.The final stage might therefore be a visit by the Foreign.Secretary himself.The War Cabinet :-Took no decision on the suggested visit of the foreign secretary to Ankara, but agreed that the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Ankara on this proposal shouldbe ascertained.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 71stConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Secretary of State for Air said that the weather hadbeen generally unfavourable for flying during the previous day.Seven unidentified tracks had been plotted during daylighthours between Aberdeen and the Firth of Forth. Between midnightand 2-30 a.m. there had been six unidentified plots, believed to havebeen enemy aircraft, off North Foreland, Portsmouth andFelixstowe.Unfavourable weather had prevented operations by bomber command, and had interfered considerably with those of coastal command, preventing all but a few of the usual anti-submarine patrols and convoy escorts.The Secretary of State for Air and the Chief of the Air Staffgave particulars of a projected operation which would be carriedout as soon as the weather permitted. General agreement was expressed on the desirability of making it quite clear that theoperation was our reply to the German raid on Scapa Flow on the17th March.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.71stThe naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40)Conclusions,Minute 2.)Air attack onScapa Flow on17th March.5. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet of the movements of the Home Fleet.The First Lord said that the Germans had been trying to makefar too much out of their raid on Scapa on the 17th March. In this they were being aided and abetted by our own Press. The raid hadbeen a negligible affair, and it was most undesirable that the general public should gain a distorted view of its importance at a time whenserious fighting might break out.The Prime Minister said that he would be touching upon thispoint in his speech in the House of Commons that afternoon. Hewould also include particulars about the damage which had beendone on land to objectives which were not military, by way of forestalling criticisms which might result from the retaliatory action which we proposed to take.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the factthat incendiary bombs had been dropped, which had presumably notbeen aimed against warships.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Germans had declaredthat their objectives on land had been &quot; air bases.&quot;
Enemy attacks The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that there had been noon shipping.      attacks on British shipping, but the Italian S.S. Tina Primo(4,853 tons), in ballast from Rotterdam to Italy, had been mined15 miles east of North Foreland at 5-10 p.m. on the previous day.The ship had sunk after the  second explosion at 6-22 p.m.33 survivors and 1 body had been landed at Ramsgate.Four bodies and some wreckage, which had been washed ashoreoff Gourdon, had been identified as being from the Aberdeen trawlerSoar, which was presumed to have grounded in gale and thickweather on the night of the 17th-18th March.The S.S. Aquitania, previously reported to be aground atFreetown, had been refloated, and had apparently suffered no damage.  After examination by divers it was hoped that she wouldsail that day.S.S. Albionic (British, 2,300 tons) had reported at 2-6 a.m. thatshe was on fire off Lundy Island, and later that her crew had takento the boats. She had been out of danger by 7-30 a.m., with alifeboat standing by.H.M.S. Jervia. The Destroyer BZ.M.S. Jervis had collided with the SwedishS.S. Tors off the Coquet Islands at 3-15 a.m., and had sustainedextensive hull damage both above and below the water line. Therewere 2 dead and 15 missing. She was now proceeding homewardsstern first at 5 knots, and was expected to arrive that morning. TheS.S. Tors had been only slightly damaged.German TJ-boat The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, according toactivity. Admiralty calculations, only 3 U-boats were now out.The Chief of the Naval Staff&apos; said that there was definite evidence from prisoners that the U-boats were very reluctant toattack convoys for fear of being sunk.There was nothing to show that the Germans were havingdifficulty in recruiting crews for their U-boats.A German torpedo had been washed ashore south ofBridlington.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 6.   The Secretary of State for War made no report on theSituation. military situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 71st __Conclusions,Minute 3.)7.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (40) 54) recommending (i) that shipyards in neutral countries be used, if necessary, to supplement resources in this country for the degaussingof British merchant ships;(ii) that technical information of our methods of demagnetisa-tion be supplied as and when necessary to neutral countries for the degaussing of neutral ships trading with this country. In imparting this information, everyeffort would be made to obtain a quid pro quo.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the present position was as follows : Warships completed       ...      ...       ...      420Warships in hand ...      ...      ...      ...      231Merchant ships completed ......      471Merchant ships in hand  ...      ...       ...      323Degaussing ofMerchant Ships.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3.)
(previous reference:W.M. (40) 68thConclusions,Minute 2.)As regards the communication of technical information to neutral countries, it was not proposed to say anything to them aboutthe new system of degaussing, which consisted of &quot;wiping&quot; thehull plating with a horizontal cable subsequently removed carrying a heavy current. This system was still in the experimentalstage and must remain secret. The information given to neutralswould relate to degaussing by means of coils, through which hadbeen passed a current related to the magnetic characteristic of theship. There could be no objection to the supply of this information,in view of the arrival of the Queen Elizabeth at New York, and the subsequent publicity given to the subject in the press.In discussion it was suggested that we might use this informa-tion as a lever in our present negotiations with the norwegian government for the chartering of additional tanker tonnage.General agreement was expressed with this view.The War Cabinet-(i) Gave  a general approval  to the  recommendations  in w.P. (40) 54.(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Ministerof Shipping to settle, in consultation, what quid pro quowe should attempt to obtain from Norway and other neutral countries, in return for the supply to them of technical information as to our methods ofdemagnetisation.StandardClothing.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 23rdConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer on Standard Clothing(W.P. (G.) (40) 77).The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised that some schemeof the kind suggested was required in view of the prospectiveshortage of wool caused by the service demands and the need to divert as much wool as possible to the export trade. This shortagewould be felt most acutely by the poorer.classes. The provision ofa standard suit would not necessarily have the effect of driving offthe market the suits now produced by the large makers-up; but itshould have a considerable influence on the prices at which thesesuits were sold.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he hoped thatattention would be paid to durability. He understood that a betterlasting suit could be provided at little extra cost.The President of the Board of Trade agreed that steps of thekind suggested in the Memorandum should be taken. Wool was now being released for the export trade in substantial quantities.The Minister of Labour said that he felt that the difficultieswhich would be encountered in bringing the scheme into operation would probably be greater than was anticipated, and that consulta-tion with the trade concerned should take place before the schemewas finally decided on.The Minister of Supply recognised that there would be diffi-culties which would require careful exploration. He had, however,consulted Lord Woolton, who took the view that the proposal was practicable. Lord Woolton felt that the scheme should be extendedto include suits for boys.The War Cabinet (a) Subject to further examination as to the practicability ofthe scheme, decided in principle that arrangements
should be made for the provision, not later than thebeginning of October next, of (i) A &quot; Standard cloth for standard suits &apos;&apos;;(ii) Standard boots and shoes for men, women andchildren.(b) Agreed that the responsibility for the working of thescheme should rest with the Ministry of Supply.(e) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe necessary preparatory steps to be taken depart-mentally to give effect to Conclusion (a) above.(d) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make asuitable public announcement, when the preliminarysteps referred to above had reached such a stage as torender this desirable.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 19, 1940.
