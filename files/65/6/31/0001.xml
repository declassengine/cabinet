Scandinavia:German Inva-sion of norway and Denmark.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 85thConclusions.)Militarysituation.1. The War Cabinet continued their examination of thesituation resulting from the German invasion of Norway and denmark.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff hadreviewed the situation before the meeting of the War Cabinet.According to a broadcast from Oslo, a small German force had landed at Narvik. The Chiefs of Staff had agreed that our destroyers in the Vest Fjord should go in and probe Narvik toascertain the situation. One of the original battalions of theA vonmouth force was moving up to Scapa, and this battalion wouldbe available to support the operations of the destroyers at Narvik.As regards further land forces, 7 battalions would be ready by the12th April, and could be used at Bergen, Trondhjem or Narvik,as the situation might dictate. The first necessity was to deal withthe German heavy ships.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Germantransport which had reached Narvik must presumably have slippedpast our patrol in the heavy weather prevailing at the time. Asregards the general situation in Scandinavia, he felt that we werein a far better position than we had been up to date. Our handswere now free, and we could apply our overwhelming sea power on the Norwegian coast. The German forces which had been landedwere commitments for them, but potential prizes for us. We couldnot have prevented these landings without maintaining large patrolscontinuously off the Norwegian coast, which would have beenwasteful of our naval strength; but we would liquidate them in aweek or two. It was heartening to find that the Norwegians wereresisting, and we should proclaim to the world our intention to goto their assistance. The Norwegians would hem in the german forces on land, and we could do the same on the sea, either bylaying mines or other naval action.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the norwegians had few regular troops but considerable numbers of volunteers, who should be able to hold up the Germans in themountainous country. xThe Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that M. Colbanwas showing himself very ready to co-operate with us in every way and seemed in good heart. Sweden was reported to have announcedher intention of protecting her neutrality, and to have orderedgeneral mobilisation. It would seem that our chance of getting toGalivare was better now than at any time since the beginning ofthe war.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that orders had beengiven to our naval forces to force their way into Narvik and Bergen.Trondhjem would be left for the time being until the situation had clarified. The main problem was to deal adequately with thetwo German heavy ships, which were of the most modern type. Itwas essential to maintain a fleet in considerable strength in theBergen area and to avoid having any weak detachments whichcould be &quot; mopped up.&quot; If these two ships ran for home so much the better for us we should then be able to deal with their land forces at leisure.The First Lord suggested that we should make arrangementsimmediately to take under our protection Norwegian and Danishshipping all over the world, and that we should announce this actionpublicly. Our destroyers were at present engaged in an attempt to-collect and safeguard the inward convoy from Bergen, which hadnot yet left Norwegian waters.[21130] b 2
As regards other offensive action, he had communicated withM. Reynaud urging him to authorise the Royal Marine operation to be carried out. He asked the approval of the War Cabinet to draft instructions to our submarine commanders to attack without warning all shipping in the Skagerrak. Normal mercantile shipping had been held up, and it must be presumed that any other ships were ships of war or transports.  This was agreed to.The Minister without Portfolio said that there were 100,000tons of oil at Oslo which should, if possible, be denied to theGermans. He suggested that the Norwegian Government shouldbe asked to take the necessary steps. The 200,000 tons of oil in denmark must be presumed to have fallen into the hands of theenemy.The Minister without Portfolio also suggested that the questionof demolitions on the Scandinavian railways should be looked into.These railways would be required for the movement of Norwegiantroops in the early stages, but it would be desirable to put them outof action before the Germans could use them to move out from theirports of disembarkation.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Approved   the   issue   of   instructions   to   submarinecommanders, on the lines proposed by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty at &quot; A.&quot;(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to draw the attention of the Norwegian Government to theimportance of denying stocks of oil, &amp;c, to the Germans.German 2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs raised the invasion question of the Faroes and Iceland.   He suggested that we should of Denmark: take steps to protect them on behalf of the Danish Government.The Faroes and The position of Iceland in relation to Denmark was comparableIceland. with that of a British Dominion to the United Kingdom.   It was desirable, therefore, to avoid any risk of complication throughIceland declaring herself a neutral.In discussion, the view was expressed that it would be better not to make any public announcement, and that, in the first instance,we should inform the Danish Government that, in view of thesituation which had developed, we should have to take measures toprevent the Germans taking possession of the Faroes and Iceland,and that we might require facilities in those islands for Air and naval units.At a later stage in the proceedings, information was received that the Danish Government had decided to accept the Germanterms, and that, according to German reports, the occupation of denmark was proceeding without incident.In these circumstances, it was thought that immediate steps should be taken to secure our interests in the Faroes, and that adirect communication should be made to Iceland, through theBritish Consul, in the terms which had been proposed for the communication to Copenhagen. It was realised that the germans might possibly have themselves sent forces to the Faroes andIceland, in which case it would be necessary to dislodge them. Inthe meanwhile, nothing should be said publicly of our intentions, butaction should proceed as soon as practicable.The War Cabinet agreed (a) That the Foreign Secretary should inform the Governmentof Iceland, through the British Consul, that we wouldbe prepared to help them to maintain their indepen-dence, and that we should require Naval and Airfacilities for the purpose.
(b) That steps should be taken as soon as practicable to takepossession of the Faroe Islands and to establish suchNaval and Air facilities as we might require.German Im?a-sion of denmark and Norway.Action to betaken withScandinavianand Balticshipping.3. The Minister of Shipping said that action had already beentaken to hold up all sailings of our own and Allied ships to scandinavia and Baltic ports. Steps were also being taken to detain all Norwegian and Danish ships which were in our ports,and to divert all those at sea into Allied ports. It remained toconsider what action should be taken towards Swedish, Latvian andFinnish ships. It might be advisable, now that these countries were so much in the war zone, to take the same action towards their shipping as towards Norwegian and Danish. Otherwise, there wasa danger that, under German pressure, the Governments or theowners of the shipping might order their ships into neutral ports,and we might lose them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that there were two cases to consider : First, the. ships actually in port. These could easily be detained on one excuse or another until the situationbecame clear. Secondly, there were the ships at sea. It was moredifficult to make out a case for diverting them into Allied ports.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed. Hethought it would hardly be necessary to divert Swedish, Latvianand Finnish ships unless they were actually sailing towardsScandinavia or the Baltic.Agreement was expressed with this view.Continuing, the Minister of Shipping said that all coal destined for Scandinavia had been stopped and diverted. The situation ofour iron ore ships was as follows : Five were at Narvik : five were anchored off Bergen, waiting tocome in the next convoy : three were on the way : eight had beenrecalled to Kirkwall: and twenty-nine were in United kingdom ports discharging.Unless traffic to Narvik could be continued, he would likeimmediately to start diverting some of the outgoing ships to north african destinations to fetch ore.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that we might be ableto resume traffic to Narvik in a few days time.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved the action which had been taken to detain ordivert to Allied ports Norwegian and Danish ships.(2) Agreed that as regards Swedish, Latvian and Finnishships (a) those in ports should be detained for the time being :(6) those which were on their way to Scandinavian orBaltic ports should be diverted.(3) Invited the Minister of Shipping to arrange for similar action to be taken by Allied, Dominion and Colonialauthorities.(4) Invited the Minister of Shipping, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade, to make such arrangements as might seem right regarding the diversion of iron ore ships to destinations other thanNarvik, on the assumption that it might be possible to resume sailings to that port in a few days time.
German Inva-sion of denmark and Norway:PrimeMinistersStatement.4. The Prime Minister said that he had been considering what line he should take in the Statement which he would haveto make in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a draft statement was being prepared, the main argument of which wouldbe, not that the Government had any knowledge of what had been about to happen, but that the clockwork precision with which theGerman operation had been carried out was a proof of the veryelaborate preparations which they had made and of the precautionswhich they had taken to keep them secret.A discussion then ensued on the statement which should bemade about the operations of the Fleet, the Minister of Informationhaving mentioned that at the Press Conference that morning anoptimistic, and not perturbed, anxiety had been expressed as towhat the Royal Navy was doing.It was generally agreed that the House would be satisfied if itwere pointed out that the Navy was in the act of conductingoperations at sea, and that it would obviously not be in the publicinterest to divulge the details of those operations. It was thoughtbetter not to add that these operations involved wireless silence.The War Cabinet agreed That the Prime Minister&apos;s Statement in the House should follow the lines indicated in the discussion.Supreme War 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theCouncil: 7th War Cabinet that M. Reynaud and M. Daladier would be arrivingMeeting. that afternoon by air at 3 o&apos;clock and would be ready for a Meetingat 4 p.m.  It was not known whom they were bringing with them.It was agreed that as the Prime Minister was making a State-ment in the House, the Meeting of the Supreme War Council shouldbe held at 4-15 p.m. The War Cabinet would be represented by thePrime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the three service ministers. The Prime Minister asked that the other members ofthe War Cabinet, and the Chiefs of Staff, should hold themselvesin readiness at short notice.Richmond Terrace, S.WA,April 9, 1940.
