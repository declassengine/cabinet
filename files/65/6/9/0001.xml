The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 63rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.Eeconnaissancesof heligoland bight and the ruhr.1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that during the early hoursof the 8th March three enemy aircraft had been plotted off theEast coast. Fighters had been sent up, but no interceptions hadbeen made.A Heinkel 111 had been shot down by our fighters East of &quot;Wickin the afternoon of the 8th March.An air attack had been made on the Scandinavian convoy.None of the ships had been hit.In the early morning (the 9th March) four aircraft had beendetected off the East coast, presumably engaged in laying magnetic mines.A reconnaissance of the Heligoland Bight had been carriedout on the previous day, but no enemy warships had been observed.A night reconnaissance had been carried out to the West ofthe Ruhr, but no road or rail activity had been observed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Laying ofmagnetic minesby aircraft at scapa Plow.The First Lordat Scapa.Air attacks on shipping.Shippinganchored in theDowns: Fighterprotection.Anti-Aircraftwarships.Attack on theItalian S.S.Amelia Lauro.2. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that either 2 of 3enemy aircraft had operated over Scapa on the previous afternoon and had dropped what were presumed to be magnetic mines in themain entrance to the harbour. Full information of the circum-stances had not yet been received, but it appeared probable that,owing to their approach from the Westward, they had been mistakenfor friendly aircraft and had not been engaged by the defences.The channel at the entrance had since been swept and it seemed that the magnetic mines had been laid clear of it.The First Lord of the Admiralty had arrived at Scapa on theprevious day and was now on board H.M.S. Hood.The mine-laying operations on the East Coast, referred to inthe previous minute, appeared to have been carried out well clear ofthe channels used by shipping except in one case.Further information had now been received in connection withthe air attacks on shipping on the 7th March. A number oftrawlers on the Dogger Bank and a number of fishing vessels offScarborough had been attacked, though without result; and anattack had been made at dusk on the shipping in the Downs, duringwhich a machine-gun attack had been made on the contraband control guard ship, which was a converted merchant ship. On thelatter opening fire, the aircraft had broken off their attack.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that this was the first time that shipping in the Downs had been attacked. The Admiraltyrealised that this contraband control anchorage was a very temptingtarget. The Downs was, however, a very much more convenientanchorage than the alternatives of Weymouth or Falmouth.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence suggested that itmight be desirable to maintain a standing fightef patrol over theshipping in the Downs at dusk.The Chief of the Air Staff agreed and undertook to arrangethis.In reply to a question, the Deputy Chief of Naval Staffinformed the War Cabinet that there were at present four anti-aircraft cruisers in service. Two more cruisers and four merchant ships, converted into Anti-Aircraft ships, would be in service by may 1940.The Italian S.S. Amelia Lauro, which, as reported at theprevious Meeting, had been bombed and set on fire, was now in towand the fire had been extinguished.[20985] . b 2
Shipping losses.Interception ofGerman S.S.Hannover.S.S. Altmark.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 56thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Prime Minister hoped that the Ministry of information would make the most of this attack on an Italian ship.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to make sure that this was being done.The British ship Counsellor, homeward bound in convoy, hadbeen mined and sunk off Liverpool. She had carried the Commodoreof the convoy, and had been right out of the Channel in a knowndangerous area. A special light vessel had been placed to markthe area, and the Commodore had been given his position in relationto this lightship by an aircraft.There was at present no explanation of the occurrence, butappropriate action would be taken.H.M.S. Dunedin had intercepted the German ship Hannoverin the West Indies. The crew had set fire to the vessel, but aboarding party had managed to get the fire under control. the engine room had been extensively damaged, and attempts were nowbeing made to tow the ship into Jamaica. One boatload of Germansailors were reported to have escaped ashore at San Domingo.The Altmark, which was creeping round the Norwegian coast,was now reported to be not far from Oslo. It appeared likely thatshe would escape into the Baltic by making use of territorial watersfor the whole voyage.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 63rdConclusions,Minute 3.)&quot;Western Front.Number, quality and distributionof german divisions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 60thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report on the Western Front.Finland.The French and British Staffs had just completed one of theirperiodical examinations of the total number of German Divisions.They were still of the opinion that 163 was the maximum, though there was doubt about five of them, giving a total of between 158and 163. A number of these Divisions might also be incomplete in personnel and training.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence enquired whetherthose Divisions reported as being in the centre of Germany were disposed for any particular purpose, such as keeping order, orwhether they were merely in reserve.The Secretary of State for War thought that a number of themmight be units undergoing training, and completing with equipment,though there was no certain information on the matter. A certain minimum would undoubtedly have to remain in Poland for internal security.There was no change in the military situation in Finland. the finns appeared to be holding their own, and it was possible thatthe Russians were using the period of negotiation for bringing upfurther reinforcements with which to renew the attack.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
Assistance to finland.Supply ofmunitions.75-mm. gunsfrom the UnitedStates.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 44thConclusions,Minute 4.)Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Italy.economic relations:German sea-borne coal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 63rdConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that atelegram had now been received from our Ambassador atWashington reporting that he had been informed by the Finnish minister that the War Department had intimated that 200 75-mm.guns were surplus and for release, and that the Swedish minister had put in a formal application to purchase them. The Finnish minister was confident that the sale would go through.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet the latest information in regard to the position in Finland.A record of the discussion which took place is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad seen the Italian Ambassador on the previous afternoon and had informed him that our difficulties in regard to the Italian ships which had been detained in the Downs would have been obviatedif the Italian Government had informed us at an earlier stage that,owing to circumstances over which they had no control (viz., delay in loading due to weather conditions), a number of ships alreadyloaded, the cargoes of which had already been paid for, would be unable to leave Rotterdam by the 1st March. They had also compli-cated the position by publishing to the world, at almost the samemoment as the ships had sailed, a stiff Note of protest. Nevertheless,we were prepared to release the ships, with their cargoes, in returnfor an undertaking from the Italian Government that in future noGerman coal should be shipped to Italy.Signor Bastianini had seemed pleased, and had said that theItalian authorities had acted in good faith, and had no interest inpicking a quarrel with us at the moment.Sir Percy Loraine had been informed of the proposal made tothe Italian Ambassador, and had been instructed to take the matter up with Count Ciano.The prospect of reaching a settlement on the above lines seemedto be favourable.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Iron Ore. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heGerman imports thought the War Cabinet would like to be aware of the figures ofhom Sweden.    exports of iron ore from Sweden to Germany in January and february of this year, as compared with January and February of1939.  The figures were as follows : 2939. 1940.From Narvik  Tons. Tons. Tons.

The figures for Oxelosund only for the first two monthsof 1940 were as follows : January 1940    .........      104,865 tonsFebruary 1940   ......... 7,000 tonsThe War Cabinet took note of this statement.
