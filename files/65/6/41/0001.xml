The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 95thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemymine-layingactivities.Attacks onStavangeraerodrome.Vaernesaerodrome.Attack on Osloaerodromes.Mine-laying operations.Attacks onTJ-boats.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that enemy aircraft had renewed their mine-laying activities off our coast and had been working constantly between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. on the previous night from the Downs to the South Essex Coast. Fighters had been dispatched, but had been unable to make contact.On the previous day at noon, after the bombardment byH.M.S. Suffolk (see Minute 2), attacks had been made on stavanger aerodrome by twelve Blenheims. Direct hits on runways had beenreported and also on dispersed aircraft, some of which had been blown up. The pilots had been unable to make close observations,but had reported that the hangars looked as though they had been damaged. Fifty Messerschmitts 110 and some 109s had been encountered over the aerodrome. Two Blenheims had been shot down, whilst a third, which had succeeded in returning to its base,had been hit in fifty-two places.Eleven Wellingtons had left between 5-30 and 7-30 theprevious evening for a further attack on Stavanger. Six aircraft had dropped their bombs on the aerodrome and hits had been observed, but four had been unable to locate the target. One ofthese machines was missing.Six Whitleys which had left on the previous night for an attackon the aerodromes at Vaernes had been unable to locate their targetowing to bad weather.Two Whitleys had left at ef-30 the previous evening to attack the aerodromes at Oslo. Both had returned, but their reports hadnot yet been received.Twenty-eight Hampdens had carried out an offensive mine-laying patrol to the Belts and other areas. One of the aircraft hadcrashed on taking off and the crew had been killed. Eleven had succeeded in dropping their mines, but three had been unable to locate their allotted areas. Reports from the remaining aircraft had not yet been received.One Heavy Cruiser, possibly of the Hipper class, had been seensteaming north in the Great Belt at 5 knots. .Two Flampdens had carried out a reconnaissance of theAalborg aerodrome, which had been found to be full of aircraft,some fifty of which were parked wing-tip to wing-tip. these aircraft were thought to be troop carriers. The question whether we should attack this target was being considered by the Air Staff.He would suggest that a decision should be deferred until thefollowing day, when fuller information would be available.A number of aircraft had searched the Norwegian coast fromKristiansand (North) round to Kristiansand (South) during theprevious day. Weather conditions had made it unsuitable for aircraft to penetrate deep into the fjords. -One Hudson had attacked a U-boat in Bjorne Fjord about20 miles South of Bergen. It was thought that the U-boat hadbeen hit.Just after noon the previous day a Walrus had attacked aU-boat south of the Fair Isle and had estimated that damage hadbeen done to it.Patrols had been undertaken over H.M.S. Suffolk on her return journey during the previous afternoon and enemy bombers engagedin attacking her had been chased off. This patrol had been laterrelieved by Skuas (see Minute 2).At 6-30 p.m. on the previous evening two enemy destroyers hadbeen seen in Avero Fjord, just north of Romsdal Fjord, but our aircraft had been unable to keep touch with them owing to bad weather.
Seven Beauforts had successfully carried out a special patrolin the Heligoland Bight.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 95thConclusions,Minute 2.)Bombardmentof stavanger aerodrome byH.M.S. Suffolk.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinetdetails regarding the movements of the Main Fleet.Attack on the admiral Scheer.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 2.)German navallosses.Magnetic mines.MediterraneanFleetmovements:consultationwith the French.H.M.S. Suffolk had fired 217 rounds at Stavanger Aerodromebetween 4-45 and 6-5 a.m. on the 17th April. Observation of theeffects of the fire had been difficult owing to the fact that aircraftcommunication had broken down, but heavy smoke had been observed over the target. During the action a torpedo had been seen to miss astern. When retiring, H.M.S. Suffolk had been bombed persistently and had sustained one hit and several near misses, which had caused considerable damage. Thirty-three dive-bombing attacks had been made and 82 high-level bombs dropped.The casualties had been 17 killed and 33 wounded. H.M.S. Suffolkwas now approaching Scapa, escorted by HALS. Renown and 9destroyers. During the air attack. Fleet Air Arm aircraft had succeeded in bringing down 1 Heinkel and 1 Dornier and haddamaged 3 Heinkels&quot;.H.M. Submarine Spear fish, on her return to harbour, had con-firmed that the A admiral Scheer had been hit by at least one torpedo,6 miles North of the Skaw at 12-30 a.m. on the 11th April.The Chancellor of the Exchequer questioned whether sufficientprominence had been given in the Press to the effect of the recentsevere casualties suffered by the German Navy. Naval strengthswere relative, and the recent increase in our naval strength ascompared with Germany&apos;s should be fully stressed, particularly for the benefit of the Italians. The point to bring out was the striking change in the proportionate strength of the British andGerman Navies, as a result of the recent German losses.The enemy had again started to lay magnetic mines by aircraftoff our East Coast. Shipping in the Downs had been ordered notto sail as a precautionary measure. Our arrangements for dealingwith magnetic mines were now in a high state of efficiency.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that he had been studying the situation in the Mediterranean and Admiral Blake had alreadyleft for Paris to discuss matters with Admiral Darlan. The object in view was to reinforce the Allied naval forces at the Eastern endof the Mediterranean as soon as possible. He would report further to the War Cabinet when the consultations with the French naval staff had taken place.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
355W.M.96 (40).Operations in 3.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty gave the  followingNorway. particulars of naval movements in Scandinavian waters : (Previous The Admiral commanding the First Cruiser Squadron had reference: reported that there were 9,000 tons of oil fuel in Tromso in shoreW.M. (40) 95th stocks. One Norwegian battalion had been embarked at Kirkenes.Conclusions, H.M.S.  War spite and three destroyers were out on patrolMinute 3.)        60 miles west of the entrance to the Vest Fjord.Naval The Captain of H.M.S. Faulkner had reported that at midnightmovements. on the 16th April he had destroyed a dump of ammunition andpetrol which had been landed by German destroyers one mile west of Herjangen. Preliminary reconnaissance to locate this dump hadbeen carried out by a landing party, with the loss of one ratingkilled.The Captain of this ship had also sent a full report of the guns mounted around Narvik. This report had not yet been examined in detail, but it appeared that they were a verymiscellaneous collection.The convoy which had taken the troops to Narvik had returned.Landings at The transport Chrobry, escorted by H.M.S. Manchester, hadNamsos and arrived at Namsos after dark the previous evening. DisembarkationAndalsnes.        had begun at 9-45 p.m. and had been completed satisfactorily.Brigadier Phillips&apos;s brigade was thus ashore. The first part of the convoy which contained the Chasseurs Alpins was due to arrive offNamsos at dusk that day.A force of 700 men had been landed at Andalsnes the previous night. The first contingent of Brigadier Morgan&apos;s brigade wouldbe landed there on the night of 18th/19th April.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked whatimportance should be attached to the possibility of the Germansreinforcing Trondhjem from the air by means of troop-carriers.The Prime Minister said that it had not been considered thatreinforcements could be sent in any great numbers in troop-carriers.The aerodrome at Vaernes was poor and had already been respon-sible for a number of crashes.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Staff hadcalculated that the Germans had 400 to 800 aircraft working in scandinavia. Most of these were fighters and troop-carriers, themain German bomber force having as yet been practically unused.The Minister without Portfolio asked if the Norwegians wereblowing up the railways.The Prime Minister understood that this had been done in places; but he was sceptical about our placing any reliance on the norwegians, who were offering no serious resistance.Looking at the position generally, we could be satisfied thatwe had already got so many troops ashore without any loss not-withstanding the risk of air attack.The Prime Minister also gave a general outline of the scope ofAllied operations in Norway, a record of which is contained inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 95thConclusions,Minute 4.)Western Front.4. The Secretary of State for War said that the latestintelligence from the Western Front revealed no change in thenumber of German Divisions, although the German Forces in scandinavia would seem to have been drawn from the Baltic coast and from East and Central Germany. There had been no con-firmation of reported German troop concentrations in Galicia.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
The western front.Action to betaken if theNetherlands or belgium is invaded.(previous reference erences:W.M. (40) 93rdConclusions,Minute 10,and 95thConclusions,Minute 10.)&quot;X&quot;6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it now appeared that the reason why M. Reynaud had been pleased at theway in which the Belgian Ambassador&apos;s questions had been dealtwith on the 14th April was that M. Reynaud had told the BelgianAmbassador in Paris that the Allies would never move their forcesinto Belgium in the absence of an invitation from the BelgianGovernment. M. de Lantsheere, the Belgian Counsellor, had informed Mr. Strang the previous day that this assurance had beengiven by M. Reynaud. He had gone on to say that he thought his country would be willing to exchange views very confidentially with us and had suggested himself as a suitable channel, a suggestion which he could hardly have made without having received authorityto do so. The Foreign Secretary proposed now to telegraph toSir Ronald Campbell asking him to clear .up with the FrenchGovernment three questions which remained in doubt as to thenature of Allied action in the event of German aggression againstthe Low Countries. In particular, he proposed to ask whether theFrench Government had definitely decided that the Allied forces should enter Belgium immediately upon an act of aggression beingcommitted by Germany whether or not the Belgian Governmentissued an invitation. If what M. de Lantsheere had said was true,it tended to confirm his (the Foreign Secretary&apos;s) view that general gamelin might not as yet have finally decided to move troops into belgium in the circumstances indicated; it would explain alsoM. Reynaud&apos;s objection to any further communication being madeto the Belgian Government. The draft statements which had beenprepared by the French Government assumed that we should so moveJapan. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that afterPosition of the the last Meeting of the War Cabinet he had intended to make aNetherland East communication to the Japanese Government. He had intended toIndies in the take as a peg the fact that the Netherland Minister in Londonevent of the had informed Mr. R. A. Butler that the Japanese Government hadinvasion of the notified the Netherland Government, both in Tokyo and at TheNetherlands. Hague, that it was in Japanese interests to see the status quo(Previous maintained in the East Indies.   He had intended to inform the reference: Japanese Minister that we took note of this declaration and, atW.M. (40) 95th the same time, to ask him to inform the Japanese Government that conclusions, we held the same views. Before doing so, however, he had wishedMinute ii.) to ascertain from Lord Lothian whether the United States Govern-ment concurred and, if so, to suggest that they should take parallelaction. That morning, however, the Daily Telegraph had published a statement by Mr. Cordell Hull expressing the interest felt by theUnited States Government in the maintenance of the integrity ofthe Netherland East Indies. For the moment, therefore, he proposedto take no action vis-a-vis the Japanese Government, but he had arranged with the First Lord of the Admiralty that the UnitedStates Naval Attache in London (who had previously made an informal approach to the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff) should beauthorised to report to President Roosevelt that if the United StatesGovernment ordered the United States Fleet to the Philippines, weshould be willing to provide all possible repair and dockingfacilities at Singapore. He proposed also to notify Lord Lothianof the communication received from the United States naval attache and of the reply which had been given as recorded above.In reply to a question by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, the Foreign Secretary said that there would be no objectionto his informing the Prime Minister of Australia of the com-munication which the Japanese Government had made to the netherland Government, and letting him know that we were pro-posing to take the matter up with the United States Governmentwith a view to securing their concurrence in parallel action.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
our troops, but the covering note from the Quai oTOrsay did notexplicitly state that this was the intention of the Allies.The possibility that General Gamelin would not order his troops to move would be even greater in the event of the Netherlandsacceding to German demands for the surrender of bases to be usedto attack us. If, in that event, the Allied troops entered Belgian territory, the Belgian Government would no doubt protestvigorously; but if the Germans reacted by immediately invadingBelgium, the Belgian objection&apos; to our action would cease.Similarly, if the Germans decided not to attack Belgium until, say,one or two days after we had entered Belgium, we should no doubt have to put up with a barrage of propaganda. That would notdisturb us, having regard to the strategic advantage which weshould have gained. We should, however, be in real difficulties if,after we had entered Belgium, the Germans decided not to do so.The Prime Minister said that he thought that the lattercontingency could be ruled out. The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff had said that he was confident that the Germans would reactimmediately, in order to deny to us the advanced defensive position which we should then be seeking to take up.The Secretary of State for War said that he had never been satisfied that the French had definitely committed themselves tomoving the Allied forces into Belgium without an invitation fromthe Belgian Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he fullyshared the Secretary of State&apos;s anxiety, which was reinforced inhis mind by the stress laid by the French &quot;on the need for securingBelgian military co-operation.-(Previous The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at his interviewReference: on the 14th April the Belgian Ambassador had told the ForeignW.M. (40) 93rd Secretary that he assumed that the French Government would be conclusions, in a position to give a plain reply in the sense desired by the BelgianMinute 10.) Government to the questions which he was then putting to us. Thiswas perhaps significant in the light of this new information.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed; at thatinterview Baron de Cartier had probably been aware of the assurance given by M. Reynaud.The Prime Minister said that, if the Netherlands or Belgiumwere to make a deal with Germany under which the latter obtainedadvanced positions for attack on this country, and the FrenchGovernment refused to move the Allied armies into Belgium, weshould be confronted with a very serious and alarming situation.He fully agreed, therefore, that we must do everything to obtain from the French Government a categorical declaration of their intention to join with us in entering Belgium, whether invited ornot, and whether the Belgians objected or not, immediately anyovert act of aggression was committed by Germany. Furthermore,M. Reynaud would need to withdraw any assurance to the contrarywhich &quot;he might have given. If we could reach definite agreementwith the French Government on this subject, it would, he thought,be well for us to make a further communication to the BelgianGovernment. The policy of the Belgian Government was based onthe assumption that it was still possible for them, by concessions toGermany, to avoid being drawn into the war, and it would be well to destroy their present complacency by making it clear to themthat, if Holland was invaded, they could not by such means escape from being drawn into the war.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the view taken hitherto had been that our best course would be to make nofurther communication to the Belgian Government at this stage,but, immediately Belgium was attacked, ourselves to enter Belgium,
basing this action on our firm conviction that the Belgians desiredus to come to their aid; we should thereby make it impossible forthem to work up public feeling against our action.The Prime Minister said that what he had in mind was that,in agreement with the French, we should demand from the BelgianGovernment to be informed of the action which they would proposeto take in the event of a German attack upon the Netherlands. Theywould not, he was confident, dare to say that they intended to take no action.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that heshould now telegraph to Sir Ronald Campbell on the lines indicated at &quot;X &quot; above, referring also to the considerations which had been advanced during the discussion, and asking the French Governmentagain to consider the wisdom of the Allies making a further jointcommunication to the Belgian Government.   This was agreed to.The Secretary of State for Air said that the position as regardsthe air action to be taken in the event of a German attack againstthe Netherlands was equally unsatisfactory. It had been agreedthat this should be discussed between the French and ourselves bothon the political and on the military plane; and in each case theFrench reply had been entirely indefinite. It was worth considering whether an attempt should be made to clear up this question throughpersonal discussion at General Gamelin&apos;s headquarters; and he proposed to discuss this matter further with the Chief of the AirStaff.The Prime Minister agreed that this was desirable.The War Cabinet- ,(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris,instructing him to make a communication to the FrenchGovernment on the lines indicated by the Secretary ofState in the passages marked &quot; X &quot; and &quot; Y &quot; above.*(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to arrange for afurther discussion at an early date on the military planein regard to air action in the event of a German attack against the Netherlands.Western Front(continued).ProbableGermanintentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 93rdConclusions,Minute 9.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams bearing on German intentions receivedfrom His Majesty&apos;s Minister, The Hague : Telegram No. 100 of 16th April, 1940. The Minister forForeign Affairs had said that he saw no immediate cause foralarm. The Germans were adding to their barbed wireentanglements; and, unless this were a ruse, it did not look as though they were contemplating an attack at the moment.Telegram No. 104 DIPP, of 17th April, 1940. The naval attache had been informed that the Netherland Naval staff had learned from their reliable source in Berlin that it was still part of the plan to attack on the Western Front, but not before the Norwegian position had been clarified.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Telegrams Nos. 101 and 102 DIPP to Paris.
Italy.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 95thConclusions,Minute 7.)Proposals of theFrench war committee.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read the draftof a Telegram which he proposed to send to His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Paris, setting out, for the information of the FrenchGovernment, our reactions to the proposals of the War Committeeof the French Cabinet; the general line of the draft was asfollows : We did not agree with the view that the action of theAllies should be made wholly dependent on that of Turkey,Greece and Roumania. The policy of those countries wouldbe decided only by the action of the Allies, and if the Allies,anticipating an Italian attack on Yugoslavia, tried to forcethose countries to commit themselves in advance of GreatBritain and France, they would conclude that the Allies were trying to evade the issue and place the responsibility on them.After indicating the probable attitude of Roumania,Turkey and Greece (paragraphs 3-8), the draft (paragraph 7)stated that it would be a waste of time and might also produceunfortunate misunderstandings if Great Britain and france were to do nothing more at this juncture than to propose tothe four States concerned that in view of a possible attack on yugoslavia, they should create a united military front against aggression.The Allied Governments would have to make up their minds without being sure of the reaction of Yugoslavia ifattacked by Italy (paragraph 8). Yugoslavia was, however,much more likely to offer resistance if she knew in advance that if Italy attacked her, Italy in turn would be attacked by great Britain, France and Turkey. Even so the risk must be faced that Germany might intervene on Italy&apos;s behalf, andthat Yugoslavia might capitulate even if assured of the supportof the three Governments named above. Whether or notYugoslavia put up resistance, a decision by the Allies merely to wait for the Balkan States to take the initiative would produce a disastrous effect on our position in South eastern europe. We trusted therefore (paragraph 9) that the FrenchGovernment would examine the problem again in the light ofthe considerations set forth above; and since the matter brookedno delay, we suggested that, concurrently, the French andBritish Chiefs of Staff should be asked to study the problem from the naval and military point of view.The following were the main points raised in discussion : Advice of the Chiefs of Staff.(i) It was agreed that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked toconsider the implications of our becoming involved inwar with Italy, so that in the light of their advice, theWar Cabinet might agree on a considered policy. TheChiefs of Staff should be asked to assess the advantages and disadvantages of our becoming involved in war with italy. Was the position such that we should seek inevery possible way to avoid becoming so involved?(ii) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hoped that the Chiefs of Staff would be instructed, when considering this matter, to give weight also to the effecton the Balkan situation generally, if Italy attackedYugoslavia and ,we did nothing. He had been much impressed by the view expressed by Sir Michael Palairetthat, if we were to do nothing in that event, our Balkanpolicy would melt away, while Italy&apos;s entry into the war against us would only be postponed for a short time.Sir Michael Palairet felt, therefore, that the better course would be for us to face up to the position as soonas Italy moved against Yugoslavia.
Italy&apos;s possible attitude and reactions.(iii) The Secretary of State for Air considered that, if Italyattacked Yugoslavia, Northern Italy and Italian publicopinion generally would be opposed to this policy, butthat this opposition might well die down quickly ifthere were no immediate reaction from the Allies. his conclusion was, therefore, that in that event our proper course would be to attack Italy at once. Italy was undoubtedly more vulnerable than France, provided thatthe present restrictions on the targets which might bebombed were removed.(iv) Should we give a warning to Signor Mussolini ?   Thiscourse was not favoured, since the Duce was likely todecide the issue on his own estimate of the progress ofthe war.(v) Successful Allied operations in Norway would be the bestanswer we could give him. The Duce had now arranged to make a speech on the 30th April, 1940. It was unlikely that he would take any final decision before that date, by which time he would be in a better positionto judge the progress of our operations in Norway.(vi) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 372, dated the 14th April, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Minister, Rome, stating that SignorAnsaldo, both in conversation with Dr. Hodel, a prominent Swedish journalist, and with a well-knownSwiss journalist, had said that, &quot; if the Allies fail todisembark in Norway, Italy will take that as a sign toenter the war. If the British disembark, Italy will notmove.&quot;(vii) The Foreign Secretary said that Sir Ronald Graham,whom he had seen the previous evening, had taken theview that it would be of value if we could restart thecommercial negotiations in such a way as to showNorthern Italy that there was an opportunity of increased trade with this country.Procedure when the Chiefs of Staff report had been received.(viii) The Prime Minister said that, after the advice of theChiefs of Staff had been received, the action to be takenwould fall into three stages : (a) It would be necessary to decide whether the political disadvantages of seeing Yugoslavia overrunjustified us incurring the risk of becoming involved in war with Italy in order to prevent it.\b) If the answer to the foregoing question was in the affirmative, we should have to find out whether wecould count on assistance from Turkey.(c) If Turkish aid were assured, we should then have to approach the Yugoslav Government and give them an assurance that, if they were to resist anattack by the Italians or by the Italians and germans together, they would have the full support of Great Britain, France and Turkey.These proposals were agreed to.Drafting Amendments.(ix) The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that in para-graph 7 it would be more correct to say that weanticipated &quot; the most unfortunate misunderstandingsif Great Britain and France were to do nothing more at
this juncture but to wait &quot; than to say &quot; .... at this juncture than to wait.&quot; In general, the draft telegramimplied that the decision to be taken rested mainly onstrategical grounds. Would it not be better, therefore,to formulate the questions which in paragraph 9 it wassuggested should be considered by the French andBritish Chiefs of Staff? What was required was thematerial to enable the Allied Governments to decide what they should do in the light of the present situation.(x) The Prime Minister said that the important question todecide was the nature of the communication which, inagreement with the French, we should make to the yugoslav Government. It did not, therefore, seem necessary to put to the French Government the possi-bility that Yugoslavia might capitulate, and he would therefore like to see the deletion of the penultimatesentence in paragraph 8 of the draft telegram (&quot; but even so ... . Great Britain, France and Turkey&quot;).(xi) As regards the communication to be made to the FrenchGovernment, the Foreign Secretary thought that the best course would be to leave the opening portion of the draft telegram much as it stood at present, and then to addparagraphs : (i) Indicating the considerations urged by Sir MichaelPalairet to which he had referred and also thosewhich had been mentioned by the Secretary ofState for Air;(ii) Setting out the questions which we wished theAllied Chiefs of Staff to consider;(iii) Stating that, if Turkey shared our view, we should propose to approach Yugoslavia as suggested bythe Prime Minister.(xii) The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it would bedesirable also to redraft paragraph 1 of the telegramsince in its present form it almost prejudged the issue to be decided.Position of Shipping in the Mediterranean.(xiii) The Minister without Portfolio suggested that, as therewere only twelve days before the date fixed for signor mussolini&apos;s speech, the position of British shipping inthe Mediterranean should be considered.The Secretary of State for War said that a completediversion, as adopted at the beginning of the war, had caused great inconvenience. It would, however, bepossible to secure much the same object by regulating the rate at which British ships entered theMediterranean at either end.The Prime Minister agreed that the Minister ofShipping should be asked to advise whether action onthese lines should be taken.The War Cabinet (1) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider the implications ofour becoming involved in war with Italy at the presenttime. The particular situation envisaged is an Italianattack on Yugoslavia, which is regarded as the most likely form of Italian action at the present time. TheChiefs of Staff are asked to take into account the effecton the Balkan position generally if this aggression tookplace and we took no action.
(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to instruct our Ambassador at Paris to make a communica-tion to the French Government setting out our viewson the proposals of the French War Committee on thesituation which would arise if Italy were to attackYugoslavia.(3). That the instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris,referred to in (2), should follow the lines of the draftprepared in the Foreign Office, amended in the light ofthe above discussion, and in particular^ of the pointssummarised in (viii) to (xi) above.(4) Invited the Minister of Shipping to consider whether, andif so what, measures should be taken at once to reducethe volume of British Shipping passing through theMediterranean, and to report to the War Cabinet.War Cabinet 9.   The Prime Minister said that he proposed that in additionArrangements. to the normal Cabinet to be held on the morning of Monday,22nd April, 1940. a special Cabinet should be held at 5 p.m. on that day to consider the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Budget State-ment.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,April. 18, 1940.
