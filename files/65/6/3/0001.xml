19 W.M.58(40):The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 56thConclusions,Minute 4.)Air attacks on shipping.reconnaissance of Heligoland.Patrols andleaflet raids.1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been no enemy activity during daylight on the previous day. During the night, however, after moon rise, 13 raids had taken place on shipping off the East and South coasts from Aberdeen to SelseyBill. It had been reported that a ship had been damaged off the isle of Wight, but details were not yet available. Fighters had been dispatched, but no interceptions had taken place.A Spitfire had taken photographs over Heligoland on theprevious day.   No warships had been seen.Patrols had been maintained over Borkum, Norderney and Sylt,and leaflet raids had taken place over Berlin, Kiel, Lubeck,Hamburg and Bremen.An aircraft of the Coastal Command had sighted two Flakships off Horns Beef on the previous afternoon and had attacked with bombs and machine guns.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 56thConclusions,Minute 5.)Attacks on shipping:South coast defences.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the attacks on shipping as far West as the Isle of Wight raised new and seriouspi&apos;oblems in connection with the defence of the South coast. Itmight be necessary to review the adequacy of the defences at plymouth, for ,example.Enemy air attacks on shipping had been as follows :  Norwegian S.S. Brott (1,583 tons) bombed and machine-gunned off Whitby. Some of the crew had taken to boats and four were still unaccounted for. Ship damaged by concussionand being towed to port.Norwegian S.S. Vestfoss (1,388 tons) bombed east ofOrkneys.   Sank later when in tow.  No casualties.From reports which had so far been received of the raidsreferred to in the previous Minute, it appeared that ten attacks hadbeen made. There was no report of damage except in the case ofthe ship off the Isle of Wight, which was reported to be on fire with250 passengers on board.No attacks by mine or torpedo had been reported in the previous24 hours, but a delayed report had been received of the sinking ofthe Italian S.S. Maria Rosa (4,200 tons) off Lowestoft on the29th February by mine or torpedo.The Italian S.S. Mirella (5,340 tons), reported as damaged atthe Meeting referred to in the margin, was at anchor.The new Cunard liner S.S. Queen Elizabeth (80,000 tons) had left the Clyde earlier in the morning for New York.H.M.S. Despatch had intercepted the German S.S. Troja(2,400 tons) on the 29th February off Venezuela. The Troja hadbeen set on fire and then scuttled. H.M.S. Despatch had picked upher crew.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff explainedthat the chances of intercepting aircraft at night were at presentextremely slight. The methods which were being developed by thescientists for detecting enemy aircraft from our own aircraft had seemed most promising and had been given the highest priority.While he was convinced that a satisfactory instrument would be developed in due course, he did not think it likely that the problem would be solved in the very near future.It was suggested that Sir Henry Tizard should be invited togive the War Cabinet the latest information in regard to this,matter.[20932] B 2GermanS.S. Trojascuttled.Interception of aircraft at night.
Reference was made to the Press reports on the previous dayof the sinking of the S.S. Pyrrhus and of an alleged U-boat attackon the S.S. Stonegate in the Caribbean Sea.The War Cabinet were informed that, although the Pressaccount made it appear that the Pyrrhus had just been sunk, theship had, in fact, gone down on the 17th February. TheS.S. Stonegate had exchanged shots with a French submarine.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 56thConclusions,Minute 6.)Western Front:redistribution olGermanDivisions.Finland.3. The Secretary of State for War said that there had been an increase of 1 German Division north of the Moselle, and acorresponding reduction of 1 Division in the centre. The Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff had been informed by General Gamelinthat the Germans had withdrawn all their active Divisions from thefront line between Switzerland and Luxemburg, but this was notthe case on that part of the front opposite Belgium and Holland.The Chief of the Imperial General Sta)ff said That he had spoken on the previous day in France to a French officer who had left Field-Marshal Mannerheim on Wednesday, the 28th February.This officer had represented the French Army in Finland for someyears. He had reported that the military situation in Finland whenlie left was in no way dangerous. The Finns had carried out their withdrawal in good order, and the Russian attacks were dying down.The Finnish Command were not in any way alarmed by the position.Marshal Mannerheim himself realised that, if Finland surrendered to Russia, the whole country would be bolshevised. Unfortunately,the morale of the Finnish Government was less sound, and therewas certainly a considerable difference of opinion between marshal mannerheim and his Government regarding the peace terms whichthe Russians had offered.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Assistance to 4.   A record of a statement by the Chief of the ImperialFinland. General Staff; of the ensuing discussion; and of the conclusions(Previous reached by the War Cabinet, is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s StandardReference:        File of War Cabinet Conclusions.W.M. (40) 57thConclusions.)5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theposition of the Commander-in-Chief of the British ExpeditionaryForce in relation to the French High Command had been satisfac-satisfactorily settled between himself and General Gamelin, on the basis that Lord Gort would be under the orders of General Georges aswe had always understood him to be hitherto. There could beno doubt that there had been a misunderstanding on our part. Itwould, of course, be necessary to have the matter confirmed inwriting.The Secretary of State for War suggested that the best meansof doing this would be for the Chief of the Imperial General staff to address a letter to General Gamelin, the terms of which wouldbe submitted for the War Cabinet&apos;s approval.British land forces inFrance.Position of theCommander-in-Chief in relationto the french high Command.(previous reference:W.M.

United States olAmerica.Mr. sumner welles&apos; Visit to europe.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 55thConclusions,Minute 8.)Request formilitaryinformation.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatGeneral Miles, the American Military and Air Attache, had visited the War Office and stated that his object was to acquire military information for transmission to Mr. Sumner Welles. He asked fora special visit to the British Expeditionary Force, for a statementof the present composition of the British Forces, and for an outline of our plans for expansion on both a short and a long term basis.The Foreign Office had been consulted as to the reply to be given.In discussion, the view was generally expressed that this request could not be acceded to, but that we should reply to it with circumspection and courtesy. It was true that in April 1939we had given the American Ambassador (in confidence, for trans-mission to President Roosevelt) certain particulars as to our air strength. But the position was quite different now that we were at war.The Minister without Portfolio recalled that no special military information had been given to Colonel House on the occasion of his visit to London as President Wilson&apos;s emissary in the spring of1915. But some members of the Cabinet had talked to him veryfreely perhaps too freely about military questions, as recorded inColonel House&apos;s memoirs.It was suggested that the reply to General Miles should takethe line that, when Mr. Welles reached London, he would haveconfidential discussions with Ministers, and that these discussions would no doubt touch on military matters; but that we did not feelthat, at the present time, it would be possible to accede to therequest put forward by General Miles.The War Cabinet Invited the Chiefs of Staff (i) in conjunction with the Foreign Office, to draft a replyto General Miles on the above lines;(ii) to inform the French authorities, through militaryliaison channels, of the reply sent to General Miles.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 2, 1940.
