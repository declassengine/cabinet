Man Power.Supply andtraining of skilled labour.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by theChancellor of the Exchequer on the Supply and Training of skilled labour (W.P. (G.) (40) 71).The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained the main features of his Report. The following were the main points made in the subsequent discussion : Statistics of Employment.(1) General agreement was expressed with the view thatarrangements should be made to obtain from employers in theindustrial groups of importance to our war effort (including theexport trade) a quarterly return showing the number of personsemployed, distinguishing between the main occupational groups andthe classes of work undertaken by the firm.(2) It was agreed that the first of the groups to be coveredshould be re-defined as &quot; Engineering, &amp;c, construction and repair of motor vehicles and aircraft.&quot;(3) It was agreed that the quarterly returns should be supple-mented by monthly returns prepared on a sample basis.The Minister of Labour explained that these monthly returnswould relate to certain selected firms only. Owing to the large amount of work involved, it would not be possible to include in thefirst of the monthly (sample) returns all the other industrial classesof importance to our war effort, but he would like it laid down thatthe aim should be to obtain a full return on all such classes by theautumn.(4) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Ministerof Labour had agreed to consult the various Supply departments and the Board of Trade in regard not only to the distribution ofthe industrial groups between the successive returns, but also to the definition of the occupations to be included therein.(5) Importance was attached to the Minister of Labour havingauthority to inform employers that this return was being collected by the express direction of the Government and that he could useor obtain additional compulsory powers, if necessary. The Ministerof Labour said that he did not expect that it would be necessary touse compulsory powers, but he wished to be in a position to do so if circumstances demanded.(6) It was agreed that the results likely to be obtained did not justify obtaining statistics as to the industries from which labourwas being drawn into the war industries.Reserves of Labour for the War Industries.(1) General agreement was expressed with the view that thetask of seeking out reserves of labour was pre-eminently one to becarried out regionally rather than centrally, and that full advantage should be taken, for this purpose, of the machinery provided by theArea Boards now being established by the Ministry of Supply.(2) In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the Ministerof Supply said that it was hoped to establish all the 13 Area Boardsbefore Easter; 7 or 8 of them were already functioning. In general,he thought that the Area Organisation would be very valuable forthis purpose. It was of great advantage to the latter if they hadworking under them the Area Committees, whose duty it was to seek out productive capacity. He would be prepared, if desired, to add to the Boards an Export Representative. The President ofthe Board of Trade welcomed this proposal.(3) The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury said that, whilethe Area Boards would no doubt be able to play a valuable role, itshould be realised that a great deal of work in this field was already being done by the Ministry of Labour through  EmploymentExchanges.[20973]b 2
(4) The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to the importance ofobtaining, at an early date, statistics of the non-essential industriesfrom which labour would have to be drawn into essential industries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that it was contemplated that the Area Boards should furnish periodical reports of the progress achieved in the task laid upon.them. he invited the Minister of Supply to include, in the communication tobe made to the Boards, the date by which the first of these reports should be rendered.   It was agreed that this should be done.Training for Industry.(1) It was agreed that training in Government institutionscould not compare, as regards the volume of results obtained, withthat afforded by industry. Nevertheless, all possible advantage should be taken of the Ministry of Labour Training Centres, bothby reducing the period of training where this proved to be practicable, and by the institution of double shifts.(2) The Minister of Labour said that it was not proposed toreduce from six to four months the course for all trainees, but only for those who proved to possess sufficient aptitude to render a four months&apos; course adequate. There was general agreement thattraining in purely repetitive processes was best given in the works.(3) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as a result ofthe recent drive, there had been a gratifying increase in the numberof applicants for training at the Centres; but if later it should prove impossible to keep the Centres working to capacity throughvoluntary recruiting from the unemployed, it would be necessaryto consider other measures, such as (a) making attendance at a centre, if required, a condition of receiving unemployment benefit,and (b) the opening of Centres to persons employed in the non-essential industries. In the latter case, it would be necessary,however, to pay such persons, while in training, allowancesequivalent to the wages they had been drawing.(4) The Lord Privy Seal said that the need for such trainingmight arise quite quickly, and he suggested, therefore, that consideration should at once be given to the machinery which wouldbe required.The Minister of Labour said that this question was now being studied by the Training Division of his Department. In general,he wished to emphasise the remarkably high standard of the candidates now coming forward for training.(5) With regard to training in Technical Institutions, &amp;c,the President of the Board of Education said that what he had inmind was to make available (a) certain places at present used fortraining not essential to our war effort, and (&amp;) certain new buildings which, owing to the war conditions, had not yet been equipped.Training given at such institutions was of a very high grade, butthe number of places was not large. At present, there were some,000 places, and, given the necessary staff and equipment, it shouldbe possible with the introduction of double shifts to increase theoutput of a proportion of these places three fold.(6) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the Scottishtechnical institutions could play an important part in matters ofa scientific and technical nature, though on the trade side the contribution which they could make was limited. He estimatedthat there were, approximately, between five and six hundred placesnow available for such training, and that that number might bedoubled by equipping spare rooms in existing institutions. he intended to issue a circular to Scottish institutions on the lines proposed by the President of the Board of Education for those inEngland and Wales.
(7) The Secretary of State for War said that, in order to avoidcalling up skilled men for the Army, the War Office were makinguse of the Ministry of Labour Training Centres, and the technicalinstitutions, but, if these facilities ceased- to be available, therewould be no alternative to calling up skilled men for the Army.The Minister of Labour said that there was no intention of inter-fering with the arrangements made for training of Army personnel.The War Cabinet: Approved the arrangements indicated by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in his Memorandum (W.P. (G.) (40) 71)in regard to : (a) the steps to be taken to obtain statistics of employment;(b) the arrangements for training for industry;subject to the amendments on points of detail indicated inthe course of the discussion recorded above.economic warfare.Control ofcotton imports into countries to which germany has2. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer covering a Report by the interdepartmental committee on Economic Warfare on the control of Cotton imports into countries to which Germany has access (W.P. (G.) (40) 70).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had thought it advisable to bring this Report direct to the War Cabinet insteadof to the Committee on Economic Policy because of the serious political issues which it raised.The Minister for Economic Warfare explained that under present arrangements exports of cotton from the Empire and from egypt to &apos;&apos; dangerous destinations &apos;&apos; were controlled by a system of export licences, but cotton from North and South America was subject only to the ordinary contraband control, i.e., it could be seized only if there was evidence that a particular consignmentmight be destined for Germany. As a result the Egyptian exportersfelt that they were being unfairly treated; and though their exports were larger than before the war, we might have to pacify them bybuying from them the cotton which they were prevented from sellingto &quot;dangerous destinations.&quot; The alternative was to rationimports from America. There was in any case a strong statisticalcase for this, inasmuch as stocks were piling up in countries,adjacent to Germany, as set out in his Memorandum, and this fact was arousing criticism in this country. The United Statesimporters were unwilling to co-operate in a scheme of export quotas for American cotton, and it was therefore necessary to deal withthe matter at the European end by means of import quotas.He did not anticipate any insuperable difficulty in securingagreements with the countries concerned for import quotas,providing they were on reasonable terms, but he thought that therewould be considerable delay, and in some cases failure to secure agreement, unless he had in reserve the sanction of forciblerationing, i.e., the power to detain as contraband cargoes in excessof the agreed quota. A slightly different approach would be appropriate in the case of each of the countries concerned. Itwould no doubt be objected that it was unsatisfactory to leave Italyfree as he proposed, but her stocks were, in fact, very small and sheappeared to have no resources with which to pay for a large increasein imports. In the case of some of the countries with which wehad made war trade agreements, there was what they might consider amounted to an understanding that we should not require them to conclude rationing agreements; but he thought that these objections could be overcome by a reasonable approach. As regardsopinion in the United States, his proposals were in line with the[20973] B 3
suggestions of the importers themselves, though it was true thatthe producers would probably object to anything which reduced thevolume of American exports of cotton as a whole.On all these grounds the Interdepartmental Committee had concluded that it was desirable to fix quotas for cotton imports tothe countries concerned.The A attorney-General said that, as explained in his noteannexed to the Report, a quota fixed for forcible rationing couldnot be rigidly enforced by seeking and obtaining condemnation inthe Prize Courts of all cargoes in excess of the quota. It would,however, probably be possible in particular cases to secure additionalevidence as to the destination of the cargo concerned, while the delays and inconveniences of the Prize Court procedure were aconsiderable threat in themselves. Generally, he did not think thatthe doubt as to the attitude which the Prize Court would adoptmade it inadvisable to resort to the threat of possible rationing.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that it was desirable to conclude quota agreements on the lines proposed as quickly as possible. He was pleased that the proposal would meetthe Egyptian criticisms which we now had to face, and that it wasnot proposed to impose rationing on Italy.The Minister without Portfolio recalled that our failure tocontrol cotton imports to neutrals at the beginning of the last war had aroused considerable criticism and that the matter hadeventually been dealt with on lines very similar to those which were now proposed, i.e., by agreements with the various countries concerned.The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that the use of shipping for building up stocks of cotton and other essential commodities in neutral countries restricted the amount available for other purposes and so added to our shipping difficulties.The War Cabinet :-(i) Authorised the Minister for Economic Warfare tonegotiate with the Governments of neutral countries towhich Germany has access, other than Italy, with a viewto restricting cotton imports into those countries,(ii) Agreed that this object should be secured by fixing importquotas, to be determined if possible by voluntary agree-ments; but authorised him, if necessary, to have recourse to forcible rationing,(iii) Took note that, as regards Italy, forcible rationing wouldbe neither applied nor threatened.Italy. &apos;economic relations:subjection ofGerman sea-borne coal to enemy export control.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 61stConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wished to ask the War Cabinet to give instructions that the Italiancoal ships now detained in the Downs should not be sent elsewhere.He feared that, if this were done, it would suggest the beginningof the process of unloading and putting the cargoes into prize, &amp;c,whereas he wished to keep open the possibility that some of the cargoes might after all be released. This was partly because theMinister for Economic Warfare was considering a scheme forre-selling the coal to Italy if she were willing to buy it, and partly because of certain new information which had not been before theWar Cabinet on the previous day. Telegrams which had just beenreceived, and other information, suggested very strongly that theItalians had not been &quot; trailing their coats &quot; in ordering these ships to sail from Rotterdam, but that there had been a genuine misunder-standing. It seemed that a representative of the Coal Monopoly in rome had gained the impression from someone in the British

(40) 61stConclusions,Minute 1.)Attacks on shipping.Embassy there that we should not, in fact, stop ships carryingcargoes which had been paid for before the 1st March, and whichwould have sailed sooner but for the bad weather.If the Italians could make out a case on the score of such a misunderstanding for the release of these ships or some of them,he thought that it might be possible to make a bargain by which,in return, the Italian Government would undertake to send no moreships to fetch German coal.The Minister for Economic Warfare said that he had so far been intending to divert the ships at an early date to someconvenient port, the Italians being given to understand that this did not imply a decision to unload, but was being done so that, ifit were eventually decided to unload them, there should be no avoidable delay. This view was fundamentally in agreement withthat of the Foreign Secretary. He was also exploring the possi-bility of finding some way of dealing with these vessels more quickly,while exercising our full belligerent rights. He would naturallywelcome the conclusion of a bargain such as the Foreign Secretarysuggested. A question which immediately occurred to him was whether we or the Italians were to take the initiative.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Minister of Shipping had shown him a letter from a friendly Italian shipowner whichconfirmed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view that there had been a genuine misunderstanding on the part of the Italians in this matter.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had itin mind to approach the Italian Government, to say that we had some reason to think that there had been a misunderstanding in thecase of these particular ships and that, if so, we should be glad to listen to their complaint. He would then endeavour to secure ageneral arrangement for the future such as he had suggested.The Prime Minister said that this would be quite consistent with the decision of the War Cabinet on the previous day.The War Cabinet: (i) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to discuss this matter with representatives of the Italian Government,(ii) Reaffirmed the view that, provided a satisfactory generalarrangement could be reached with the Italian Govern-ment for the future, we could make some concession inregard to the coal ships that had already sailed fromRotterdam.(iii) Agreed that it was not desirable to divert elsewhere theItalian ships now detained in the Downs, so long as therewas reasonable prospect of making a satisfactory generalarrangement with the Italian Government, and leftdiscretion to the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Minister for Economic Warfare to reach adecision on this point.4. The Secretary of State for Air said that there had been little or no enemy air activity during daylight hours on the previous day. Beginning at dusk, however, there had been nine raidsbetween 7 p.m. and 8-30 p.m., involving at least 12 enemy aircraft,which had attacked shipping on the East Coast. Five of these raids had been in the Newcastle-Flamborough Head area. Two had beenoff Cromer, one off Spurn Head, and the remaining one in the Firthof Forth.Attacks on two convoys off Flamborough Head and Sunderlandhad been reported, and on two Lightships off Yarmouth. TheS.S. Rosedene had been attacked with bombs off Sunderland and was

An unknown ship off Hartlepool, theShelbrit off Aberdeen, and two ships off the Tyne had also been attacked, but detailed reports had not yet been received. Threefurther unidentified aircraft had been reported off the north foreland between midnight and 2 a.m. The difficulties of inter-ception in the dark were shown by the fact that 217 Fighter aircraft had been sent up without, however, gaining contact with the enemy.Two aircraft had carried out a flying reconnaissance into the heligoland Bight with a view to action being taken to prevent thesalvage of the submarine which had been attacked at Schillig on the4th March. The objective had not been reached as cloud cover haddissipated near Borkum. The aircraft had been attacked by twoMesserschmitt 110&apos;s, but the attack had been shaken off without incident.Reconnaissance of enemy seaplane bases in the heligoland bight had continued on the previous day, but had been abandonedlater owing to bad weather.Reconnaissances had been carried out during the previous nightby nine Bombers over Hamburg, Hanover, Bremen and Wilhelms-haven, during which leaflets had been dropped.Nine Fighter patrols had been carried out by British Air Forcesin France.The normal patrols had been carried out by Coastal Command.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 61stConclusions,Minute 3.)The western front.Finland.5. The Secretary of State for War read to the War cabinet a preliminary report which had been received at the War Office onthe raid which had taken place on the 5th March on part of the line in the Saar area held by a battalion of the Duke of Cornwall&apos;s LightInfantry as a result of which two of our posts had been capturedwith the loss of two killed and sixteen taken prisoner. This initialreport was somewhat disquieting.The Prime Minister said that he supposed that the raid hadbeen carried out for propaganda purposes.The Secretary of State for War agreed, and said that duringthe last war we had frequently carried out raids of this characterfor the sake of their moral value alone.In Finland no change of importance was reported. The fact,however, that the Russians had been able to attempt operationsacross the ice of the Gulf of Finland well to the West of Viborgcould not but add greatly to the anxieties of the Finnish high command.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.U.S.S.R.Visit of sir stafford Cripps.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 61stConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred again to Chungking telegrams Nos. 87, 88 and 89 of the 4th March, dealingwith Sir Stafford Cripps&apos; visit to Moscow and his conversation withM. Molotov. Sir Stafford Cripps had informed Sir Archibald ClarkKerr that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to pursue thequestion of a rapprochement with Russia, he would be willing toreturn, if desired, direct to London by air from China or Japan,instead of going on via the United States.
The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to reply to theeffect that Sir Stafford need not put himself to the trouble of flyingback, and might pursue his journey via the United States.The War Cabinet Agreed to the despatch of a message on the above lines.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 61stConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet of the latest develop-ments in the Finnish situation. A record of the ensuing discussion and of the Conclusions reached by the War Cabinet is contained inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 7, 1940.
