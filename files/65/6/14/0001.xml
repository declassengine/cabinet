Three 250-lb. bombs had been dropped, the nearest of whichhad fallen 45 feet over.

The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet certain particulars about the movements of the Fleet.The convoys were proceeding satisfactorily.A submarine reconnaissance flight round Ireland had beencarried out by two flying boats.An Empire flying-boat on a reconnaissance flight up theNorwegian coast had sighted the German S.S. Erika HendrichFisser (3,347 tons) off Molde, northward-bound in ballast.The anti-submarine trawler Peridot had been damaged by a mine off Dover early that morning. The crew had been taken off by another trawler and a tug had been sent out from Dover. Therehad been no casualties.News had just arrived that the Soviet .ship Mayakovsky hadbeen intercepted by one of our armed merchant cruisers off thenorth-east coast of Japan.In reply to the Prime Minister, the First Lord confirmed thatthere had recently been a considerable diminution of enemy attacks on shipping. A further cause for satisfaction was that merchantvessels were now arriving much more heavily laden.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 68thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that he had nothing of importance to report on the military situation.He informed the War Cabinet of certain movements which theWar Office would shortly be carrying out.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[21008]
Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 68thConclusions,Minute 4.)Policy withregard to public statements.4. The Chief of the Air Staff said that, while on political grounds we might have to tell the world the extent of the military assistance that the Allies had been prepared to render to Finland,from the military point of view it was most desirable that no details of our preparations should be disclosed. If such details were published the enemy would be able to check up his sources ofinformation. The Chiefs of Staff therefore hoped that no detailswould be given regarding troops, assembling of ships, naval escorts,and so forth.The Prime Minister agreed that details of our preparations should not be given, but thought that he would have to include in&apos;his statement to Parliament on the 19th March a statement in roundfigures of the size of the force.The War Cabinet expressed general agreement with these views.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 68thConclusions,Minute 5.)Stoppage ofmilitary supplies to Finland.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, as arranged at the previous meeting of the War Cabinet, he and theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence had seen M. Gripenberg theprevious evening and had put to him our desire to secure the return of the war material which we had sent to Finland. M. Gripenberg&apos;sreaction had been both immediate and unexpected. He had admitted that this matter should not be settled on questions of law; but hehad urged that the present peace was nothing but an armed truce,and that to take away this equipment would be a terrible blow to finland, which might at any time have to resume its struggle withthe CJ.S.S.R. If we were to press for the return of this material,Norway and Sweden might gain the impression that we weredeserting Finland.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been impressed by thispresentation of the case. He had asked M. Gripenberg not toreport the conversation to the Finnish Government until he had reported it to the War Cabinet. He was now disposed to think thatthe right course was to stop the despatch of war materials still inthis country, but to make no effort to secure the return of thatwhich had actually gone.The Secretary of State for War said that our Military attache in Sweden had reported that it was universally felt that the presentpeace was only a truce and that the Finnish General Staff expectedbefore long that Finland would once more be at war with theU.S.S.R.The First Lord of the A dmiralty thought that the Finns havingnow lost their strategic advantages would not be able to resume thestruggle. We should try to secure the return of all the war material(especially the aircraft and guns) which we had sent to Finland atso great a sacrifice to ourselves.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thought it possiblethat the Finnish Government might take a more moderate view onthe subject than M. Gripenberg had on the previous evening. Hesuggested therefore that we should remind the Finnish Governmentof the sacrifices we had made to send them this material, and should ask them to consider whether it was vital for the future securityof Finland that it should all be retained. It was only by persuasion,and by goodwill on the part of the Finnish Government, that wecould secure the return of any part of this material.The Prime Minister thought that we were not in a position to stop material now at sea or in transit in Scandinavia. We might:well, however, ask the Finnish Government themselves to returnsome of the material which had actually arrived in Finland.   He
had in mind, in particular the Hurricane and Blenheim aircraft.We should ascertain the line which the French Government proposedto take with regard to the material which they had sent to Finland,lest one Government should appear to be acting less generously thanthe other.The War Cabinet :-(a) Re-affirmed their decision to stop the despatch of warmaterial which had been destined for Finland, but whichwas still in this country.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs : (i) to ascertain from the French Government what action they had taken or proposed to take in order tosecure the return of French war material whichhad been despatched to Finland :(ii) to inform the Finnish Government that as regardswar material which had actually left this countryand was now in transit, we did not propose totake any steps to interfere with transit, but thatat an early date we proposed to invite the finnish government to return some of the most vital ofthe war material which we had supplied and,which we urgently required ourselves.(c) Deferred a final decision on the exact form of the substantiverequest to be made to the Finnish Government untilreplies had been received to the communications referredto in (b) above.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it hadbeen arranged that M. Corbin should see him that evening, to give him a personal message from M. Daladier. He asked whether he might mention to the French Ambassador the possibility of ameeting of the Supreme War Council being held in the near future.Such a meeting would be valuable at the present juncture, though he realised the objection to making this suggestion until a more definite decision had been taken about the subjects to be discussed.If a meeting was to be held, it should take place during thefollowing week, since otherwise, owing to Easter, it would be undulydelayed. On the question of date he only proposed to say toM. Corbin that he thought that a meeting should take place as soonas a convenient opportunity offered.The Prime Minister thought that a meeting of the supreme war Council at the present time would have a valuable effect andthat it should not be allowed to stand over until after Easter.The War Cabinet agreed : -That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, without making precise reference to dates Qr subjects for discussion,should indicate to M. Corbin that His &apos;Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment felt that an early meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil was desirable, and that they hoped thatM. Daladier would agree that on this occasion it shouldbe held in this country.7. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had had along talk the previous day with M. Colijn, who professed to beconfident that the Netherlands were not in immediate danger of invasion by Germany. Holland was now able to put up a farstronger defence than in November 1939. M, Colijn thought thewar would be a long 6ne, and had expressed the greatest pleasureSupreme WarCouncil.Proposal for ameeting.(previous reference:W.M.

(Previous in the action we had taken in regard to the Altmark.   He fullyReference:        accepted the views which the First Lord had expressed in a recentW.M. (40) 30th   speech as to neutrality, provided that all the neutrals acted together.Conclusions,      M. Colijn had also said that, at the outbreak of the war, he had minute 6.)        been invited to become Prime Minister again, but had refused, since he felt that public opinion in his country was then not sufficientlyattuned to his point of view on the subject of neutrality.  He under-stood that this offer would be renewed if his country was in danger.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that M. Colijn had told him that he had considered that he could render a greater service to his country by educating neutral opinion as to their duties intime of war, rather than by becoming Prime Minister last september. He had been emphatic in the opinion that the oldconceptions of neutrality were now out of date.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that M. Colijnhad spoken on similar lines to him, but had made it clear that he considered that some time would be needed to secure a change ofheart on the part of neutral Governments.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Italy. 8.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionRelations&quot; with to telegram No. 20, dated the 14th March, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;sGermany. Minister, the Vatican, reporting that he had been informed from(Previous a confidential source that Herr Hitler was not at all satisfied withReference:        the results of Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s visit to Rome, and had,W.M. (40) 65th therefore, proposed to Signor Mussolini a personal meeting on conclusions,      Italian soil at the end of the week; that this proposal had been minute 5.)        accepted; and that Signor Mussolini would be accompanied bySignor Anfuso, but not by Count Ciano.   The Foreign Secretarydoubted this report, and said that on the last occasion the informa-tion received from this source had been wrong.   If, however, thereport proved to be true, it probably presaged not only trouble forus, but also trouble in Italy.The Prime Minister doubted whether Herr Hitler and signor mussolini would make a concerted peace move at the very moment when Mr. Sumner Welles was on his way back to Washington. Hethought it likely, however, that Signor Mussolini would askMr. Welles whether he thought that there was any prospect of theAllies agreeing to a negotiated peace; that Mr. Welles would reply that the attitude of the Allies was very stiff; and that Mr. Welleswould then indicate the conditions which would have to be fulfilledif there was to be any prospect of peace. The Duce might then consider whether such terms were likely to be acceptable to Germany.This would take time, and the Prime Minister did not thereforebelieve that any spectacular development was likely in the immediatefuture, even if Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini were to meet.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.The Coal 9-   The Prime Minister said that the London VigilanceSituation. Committee,   comprising,   amongst   others,   Mr.   Shinwell   and-.   &apos; Mr. Herbert Morrison, had been to see him on the previous day to reference-        discuss questions of coal.   The deputation appreciated that allW Me(40) 63rd PosslDle steps were being taken to deal with the position.Conclusions, The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to reports of largeMinute 9.)        numbers of empty coal trucks standing in sidings.   He had alsobeen told that several ships were now lying idle in South Walesports waiting to be laden with coal.
India- 10.   The War Cabinet offered their warm congratulations to congress and the Secretary of State for India on his miraculous escape at thethe war. meeting at Caxton Hall on the 13th March, when, at the close of(Previous the meeting, he had been shot at from a distance of a few feet.Reference: The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by theW.M. (40) 30th Secretary of State for India (W.P. (G.) (40) 73 and 74).    TheConclusions, recommendations made in the concluding paragraph of the formerMinute 4.) Memorandum (somewhat abbreviated) were as follows : (a) A purely negative policy in the face of the definite break with the Congress which now seems likely is, in any case,unlikely to serve for long.(b) To issue at this moment a threat in the terms proposed bythe Home Member in the draft communique attachedto the Viceroy&apos;s telegram would be highly inexpedient.(c) It is of great and increasingly urgent importance, if weare to retain the goodwill of the Muslims, the Princesand the smaller minorities, to make it clear to them andthe Congress that we decline to regard the latter as representing the whole of India.(d) A positive policy is essential, if only for the purpose of retaining the goodwill of neutral countries, andparticularly of the United States of America, as acounterweight to the repressive action we should haveto take against civil disobedience.(e) There is no hope of a peaceable settlement of our constitu-tional relations with India if these relations and theIndian Constitution itself are to be dictated to India,or even to have the appearance of being dictated, in thelast resort by the British Government and Parliament.(/) The Secretary of State asked for authority to send the lineof policy indicated in Appendix &quot; C &quot; to the Governor-General for his comments.(g) The announcement of this policy ought not to be delayedbeyond the outbreak or the serious threat of disorder;the right moment for its announcement might well occurbefore.(h) The announcement might be made, in the first instance, toa small conference representative of all the leadinginterests in India to be summoned by the Governor-General, publication following immediately thereafter.- (i) If the Governor-General feels, and has support for his view,that progress with the plan would be facilitated by the speedy inauguration of the Federal provisions of theAct, he should be free to do what he can to secure it.(j) Meanwhile, whatever his views on the larger questions ofpolicy, he should be invited to reconsider the expediency of appointing representative Indians to his ExecutiveCouncil and proceed with it even if, as is almost certain,the Congress maintains its refusal to co-operate.The Lord Privy Seal said that similar reports which had reached him at the beginning of the week had been found onanalysis to be very much exaggerated. The position was being held,but we should have no margin to fall back on until the cold weatherceased.The previous day it had been decided at a meeting of Ministers,over which he had presided, that the present measures of priorityafforded to coal for domestic and industrial purposes should becontinued until the end of the month.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
In the course of an opening statement, the Secretary of Statefor India said that, while on essential matters of principle his views were unchanged, his present proposals represented a somewhat different method of approach.The Working Committee of the Indian National Congress had now framed a resolution reiterating in uncompromising terms theassertion that nothing short of complete independence would beaccepted by the people of India; that Dominion status or any otherstatus within the Imperial structure was wholly inapplicable toIndia; and that the people of India alone could properly shapetheir Constitution and determine their relations with othercountries through a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult suffrage. The resolution concluded with the statement that civil disobedience was the natural sequence to the preliminary stepof the withdrawal of Congress Ministries, and that Congress wouldresort to this step as soon as their organisation was considered fitor circumstances necessitated it. This resolution would come beforethe All-India Congress Committee at Ramgarh on the. following monday, the 18th March. After that, probably on the 19th March,,it would be submitted for approval to a full meeting of Congress.The draft resolution was of course totally unacceptable.In particular, it was fantastic to suggest that adult suffrageshould be the basis of election to the body which was to shape India&apos;future Constitution. He had already endeavoured to make that point clear in a recent public statement, and had, as a result, been described by Mr. Gandhi as having &quot; slammed the door.&quot; Theomens, therefore, were sufficiently unfavourable. Nevertheless, theSecretary of State found himself unable to accept the Viceroy&apos;opinion that our course ought to be to wait upon events, and thatthere was no necessity for considering any modification of the offer which we had already made to associate representative Indian publicmen with the Central Government in the prosecution of the war orfor taking any step at present towards implementing that offer in whole or in part.The Secretary of State considered that our offer ought to stand,quite apart from any expectation that it might serve to bring theConstitutional deadlock to an end. The fact that the congress party had declined to associate itself with this offer did not,however, afford any reason for denying such association to therepresentatives of other political parties. It ought to be made clear to Congress that, while we recognised them as a powerful political party, we could not accept their claim to speak for India as a whole.There were very considerable sections of responsible Indian opinion which, while in disagreement with Congress policy, were willingand anxious to take part in an advance towards fuller self-government. He was not thinking only of the Muslim community.Large sections of Hindus also held these views. The Secretary ofState instanced the Hindu representatives, such as Sir Tej BahadurSapru, who had taken part in the Round Table Conferences. Itwas our duty to make it plain to those sections of opinion that wewere willing to satisfy their legitimate aspirations.In his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) view the plan should be, whenthe appropriate moment arrived, for the Viceroy to summon a smallconference representative of opinion in British India and the States,,and to expound to that conference, in the first instance, the proposals contained in Appendix &quot; C &quot; to his Paper. Those proposals were,briefly, that an All-India body should be set up to prepare a constitution for India as a separate member of the British Common-wealth of Nations. That body would have to contain suchrepresentation of the Indian States and of the minority communitiesas was accepted by the States and the minorities; the method ofselecting its membership, and the process by which it was to reachits conclusions, would also have to be agreed by the Indian interests concerned.   When it had reached conclusions covering the whole
ground, but in any event not earlier than the conclusion of peace,this body would appoint representatives to meet representatives ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to negotiate an agreement. If the British and Indian representatives reached agreement on the plan, with or without modification, propounded bythe constituent body, their conclusions would be put to parliament and to the constitutional body in India for ratification. It wouldhave to be made clear, however, that there were certain matters(with which the War Cabinet were familiar) relating to the defenceof India as part of the Empire, the service of the sterling debt, therights of the Services, &amp;c, as to which we were entitled to ask for security.The first stage in the course of action proposed would be toset up the preparatory conference. That conference might be invited by the Viceroy to discuss the proposals in Appendix C and toset in motion machinery to give effect to them.The meeting of the preparatory conference might be the occasion for making it clear that we were unable to accept the claim of congress to speak for India. The conference would have to be told that no further progress towards full self-government could takeplace, except on the basis of substantial agreement between thevarious Indian communities and parties. It was up to them toreach a modus vivendi.In discussion, the question was raised whether it would, in fact,be possible to make a further approach to Congress immediatelyafter the meeting at Ramgarh on the assumption that at that meeting Congress had adopted a resolution of a completely unaccept-able character, absolutely refusing to consider Dominion status orany other status within the Imperial structure. If Congress werenot approached, or if they once again declined to co-operate, could we go ahead without them? If we did so, would it be consistent with the principle laid down in Appendix C that the absence ofprior agreement among Indians themselves is an impassable barrierin the way of self-government and an obstacle which only they canremove ?The Secretary of State for India thought that it might bepossible to proceed with the preparatory conference, even in the face of another refusal to co-operate on the part of Congress. whether we could proceed further would have to depend on events, and inparticular on the actions of Congress, both at and after the Ramgarhmeeting.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he could not see thatadherence to the policy embodied in the Act of 1935 and the furtheroffers which we had already made since the war began could fairly be described as a policy of negation or inaction. In his view, theViceroy had previously been too ready to feel that he must at every stage endeavour to secure agreement with Mr. Gandhi. The Viceroynow felt disposed to take a stronger line, and it was our business tosupport him, rather than to give him a strong lead to make further concessions, which would only lead to further demands by Congress.In any case, he doubted whether the reservations included on thelast page of the proposals embodied in the Secretary of State&apos;Appendix C were consistent with the safeguards for Britishinterests which the Government had promised in Parliament tomaintain.The Secretary of State for India said that there was no questionof overruling the Viceroy, but only of putting a plan to him, andinviting his comments. Reference was made in this connection to paragraph 7 of the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the Viceroy,in paragraph 18 of his telegram of the 8th March (printed as appendix A to the Memorandum), had expressed the view that[21008] c
moderate opinion in India had very largely lost sympathy with theexaggerated claims of Congress, and was, in fact, apprehensive thatwe might go further to meet Congress claims. He thought that theSecretary of State&apos;s proposals would, in fact, be represented as another effort to conciliate Congress. Further, the Viceroy, inparagraph 27 of the same telegram, expressed himself very strongly in favour of &quot; taking no action and of lying back.&quot; The Chancellorsupported this view. The meeting of Congress at Ramgarh was totake place in a few days&apos; time, and he urged that we should acceptthe Viceroy&apos;s suggestion and wait for his further report in the lightof the Ramgarh proceedings. They would probably produce an intolerable resolution, and he would be sorry if the next step takenby the Government thereafter should be a mild invitation whichwould provide another opportunity for talks between Mr. gandhi and the Viceroy. Surely the better line would be to say quite bluntlythat the claims of Congress were all nonsense ?The Lord Privy Seal said that he saw a number of objectionsto the policy of taking no initiative. There was hardly an Indian in public life who would support the policy of continuing to leave thegovernment of India in the hands of officials. Civil disobedience, ifit were to come during the course of the war, would be a very great danger. We were more dependent than ever on India for supplies,and a general strike, with a consequent interference in India&apos;output of steel, would have very serious consequences. It might bevery dangerous to let things drift until, at the end of the war, ourrelations with India were like those with Ireland at the end of thelast war. Opinion among the public and in the House of Commonswas opposed to resolute action, and the result might be a most fortunate collapse. We might also perhaps find that we were making difficulties for ourselves at the peace negotiations if theworld at large considered that we were to blame for India&apos;s failure to progress towards self-government. For all these reasons hethought it important to make some effort now to bring out the factthat the responsibility for India&apos;s future lay with Indians them-selves. He could see no objection to putting the Secretary of State&apos;sproposals to the Viceroy for his consideration in addition to thepossibilities which he had already considered.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he regarded it as an entirely reasonable proposal that representativesof the various Indian parties should be brought together to workout a constitutional programme which we would hope to implement.In fact, he thought that such a policy was not very different from what had been announced by the Government before he had enteredon his term as Viceroy. He was not clear whether the Viceroy had,in fact, had before him as an alternative a policy such as that suggested by the Secretary of State in his Appendix C; if not,he thought it would be useful to invite his comments on theseproposals, but that they should not be put before him as favoured by the War Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Air said that, if Congress passed the expected resolution in the following week, it would be taken as a great sign of weakness on our part if they were then invitedto send representatives to a further meeting as proposed by theSecretary of State.The Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India said thatthe course of action proposed, so far from encouraging Congress,would be taken as a serious rebuff, since it would make quite plain that we did not accept the claims of Congress to represent India.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that, as he understood it, the War Cabinet were not being asked to consider any change in policy, but the question of the best tactics to adopt
113 W.M. 68 (40), ,      83in handling the immediate situation in India. He did not anticipate any early return to violence, but we had to face the factthat even those Indians who did not accept the claims of congress would not openly support the British Government in opposition to congress. We had to show that we meant to live up to the offerswe had made, and to give Indians an opportunity of showing thatthey were opposed to the claims of Congress without appearing tobe subservient to the British Government. He would, therefore,support the proposal that the Viceroy should be asked to give hisopinion on some procedure such as had been suggested by theSecretary of State, more particularly as he thought that the Viceroywould find it difficult to maintain his present attitude and wouldbefore long be looking for some easement of the position vis-a-visCongress.Discussion followed as to the exact procedure contemplated inthe proposals under discussion. The Secretary of State for Indiasaid that he had in mind to call an informal Conference of repre-sentative Indians, as a convenient means of making the proposed announcement of policy. He assumed that Congress would beinvited to send representatives, but that they would not accept. Onthe question whether it would be possible to proceed with the next stage of a body to discuss constitutional plans, he could only saythat it was not possible to look so far ahead. It was generally felt, however, that, if Congress were to boycott the suggestedmeetings, it would not be possible to take the matter further. Itwould be impossible to claim that a body from which Congress was absent could secure agreement between all important sections of theIndian people.The Secretary of State for War said that he would consider it very objectionable to invite Congress to send representatives at allif they passed the resolution which were to be put before them atRamgarh; even to issue such an invitation would imply that wewere ready to consider constitutional proposals for India on thebasis adopted by Congress.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Viceroy had proposedto submit a further report on the general situation after theRamgarh Conference. In the circumstances, it seemed best to await that report before deciding on the next step.The War Cabinet-Decided to defer a decision on the Secretary of State forIndia&apos;s proposals pending receipt of the further reportpromised by the Viceroy after the Ramgarh Conference.british expeditionary force.Supply oflabour.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 119thConclusions,Minute 1.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (G.) (40) 78) on the Supply ofLabour for the British Expeditionary Eorce.The Secretary of State for War said that, in order to make good the shortage of labour from which the B.E.F. in France wassuffering, he proposed, inter alia, (i) as a temporary measure, tosend portions of three of the Divisions which would not be required as such for the B.E.F. for many months and use them for labourduties,, and (ii) to allow young men in the age groups 18-19 to enlist voluntarily in the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps.During the course of the discussion the following points were raised : (1) Was such a large force of labour required permanently inFrance when much of the work, such as the constructionof aerodromes, roads and railways, was not of a continuing nature?
(2) The desirability of enlisting youths of 18 and 19 for this work was questioned. It was suggested that such work would be a great tax on their strength and mightadversely affect their mental outlook.(3) The Minister of Labour doubted whether a voluntary appealto the 18-19 groups would produce the numbers hoped for by the Secretary of State for War. The estimategiven in paragraph 14 of the Memorandum that therewere between 40,000 and 50,000 unemployed between the ages of 18 and 20 was, he thought, too high.(4) The Secretary of State for War called attention to the urgency of the matter and said, in reply to the criticism that the army machine was not sufficiently mobile, thatthe proportion of troops behind the line was no greater in the B.E.F. now than it had been in the last war.Owing to the air menace, the depots behind the line hadto be spread out and the number of ports used was alsogreater. This added considerably to the amount oflabour required.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Military Co-ordination Committee to considerthe Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War, as amatter of urgency, and to report to the War Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 15, 1940.
