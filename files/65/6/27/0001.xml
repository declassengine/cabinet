Afghanistan.(previous references:W.M. (39) 12thConclusions,Minute 1, andW.M. (40) 66thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a joint&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for India on Afghanistan (W.P. (G.) (40) 94).The Secretary of State for India said that the memorandum had been prepared as a result of the discussion in the War Cabinetin September 1939 as to the attitude which we should adopt towardsAfghanistan, if that country was threatened or attacked by Russia.The proposals in the Memorandum summarised in paragraph 17 were based on the assumption that we should maintain our traditional policy of preserving the integrity of Afghanistan as abuffer State.The immediate question was what assurance we should give to afghanistan, and what steps we should be prepared to take to implement that assurance. On these points there was somedifference in the view taken by himself and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, supported by the Chiefs of Staff on the onehand, and that taken by the Government of India on the otherhand. The former view was that the Afghan Government shouldbe given an immediate secret assurance that, in a clear case ofRussian aggression, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be preparedto give them all the assistance in their power, including theimmediate provision of some measure of assistance by land forces from India, in addition to air support; though they could not undertake an obligation for the military defence of the northern frontier of Afghanistan (see paragraph 17 (3) of W.P. (G.) (40) 94).The view of the Government of India on the other hand wasthat, whilst they agreed that we should give the Afghans an assurance of help, they excluded the possibility of sending landor air forces into Afghanistan itself, and proposed that we should confine our assistance to offensive air action against Soviet bases and lines of communication by aircraft operating from bases inIndia and/or the Middle East, and to the provision of armaments and technical advice (Appendix II to W.P. (G.) (40) 94).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, referring to paragraphs 15 and 17 (7) of the Memorandum, said that he would prefer that we should not thrust on the Afghans an offer of an open agreement of mutual assistance, which might be distasteful tothem on account of their fear of the Russians.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that the casus fozderiswould be likely to prove difficult. The circumstances calling forour action might in the event prove far less clear-cut than wassuggested in paragraph 17 (3). The Russians would be far more likely to seek their ends by fomenting internal trouble in afghanistan.The Secretary of State also stressed the importance of propaganda, and was informed that the necessary steps in this connexion were being taken by the Government of India.The Prime Minister said that the value of any assurance we gave rested in the fact that it would stiffen the attitude of theAfghan Government towards Russia by giving them the knowledge that they could rely on our support. The nature and extent of that support must, however, be left to us to decide, according to thecircumstances, when the time came.The Secretary of State for War said that it was important toensure that the Government of India should have behind them themeans of implementing any pledge which we might give to the afghans. The troops at present in India were required for internal security purposes, with the exception of a division earmarked forthe protection of the Anglo-Iranian oilfields.The Secretary of State for India said that this point had been covered by the recommendations in the last part of paragraph 17 (4) :
&quot; that the Government of India should be requested to prepare toundertake such minimum measures and should be consulted as tothe form which they should take,&quot; and also by the recommendation in paragraph 17 (5) : &quot;that the Chiefs of Staff should be askedto reconsider urgently the problem of British support forAfghanistan on the basis of the policy proposed.&quot; In this connexion,he suggested that the Chiefs of Staff might consider whether india could be reinforced by withdrawing some of the troops now at singapore.The Prime Minister asked whether the position in India mightnot be relieved by the substitution of Dominion troops for theIndian Division which was at present earmarked for Iran if theneed arose. The essence of the problem, however, was that we should prepare the ground by taking all proper precautionary steps againsta contingency which/at the moment, he did not regard as alarming.The Chief of the A ir Staff suggested that, as a preliminary stepto the report which the Chiefs of Staff would submit in accordancewith paragraph 17 (5) of the Memorandum, the Government ofIndia should be asked for their views as to the form which Britishsupport for Afghanistan might take.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that it should be placedon record that the decisions taken that morning by the War cabinet were without prejudice to the question of the provision of creditsdealt with in paragraph 6 of Appendix II to the Memorandum.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet agreed (1) That it should be accepted as an essential part of the polic)rof His Majesty&apos;s Government that, in the event ofRussian aggression against Afghanistan, support mustbe given to the Afghan Government by all the means inour power.(2) That the Afghan Government should at once be given an assurance that, in the event of action by Soviet foi-cesdirected against the independence or integrity of afghanistan, His Majesty&apos;s Government would beprepared to give them all the assistance in their power,including, in the event of invasion by Soviet forces, theimmediate provision of some measure of assistance byland and air forces from India (though they could not undertake an obligation for the military defence of thenorthern frontier of Afghanistan).(3) That the views of the Afghan Government should again beinvited on the question of the conclusion of an overtagreement on the lines approved by the Cabinet inSeptember 1939.(4) That the Government of India should immediately be consulted as to the minimum measures which thatGovernment considered that they could themselves take in the event of Russian aggression in order to strengthenAfghan morale, and as an earnest of their intentions;and that they should be requested to undertake these measures without delay.(5) That the Secretary of State for India should inform theGovernment of India that the Chiefs of Staff were being asked to reconsider urgently the problem of Britishsupport for Afghanistan on the basis of the policy proposed in (1) above, and to report on the best meansof providing such sources as might be required for effective co-operation in the defence of SouthernAfghanistan, or for the replacement of such forces as were made available from India for this purpose; and
to request the Government of India to submit their viewson the nature and extent of the forces which Britishsupport for Afghanistan might involve, basis forthe Chiefs of Staff Report.(6) That, on receipt of the reply of the Government of India,the Chiefs of Staff should immediately prepare a Report-in accordance with (5) above.(7) That the Government of India should be consulted on thequestion of raising levies of our tribesmen for service in afghanistan if required.(8) That the decisions taken under (1) to (7) above should be without prejudice to the grant of credits to the AfghanGovernment for the purchase of commercial goods andmilitary equipment.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 81stConclusions,Minute 4.)Attacks onGermanwarships.2. The Chief of the Air Staff said that two German ships,thought to be battle-cruisers, had been sighted at anchor in theSchillig Roads on the previous morning. Six bombers had been dispatched to attack them, one of which had carried out an attackon a ship thought to be either a battle-cruiser or a cruiser. Fourbombs had been dropped, one of which had fallen fairly close to theship, but no direct hits had been observed. Another of our aircraft had bombed a ship which was probably a destroyer, but again no hits were claimed. Our aircraft had reported some 50 or 60 ships,presumably mine-sweepers and anti submarine craft, in the heligoland Bight, steaming northward.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 81stConclusions,Minute 5.)German naval dispositions.3. The Chief of Naval Staff said that, in the opinion of theAdmiralty, the ships in the Schillig Roads (see Minute 2) were probably the German battle-cruisers. Judging by the fact that nosubmarines appeared to be operating at the moment on the trade routes, it seemed probable that the German surface vessels were taking up dispositions to deal with possible operations by our ships off the coast of Norway.Enemy air attacks on shipping had been as follows : Fishing  trawler  Gorspen,  off the  Shetlands,  attacked by aircraft and seriously damaged.   Crew saved.Fishing trawler (unknown), in the same area.    Bombed and sunk.  No survivors.Two trawlers attacked off Fair Island with bombs and machine guns.  Seriously damaged.German aircraft appeared increasingly reluctant to attackconvoys or ships from which effective anti-aircraft fire might beexpected.A raft with one corpse, apparently from the Finnish S.S. Signe(1,540 tons), had been found off Fair Island. The S.S. Signe had sailed from Gothenburg on the 30th March to join a homeward-bound Norwegian convoy, but had failed to do so.Air attacks on shipping.
4. The Secretary of State for War said that he had nothing to report.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 8.1stConclusions,Minute 6.)Scandinavia.german intentions.(previous reference.- Telegram No. 161, D1PP, dated 4th Anril   iQin n-W.M. (40) 80th Majesty&apos;s Minister, Stockholm:- P   &apos; 1940&apos; from HlsConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following Telegrams on the subject of German intentionstowards Scandinavia : Mr. Mallet reported that Herr Weizsacker had expressedthe view that the Swedish Government under-estimated thedanger from the Allies in North Sweden. He had refused todiscuss the German concentration of troops on the grounds thatit was a military secret. In forwarding this report,Mr. Mallet added that the Swedish Government still believedthat German troops would not be used except as a counterstroketo Allied action. According to the latest information, theGerman troops were not being kept on board ship, but at timesthey practised embarkation.Telegram No. 247, dated 4th April, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;minister, Helsingfors : Mr. Vereker reported that the Finnish Prime Minister had said that he was sure that any action taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment inside Norwegian Territorial Waters would befollowed by retaliatory action by the German Government inSwedish Waters. He expected that, apart perhaps from smallshipments from Petsamo, Finnish exports to the UnitedKingdom and North America would in the near future onlybe possible over the Scandinavian land route. If he were inthe position of His Majesty&apos;s Government, he would occupy a norwegian harbour in the Skagerrak; the Norwegians wouldprotest energetically, but secretly they would be relieved. Asthe representative of a small nation which must be able to count upon an Allied victory, the Finnish Prime Ministerconsidered that the only escape from the present situation wasthe adoption of a less scrupulous attitude on the part of theAllied Governments.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Supreme WarCouncil: 6thMeeting.Royal marine operation.proposed action in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 81stConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprevious day Sir Ronald Campbell had reported that M. Reynauddid not favour the despatch by the Prime Minister of a personal message to M. Daladier on the subject of the Royal marine operation, since he thought that this would only strengthenM. Daladier&apos;s position (Telegram No. 87 DIPP from Paris). Ithad then been arranged that the First Lord of the Admiralty should go at once to Paris and try to persuade M. Daladier to withdraw his opposition. The First Lord and M. Reynaud had dined at the embassy on the previous night, and had had a long talk. (TelegramNo. 88 DIPP from Paris.) Arrangements had been made for theFirst Lord to see M. Daladier that morning, and in the eveningM. Reynaud would give a dinner at which M. Daladier and theFirst Lord would be present. If the First Lord, succeeded in his mission, the two Operations would go forward together. The FirstLord suggested, however, that if he failed to move M. Daladier,he should be authorised, at an appropriate moment during the
dinner that evening, to inform the French Ministers that, whileowing to their opposition the Royal Marine Operation would not becarried out now, none the less we had decided to go forward withthe Operation in Norwegian Territorial Waters. In reporting thisproposal Sir Ronald Campbell had added that he felt fairly sure that M. Reynaud&apos;s days would be numbered if we did not carry outthe latter Operation.The Foreign Secretary said that, while the War Cabinet wouldregret a decision being influenced by French internal politics, it was essential to secure co-operation between MM. Reynaud andDaladier; for if M. Reynaud fell, and was replaced by M. Daladier,it was inevitable that a period of internal difficulty would follow in France. The bad effects which would follow a disturbance in theFrench political field, coupled with the general psychologicalposition, constituted perhaps the most weighty factors in a verydifficult situation. For these reasons he felt that it would be extremely difficult to abandon the Norwegian Territorial WatersOperation. It must not be overlooked that the aide-memoire whichwe had submitted to the French at the Supreme War Council hadbeen put forward as an alternative to the policy proposed by theFrench Government; in our minds the Norwegian territorial waters Operation had always been associated (a) with the royal marine Operation and (b) with the possibility later of interruptingsea-borne trade from Lulea. It now looked as though the royal marine Operation would have to be postponed, and the prospectivebalance-sheet if we carried out the Norwegian Operation alone,was not attractive. The War Cabinet were familiar with the factors in this balance-sheet. Nevertheless, it was difficult to disregard the psychological importance of taking this action at the presenttime. If, therefore, the War Cabinet remained in favour ofcarrying out this Operation, he would accept that decision, although he had never concealed his doubts as to the wisdom of the operation in Norwegian Territorial Waters.The Prime Minister said that the First Lord of the admiralty would make his attempt to win over M. Daladier when he saw him that morning. Apart from the general decision to be taken, thequestion was, therefore, whether at the dinner that evening theFirst Lord should tell the French our intentions on the subject ofthe Norwegian Operation.As regards the general question, the Prime Minister had always desired to see the two Operations carried out simultaneously,partly because attention would thereby to some extent be deflectedfrom our violation of Norwegian neutrality, but primarily becausethe Royal Marine Operation was a vigorous and aggressive action,and would be accepted as such by the world at large. The war inits present phase was largely psychological, and in world opinionpoints won or gained by the two sides were measured in psycho-logical terms. This tended to set a false standard of values, but itwas a situation of which account must be taken. From this pointof view, the Royal Marine Operation would have told heavily in our favour.He did not believe that M. Daladier would withdraw hisopposition. What, then, would be the position if we were now todo nothing ? The utmost publicity had been given to the meetingof the Supreme War Council attended by the Head of the newFrench Government, formed to secure a more vigorous prosecution of the war. It was true that no definite statement in authorisedterms had been issued committing the Allies to new courses ofaction; but in various ways we had deliberately allowed. it to be known that we contemplated such action. All these indications hadbeen in the direction of our stopping the supply if iron ore toGermany from Scandinavia. If we were now to do nothing, theresult would be most unfortunate from the psychological point of
view.   He was, therefore, definitely in favour of carrying throughthe Norwegian Territorial Waters Operation.As to the possible repei-cussions of this action, the PrimeMinister agreed that it was unlikely that the supply of iron orefor Germany which we should intercept by the proposed operation would be very substantial. We should, however, gain importantadvantages from the psychological point of view. In the first place,,there was the deferred gain to which, however, too much importance should not be attached that we should have secured apoint on the Norwegian coast to which later we should be able toextend the eastern end of the Northern Barrage. Further, if in factwe did not cut off important supplies from Germany by this action,Germany would not suffer material injury and would be unlikely to be tempted to take dangerous retaliatory action; for it must berealised that any action which Germany might take in retaliationwould cause injury to Germany (through increasing fuel consump-tion, through the dislocation caused by the movement of troops, &amp;c),and would, moreover, give us ample justification for sending an expedition to Scandinavia. On this part of the question, he believed,therefore, that the German Government would take no retaliatory action. He thought that they were more likely to claim that theOperation had been carried through too late to do them any injury,to declare that it constituted an impudent attack on neutral rights,and to announce their intention of redoubling their attacks on british shipping.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister without portfolio expressed their concurrence with these views, and thelatter added that the laying of the proposed mine fields would havethe additional advantage of tightening our blockade in northern waters. Moreover, Lulea was open for only seven months of theyear; and Germany would now know that in future, once Lulea was again closed by ice, they could hope for no further supplies from narvik.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs, who had been called to the telephone to speak to the First Lord of the admiralty in Paris, then gave to the AVar Cabinet the substance of the conver-sation. The First Lord had discussed the Royal Marine Operationwith M. Daladier, and had been convinced by the French arguments that a serious risk would be run if the Operation took place now.In three months&apos; time the French would have been able to take thenecessary security measures in connection with their &quot; aviation.&quot;The First Lord felt strongly that it would be a very great mistake to try to force the French to fall in with our wishes. If serious damage to their interests resulted from such action, it might be amortal blow to the Alliance. The French were, however, preparedto give us a firm date, in writing, for the initiation of the royal marine Operation. M. Daladier had been very gratified to receivethe message from the Prime Minister which the First Lord hadconveyed, but it was disappointing to find that he had refusedM. Reynaud&apos;s invitation to dinner to meet the. First Lord. TheFirst Lord had referred to this refusal in his conversation withM. Daladier, and, though the latter had stuck to his excuse of a previous engagement, he had assured the First Lord that the periodof political crises was past and that he would work in harmony withM. Reynaud.The Foreign Secretary had informed the First Lord that theWar Cabinet had decided to proceed with the Operation in norwegian Territorial Waters. The First Lord had renewed therequest made in telegram No. 88 DIPP, from Paris, that he shouldbe authorised to inform M. Reynaud of our decision that evening.Discussion ensued as to whether it would be desirable thatour decision to proceed with the Operation should be communicatedat once to the French.   It was agreed that in deciding to proceed
with this operation, while acquiescing in the postponement of theRoyal Marine Operation, we were making a great concession to french wishes. M. Reynaud would be placed under a deep-obligation to the Prime Minister, who had pressed strongly thatthe two Operations should be simultaneous and complementary.It was felt that, in the circumstances, a more formalcommunication should be made to the French Government than a message conveyed to M. Reynaud by the First Lord at a dinner-party. Further, in view of the impending Debate in the FrenchSenate on the 9th April, and of the desirability that the Frenchand British Notes should be presented about the same time to theNorwegian and Swedish Governments, the sooner we let the Frenchknow of our intentions the better. Moreover, if the news wereconveyed at once, it might be possible for French vessels toparticipate in the Operation, or at least in the subsequent patrols.Discussion then turned on the various aspects relating to thetime-table of the proposed Operation. Particulars of the discussion,and of the Conclusions reached, are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet: (1) Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to instruct our Ambassador in Paris forthwith to informthe French Government as follows : (a) That, notwithstanding the great importance whichwe had throughout attached to carrying out theRoyal Marine Operation at an early date and simultaneously with the proposed Operation in norwegian Territorial Waters, we were, never-theless, prepared, as a concession to their wishes,to proceed with the latter alone.(b) The French Government should also be informed ofthe date on which it was intended to carry outthe proposed Operation, and emphasis laid on theimportance of secrecy, since leakage of our intentions might make it impossible to carry outthe proposed Operation.(c) The French Government should also be invited toprovide some naval forces to co-operate with theBritish forces in the carrying out of theOperation, or at least in the subsequent patrols.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for the British and French Notes to be presented to the Governments of Norway and Sweden, either that afternoon or on the following day.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,April 5, 1940.
