The AjrSituation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 58thConclusions,Minute 1.)Reported new type of Germanbomber.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there had been little enemy activity on the previous clay. Earlier in the morningtwo unidentified aircraft had been plotted off the East Coast.Fighters had been sent up but had failed to intercept.One of our Hudsons had unfortunately been shot down by ourown fighters in the Thames Estuary and the crew of 5 had been killed.A Heinkel 111 had been shot down by our fighters nearSaarbriicken.The First Lord of the Admiralty alluded to a report that theGermans had designed a bomber which would be capable of crossingthis country at a height of 35,000 feet.The Secretary of State for Air said that he would investigatethis report, which&apos; had already come to his notice.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Naval 2.

Domala (8,441 tons). The ship was nowW.M. (40) 58th anchored in Yarmouth Roads, but was still burning. The ship had conclusions, carried a total of 301 passengers and crew, including 143 LascarMinute 2.) passengers returning from Germany; 102 were missing, includingAttacks on        two European women.shipping. The Italian S.S. Mirella, previously reported as mined ortorpedoed on the 1st March, had now sunk.Enemy attacks on shipping were as follows : March 2.S.S. Albano (1,176 tons) sunk by an explosion, probably a mine.   Two dead.Swedish S.S. Lagaholm (2,818 tons) set on fire and sunk.Crew saved.Dutch S.S.

Cato, ports in the bristol channel east of Swansea had been temporarily closed.News had been received of the interception of a number ofGerman ships. All except one had been scuttled. Particulars were as follows : February 28.German S.S. Wangoni (from Vigo) intercepted by H.M.Submarine Triton off the Norwegian coast, but escaped undercover of darkness owing to superior speed. This was the onlyone of the six German ships from Vigo which had succeeded in returning to Germany.March 2.German S-S. Wolfsburg (6,201 tons; from Pernambuco onthe 2nd February) intercepted by H.M.S.

March 3.German S.S. Arucas intercepted by H.M.S. York on northern Patrol. Scuttled. Weather too bad for boarding.Forty-two of crew saved, 15 drowned.The French ship S.N.A. 1 (2,679 tons) had been in collision offLand&apos;s End. The ship was still afloat and the crew had beentaken off.The Norwegian convoys were proving extremely popular. Theoutgoing convoy consisted of 81 ships and was being sailed in two separate portions. The incoming convoy consisted of 31 ships; thegreat majority were neutral vessels. In all, there were. some400 ships in convoy off our coasts.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 58thConclusions,Minute 2.)The western front.Finland.3. The Secretary of State for War said that one new GermanDivision had been identified in Austria and two more in the centre,thus increasing the total from 157 to 160 Divisions.There had been very little change in the Military situation in finland. The expected fall of Viborg did not yet seem to havetaken place. This was all to the good, as every day&apos;s delay gave the finns more chance of completing satisfactorily the preparations oftheir next line of defence, which lay to the north of Viborg. Therehad, however, been indications that the Russians were penetrating-just north-east of the city, which might bring them very close to thenew Finnish line.The new Military Attache had been due to see Field-marshal mannerheim on the previous day, and further news could thereforebe expected in a report which should arrive that day.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.India.Operations onthe North-west frontier.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 34thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. Attention was drawn to reports that we had suffered lossesamounting to 15 killed and 14 wounded in the course of theoperations in the Ahmadzai Salient. It was recalled that theSecretary of State for India had stated that if raids and ambusheswent unpunished, the Government of India would be faced withhaving to carry out a much larger and more difficult operation in less favourable conditions. Further, the War Cabinet, when autho-rising the operation, had invited the Secretary of State for India&quot; when conveying this approval to the Government of India, toexpress the anxiety of the War Cabinet that this operation shouldnot result in any major military commitment.&quot;The view was expressed that the reasons for this view still held good, and that it would not be in keeping with our broadstrategy if forces had to be withdrawn from other theatres of operations to take part in a war on the Frontier.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Prime Minister to convey the War Cabinefsviews to the Secretary of State for India.
Protected Areas.(previous reference:.W.M. (40) 3rdConclusions,Minute 8.)Request for permission forMiss UnityMitford to visit the North ofScotland.5. The Secretary of State for War said that the War cabinet would be aware that, at the request of the Admiralty, the WarOffice had declared a large part of Northern Scotland a protectedarea under the Defence Regulations.An application had now been received from Lord Redesdalefor permission to take his daughter, Miss Unity Mitford, to an island which belonged to him within this area. The admiralty had been consulted and he (the Secretary of State) shared their view that it would be unwise to grant this request. A parliamentary question had been put down on the matter, and he thought thathis colleagues should be aware of the position.The view was generally expressed that, whilst the presence of miss Unity Mitford in this area would not be a source of danger,the public outcry which might be expected if she was allowed togo there would be such as to make it undesirable that permissionshould be given. If an exception were made in Miss Mitford&apos;scase, it would be very difficult to refuse other applications.The War Cabinet agreed : That, for the reasons stated, permission should not be givento Lord Redesdale to take Miss Unity Mitford withinthe protected area in North Scotland.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 58thConclusions,Minute 4.)Italy.economic relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 50thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. A discussion took place in regard to the question ofassistance to Finland, particulars of which are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 68), covering aMemorandum prepared in the Foreign Office in consultation withthe other Departments concerned with Anglo-Italian economic relations.The principal points brought out in discussion were thefollowing : (1) The Italian Government had already been informed that german sea-borne exports of coal to Italy would be subjected to our Export Control from the 1st March,and that special facilities would be available to cover theimport of British coal to Italy during the month ofMarch. It would be desirable to defer any final decision in regard to the provision of further facilities for thesale of coal to Italy until the position generally wasclearer. The matter might therefore be reconsidered in,say, a fortnights time.(2) The arrangements referred to at (1) would give Italy a,breathing space in which to reconsider her position. Atthe end of that time she would either (a) have to findmeans of financing her essential imports, whether bysales of armaments or payments in free exchange, or(V) have to resign herself to a restriction of imports ofa severity which might bring Italian industry almost toa standstill.(3) The severe strain on the Italian economy might lead signor mussolini to reconsider his decision. He would be underconsiderable pressure from Italian industry and, inparticular, from the aircraft and munitions firms whosecontracts with this country had almost gone through.
(4) Rome telegram No. 190, of the previous day, reporting the-Italian Governments strong protest against our decision in connection with German sea-borne coal, complicatedthe situation further. The. Italian Note was a politicalprotest; it read as if Signor Mussolini wished to-encourage another bout of Anglophobia among his followers. It was now doubly undesirable that we should do anything to make matters easier for the ItalianGovernment. We ought, if anything, to &quot; put on thescrew.&quot; Any sign of weakness on our part would beput down in Italy to the effects of their Note.(5) After the end of March, in the absence of any change ofheart on the Italian side, it would probably be necessaryfor us to supply only as much coal as Italy could pay for.This policy would almost certainly lead to a drastic reduction of coal exports to Italy. The British coalexporters would not be prepared to accept increasingdelays in payment through the Clearing.(6) The Minister for Economic Warfare drew attention &quot;to paragraph 9 of W.P. (G.) (40) 68, which referred to the negotiation of a new Clearing Agreement with Italy.The Minister suggested that it might be possible for anew Clearing to be established on a basis which would permit further increases in turnover as trade increased.(7) The Minister for Economic Warfare said that Mr. Shinwellhad put down a Parliamentary Question for answer onthe following day, regarding 25 Italian colliers now inRotterdam. It was believed that 18 of these had alreadybeen loaded with coal. Some of them had put out to sea, and had then been recalled, to prevent their cargoesbeing put in prize. The view was expressed that, inview of the stiff terms of the Italian Note, the grant ofany further period of grace would be interpreted as a sign of weakness. In the absence of any concessions onour part, the colliers and their cargoes would probablyremain in port at Rotterdam.The War Cabinet (i) Took note, with approval, of the general policy suggestedin W.P. (G.) (40) 68.(ii) Authorised the Minister for Economic Warfare to make itclear, in reply to Mr. Shinwell&apos;s parliamentary question, that we intended henceforward to put in prizethe cargoes of any vessels putting out from port carryingGerman coal for Italy.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 4, 1940.
