The Air 1.   The Chief of the Air Staff said that the weather conditionsSituation. on the previous day and night could not have been worse, and had(Previous very largely prevented satisfactory operations.Reference: Two Blenheims had carried out a reconnaissance of the SchilligW.M. (40) 94th Roads and Wilhelmshaven during the day. Patrol vessels had been conclusions, observed, which had appeared to stretch in a continuous line north-Minute l.) wards from Wangeroog. Aircraft had penetrated as far as there connaissance junction of the Kiel Canal and the Elbe Estuary. No warships had of German been seen there and no anti-aircraft fire had been experienced. Thenaval bases position of the battleship Tirpitz, now building in Wilhelmshaven,had been changed. Two submarines had been seen to be lying on thenorth side of the harbour.Attacks on A force of six Blenheims had left early on the previous morningStavanger to attack Stavanger aerodrome.   Five had had to return owing toaerodrome. thick cloud, with icing conditions, from sea level to 1,700 feet. one had managed to get through and had dropped four bombs on the aerodrome, but had not been able to observe the results.Approximately sixty enemy aircraft of different types had been seen on the ground.Of a force of twelve Wellingtons which had left in the eveningto carry out a night attack on Stavanger aerodrome, only two had reached the objective owing to the extremely poor weather condi-tions, and these two had found themselves at too low a height to beable to bomb. A number of merchant ships had been seen in Hervikand Skjold Fjords.Other Three Wellingtons, despatched to carry out a night attack on operations in     Kjeller and Forneb aerodromes,  had  failed to identify theirScandinavia.       objectives.All the above aircraft had returned safely.A further force of five Whitleys, which had left the previous evening to attack Vaernes aerodrome, had not succeeded in reaching the target, again owing to adverse weather. On their return one had crashed in Scotland, though the crew, with the exception of the captain of the aircraft, had jumped and landed safely.A Hudson aircraft of the Fighter Command on a reconnaissance of Bergen the previous day, had reported no sign of activity orrolling-stock on the railway or at the stations. No anti-aircraft firehad been encountered, and no gun emplacements had been seen.Another aircraft had reported that a bridge on the railway ten miles north of Bergen had been demolished.Five enemy destroyers had been seen in the approaches toSkudesnes Fjord at 7 p.m. the previous night, steaming north.There was nothing of importance to report as regards activities in the Fighter Command, or with the British Air Forces in France.Night The War Cabinet were informed that the laying of mines frommine-laying aircraft in the Kattegat had not been possible on the previous night operations.        owing to weather conditions.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Ministrywished to complete these mine-laying operations as soon as possible,as owing to the special fittings required, the aircraft engaged onthis work were immobilised for other service.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War cabinet situation. of the dispositions and activities of the Fleet in connection with(Previous the combined operations taking place on the Norwegian coast, and reference: of the steps that were being taken to deal both with the GermanW.M.

(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Bombardmentof stavanger aerodrome byH.M.S. Suffolk.H.M. SubmarineThistle.Attacks on shipping.On the evening of the 16th April, the German submarine U.49had been sunk in Vaags Fjord by H.M.S. Fearless and a numberof the crew had been taken prisoners. It was of the utmost importance that this fact should be kept secret.H.M.S. Hardy, damaged in the attack on Narvik on the10th April, was a total wreck. Her survivors, some 140 in all, had now returned to England. ELM. ships Punjabi and Hotspur wereseaworthy, and H.M.S. Cossack would be seaworthy in about aweek&apos;s time. H.M.S. Penelope had been moved into shallow watersin order that divers might work on her.H.M.S. Suffolk had carried out a bombardment of stavanger aerodrome that morning, according to plan. No report had yetbeen received from her, except to say that she was being bombed.She had been authorised to expend up to 400 shells, and as thespotting aircraft had reported that the shooting was good, it mightbe anticipated that satisfactory results had been obtained, eventhough the presence of snow had prevented observations of the precise positions of the runways.Later in the meeting a message was received reporting that.M.S. Suffolk had been hit by a bomb and badly damaged. HALS.Calcutta had been sent to give her additional protection.In reply to a question, the First Lord said that so far as was known, only one submarine, Thistle, had been lost in the recent operations in the Skagerrak.S.S. Stancliffe had been torpedoed and sunk on the morning of the 12th April, North-East of the Shetlands. She had been on passage from Narvik to Immingham with a cargo of iron ore.Four magnetic mines had been exploded on the previous day in the Thames area.S.S. Queen Mary had arrived at Sydney. The Mauretania andAquitania were already there.The Secretary of State for Air drew the attention of the FirstLord of the Admiralty to a telegram from Flis Majesty&apos;s Consul-General in Mexico City, reporting information that enemy agentswere on board the Queen Mary with the intention of committingsabotage.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 93rdConclusions,Minute 4.)The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 94thConclusions,Minute 3.)Scandinavia.Supply ofmunitions to norway.3. In connection with the preceding Minute, the First Lordof the Admiralty made a statement regarding present dispositionsand future operations in Norway. A record of this discussion, andof the conclusions reached by the War Cabinet, is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet conclusions.4. The Secretary of State for War said that he had nothing to add to the information which had been given by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty as to the military operations in Scandinavia (see minute 3).Arrangements were being made for the shipment of 50,000rifles, 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition, and a number of Bren gunsand anti-tank guns, to Norway as soon as possible. In view,however, of the lack of fighting spirit shown by the Norwegians,considerable care would have to be taken before handing overvaluable equipment. It seemed quite clear that the morale of theNorwegian troops would remain low until they could be stiffenedby British troops.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
347W.M.95 (40).Scandinavia.Visit of admiral sir EdwardEvans to norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 94thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that ithad been arranged that Admiral Sir Edward Evans should fly to norway that evening. As agreed at the last meeting of the WarCabinet, the main object of his visit would be to maintain contact with the King of Norway. In order, however, to give him a diplomatic status, he would be attached to the British Legation.One suggestion which Admiral Evans would make to the king of Norway would be that he should send a personal message to theKing of Italy.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Sweden.AttitudetowardsGermany.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 91stConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, fromconversations which he had with M. Boheman and M. Prytz on theprevious day, he had received the impression that the attitude of sweden was quite satisfactory. They had both stated that she would refuse any German demands for railway or other facilities.M. Boheman had said that all Sweden had decided that they would only fight a defensive war, but that there were many Swedes whohoped that this would become a necessity, i.e., that the germans would force their hands.M. Prytz had made the significant observation that a vitalelement in the situation was the presence of our troops at Narvik.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.probable intentions.Possibility of an italian attackon Yugoslavia.Proposals of theFrench war committee.(Previous- Reference:W.M. (40) 94thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreian Affairs drew attentionto Paris telegrams Nos. 130 DIPP and 133 DIPP, dated the16th April. In the latter, Sir Ronald Campbell reported thatM. Leger had just informed him of the decisions reached that day by the French War Committee, which were as follows : (1) An Italian attack on Yugoslavia would call for a reactionon the part of the Allies.(2) The   extent   and   nature  of   that  reaction   would   be dependant on (i) The reactions of Yugoslavia herself;(ii) The reactions of Turkey, Greece and Roumania.(3) The Allied Governments should therefore take immediate steps, by official diplomatic action, and semi-officiallythrough General Staff channels, to ascertain the disposi-tions of these four States and to remind them plainlythat their individual safety was bound up with that ofthe Balkan community as a whole. They should beinformed that any help which the Allies might rendermust primarily depend on the extent of the resources which would be immediately available as a result of theco-operation of all the military forces of the BalkanEntente States, with a view to resisting the collective or individual threats which were hanging over the Balkans.(4) The four States should, therefore, without loss of timecreate a united military front against aggression.The Foreign Secretary said that we should be confronted witha difficult decision if an Italian attack on Yugoslavia, or the dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, should materialise. Our mainconcern would be, on the one hand, to keep out of the war with italy, if that were possible; and, on the other hand, to mark ourdispleasure in some manner which should not be futile orreminiscent of sanctions.It would be difficult to do nothing at all if Italy took actionon the Dalmatian Coast. &apos;One course would be to occupy Corfu,assuming that the Greeks would invite us to do so.    It seemed,
however, that this would certainly involve us in war with Italy,which we wished to avoid.The Prime Minister said that the decisions of the French war committee, including diplomatic enquiries of Yugoslavia, Turkey,Greece and Roumania, and the formation of a united Balkan frontagainst aggression, seemed very unpractical.General agreement was expressed with this view.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was considering whether it would be possible to ask the TurkishGovernment to act as a restraining influence with the ItalianGovernment. In the meantime, he had instructed His Majesty&apos;minister to the Holy See to discover whether Mr. Myron Taylorcould be persuaded to seek an interview with Signor Mussolini.Cancellation of Reference was made to the statement published that morningspeech by Signor that Signor Mussolini had cancelled the meeting of the general assembly of the 1942 Exhibition, which was to have taken placeon the 20th April, and at which he was to have spoken on theinternational situation. Signor Mussolini might have reached thisdecision because he considered the chances of the Exhibition being held so remote that it was not worth while for the meeting to takeplace; or he might have prepared a bellicose speech but had changedhis mind about delivering it, as he was no longer certain whichside was going to win.The view was expiration&quot;essed that Signor Mussolini would makehimself as unpleasant to us as he possibly could, short of going towar.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had seen Sir Percy Loraine the previous day, and had decided that sir Percy, who was indisposed, ought to take the rest of his leavebefore going back to Rome. If, during that period, we should become involved in war with Italy, we should have to explain, on grounds of illness, his absence from his post during these criticaldays.The Foreign Secretary said that his own opinion was that thepresent situation was not one which was likely to be influenced byeven the most able diplomatic representative. Signor Mussoliniwould be guided by his own reading of the situation and eitherwould, or would not, make war. The British Minister in Romewas fully capable of doing all that could be done.The Foreign Secretary mentioned that the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had recently, at aluncheon party, met the Italian Ambassador and Marchese Fracassi.A little heat had been engendered when they had talked of the tonewhich the Italian press had recently adopted towards this country,but Signor Bastianini had said that he thought he could do some-thing to ease matters. He had added that, in his opinion, the tension of the last few days was now diminishing.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Mussolini.Sir PercyL Maine.Spain.Possibleintervention inthe war.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 88thConclusions,Minute 9.)8. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that, if Italy entered the war on Germany&apos;s side, the Chiefs of Staff would have to take into consideration the possibility that Spain would also join our enemies. The principal economic consequence in that eventualitywould be that we should lose Northern Spain as a source of iron ore unless indeed Civil War should break out in Spain once more,and the Asturias should throw off the yoke of Madrid.The Prime Minister said that his personal view was thatGeneral Franco would be careful not to involve his country in another war.
Germany. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionAttack on to Stockholm telegram No. 265 DIPP dated the  16th April.Scandinavia Mr. Mallet had learnt from a neutral source (not Scandinavian),undertaken the value of which he could not fully assess but which claimed toagainst the have accurately foretold the date of the invasion of Norway, thatadvice of the Herr Hitler had insisted on undertaking that invasion against theGerman High wishes of his Military and Naval High Command.  It was said thatCommand. Herr   Hitler  now  expected   Norway   to  surrender  that   day(Previous (17th April), although he had previously expected the NorwegianEeference: surrender to take place at an earlier date.W.M. (40) 93rd The same source had stated that the German High CommandConclusions, intended to oust the Nazis, if the Norwegian coup should miscarry.Minute 6.) The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that information had been received from secret sources to the effect that king Leopold and his immediate personal advisers had decidedthat, if Holland was invaded, Belgium would not come to her assistance. Confirmation of this was contained in telegram No. 82DIPP from our Ambassador at Brussels. Sir Lancelot Oliphanthad, however, also heard the view commonly expressed that, if theNetherlands were attacked, Belgium would go to her aid. It thusseemed possible that a situation might arise in which the King andthe Belgian Government would find themselves in opposition to thepeople.In discussion, it was pointed out that this was probably thereason for the Belgian Ambassador&apos;s request for an assurance thatthe Allies had no intention of moving troops into Belgium unlessthe Belgian Government appealed to us for help.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was because we hadsuspected that the Belgians might desire to maintain their neutrality, in the event of a German attack on Holland, that we had proposed taking steps to make it clear to the Belgian Governmentthat they could not hope to preserve their neutrality by action of thiskind, and that, if Holland was invaded by Germany, the allied troops would enter Belgium, irrespective of whether they hadreceived an invitation from the Belgian Government. The FrenchGovernment, however, had thought that it was better not to tellW.M. (40) 92nd the Belgian Government now that we proposed to act in this way.Conclusions, The Prime Minister thought we should consider whether we should minute 6.)        not at once make our attitude plain to the Belgians.The Foreign Secretary doubted whether we should gainanything by making a communication on the lines proposed. Hethought that the Belgian Government would adhere to their present attitude, and that our action, if taken in advance, would only give them an opportunity of working up public opinion in favour of neutrality. He agreed, however, that the point should be further examined.The Secretary of State for Air expressed the fear that, if theBelgian attitude became known in Holland, the netherlands government might be disposed to make terms with Germany.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that so long as the dangerof a German invasion of Holland remained acute, it was desirableto avoid, if possible, the despatch of further ships to Holland.The War Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether, in thelight of the latest information, we should ask the french to agree to the despatch to the Belgian Government of afurther communication, informing them that, if Germanyinvaded Holland, Allied troops would enter Belgium.Western Front.Action to betaken if theNetherlands or belgium is invaded.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 94thConclusions,Minute 6.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 90thConclusions,Minute 3.)(previous reference:
Japan.Position of theNetherlandsEast Indies inthe event of an invasion of theNetherlands.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 93rd(^inclusions,Minute 9.)11. In reply to a question, the Secretary of Slate for ForeignAffairs said that he had no information as to the attitude of Japanexcept what was contained in recent telegrams from Sir robert craigie. Various United States Press messages had been received in Japan suggesting that, in the event of a German invasion of holland, the United States Fleet would take steps to prevent japan from advancing upon the Netherlands East Indies. This had resulted in considerable discussion of the question in the JapanesePress. The Foreign Secretary said that his own provisional reading of the Japanese attitude was that Japan was not anxious to see thewar extended to the Far East, and that she was unlikely to take action in the Netherlands East Indies unless we forced the pace.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he hada telegram from the Government of the Commonwealth of australia to the effect that, on several occasions in recent years, president roosevelt and his advisers had expressed the view to AustralianMinisters that the United States could not remain indifferent to anyattempt to alter the status of the Netherlands East Indies. It wassuggested that this matter might be taken up with the United states authorities, in order to ascertain their present attitude and possible action.The War Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toconsider whether it would be desirable to make an approach to the United States Government as to theirattitude towards any attempt to alter the status of theNetherlands East Indies.Scandinavia.economic consequences tothe Allies andGermany ofGerman inva-sion of denmark and Norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 87thConclusions,Minute 7.)12. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer covering a statement by Lord Stamp&apos;sSurvey of Economic and Financial Plans on the economic conse-quences to the Allies and to Germany respectively of the seizure byGermany of Denmark and Norway (W.P. (G.) (40) 103).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at the last Meetingof the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy the ministers concerned had supplied information on this subject. The tabula-tion had been undertaken by Lord Stamp &apos;s Survey.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in view of his advisers, the document was unduly pessimistic. He would send theChancellor a copy of their observations.The Secretary of State for Air said that this Department were anxious regarding the supply of special steels and aluminium.Norwegian supplies of these metals had been drawn from the Southof Norway, and must now be regarded as unavailable; alternativesupplies could only be obtained through purchases in dollars.The Prime Minister said that, in general, it would be premature to assume that Norwegian supplies of all kinds would no longer beavailable to us, since with the progress of military operations we might also re-establish part of our import trade from Norway.The War Cabinet took note of the above document.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,April 17, 1940.
