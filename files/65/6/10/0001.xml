The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 64thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy air activity.Reconnaissancesof Heligolandand JadeEstuary.Leaflet raids.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that there had been little, if any, activity by the enemy off our coasts on the 9th March.Five aircraft had been plotted off the East coast on the 10th March.Reconnaissances of Heligoland and the Jade Estuary had beencarried out on the 9th March, but nothing of importance had been seen.Leaflets had been dropped over Prague and Vienna on the9th March.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 64thConclusions,Minute 2.)The First Lord&apos;visit to Scapa.Laying ofmagnetic minesby aircraft at scapa Flow.H.M.S. Kelly.Shipping losses.Attacks onU-boats.Signal fromArmedMerchantCruiser Wolfe.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinet a brief account of his visit to the Fleet at Scapa Flow.He had found the Fleet in very good heart. A great deal ofwork had been done to make Scapa a safe anchorage, and, although there was still further work to be done, he thought that the basecould now be considered 80 per cent, secure. Strong anti-submarine patrols were being maintained outside all the entrances and the risks of using the anchorage in its present state were not greaterthan could properly be accepted. Owing to the good strategicalposition of Scapa, it would not be necessary for the ships to spendso much time at sea, and conditions for the personnel should nowbe less arduous.It appeared that the German aircraft which, as reported atthe previous meeting, had been seen dropping objects in one of theentrances to Scapa had been mistaken for our own machines whichhad been co-operating with the defences for training purposes atthe time.H.M.S. Kelly had been slightly damaged as a result of acollision with another destroyer on the 9th March.Enemy attacks on shipping were as follows : March 9.S.S. Chevy Chase (2,179 tons) sunk by a mine off the East coast.March 10.S.S. Borthwick (1,097 tons) mined or torpedoed off the dutch coast.   Crew landed at Flushing.S.S. Maindy Hill (1,918 tons) had sunk as a result of a collisionoff the East coast.   The crew had been landed.The Greek S.S. Joannis Chandris, which had lost her rudderin mid-Atlantic on the 28th February, was now in tow of a Dutchtug in the Western Approaches.The Italian S.S. Amelia Lauro (bombed and set on fire on the7th March) had arrived safely in Yarmouth Roads (Isle of Wight)on the 10th March.H.M.S. Ghurka had attacked what was possibly a U-boat,60 miles East of the Orkneys, on the 9th March.HM. trawlers Cloughton Wyke and Chiltern had attacked aU-boat with gunfire to the westward of St. Kilda. One hit on theU-boat was claimed.The Admiralty had picked up a signal on the 10th Marchpurporting to be from the Armed Merchant Cruiser Wolfe reporting&quot; 9 vessels, perhaps warships &quot; in a position 50 miles North-west of Iceland. Doubts were entertained as to the authenticity of thissignal, and the matter was being investigated.[20991] b 2
Two S.O.S. messages had been intercepted from the GreekS.S. Alexandras (4,343 tons) off Cape St. Vincent on the 10th March.A magnetic mine had been exploded by the specially fittedaircraft on the previous day.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Military 3.

The large decreases in ore from Narvik to GermanyMinute 7.) during February were attributed to the following causes : (i) The Swedes, who controlled the railway and quays at narvik, were &quot; not co-operating &quot; with the Germans,thus putting into operation the delaying tactics whichthey had promised to use under the &quot; secret under-standing &quot; given at the time of the signature of theWar Trade Agreement.(ii) The Germans could not keep inside Norwegian territorial waters unless they had Norwegian pilots on board. TheMinistry of Economic Warfare were already working on the Norwegian Pilots&apos; Association to secure a boycott of German ships; some progress had been made already,and further progress was anticipated shortly.(iii) Owing to the Sound being frozen, German ships could not proceed inside Norwegian territorial waters, and proceedthus by the Sound to Stettin. They had, therefore, to cross a large stretch of open water from norwegian waters to the west coast of Denmark; and as the resultapparently of fear of being intercepted by our patrols,fewer ships had made the journey. Further, when theships arrived in German North Sea ports, they were held up through the canals being frozen.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadVisit of Herr no definite information regarding Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s suddenvon Eibbentrop. decision to visit Rome. It was worth noting, however, that count ciano had first heard of this visit when it was announced at 12 noon on the 9th March, 1940, through the German Ambassador. He (theSecretary of State) was not unhopeful that Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;ssudden arrival with a large retinue of officials would do more goodthan harm from our point of view.

(telegram No. 215, Dipp, dated the 9th March, 1940) that count ciano had shown anxiety to have this question settled before the arrival of Herr von Ribbentrop, and had not concealed his delightat the prospect of an immediate settlement of this question at that moment of tension.The First Lord of the Admiralty congratulated the foreign secretary on the settlement of this case, which was both extremelywell-timed and showed also the value of a judicious use of sea power.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the formula agreed on (as set out in Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s telegram No. 216, dated the9th March, 1940) strictly covered only imports of German coal fromthe Netherland ports at which the coal in the thirteen ships we hadreleased had been loaded. He hoped that it was understood by theItalian Government that we expected them to import no furthersea-borne German coal, no matter what the port of loading.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldhave preferred to secure a simpler formula such as that suggestedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but in view of the importanceof the time factor on the evening of the 9th March, 1940, he had&apos; thought it better to clinch the bargain on the terms drafted byCount Ciano. He did not believe that the latter had any misapprehension-hension on this subject.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet had before them the following Papers : (i) A Note by the French Ambassador giving the views of theFrench Government on the attitude to be adopted ifFinland appealed for assistance (WP. (40) 92).(ii) A communication handed to the Prime Minister by theFinnish Minister on the 10th March (WP. (40) 93).A record of the discussion which took place and of theConclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.Royal marine operation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 63rdConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinetthe latest information in regard to this project.This information is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,March 11, 1940.
