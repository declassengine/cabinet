1. The Prime Minister drew attention to telegram No. 262,Saving, from Paris, reporting that the Secretary-General of thePolish Ministry for Foreign Affairs had heard from a prominentBelgian, who went constantly to Germany, that the R.A.F. raidon Sylt had produced something like consternation in Germany,and that the material damage was so extensive that a good dealof work would be required before the base could be of any useagain.The Secretary of State for Air said that the leader of the raid, who had remained in his aircraft for an hour or so offSylt, watching the action of each aircraft as it arrived, had told the Press, at a Conference held the previous day, that there wasno doubt about the extent of the damage inflicted.Enemy activity. Except for a few aircraft plotted well out to sea, there hadbeen little enemy air activity the previous day.R.A.E. activity. Nine Blenheims had carried out an offensive patrol off the danish coast, and had attacked two enemy patrol ships withoutvisible result. One of the Blenheims had been seen to fall back from the formation on the way home, and had not returned to itsbase.A Blenheim on patrol had attacked a J.U.88, and had inflicteddamage on it.The usual security patrols had been maintained over Germanseaplane bases, and 7 Hampdens had carried out a reconnaissanceover N.W. Germany during the night.Coastal command patrols had been much curtailed by bad weather.Western Front. In  France, our Fighter  patrols had been  active.    ThreeHurricanes had attacked a formation of 9 Messerschmitts 110, andit was believed that three of the latter had been shot down. this information had not been published however, pending confirmation.One of the Hurricanes had been badly damaged by cannon fire,but had returned safely.Air tactics. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that whereasGerman Fighters appeared to operate in formations of nine ortwelve aircraft, our aircraft appeared to operate only in flightsof three. The Dominion High Commissioners had enquired whether there was any significance in this difference in tactics.The Chief of the Air Staff said that a flight of three aircraft was our tactical unit for fighting. The Germans appeared to moveabout in greater numbers, but as soon as they were attacked, theysplit up, as fighters could not manoeuvre in large formations. Inthe encounter which had just been referred to by the Secretaryof State, the formation of 9 Messerschmitts had split up, and eachof our aircraft had then engaged one adversary.The Secretary of State for Air said that all accounts seemedto show that the German Fighters were not prepared to take theinitiative, and, when attacked, usually made for home; whereasour men were at all times ready to go in and engage.The Minister without Portfolio enquired whether the Secretaryof State for Air had yet heard the French version of the airencounter reported at the meeting of the War Cabinet the previous day, in which the Germans claimed to have shot down 7 FrenchFighters.The Secretary of State for Air said that the French had issued a communique saying that two of their Fighters had been shot down, the pilot of one having escaped by parachute. The French air Mission had confirmed this report.[21093] B 2The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 78thConclusions,Minute 1.)Raid on island of Sylt,March 19th.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 75thConclusions,Minute 1.)
Press reports of The Secretary of State for War thought that a good deal ofair operations, harm resulted from the fact that the Germans put out their reportsof air operations in time for them to be included in our morningpapers, whereas the French and British accounts did not appeartill later in the day. The Germans thus had a clear start withtheir version of what occurred and people were apt to believe whatthey read first.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed, and emphasised the importance of issuing contradictions of Germany&apos;sexaggerated claims and false statements with the utmost speed.An Italian had told him, on the previous day, that the Germanstory about two British officers, who were said to have been court-martialled for giving false reports of their exploits, had been published in the Italian papers on Friday, and that ourcontradiction had not appeared until the following Monday. Hethought that our machinery for keeping a watch over Germanstatements abroad, and contradicting them rapidly, requiredexamination.The Secretary of State for Air drew attention to the importanceof ensuring that statements which we issued were accurate, even at the risk of some delay. This meant in some cases having to wait for confirmation of the first reports received. He undertook,however, to see whether a preliminary report could be issuedimmediately, to be followed by a fuller statement when confirmationhad been received.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had noticed thatthe B.B.C. were continuing the practice, to which the PrimeMinister had referred at the meeting of the War Cabinet mentionedin the margin, of following our own account of events at sea andin the air with the German account.The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury said that, on theinstructions of the Prime Minister, he had seen the Chairman ofthe B.B.C., and also the Minister of Information. They had bothbeen perturbed by the action of the B.B.C. in putting out news inthis form, which they said was against their own wishes; and had undertaken to see that matters were put right.Tie Prime Minister said that, judging by recent broadcasts,the practice appeared to be continuing.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above discussion.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to consider whetherearlier reports could be issued as to air operations.B.B.C. news bulletins.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 4.)The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 78thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the twohomeward-bound Norwegian Convoys had been scattered by thegale, but had suffered no mishap and were approaching their destinations under escort.Two or three enemy reconnaissance aircraft had appeared overScapa Flow on the previous day. Shore batteries had opened firewithout result.Four mines had been exploded off Harwich by the &quot; LL &quot;sweep, without damage to the towing trawlers. This type of sweepcleared a wide channel at considerable speed, and looked likebecoming our staple sweep against magnetic mines.The Prime Minister referred to the reports which had appeared in the Press that German vessels intended to sail from AdriaticPorts; it seemed to be suggested that one German vessel loading
with bauxite in the Adriatic might be intending to make its way through to the.Black Sea. The matter might be raised in the House,and he would be glad to have a report about it.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to provide thisreport by the following day.The Prime Minister asked whether the Admiralty had any information on the report that the German battleship Lutzow(formerly Deutschland) had moved from the Baltic to a North SeaPort, and had sailed on commerce raiding duties, early in March, in company with the Nordmark.The Chief of Naval Staff said that the Admiralty had no evidence to show that this was the case. The Chief of the Air staff had arranged that air reconnaissances should be carried out simul-taneously of the Baltic and North Sea ports, with the object oflocating important German naval units. Weather conditions had,however, prevented this.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.German-battleshipThe Military 3.

(40) 78thConclusions,Minute 3.)Supreme WarCouncil: 6thMeeting.Eoyal marine operation.proposed operation in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 78thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that no reply had been received from the French Government on the subjectof the Royal Marine Operation. No doubt they were much disturbed by the communication we had made to them. The wisest coursewould be to wait a day or two for the French Governments response.This was agreed to.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that two norwegian coast Defence Ships had arrived at Narvik. This lent colour to thesuggestion that the Norwegians might be contemplating action toprevent altogether the export of iron-ore from Narvik. The FirstLord hoped that, even if this was so, we should not be deterred fromgoing forward with the proposal to stop traffic through norwegian territorial waters. In his view, the present time was a favourableone to carry out this operation.The Foreign Secretary doubted whether the Norwegian Govern-ment would, in fact, either themselves lay a minefield in their ownterritorial waters, or would forbid the export of Swedish iron-ore from Narvik. If, therefore, we were to proceed with the plan, itwould, he thought, be worth while to arrange, if this had not alreadybeen done, for the participation of French naval units, in order tomake the operation a combined Allied operation.The First Sea Lord said that the French had already promised to make available for the operation a cruiser flying a Rear-Admiral^ flag and six destroyers.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
The Far East.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 38thConclusions,Minute 7.)Relations with japan: speechby Sir robert craigie.Tientsinquestion.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 104thConclusions,Minute 11.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad now seen the full text of the recent speech by His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Tokyo, which had been widely reported in the Press;the speech contained one or two rather embarrassing phrases. Thematter might well be raised in Parliament, and it would be necessaryto give some explanation. The previous day Mr. Herschel Johnson,Counsellor of the United States Embassy, had raised the matter with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs. He (the Foreign Secretary) thought that the incident couldbe disposed of without saying anything which would reflect on our ambassador.It now appeared jDrobable that within a week we should settle the Tientsin question, and that the Japanese would lift the blockadeon,the Concession. He had suggested the insertion of a clause inthe agreement laying down that, if any future differences were to arise between the two Governments, the blockade should not bereimposed upon the Concession, but the matter settled by friendlydiscussion. A settlement on these lines would be satisfactory.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprevious afternoon the Netherland Minister had said that, if germany were to invade the Netherlands, the aerodromes whichthey might be able to seize were all so bare that the Germans wouldbe unable to conceal their aircraft, which would therefore be at themercy of our bombers. He had also confirmed a statement, recently made by M. Colijn, that there was so little sub-soil that it wouldbe an extremely lengthy business to repair any aerodrome damaged by bombing attack.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Balkans. ^ 7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he(Previous had now arranged to open his discussions on the following Monday,Reference: the 8th April, 1940, with the British Representatives in BalkanW.M. (40) 76th countries who had been recalled for this purpose. It would be mostConclusions, helpful if the Minister without Portfolio could be associated with minute 6.) these discussions. He had arranged also that, in addition to the visit to London discussions to be held in the Foreign Office, the British Represen-of His Majesty&apos;s tatives should have an opportunity, before returning to their posts,Representatives, of discussing the general situation with the Chiefs of Staff, andwith the Ministry of Information, the Ministry of economic warfare and other Departments.The Prime Minister welcomed the suggestion that the minister without Portfolio should be associated with the forthcoming discussions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.TheNetherlands.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 3.)German oil supplies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 22ndConclusions,Minute 10.)8. The War Cabinet had before them the Third Report ofLord Hankey&apos;s Committee, covering the Second Report of TheCommittee on the German Oil Position (WP. (40) 108).The Minister without Portfolio gave a summary of his Report,and invited attention to a number of points. In particular, he emphasised the immense importance to Germany of Russian and roumanian oil supplies, more especially lubricating oil, gas oiland diesel oil. He did not dissent from the conclusions in theReport of the Committee on the German Oil Position as toGermany&apos;s future position, but he felt bound to warn the WarCabinet against building too much on the effect on German oil
supplies of active warfare. The difference between the con-sumption in active and static warfare was less than might beexpected. Subject to this caveat, he concurred in the comments ofthe Secretary for Mines, set out in paragraph 15 of his coveringnote to the Committee&apos;s Report. Action calculated to induceGermany to undertake more active operations, to hamper herdomestic production, or to destroy her reserves, raised questions of major strategy beyond the scope of the Report. But the restriction of German imports from Roumania and Russia went to the veryheart of the question. Germany had concluded a relativelyfavourable agreement with Roumania and was taking all possible measures to improve her communications with Roumania and the black Sea, and to develop Russian resources. For our part, wewould have to continue our opportunist tactics to slow downGermany&apos;s supplies. A brief reference to these tactics was madein the Report; and he (the Minister without Portfolio) felt thatthe Royal Marine Operation, when undertaken in the Danubianregion, would be particularly effective.The Compensation Scheme for the destruction of the oil fields,in the event of Roumania being overrun, was not yet agreed; butdiscussions were taking place on this matter in London at themoment. The Roumanians had stated that they would destroy thewells in the event of invasion by Germany, whether or not theCompensation Scheme was agreed. There was no doubt, however,that it would be a wise precaution to obtain agreement on theCompensation Scheme. The arrangements for transporting anR.E. Company from Alexandria to co-operate in the work of destruction were in suspense, owing to the unhelpful attitude ofthe Turks; and he suggested that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs might raise this matter in his forthcoming discussions withour representatives in the Balkan States.In conclusion, he referred to the arrangements which hadbeen made on the Danube in concert with the French, with theobject of preventing the Germans from jostling us off the river inthe existing conditions, and of keeping the situation on the riverin hand in the event of German invasion.The Prime Minister observed that the result of the investigationseemed to indicate oil supplies as the most vulnerable point inGermany&apos;s system. He asked whether Germany&apos;s oil supplies andhydrogenation plants would therefore be the most advantageoustarget to attack, if we decided to embark on unrestricted air operations.The Chief of the Air Staff said that in the view of the AirStaff oil took precedence over all other targets.The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that there was arelation between oil supplies and supplies of iron ore. Any shortageof the latter would affect Germany&apos;s plans for increasing her oil supplies by improving the railways, building tank wagons, andso forth.The Lord Privy Seal referred to the strong diplomatic and commercial representation of the Germans in Roumania. the roumanians, being a semi-oriental people, were much affected-byoutward appearances, and he suggested that we might with advantage be represented on a much more impressive scale.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs thought that therewas much to be said for this suggestion : he would discuss the pointwith the British Minister during the latter&apos;s forthcoming visit.It was clearly important that our propaganda in Roumania shouldbe as active as possible. He thought, however, that the determining factor would be whether the Roumanians believed that, if Germanyattacked them, the Allies would be able to prevent their country from being overrun.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thought that theReport clearly showed that oil was Germany&apos;s &quot;Achilles&apos; heel.&quot;He emphasised that many of the estimates which had been putforward necessarily contained a considerable element of uncertainty.He agreed with the Lord Privy Seal that our diplomatic and commercial representation in Roumania should be as impressive aspossible.The Secretary for Mines also stressed the uncertainty of manyof the figures in the Report. He thought that there had been ageneral tendency in many countries, including this country, to over-estimate consumption by the Services. This had been reflected inour estimates for German consumption, which were based on ourown figures. He thought that it was very desirable to obtain, ifpossible, more accurate information of Germany&apos;s civil consumption,and he had provided the Foreign Office with a questionnaire forthis purpose. He suggested that the German oii position shouldbe re-assessed at regular intervals in the light of such furtherinformation as we might receive.The Minister of Economic Warfare thought that we should do everything possible to stiffen the Roumanian Governmentsresistance to German pressure. He foresaw the possibility of astruggle over the question of forcing the loyal Companies to sell oil to Germany.In reply to a question, the Minister said that, from the pointof view of economic warfare, he was anxious to ration Italian oil supplies. To the best of our knowledge only insignificant quantitiesof oil had passed from Italy to Germany. Italy&apos;s large stocks were,however, a potential reservoir for the Germans. He was not soanxious regarding the stocks of Northern neutrals, who probablyrequired them for their own purposes and would be unwilling tosupply Germany.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to a secret reportthat German ownership had now been accorded by the Italian courts to several thousands of tons of lubricating oil at Trieste, whichhad previously been assigned to British ownership. He askedwhether there was any risk of further happenings of this nature.The Minister of Economic Warfare undertook to investigatethis point and to communicate with the Chancellor of theExchequer.The War Cabinet :-(a) Took note of the Third Report of Lord Hankey&apos;s Committeeon Preventing Oil from reaching Germany, covering theSecond Report of the Committee on the German oil position (W.P. (40) 108).(b) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toconsider whether steps could be taken to make british representation in Roumania more impressive.(c) Invited the Committee on the German Oil Position to revise their report at regular intervals, in the light offurther information.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,April 2, 1940.
