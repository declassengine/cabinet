The coal situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the lord privy Seal on the Coal Situation (WP. (G.) (40) 66).The Lord Privy Seal said that one of the salient points of thesituation was the dependence of London and the South Coast uponsea-borne coal for two-thirds of the supplies required by PublicUtility Undertakings. It was much to the credit of the Ministryof Shipping that, while the numbers of ships engaged in the coast-wise traffic had fallen by half, two-thirds of the normal coal supply had been carried. The situation might not have become critical butfor an accumulation of troubles after Christmas. Plans had beenmade by the Mines Department for additional coal to be carriedon the railways, but the amount so carried had fallen short ofexpectations. Just at the time when some increase was urgently needed, traffic on the railways had been almost entirely immobilised by bad weather. When the situation became acute, the ministers concerned had met to make a concerted attack upon the problem.In spite of other demands the Ministry of Shipping had been ableto allocate twelve additional ships to the coal traffic. The admiralty had released two colliers recently requisitioned, as well as certainsmaller vessels, and had also agreed to modify the arrangementsfor the arming of ships against air attack. As regards railways,the first essential had been to overcome the extreme congestion inthe colliery sidings and marshalling yards. The Ministry ofTransport and the Mines Department had been successful in dealingwith this problem. The Ministry of Transport had also obtainedpriority for the time being for coal traffic on the railways, andhad arranged a considerable programme of special trains to bringcoal to the south. These were to be complete trains, each despatched to a single destination. As a result of these measures the suppliesof coal were sufficient to keep pace with current consumption, butthe situation would remain precarious until the end of March. a plan for building up stocks during the summer was now in preparation, and would be submitted later for the approval of theWar Cabinet.The Secretary for Mines said that the position could not be described as satisfactory so long as we were compelled to live fromhand to mouth. Fewer complaints were, however, now being received in London and the south, and in the north of england the situation showed a definite improvement. Stocks at PublicUtility Undertakings remained stationary, amounting on theaverage to four weeks&apos; supply. He had been in touch with leading members of the Opposition Parties and had taken special steps todeal with difficulties to which they drew attention. While thegeneral situation had improved, local shortages were still liableto occur and would call for special remedial action.The President of the Board of Trade thought that as muchhad been done as could be done to improve matters. Althoughthe situation had become easier over the week-end, there would stillbe some risk of further trouble until the end of March.The Minister of Transport referred to the request made forabsolute priority for coal traffic. The Transport Priority Sub-Committee had only been able to agree to limited priority for alimited time. Priority for coal traffic, which was extremely slow-moving, was especially damaging to the interests of other traffic on the railways. The programme of special trains was runningto schedule, though in one case there had been some delay inunloading the coal received. He agreed that the programme ofspecial trains should be continued through the summer, even atthe cost of much dislocation. But he doubted whether a satisfactory solution could be found without some reform in the system of distribution, which would enable whole trains carrying coal to bemade up without passing through the marshalling yards.[20956] B 2
The Secretary for Mines said that his Department were already working on these lines, but some persuasion was required to securethe agreement of the merchants.The Lord Privy Seal said that the proposed reorganisation ofthe method of distribution was to be further considered as partof a long-term policy being prepared for consideration by the WarCabinet. The chief need was, however, an increase in the amountof sea-borne coal.The War Cabinet : (i) Took note of the Report on the coal situation by the lord privy Seal (W.P. (G.) (40) 66).(ii) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to submit a further Report,at a later date, formulating proposals for a long-term policy, which would secure adequate stocks of coal bythe beginning, of next winter.Diversion ofShipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 56thConclusions,Minute 3.)Construction ofconcrete ships.(previous reference:2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Transport on Diversion of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (40) 57).At the Meeting referred to in the margin the recommendation inparagraph 13 (d) of this Memorandum had been approved, andthe remainder deferred for further consideration.(i) Chartering of Dutch coasters.   (Paragraph 13 (a) of W.P. (G.)(40) 57.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would do his best to persuade the Netherlands Government to facilitatechartering of Dutch coasters, but that he was not very hopeful ofbeing able to secure a satisfactory result.The Minister of Shipping said that the Minister for economic warfare had not been able to suggest any means within his sphere,by which pressure could be brought to bear on the Dutch.The Minister without Portfolio referred to the increasing extent to which Dutch coasters had been taking a share of theBritish coasting trade before the war, and suggested that we might indicate that if they hoped to share in this traffic after the war,they must help us in the present emergency.(2) Construction of additional coaster tonnage. (Paragraph 13 (b)of W.P. (G.) (40) 57.)The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, as it took at leastnine months to build a new vessel, it was only by requisitioningand chartering that any relief could be found for our immediate difficulties. In any case the berths suitable for building coasterswere at present largely occupied by mine-sweepers and navalauxiliaries. The possibility was being explored of obtaining somevessels from the Canadian Great Lakes. Twenty concrete bargesof 200 tons each had been ordered and investigations were also being made into the practicability of building concrete ships both for ocean going service and for the coasting trade.   This methodW.M. (39) 106th 0f construction used only two-thirds the quantity of steel requiredConclusions, for the normal method of construction (much of it in the form of minute 1.) rods and bars and not of plates) and also made use of an entirely different type of labour of which there was not the same shortage.He mentioned in passing that some 7,500 additional men had started work in the shipyards since the 1st February, but that these hadbeen largely absorbed into urgent repair work.   g^^.He was arranging for the construction of fesw. experimental ^o s/-rJ--rU&apos;     concrete shipfc, esm offeoOO tono and-e-no of 1,000 tono, and he hoped&apos; that the War Cabinet&quot; would agree with him that the possibilitiesof this method of construction should be most thoroughly explored.
There was general agreement with the view that for the reasons give by the First Lord this was most desirable.(3) The decision to put into effect large-scale-diversion. (Paragraph13 (c) of W.P. (G.) (40) 57.)The Prime Minister pointed out that the War Cabinet wouldnot decide-on a policy of large-scale diversion until they were driven to do so by the pressure of events, and that in practice the onlywarning which could be given would be that attacks on the east coast were increasing in intensity.The Minister of Transport appreciated this, but wished toemphasise that extra notice, even of a day or two, would be of very great value in improving the efficiency of the arrangements.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that pressure on the West Coast ports would not in any case become acute until about a week after the decision had been given to put diversion intoeffect. The plans for dealing with the problem should, therefore,be based on one week being available to all the Departmentsconcerned to bring the necessary arrangements into full operation.The Secretary of State for Air urged that the preparations for dealing with shipping at the West Coast ports should be pressed forward as a matter of urgency. The Air Staff had calculated that, since the 1st December, 1939, 263 vessels had been attackedfrom the air, resulting in 25 sinkings and 51 cases in which therehad been damage or loss of life. Never, however, had more than35 German aircraft operated over the North Sea at any one time,and the aircraft engaged had been drawn from only 8 per cent, ofthe units of the German Air Striking Force. It was hoped thatthe new dispositions made in conjunction with the Admiralty would afford a considerable measure of protection. But we had to reckonwith longer hours of daylight and also with the probability offurther night attacks, which presented a very difficult problem. in short, we had to face the risk of far more intensive air attack onour trade, which might very well be coupled with attacks on landobjectives. The Allied Military Committee, in their recent Appre-ciation of German Action in the Spring of 1940,* had suggestedthat attacks of this nature might verv well provide the Germanswith their best chance of securing decisive results.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, while all possible measures would be taken to defend our East Coast shipping from attack, we must be ready for the possibility that such attacks would achieve a considerable measure of success. Neither he nor his advisers at the Admiralty were satisfied with the present, positionin regard to preparations for diversion to the West Coast. he doubted whether the Minister of Transport possessed adequatepowers for dealing with the situation. As his Memorandum showed,in too many instances he could only discuss the matter or consult with some other Department. He had no powers to give executiveorders that would be obeyed at once by all the Departmentsconcerned. The Port and Transit Organisation was not, he thought,altogether a satisfactory body, nor was it able to give promptdecisions. Fie gave instances in which delays had occurred, and hadbeen reported, but in regard to which prompt remedial action hadnot been taken. Further, in an emergency the ports would have towork 24 hours a day. Although the Air Ministry were ready toagree to the necessary relaxation of lighting restrictions, results were slow in coming.As regards oil for the Admiralty, a new pipe-line fromGlasgow to the Forth would be available in May or June, and thiswould make it unnecessary for Admiralty tankers to enter the* M.R. (J.) (40) 10.
dangerous area on the East Coast; but, in general, the positionwould be far from satisfactory if a dangerous situation weresuddenly to develop.Sir Horace Wilson said that a Memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty dealing with this matter had been before a meetingof officials on the previous afternoon. It had appeared to them thatthe Minister of Transport possessed ample powers, in the event of diversion being ordered, to deal with the situation which would arise.The First Lord of the A dmiralty suggested that the responsible minister required these overriding powers at once, possibly in a modified form, in order to secure that the necessary preparations were pushed forward without delay.The Minister of Transport said that he had not previouslyheard that the naval staff, who were represented on the Port and transit Organisation, were dissatisfied with its working. He washoping, as a result of the consideration of his present proposals, toreceive a decision from the War Cabinet which would enable himto insist on the action required from other Departments. He dealtwith the particular instances mentioned by the First Lord of theAdmiralty, and said that the coercion of Government departments in the matter of removing goods under their control was madedifficult by the fact that the Treasury, for instance, had not seentheir way to authorise penalty rents to be charged on Government-owned stores.The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that the War Cabinet hadalready authorised &quot; the Ministers concerned to take immediate steps to complete the necessary plans, &amp;o,&quot; and that it was now necessary to see that immediate use was made of these powers.The Prime Minister thought that a member of the War cabinet should be ultimately responsible for a matter such as this, whichconcerned so many Departments. He therefore suggested that theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence should superintend thenecessary plans and preparations. There was general agreementwith this view.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister for Economic warfare and the Minister of Shipping, to approach the. Netherlands Government with a view to securing their assistance in chartering Dutch coasters,(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to take any steps for constructing additional coasting vessels that wouldnot interfere with more urgent requirements.(iii) Approved the proposal of the First Lord of the Admiraltythat steps should be taken to explore thoroughly thepossibility of constructing concrete ships, both ocean-going vessels and coasters.(iv) Reaffirmed their decision . that large-scale diversion ofshipping from East Coast ports should be adopted only if forced upon us by enemy action, and agreed that suchdiversion should be introduced only on the authority ofthe War Cabinet,(v) Reaffirmed their decision that the Ministers concerned should take immediate steps to complete the necessaryplans and arrangements for dealing with diversion ofshipping from the East to the West Coast ports, shouldthe need arise.
(vi) Invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to supervise the action of all the. Departments concernedin this matter, and to report further to the War cabinet if, in his view, additional poAvers were required toenable rapid progress to be made with the necessary preparations.The Air 3.   The Secretary of State for Air said that four raids hadSituation. been plotted on the previous day.   Fighters had been sent up, but(Previous no interceptions had been made.reference:W.M. (40) 59thConclusions,Minute 1.)A Blenheim had attacked a U-boat in the Heligoland Bightwhen returning from a reconnaissance flight; a direct hit had beenobtained, and it was thought that the U-boat had been destroyed.Patrols had been carried out over Borkum and Sylt on theprevious night. The aerodrome at Borkum had been seen to belit up, but on the aircraft flying low, the lights had beenextinguished.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.U-boat sunk.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M.

(40) 55thConclusions,Minute 4.)Use of convoysby neutrals.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the S.S. PacificReliance (6,700 tons) bad been sunk by torpedo or mine off Land&apos;sEnd on the previous day.The British tanker Charles F. Meyer (10,500 tons) had been torpedoed while in convoy in the Channel. It was hoped that she would be towed safely to port.A U-boat had been attacked by H.M.S. Leith and H.M.S.Venetia on the previous day with promising results.The First Lord expressed his warm thanks to the Army for providing 500 detachments armed with Lewis guns or Bren guns for the protection of East Coast shipping against low-flying attack.This prompt assistance should prove most valuable.The First Lord also gave the War Cabinet particulars of theships using the Norwegian convoys, referred to at the previous meeting, which showed that the vast majority of the ships in these convoys were under a neutral flag. The position was significant inrelation to the previous week&apos;s shipping losses (26th February-3rd March). This showed that, while Great Britain had lost only ,800 tons of shipping, the Germans in the same period had lost18,400 tons as a result of their numerous scuttlings. Up to date,of 1,075 neutral ships which had been convoyed, only two hadbeen lost. The chances against being sunk when in convoy were430 to 1 in the case of British ships, and 537 to 1 in the caseof neutral ships. He proposed to refer to these figures in a public statement in regard to the results of the previous week.The First Lord thought that it might be advantageous to make an offer to neutrals of insurance for all ships which sailed in ourconvoys.   The Admiralty had the matter under examination.
Location ofGermanwarships.Interception of italian vesselscarryingGerman coal.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 59thConclusions,Minute 7.)In reply to a question, the Chief of Naval Staff said that,,owing to the ease with which German warships could be movedbetween the North Sea and Baltic ports, it would not be possibleto know the whereabouts of German ships witlh certainty untilsimultaneous reconnaissance could be carried out at both ends ofthe Kiel Canal. It was hoped that this would be possible in thenear future. At the present moment, however, the Admiralty didnot think that any German raiders were out.The Prime Minister referred to the press statement that sixItalian ships had been ordered to sail from Rotterdam with cargoes of coal. He asked where these ships would be stopped if theyattempted to pass through our blockade.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the ships wouldbe stopped either in the Straits of Dover, or by our northern patrols,or in the Straits of Gibraltar.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that itmight be worth while studying what the position would be if Italysent warships to convoy her colliers.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 59thConclusions,Minute 8.)Number and quality ofGermanDivisions.5. The Secretary of State for War said that three more german Divisions had been identified one in Poland and two inthe centre of Germany bringing the total to 163.The General Staff were undertaking an examination of thesefigures, in collaboration with the French, to arrive at a correctappraisement of the quality of the various formations. There wasno doubt that many of these German Divisions were in a verybackward state of training and equipment.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to 6.   The Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of StateFinland. for Foreign Affairs gave the War Cabinet the latest information(Previous regarding the situation in Finland.Reference: A record of the discussion which took place, and of theW.M. (40) 59th conclusions reached, is contained in the secretary&apos;s Standard FileConclusions, of War Cabinet Conclusions.Minute 6.)War Finance.First War Loan.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 90thConclusions,Minute 10.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, up to date, thewar had been financed by the additional taxation imposed; by theamounts received from National Savings Certificates and NationalDefence Bonds (approximately  100 millions had been received upto date); and by a moderate increase in Treasury Bills. he proposed to announce in the House of Commons that afternoon thefirst of our War Loans. It was proposed to invite subscriptions for 300 millions at 3 per cent., to be issued at par, the date ofredemption being 1955 to 1959. The list would be opened on the morning of Tuesday, the 12th March, and would be closed 24 hourslater. The terms of this Loan were considerably more favourable tothe Government than the first Loan in the Great War, which hadbeen issued at 3^- per cent, at 95. He was advised that there wasa good prospect that the Loan would be taken up. Success in thismatter would have a favourable effect on public confidence.The War Cabinet took note of this statement, which they regarded as a remarkable achievement for British finance.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 5, 1940.
