The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 72ndConclusions,Minute 4.)reconnaissance of heligoland bight.Raid on island of Sylt,19th March.1. The Secretary of State for Air said there had been littleenemy air activity during the previous day, and no interceptionshad been made by fighters. ,During the morning six Blenheims had carried out a reconnais-sance flight in the Heligoland Bight area, with the object of locatingand attacking flak ships. Three ships had been sighted, and somebombs dropped, but without result.From 5-45 p.m. until midnight, 50 aircraft of the bomber command (30 Whitleys and 20 Hampdens), had taken off in succes-sion to attack the seaplane base at Hornum on the Island of Sylt.All except one Whitley had returned safely. The one aircraft lostwas believed to have been shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Thirty-five tons of bombs had been dropped, including high explosive and incendiary. Full reports had not yet been received, but it was certain that heavy and extensive damage had been done. The sea-plane base had been consistently hit, and two hangars had been seen to be on fire. There had been heavy anti-aircraft fire, but, so far,only one fighter was reported to have been seen.A number of Blenheims had been sent out to make a photo-graphic reconnaissance over Sylt that morning, if conditions provedsuitable.The Germans had sent out three broadcasts : The first, at midnight, said: &quot; English bombers have attempted to attack Sylt, but, apart from one house set on fire,there has been no further damage, thanks to anti-aircraft guns.One British plane was shot down.&quot;The second, at 4-15 a.m. said : &quot; The attack on Sylt shouldbe regarded as an act of English propaganda, designed to glossover the devastating impression of the Scapa Flow attack.This is confirmed by the fact that the B.B.C. and Reuterpublished the news as a great success while the attack was stillin progress. In point of fact, the attack was beaten off entirely,thanks to the excellent German defences.&quot;The third broadcast, at 5 a.m., said: &quot;No militarydamage was done, but the large scale of the raid suggests thatwe may have done more damage to warships than the Britishadmit.   Hence they are so anxious to destroy the base.&quot;It appeared from the trend of these broadcasts that the germans were trying to minimise the incident, but, nevertheless, we must beprepared for further reprisals. In discussion, it was suggested that further attacks might be made on Scapa, or possibly on aerodromeson the coast.The Chief of the Air Staff said that all the defences were onthe alert, especially as a reconnaissance over Scapa had beenreported during the morning.The Secretary of State for War suggested that it would bereassuring to the public if it were possible to make known thenumber of aircraft which had taken part in the raid on Sylt. Therewas a tendency to disparage the efforts of our defences at Scapa,because only one enemy aircraft out of fourteen had been shot down.Such criticism would be silenced if it were known that in the raidon Sylt we had only lost one out of fifty.The Prime Minister thought it would be desirable for theSecretary of State for Air to make a statement on the raid inParliament that afternoon, and that consideration should be givento the inclusion of something on the lines suggested by the Secretaryof State for War, even if it were not advisable to give actual figures.[21026] &quot; b 2
He enquired whether there was any further evidence,particularly in the raid on Scapa, of German aircraft starting outon a mission, but returning without reaching their objective.The Chief of the Air Staff said that there was no definite evidence of this kind in connection with the Scapa raid, though there had been previous evidence, both from observations and fromthe remarks of prisoners.In reply to further enquiries about details of the raid on Sylt,he said that, when full reports had been studied, he would be ableto give the War Cabinet accurate information on such matters asthe quality of the defences and the methods of attack which hadbeen followed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40)conclusions minute 5.)Attack onTJ-boat.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet certain information about the movements of the Fleet and theNorwegian convoys.There had been no enemy attacks on shipping either from the72nd air or by submarines.Three anti-submarine trawlers had carried out attacks on agood contact the day before. Large quantities of oil had come tothe surface.The Armed Merchant Cruiser Carinthia and the armed merchant Cruiser Cilicia had been in collision north of LoughSwilly. The latter had been badly damaged and was returning tothe Clyde.H.M.S. Jervis. H.M.S. Jervis had reached the Tyne safely after the collisionreported to the War Cabinet the day before.It was unfortunate that the Americans had let out the news ofthe forthcoming sailing of the Queen Mary and the Mauretania, butit was thought unlikely that the Germans would be able to send out a raider in time to molest them.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Military 3.   The Secretary of State for War said that one more GermanSituation. Division had been identified in the centre of Germany; one, which(Previous had coine from Posen, had been identified in the back area oppositeEeference: Holland; and one, from central Germany, had been identified in theW.M. (40) 72nd Eiffel area.   The total of German Divisions on the Western FrontConclusions,Minute 6.)Distribution ofGermanDivisions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 64thConclusions,Minute 3.)Probableobjective of aGermanoffensive.was now put at between 104 and 118.The Prime Minister enquired whether, if a German offensive on the Western Front materialised, it would probably be againstHolland and Belgium.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the maximumconcentration of German troops was between the Rhine and the
southern end of Luxembourg. The number concentrated in this area was about the same as the number of Divisions which had marchedthrough Belgium in 1914.The Prime Minister enquired whether the French defencesbehind Luxembourg were in a satisfactory condition.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he wasspending Easter with General Gamelin and intended to examineparticularly these defences.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Italian-german relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 71stConclusions,Minute 4.)Information asto possible intentions.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 26 from the British Minister at the Vatican,containing an account of Mr. Sumner Welles&apos;s audience with the pope and of a subsequent conversation between the Pope andMr. Myron Taylor. The Pope had expressed the opinion that &apos;&apos; theGermans would not start a land offensive for a month though theymight attack strongly by sea and air, and by the end of that period the situation would be greatly changed.&quot; He also thought thatMr. Roosevelt could &quot;do much to ensure Signor Mussolini&apos;smaintenance of the position of non-belligerency &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; believedthat France and Great Britain should work towards the same end.&quot;The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a telegram had just been received from the naval staff at Malta reporting that Italiannaval activities were proceeding normally. Individuals were receiving leave freely and families were being sent to the dodecanese and to Libya. Cypher traffic was normal, and norestrictions had been imposed on the sailing of Italia,n ships, eitherinside or outside the Mediterranean.At the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the Chief of theImperial General Staff undertook to convey the contents of this telegram to the Allied Staff who were conducting conversations withthe Turks at Aleppo.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Western Front.Possible german attack on theNetherlands oron theNetherlandsand Belgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 72ndConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, asauthorised by the War Cabinet the previous day, he had despatchedtelegrams to our representatives at Brussels and The Hague. Ithad, however, been pointed out to him that the Belgian government might very well complain if, without informing them, we were toconfide to the Netherlands Government all that had passed between ourselves and the Belgian Government. It was particularly important not to upset our relations with the Belgians. He had therefore added a sentence to the telegram to our Minister at TheHague (No. 8, Saving), telling him not to act on it without further instructions. He had also altered the telegram to Brussels (No. 7,Saving), and had instructed our Ambassador to tell M. Spaak thatwe proposed ourselves shortly to approach the Dutch direct. Hethought that this would make it difficult for the Belgians, eitherto ask us not to do so, or to complain that we were acting over their heads, and that it would also encourage them to approach theNetherlands Government quickly themselves.The War Cabinet approved the action taken by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
France.Resignation ofM. Daladier.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 72ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Supreme WarCouncil:proposal for meeting.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 72ndConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that M. Daladier had now resigned his position ashead of the French Government. Before hearing of this, he (theForeign Secretary) had already decided that it would be unwise, inview of the French political situation, to approach the french ambassador, in accordance with the decision of the War Cabineton the previous day, with an explanation of our reasons for notfavouring immediate action in Norwegian territorial waters.He was afraid that M. Daladier&apos;s resignation would also makeit impossible to secure an early meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil. He intended to see M. Corbin at once to obtain the latest information as to the position.Sir Ronald Campbell, who was now in London, had informed sir Alexander Cadogan on the previous day that he had heard fromM. Leger that M. Daladier had already made up his mind to resign.He was very sore at the volume of internal criticism which he hadto face, and M. Leger did not know whether he intended merely to effect an immediate reconstruction of his Government, or definatly to go out of office with a view to returning after some time. TheChamber had met at 3 in the afternoon and had continued in secret session until 3 a.m. that morning, when on a vote of censure239 Deputies had voted for the Government, 1 had voted against,while 300 had abstained. The vote for the Government had beenweaker than had been expected. It was quite clear, however, thatthe criticism of the Government was not based on any desire for peace, but on a desire for a more energetic prosecution of the War.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Iron Ore:German importsfrom Sweden.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 71stConclusions,Minute 7.)Proposedcommunicationto scandinavian government.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 72ndConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatM. Corbin had told the Foreign Office that the French Embassy at berne had recently received information from Herr Thyssen on thestate of the German metallurgical industry. Herr Thyssen hadbeen told by a former colleague, whom he had seen in Switzerland,that the plants in the Ruhr were now shut down for three days aweek owing to the shortage of raw materials. The foreign secretary thought that this information, if confirmed, was of greatimportance, and that we must keep ourselves free to seize any opportunity to interfere with the supplies of iron-ore to germany from Sweden. He thought that the communication to theNorwegian and Swedish Governments which he had outlined to theWar Cabinet the previous day might take the form of saying that recent events had led us to review the whole situation in scandinavia, and made it necessary for us to formulate our policyanew. We should make it plain that we should regard certainforms of action by the Scandinavian Government as threatening ourvital interests; for example, any increase in the supplies of ore toGermany, or even perhaps a change in the situation which renderedthe continuance of the existing supplies of more crucial importance.In this way we might build up foundations that would make future action possible, and it might also help us to make clear to the French that we were not merely letting the situation drift.The War Cabinet expressed general approval of the lineindicated by the Foreign Secretary, and agreed that theDominion Governments should be kept informed of the developments of our policy in this matter.
British Land 8.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumForces in by the Secretary of State for War on the Higher Command of the france. British Land Forces operating in France (W.P. (40) 99).Position of theOommander-in- The Secretary of State for War said that it had been arrangedChief in relation that the agreement which had been reached between the Chief ofto the French the Imperial General Staff and General Gamelin regarding theHigh Command, relationship between the Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary(Previous Force and the French High Command should be confirmed in reference: writing.   For this purpose, he had submitted, for the approval of w.M. (40) 58th the War Cabinet, a draft letter from the Chief of the ImperialConclusions, General Staff to General Gamelin.Minute 5.)The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had nodoubt that General Gamelin would accept the arrangement set outin the draft letter.The War Cabinet (i) Approved the draft letter from the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to General Gamelin.(ii) Took note that, in accordance with paragraph 2 of his memorandum, the Secretary of State for War would, indue course, circulate to the War Cabinet revised instruc-tions to the Commander-in-Chief of the british expeditionary Force.Royal Air Force. 9. The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumProposed by the Chiefs of Staff Committee (W.P. (40) 102) recommending thewithdrawal of withdrawal of 2 R.A.F. Bomber Squadrons from Singapore to2 Bomber India.Squadrons from singapore to The Chief of the Air Staff explained the main points in the india. Memorandum and gave particulars of the air forces which would remain at Singapore after this withdrawal.In reply to a question by the First Lord of the Admiralty, hesaid that he thought it would be possible to leave some at least ofthe spares at Singapore, as these could, if necessary, be used for the2. Blenheim Squadrons which would remain at Singapore. Theaircraft and their crews would fly to India, but the rest of the personnel of the squadrons would go by sea. If, later, it wasnecessary to reinforce Singapore, the aircraft could be flown back from India, and the men could follow by sea in about a week.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that by way of reassuring publicopinion in the Straits Settlements prominence should be given, atthe time of their withdrawal, to the fact that these squadrons couldbe very quickly brought back from India.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs referred to theinterest which was taken by Australia and New Zealand in thedefence of Singapore. He recalled that, at our request,5 destroyers of the Australian Navy had, with the consent of theAustralian Government, been sent from Singapore to theMediterranean. He therefore suggested that it would be bothpolitic and courteous that we should consult the Australian andNew  Zealand   Governments  before   actually  withdrawing   the
2 Bomber Squadrons. This would take only 2 or 3 days, and he hadno doubt but that they would agree.The War Cabinet-Approved the withdrawal of 2 Bomber Squadrons from singapore to India, subject to the condition that this moveshould not be carried out until the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs had consulted the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand and obtained their concurrence in this step.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 20, 1940.
