The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minute 2.)E.A.F. activity.Enemy activity.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that bad weather had prevented bombing operations against objectives in Norway on theprevious night.One Hudson aircraft had not returned from a reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast. Two of the three Hudsons sent to provideair escort for three French destroyers returning from operations inthe Skagerrak had encountered two Messerschmitts 109 and hadbeen shot down. A relief escort of three Blenheims had also had an engagement with German fighters, in which some of our crews hadbeen wounded.   The damage to the enemy was not known.Three   Hudsons   had   patrolled   the   Andalsnes   area   for40 minutes on the previous day, but had not sighted any enemy,aircraft.  It appeared doubtful whether the Hudson was a suitabletype of machine for this work and the Air Ministry had the matter under consideration.On the previous evening some 20 or more enemy aircraft hadbeen plotted approaching the Wick-Kirkwall area. Three of these aircraft had reached Scapa and two bombs had been droppedwithout causing damage. The enemy had probably retired owingto bad weather.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Britishsubmarines.Attacks onU-boats.Operations byFrenchdestroyers.Trondhjem.Shipping losses.Miningoperations.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, whileH.M. Submarine Tarpon must be considered lost, hope forH.M. Submarine Sterlet would not be abandoned until the27th April.H.M. Submarine Tetrarch, for whose safety anxiety had been felt, had now reported. Owing to continued attacks by Germanunits, she had been forced to remain below the surface for a periodof forty hours.The French Submarine Orphee had fired two torpedoes at two-boats on the 21st April. Two explosions had been heard and the-Orphee considered the attack to have been successful.Three French destroyers had carried out a sweep in theSkagerrak on the night of the 23rd-24th April. They had sunkone German trawler and one motor torpedo boat and had damaged a second trawler. They had been bombed, without result, by enemy aircraft on their return journey.A report had been received that a cruiser of the Flipper class and three destroyers were at Trondhjem.. The Admiralty felt thatthe presence of the Hipper class cruiser was very doubtful, but airreconnaissances from the carriers would no doubt clear thematter up.Shipping losses during the previous twenty-four hours were asfollows : S.S. Stokesay (1,149 tons), bound from Antwerp to London,had sunk after an explosion when north of the Downs.- Nosurvivors.S.S. Rydal Force (1,100 tons), bound from Sunderland,mined when north of the Downs.   Two survivors.Both ships had been in a dangerous area at the time.The Minister without Portfolio raised a question with regardto certain mining operations between Denmark and Sweden.Particulars of the discussion on this point and of the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.[21211]b 2
Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minute 4.)Narvik.Namsos.Andalsnes andthe SouthernPront.3. The War Cabinet were given the following information asto the position : (i) H.M.S. Resolution would arrive at Narvik during thecourse of that day. A bombardment had been carriedout on the previous day with the object of destroying theGerman pillboxes, but owing to heavy snow the resultshad been most disappointing. A Swede was reported tohave arrived in Sweden from Narvik by rail. He had had to make two changes owing to damage to therailway, but did not appear to have had any difficulty incompleting his journey.(ii) The S.S. Blaekheath should have completed unloadingstores at Namsos. The First British Brigade landed namsos had commandeered all available vehicles fortheir advance on Steinkjaer. This had caused difficultyfor the French who, in addition, had lost a considerable part of their stores through bombing. Food supplies hadbeen sent to them in a destroyer. The Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, was examining the possibility of pro-viding a Naval Working Party at Namsos where no local labour was available. Naval ratings had provedinvaluable in assisting to land stores at Andalsnes.(iii) General Carton de Wiart had reported that he was nolonger in contact with the enemy, who were diggingthemselves in immediately north of Steinkjaer. Hisforward troops were at Meieri, 20 miles South ofBangsund. He anticipated difficulties in landing andtransporting heavy A.A. guns at Namsos. General deWiart&apos;s Staff and Base personnel had left for Namsoson the 23rd April. No further news had been receivedabout the French at Namsos. It was to be feared thatthey had probably lost much of their ammunition.Colonel Dawson was due to arrive at Namsos at 5 a.m.on the 26th April.(iv) H.M.S. Curacao had been damaged by a near miss.   she had sustained some forty casualties and was now beingescorted home.(v) The retreat of the Allied forces continued, and the lastreports indicated that the British troops were being hardpressed in the Otta Dombaas No British troops were in the Osterdalen Sector where the Germans were reported to have reached Tynset. Admiral Evansreported that they had reached that place by train. if so, this pointed to a collapse of resistance in the Renaarea.(vi) It was hoped that Gladiators would by this time be operating from the frozen lake at Lesgescogen, betweenAndalsnes and Dombaas. In this connection attention was drawn to an article in the Evening Standard theprevious night, which referred to a &quot; Policy of surprise,&quot; but hinted clearly at the possibility of Britishfighters operating from Norway. It was agreed thatthe publication of this article, which had not beensubmitted to the Censor, was intolerable.The Secretary of State for Air undertook to take thematter up with the Newspaper concerned.(vii) Anxiety was expressed as to the position on the lightrailway from Koppang to Storen. The War cabinet were informed that arrangements were being made to fly special demolition personnel to the aerodrome atLesgescogen. If conditions permitted, they would flythence to a frozen lake at Roeros, on the light railway.
The Norwegians were said to have about 1,000 trained men at Roeros, but they were very short of arms.(viii) The Prime Minister presumed that the general instructionsto the Commanders in charge of operations on the spotwould be that they should make every endeavour to stabilise the position South of Andalsnes, with a view toholding up the German advance.The Secretary of State for War explained that theinstructions given to the leading battalion of the15th Brigade were to try to secure Dombaas, where thesituation was critical and demanded all availablereinforcements.Telegram from (ix) The Secretary of State for&apos; War read a telegram from theNorwegian Norwegian Commander-in-Chief, giving his personalOommander-in- appreciation.   In this he reported that his troops wereChief. exhausted and harassed by continuous bombing and machine-gunning from the air. Long-range artilleryhad also made its first appearance. All important points and railway junctions from Andalsnes to the front linewere being destroyed. Communications were seriouslyinterrupted. The situation was critical, and he appealedurgently for further help. The Secretary of State forWar read the draft of the reply which it was proposedthat the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should sendencouraging the Norwegians to hold out and informing them of the British help which was on its way to them,and which included fighter aircraft.x) The Minister without Portfolio raised the question ofdespatching aircraft to Narvik to support our land operations.It was explained that the Admiralty and AirMinistry were already exploring the possibility of operating float-planes.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to see whether any further action could be taken in the matter.The War Cabinet took note of the above state-ment.Italy.Naval situationin theMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 98thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that HALS. malaya and HALS. Royal Sovereign were now at Gibraltar. The subsequentmoves of these two ships must now be considered.The Chief of Naval Staff said that these ships would be wantedin the Eastern Mediterranean in the event of war with Italy. Itwould be most undesirable that these ships should have to passbetween Tunis and Sicily after war had broken out. He thought,therefore, that advantage should be taken of the present easing ofthe situation vis-a-vis Italy to move the two Battleships, at any rate as far as Malta.This course was agreed to. It was thought, however, that itwould be better that the ships should not remain at Malta, but should go straight on to Alexandria after embarking theCommander-in-Chief at Malta.Should the Italian Government be informed of this move before it was made ? It was pointed out that it had been our practice toinform the Italians before we moved any large units to or from theMediterranean. On the other hand, the addition of these ships would not involve an increase in the Mediterranean Fleet beyond
its normal strength. If we decided to inform the Italian Govern-ment of the move, we might say that, owing to the heavy Germanlosses, we were now in a position to revert to a more normal disposi-tion of our Fleet strength.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saw no objectionto the move, but said that he would like to consider whether theItalians should be informed before the move was made.The War Cabinet-(a) Authorised the Admiralty to order H.M.S. Malaya andHALS. Royal Sovereign to proceed to Alexandria assoon as possible.(b) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to informthe Admiralty whether or not it was desirable to informthe Italian Government of the move of these two shipsbefore they entered the Mediterranean.Egypt. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that HisPosition in       Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo had raised the question whether, ifevent of war      Italy came into the war against us, we should take steps to makebetween the      Egypt declare war against Italy also.   The Commanding OfficersAllies and Italy. 0^ tne three Services in the Middle East all agreed that in thecircumstances contemplated it was essential that Egypt should comeinto the war, and that there should be no difficulty in achieving this.The Foreign Secretary suggested that, provided the Chiefs of Staffconcurred, he should issue the necessary instructions to Sir miles lampson, without further reference to the War Cabinet.   Therewas some evidence to show that the Italians were anxious to keepEgypt out of the war, the Italian Minister having told King Faroukthat Italy had no quarrel with his country.The Prime Minister thought that, if Italy declared war onus, Egypt would inevitably find herself at war with Italy. He-agreed with the course of action proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The War Cabinet agreed That, provided the Chiefs of Staff saw no objection on military grounds, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Cairo,that, in the event of Italy coming into the war against us,he should take steps to secure that Egypt also declared war against Italy.Italy.Attitude ofTurkey in eventof attack on yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreian Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 315 DIPP, dated the 24th April, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, setting out the terms of theTurkish Governments reply to our enquiry as to their attitude inthe event of Italy committing an act of aggression againstYugoslavia. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen thought that the reply meant that in theory the Turkish Government agreed with us that an Italian attack should be resisted, but felt that nothing should be sacrificed to the governing consideration of the war withGermany; in consequence, they wished, in the first place, toascertain the views of the three General Staffs as to the possibilityof resisting an Italian attack at the present time with an earlyprospect of success. Sir Hughe was convinced that the TurkishGovernment were greatly influenced by the relative strength andweakness of our own forces, especially naval, at present in theEastern Mediterranean.
Western Front. 7.   In reply to the Prime Minister, the Chief of the ImperialAction to be General Staff said that he had ascertained that there was notaken if the foundation for the report referred to at the previous meeting of theNetherlands or War Cabinet that in two recent scares of German invasion BritishBelgium is troops had actually crossed the frontier into Belgium,invaded. Tllf, War Cabinet took note of the above statement.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minute 7.)Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,April 25, 1940.
