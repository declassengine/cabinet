The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 91stConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.E.A.F. activity.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that during theprevious twenty-four hours there had been little enemy air activitynear our coasts.CoastalCommandoperations.Attacks onStavangeraerodrome.Blenheims from the Bomber Command had set off to make a reconnaissance of Wilhemshaven, but had been unable to approachtheir objective owing to the absence of cloud cover.Fifteen Hampdens had successfully laid mines in the Beltsduring the night. The weather had been fine, and they had picked up their landmarks without difficulty. One aircraft had failed toreach home.Bad weather had prevented air activity in France.Aircraft of the Coastal Command had carried out the followingoperations : (a) One Fludson had attacked three flak ships without result.(b) One Sunderland had reported that on 12th April onebattleship, one cruiser, and one destroyer had been seen in Stor Fjord.(c) Two Hudson aircraft had bombed Stavanger aerodrome.(d) One Hudson aircraft on reconnaissance had reported two cruisers at christians and (South), twenty to thirty air-craft on Stavanger aerodrome, and twelve seaplanes atmoorings near by. When over Stavanger, this aircraft had been attacked by a Messerschmitt 110. The reargunner, though wounded in the hand, had carried ontill the enemy had been shot down in flames.(e) One Blenheim had reported a cruiser off Karmo, and alsosix Messerschmitts 110s patrolling over Stavanger.(/) One Wellington, sent on a long reconnaissance towardsTrondhjem, had failed to return.(g) Three Wellingtons, early on 14th April, had successfullybombed Stavanger aerodrome.   One bomb had fallen onthe runway, one had hit the hangar, and one had fallenamong a group of twelve Heinkels.It was proposed to continue intermittent bombing of Stavangerwhenever opportunity offered.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:&apos; W.M. (40) 91stConclusions,Minute 2.)Attack onNarvik,April 13th:2. The Prime Minister expressed the congratulations of theWar Cabinet to the First Lord of the Admiralty and the first sea Lord for the brilliant operation carried out at Narvik by the-Royal Navy the previous day (April 13th).The First Lord of the Admiralty gave an account of theoperation :-H.M.S. War spite and nine destroyers, supported by aircraft from H.M.S. Furious, had attacked at noon, and had sunk all the seven enemy destroyers there. The aircraft from H.M.S. Warspitehad destroyed a U-boat, but it was intended to keep this secret:No enemy warships were now left at Narvik.In addition, 13 merchant vessels, of which 7 were German, hadbeen taken possession of in Narvik harbour.Enemy aircraft had appeared after the action but had made noattack.
The British casualties had been as follows : H.M.S. Eskimo had had her bows blown off by a torpedo.H.M.S. Cossack had been damaged and had run ashore.H.M.S. Punjabi had had one boiler put out of action.Two aircraft had been lost.Attack OnNarvik,April 10th:H.M.S. Hardy.Naval activity.Submarineoperations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 89thConclusions,Minute 2.)Occupation ofthe faroe islands.Operations inthe Kattegat.Admiral Whitworth had reported that the moral effect of thepresence of HALS. Warspite had been very great, and that theenemy were thoroughly frightened. It was believed that HALS.Warspite had moved down the fjord again after the action, and thatthe Admiral intended to return that day and to occupy Narvik.The situation in Narvik itself was still not known, and furtherreports were awaited.A report had now been received of the casualties in H.M.S.Hardy in the attack on Narvik on 10th April. Five or six Officers,including Captain Warburton Lee, and about twenty-five ratings,had been killed. The remainder had got ashore, and were nowpresumably in touch with our forces.destroy^ers with cruisers in support had carried out an extensive sweep of Stor Fjord, Aalesund, Moide and RomsdallFjord. Contact with the Norwegian Authorities had been made,who reported that no enemy had yet landed at christians and(North) or in Romsdall Fjord; nor were there any enemy warshipsbetween Statlandet and christians and (North). The destroyers had twice been bombed without result, but three German aircraft had been forced down on shore and the crews taken prisoner. ThreeNorwegian and one Danish merchant ships had been sent underguard to Kirkwall.Cruisers and destroyers were searching for enemy forces in theTromso area, and between there and Narvik.Operations by our Submarines might be summarised asfollows : HALS. Sealion had reported that on the 11th April she had sunk the German S.S. August Leonhardt (2,590 tons).HALS. Spearfish had reported that in the early hoursof the 11th April she had attacked a heavy ship off the Skawwhich was almost certainly the Admiral Scheer. She hadfired 6 torpedoes, some of which might have hit.The First Sea Lord said that this report fitted in withthe report made to the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the12th April that the Admiral Scheer had been seen on the11th April east of the Skaw, listing heavily, and escorted bya tug and two destroyers.The First Lord undertook to examine a suggestion thatwe should publish a statement that the Admired Scheer hadbeen hit and damaged by a submarine.Continuing, the First Lord said that H.M.S. Thistle hadnot reported for two days. She had been ordered home, butit was possible that she had been sunk or damaged.H.M.S. Seal had been in a slight collision off South Norwayon the 11th April, but was continuing to operate.H.M.S. Cachalot had been in collision with an Italiansteamer near Whitby on the 13th April but had proceeded tothe Tyne without assistance.A force of Royal Marines had been landed at the Faroes byHALS. Suffolk which was returning.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs enquired whatdegree of interruption was being caused to German traffic to andfrom Norway.   It was most important that everything possible
Action at 3.   In  connection  with  the  previous  Minute,   The  PrimeNarvik. Minister said that he had noticed a curious omission in theB.B.C. announcement of the action at Narvik made by the B.B.C. atannouncement, midnight. At the end of the announcement a reference had beenmade to the previous history of H.M.S. Cossack, but there hadbeen no previous reference to this ship in the announcement itself.It was, therefore, not apparent why her previous history had been mentioned. He had noticed the same curious omission in the communique in the newspaper that morning. In discussion, variousMinisters stated that they had heard in the first announcement,which had been given at 10-45 p.m., the statement that it wasH.M.S. Cossack which had silenced the enemy&apos;s howitzer, but thatthis particular piece of news had, for some reason, been omitted from the second announcement made at midnight.The First Lord of the Admiralty confirmed that it had been included in the communique as issued by the Admiralty.The War Cabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal to investigate this matter.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 89thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that there werereports of increased tension in Holland, that martial law had beenproclaimed, and that the &quot; alert&quot; was in force.should be done to intensify our operations so as to force the germans to take action against Sweden.The First Sea Lord said that it was difficult to tell whatinterruption was being caused, but there were a number of reportsindicating that it was sufficiently serious to make the Germansconsider demanding the right of passage through Sweden.The Minister without Portfolio said that the mines which hadbeen laid in the Belts would greatly affect the traffic. He enquire whether the Sound was also to be mined.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the miningof the Sound had been discussed between the Foreign Office andthe Admiralty. It had been thought better to refrain from miningthe Sound for the moment for political reasons. Rather than put ourselves in the wrong with Sweden by such action he would be inclined to suggest that our submarines should be instructed to operate in Swedish Territorial Waters in the Kattegat if theywere not already doing so. The Foreign Office saw no objection tothis course.The First Sea Lord said he did not think specific orders had yet been issued to submarines to operate in Swedish territorial waters, but he would see that an authorisation was sent out- forthwith.Attacks on The Dutch ship Velocitas (197 tons) had been mined 15 milesshipping. east of North Foreland.   She had been 6 miles out of the sweptchannel.The War Cabinet-(a) Took note of the above discussion.(b) Authorised the Admiralty to issue orders to Britishsubmarines to operate at their discretion in Swedish territorial waters.
A somewhat vague report had also been received by the WarOffice that the French &apos;&apos; were about to put an operation into effect.&apos;&apos;It had been reported at 8 p.m. on the previous day that 16 vessels had been sighted off the Dutch coast steaming South. There hadbeen abnormal wireless traffic in the Munster district, in a form which had not been used before. All the indications pointed tothe possibility of imminent action.The Chief of Naval Staff said that soundings at the FrenchAdmiralty tended to confirm these impressions.The Secretary of State for War reported the military situationin Norway as follows : Kirkenes.Three Norwegian battalions were in this area and couldbe used to reinforce the Narvik area, but the Finns would notgrant them passage through Torneo. The only way to movethem would be by sea.  We should have to provide transport.Narvik.The Germans had apparently advanced up the railway linetowards the Swedish frontier but were reported to have been checked 20 kms. from the frontier itself by a demolished bridge.Trondhjem.The enemy was said to have mounted heavy artillery toguard the port. Norwegian General Headquarters stated thatthere were not more than 1,000 Germans in this area, and theyhad given details of the forces which they could provide toco-operate with landings to the north and south of Trondhjem.The German battleship Lutzow (formerly Deutschland) was said to be at Trondhjem.Bergen and Stavanger.No information.Oslo.Reports were very confusing, but it appeared that theNorwegian troops to the east of the city were holding outthough hard pressed. They were also reported to be still holding Halden. North of Oslo no German troops seemed tohave crossed the river Vorma.Communications from the Norwegian Commander-in-chief and Government emphasised the need to recapture Trondhjem, andfor the early supply of assistance on land and in the air. the norwegians were badly in. want of arms, since many of their arsenalshad been captured before their contents could be cleared out. TheWar Office was examining the possibility of supplying the norwegians with small arms and ammunition, and the Minister ofSupply was seeing whether further supplies of these weapons couldbe obtained from Belgium, where there was reported to be aconsiderable quantity available.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.5. The War Cabinet gave consideration to certain projectedoperations in Norway. A record of the discussion is contained inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
Western Front.Action to betaken if theNetherlands or belgium is invaded.(previous reference:.W.M. (40) 91stConclusions,Minute 4.)Attitude ofBelgianGovernment.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theBelgian Ambassador had called on Sir Alexander Cadogan theprevious evening. What had passed at this interview might besummarised as follows : The Ambassador said that he had received from M. Spaakan account of the communication made to him by Mr. Avelingon instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government during the night of the 9/10th April, 1940, subsequent to the meeting of theSupreme War Council on the 9th April, 1940. Baron deCartier had said that there could be no question of the BelgianGovernment giving an affirmative answer to the Allied request.The Belgian Government had no certain information that thesituation had deteriorated or that the German forces had been reinforced during the last four days. On the other hand,Franco-British troops had within the last 48 hours moved upto positions closer to the Belgian frontier. The BelgianGovernment were extremely surprised that they had not received prior information regarding these movements. TheBelgian Government desired an assurance that there was no intention on the part of the Allied Governments to move their troops into Belgium without having received an invitation fromthe Belgian Government that they should do so.Sir Alexander Cadogan had said that he was not aware ofany recent movements of British troops such as the ambassador had referred to, but he must point out that on more than one occasion the British Government had suggested to the BelgianGovernment that arrangements should be made for theestablishment of closer relations between the British and belgian staffs; and if such closer contact did not now exist,it was not due to any fault on the part of the British Govern-ment. He had undertaken, however, to report to the foreign secretary what Baron de Cartier had said with a view to his being furnished as soon as possible with a reply for trans-mission to M. Spaak. Any movements of troops which hadtaken place were certainly not intended as a threat againstBelgium, but had been made solely by the German menace.On taking his departure Baron de Cartier had expressed thehope that it might be possible for him to receive from theForeign Office the information he had asked for either that day or the following day (Sunday, the 14th April, 1940). Hehad added that capital was being made in certain quarters in belgium regarding the reinforcement of British troops inFrance.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that he had that morningwritten a letter to the Belgian Ambassador on the following lines : Sir Alexander Cadogan had reported to him the com-munication the Ambassador had made the previous eveningregarding M. Spaak&apos;s apprehensions on the subject of the communication made to him by Mr. Aveling on the9/10th April, 1940, coupled with the recent movement ofBritish troops closer to the Belgian frontier. He could assure the Ambassador that there was no connection between the twoevents of the kind which M. Spaak seemed to fear. If anymovement of troops had taken place, it was due, as sir alexander Cadogan had said, solely to the German menace.We assumed that if the Belgian Government were attacked byGermany, they would certainly desire that our troops shouldbe as well placed as possible for coming to their aid. Similarly,the Belgian Government should welcome any increase of thestrength of our forces in France.
Just before the meeting of the War Cabinet, Baron de Cartier hadtelephoned to say that he was not satisfied with the terms of theletter he had received, since it did not contain clear answers to thefollowing questions : (i) Had the intention of the two Governments been modified ?(ii) Had we in fact no intention of moving troops into Belgiumunless the Belgian Government appealed to us for help7The Belgian Ambassador had added that he did not propose forthe moment to report to the Belgian Government, and that he hopedthat he might receive answers to his questions if possible beforelunch.A telegram (No. 117 DIPP dated the 13th April, 1940) had nowbeen received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, regarding theattitude of the French Government to the proposal made to them on the evening of Friday, the 12th April, 1940. This telegram mightbe summarised as follows :  The French Government do not consider that any useful purpose will be achieved by further communication with theBelgian Government. The latter would persist in their refusal to commit themselves, and another rebuff would only rendermore difficult our action later. The modification of the last sentence of paragraph 2 of the suggested communication to theBelgian Government which Sir Ronald Campbell had been authorised, if necessary, to suggest, did not meet the objectionof the French Government, which was to any prior com-munication being made to the Belgian Government. TheFrench Government proposed, however, that the Allies should now agree upon the text (1) of a communication to be madeto the Belgian Government at the moment of the entry ofAllied troops into Belgium and (2) of a public announcement to be made simultaneously.As regards the Belgian Government, the Foreign Secretarysuggested that our reply might be to the effect that the intentions of the British and French Governments remained as already known;it was their intention to do their utmost to protect Belgium andthe Netherlands; and they must reserve their liberty of action to-act as rapidly as possible to give support to those countries bothin their interest and in that of the Allies, the moment the timearrived.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that we were under no-obligation to reply to the questions put to us by the BelgianGovernment, and we might, therefore, answer the Ambassador by saying that we had nothing to add to what had already been said.The Prime Minister, thought that it would be desirable to postpone giving any reply to Baron de Cartier at least until the afternoon, and that our reply, when made, should contain a numberof questions; thus M. Spaak could hardly expect us to remaininactive if the Belgian Government were to come to terms withGermany was that possibility entirely excluded&apos;? Further, what action would the Belgian Government propose to take if the netherland Government made terms with Germany which affordedthe latter country strategic advantages against us ? In general, he considered that we should adopt a very stiff line.The Secretary of State for War thought it intolerable thatthe Belgian Government should take it upon themselves to questionus regarding the reinforcement of our armies in France. Hesuggested that this should be made clear at the beginning of the reply to be made to the Belgian Ambassador.Attitude ofFrenchGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 90thConclusions,Minute 2.)
The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the origin ofthe present inquiry through the Belgian Ambassador should be looked for in the interview which Mr. Aveling had had withM. Spaak on the evening of Friday, the 12th April, 1940 (as reported in Telegram No. 71 DIPP, dated 13th April, 1940) atwhich M. Spaak had shown himself sullen and unresponsive.The Prime Minister said that no doubt M. Spaak had been further disturbed by the proceedings at the meeting of the SocialistParliamentary Group on the 11th April. 1940 (as reported in telegram No. 29, Saving, dated 13th April, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris).The War Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should makea communication to the Belgian Ambassador later in theday on the lines of the discussion in the War Cabinet as recorded above.Western Front(continued).Air action incertaincontingencies.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 91stConclusions,Minute 4.)7.   A discussion took place with regard to : (i) The reply of the French Government to the proposals regarding air action in the event of a German invasion of Holland or Belgium, communicated to them after themeeting referred to in the margin.(ii) The arrangements for the intervention of the metropolitanheavy bomber force in the land battle in the event of aGerman attack on the Western Front.A record of the discussion, and of the Conclusions reached bythe War Cabinet, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.Sweden.Allied Mission.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 89thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The War Cabinet discussed the question of the return ofthe Allied Mission which had recently gone to Sweden. TheSwedish Government had asked that the existence of the AlliedMission should be kept secret. It appeared from Telegram No. 239DIPP from Stockholm that the Mission intended to leave Stockholmthat night, and it was clear from Telegram No. 236 from Stockholmthat the Swedes were anxious for the Mission not to stay too long.In discussion, it was pointed out that the chief value of theMission lay in the fact that, on their arrival, they had been more recently in touch with the situation in this country and in Francethan the British and French Ministers in Stockholm. There was,therefore, no object in delaying their return. This, however, didnot apply to Admiral Evans, who, it was intended, should go to norway and get in touch with King Haakon and the norwegian government.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Norway. 9.   The Secretary of Stale for Foreign Affairs hoped that theRequest for financial requests which had been received from the Norwegianfinancial Government (Telegram No. 205 from Stockholm) would be dealtassistance. with rapidly and sympathetically.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the nature of theNorwegian Governments requests was by no means clear. If these had reference to internal financial difficulties in Norway, we were
not in a position to help, while, if what the Norwegian Governmentwanted was to make purchases overseas, it was necessary to make sure that the desired supplies actually arrived in Norway. As soonas the matter was made clear, everything possible would be done to meet the wishes of the Norwegian Government.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his advisers thought it likely that Signor Mussolini&apos;s reaction to events in Northern Europe would be to seize Dalmatian ports. Sir NoelCharles had reported (Telegram No. 361, dated 12th April, 1940)that the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence had informed the Military Attache that evening in reply to a directquestion, that Italy had no intention of making any coup againstCorfu, or of taking any other action which might bring Britishguarantees into play. This assurance could not be regarded,however, as excluding the possibility of Italian action on the dalmatian coast.The First Lord of the A dmiralty considered that if Italy wereto seize Cattaro or other Dalmatian ports, we should take no immediate counter-action, but that we should reserve our liberty totake such action as we might think proper at a later date. In pointof fact, we should not be in a position, until the Scandinaviansituation had been clarified, to undertake operations in the central mediterranean, though we should be able to hold securely thewestern and eastern entrances. No doubt the heavy German navallosses in the last week would create a profound impression on signor mussolini.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that if, on italy seizing the Dalmatian coast, we remained inactive, a deepand unfavourable effect would be created in the Balkans. He was prepared for the moment to accept the First Lord&apos;s view that, if italy were to act in this manner, we should take no action beyondexpressing our disapproval. He proposed to consider the matter further with his own advisers, and, if as a result there appearedgreat objection to the course proposed, he would raise it again inthe War Cabinet on the following day. It might be worth whileconsulting the Turkish Government on this question.The Prime Minister said that no doubt Italy was waiting onevents in order to take sides with the victor.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that arrangements might be made for the B.B.C. to make some statement of an unofficial character suggesting that the effect of recent naval operations would be to liberate naval forces for service in other areas.The First L,ord of the Admiralty undertook to consider what could be done in this direction. It might be combined with astatement taking stock of recent German losses of various classesof warships and of merchant ships.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement and invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider theissue of a statement of recent German naval and shippingItaly.probable intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 91stConclusions,Minute 5.)
Greenland. 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heCanadian pro- had received a communication from the Canadian Highposal to seize Commissioner in London suggesting that it might be desirable forthe cryolite Canadian forces to take action to safeguard the cryolite mines atmines at Ivigtut in Greenland, which were of great importance to theTvigtut. Canadian aluminium industry.   The proposal had been examined in the Foreign Office, and he proposed to inform Mr. Massey thatthere would be no objection to such action from the political pointof view.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,April 14, 1940.
