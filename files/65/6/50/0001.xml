The Secretary of State for Air said that air operations on both sides in the previous 24 hours had been considerablyhampered by bad weather. Only four enemy aircraft had beendetected off our coasts.Clear weather over Stavanger had prevented bomber operations during the day, while cloud and fog had caused the cancellation of night operations.A Wellington on reconnaissance during the earlier part ofthe night had been shadowed for an hour by an aircraft with brightheadlamps. It appeared that this aircraft had been escortingtwo ships in the middle of the North Sea, whose identity it hadnot been possible to ascertain.Fog had prevented Blenheim fighter patrols, intended for theAndalsnes area, from taking off.Owing to fog, the demolition party, who were to have flownto Southern Norway, had not yet been able to leave.Further attempts were being made to establish an air base in norway. The Gladiators which had been landed on LakeLesgeskogen on the 25th had found no petrol. They had therefore been unable to get off the ground when attacked by the german aircraft, and, as he had reported on the previous day, sixteen outof the eighteen machines had been destroyed.The Secretary of State for Air recalled that he had undertaken to investigate the publication by the Evening Standard of a paragraph suggesting the possibility of our using fighters in norway. On investigation, it had been found that the statement had been passed by the Censor. There was, therefore, no case against the Evening Standard.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had made similar enquiriesin connection with the announcement by the B.B.C. of the Britishlanding at Namsos. In this case also it had been found that theannouncement had been passed by the Censor.Reference was made to the fact that for the second day in succession the Germans had issued a statement that we had bombedopen towns.The Secretary of State for Air said that he had thought itbest to issue a statement that there was no foundation for the charge that we were bombing non-military targets.The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff added that it was quite possiblethat civilians had been killed in the course of our attacks on military objectives.In the ensuing discussion, there was general agreement thatthe Germans were probably adopting their usual technique ofmaking accusations in order to justify a further crime which they intended to commit.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the germans were making great play with their accusations in their broadcaststo France, no doubt with the object of stirring up trouble betweenthe Allies.The Prime Minister suggested that the Ministry of information should issue a bulletin, calling attention to the German accusations;stating that there was no truth in them; and emphasising thesinister significance of such statements, having regard to the Germanpractice of falsely accusing others of a crime as a prelude tocommitting it themselves.
The War Cabinet :-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make arrangements for action by the Ministry of Information on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister, particular attentionbeing paid to broadcasts to Trance.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 104thConclusions,Minute 3.)Narvik.Namsos.Andalsnes andthe southern front.naval operations.Fleet Air Armoperations.2.   The War Cabinet were given the following information regarding operations in Norway : The demi-brigade of Chasseurs Alpins had arrived in the narvik area. The town of Narvik was virtually surrounded and admiral Lord Cork had stated that he did not require additionalinfantry at the moment. He had asked for aircraft and artillery,including anti-aircraft guns. The French Foreign Legion was being diverted to Tromso.There was no change in the general situation in the Namsosarea. Transports carrying the &quot; Maurice &quot; force headquarters anti-aircraft equipment and stores, a Royal Marine Howitzer battery,and other units which were urgently required, were due at Namsosthat night (27th April).General Carton de Wiart had reported that the air superioritywhich we had obtained at Namsos on the 25th April had provedvaluable.Andalsnes had been heavily bombed on the previous day.H.M.S. Flamingo, the only ship at the port, had expended all herammunition. H.M.S. Black Swan had relieved her, but there hadbeen no anti-aircraft ship at the port for a period of three hoursduring which severe damage had been done to the port area. Awooden jetty and store houses had been burnt out with considerableloss of small arms, ammunition and explosives.A message had been received from General Paget stating that under existing air conditions the continued maintenance of hisforce through Andalsnes was not feasible; artillery was urgently required.The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that a brigade of artillerywould arrive at Andalsnes that night (27th April).There was no news of the fighting south of Dombaas. our troops were reported to be in action east of Dombaas.The landing of Marines at Sundal Soren had been cancelledas the troops could not be spared.A German mine-laying trawler under Dutch colours, whichhad rammed and damaged H.M.S. Arrow off Andalsnes on theprevious morning, had been sunk by H.M.S. Birmingham. On herway home H.M.S. Arrow had intercepted a second German trawler,similarly disguised, which had proved to be a U-boat supply anddepot ship. The crew had been captured and a prize crew puton board.Three of our anti-submarine trawlers had been sunk by enemy aircraft. The Naval Omcer-in-Charge, Aalesund, had withdrawnthe daylight anti-submarine patrol but was maintaining nightpatrols.The carrier forces had been operating 140 miles North-west of Trondhjem during the day, their first objective being the defenceof Andalsnes.A report from the Vice-Admiral, Aircraft Carriers, contained the following detailed information of the operations of the fleet air Arm up to the afternoon of the 25th April :  (i) Two Skuas from FI.M.S. Glorious had escorted the18 R.A.F. Gladiators which had landed safely on afrozen lake. (As reported by the Secretary of State forAir, these aircraft had nearly all been destroyed.)
(ii) Twelve Skuas operating in the Andalsnes area had shot down one Heinkel, damaged another, and driven offseveral Junker bombers.(iii) Thirty-three aircraft had attacked Trondhjem on the morning of the 25th April, destroying three hangars atVarnes, damaging other buildings, and badly damagingtwo German bombers. Nine German seaplanes had been attacked successfully with bombs and machine guns. AtThamshavn two oilers had been set on fire, two shipsalongside attacked, two transports attacked, onemerchant ship probably sunk and one warehouse hit.(iv) Fighter patrols at Namsos had engaged enemy bombers and float planes.(v) Photographs   of   Trondhjem   Fjord   and  neighbouringaerodromes had been obtained. The only German war-ships at Trondhjem were one destroyer and one torpedo boat.(vi) Six Skua and four Swordfish aircraft had been lost, butonly four crews were missing.Submarine H.M.S. submarine Seawolf had sunk two merchant ships in aoperations.        south-bound convoy North of the Skaw.A record of certain further information regarding operations in Norway, of the ensuing discussion, and of the conclusions reached by the War Cabinet is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Norway. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionPood supplies to telegram No. 395, dated 26th April, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;for civilian Minister, Stockholm, on the subject of food supplies for the civilian population. population in Norway :-It was certain that the food situation in Norway, includingthe Narvik district, was serious. Mr. Mallet hoped that steps would be taken to send with the Expeditionary Force, supplies for the civilian population. At present, it seemed useless to urge the Swedes or the Americans to organise such relief from Stockholm, since communications had. been cut by the Germans.In the meanwhile, if a shortage of food developed in theGerman occupied part of Norway, the Swedish Governmentwould be under increased pressure either to allow convoys orto send food from Swedish reserves, which they would be reluctant to do, so long as there were no means of replenishingthem.The Foreign Secretary said that he had also had a communication from the Norwegian Minister. The Norwegian&apos; Government had now requisitioned all Norwegian shipping, and placed it under thecontrol of a body in London. Could we not send some supplies to the Narvik area, and leave it to the Norwegians to get them down the coast for the relief of their fellow countrymen?The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that in those areas under our control we should feed and arm the Norwegian troops and alsofeed the civilian population. Outside those areas we neither couldnor should feed the civilian population. That was a problem forthe Germans.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that theDepartments concerned might examine the question with a viewto discussing with the Norwegian Minister what might be done tohelp.
The War Cabinet agreed That at the meeting of the Committee on the Co-ordinationof Departmental Action to be held that morning, at 12 noon(see Minute 6), the Departments concerned should beinvited to constitute a small sub-committee to examine andreport urgently on the possibility of our providing food supplies for the civilian population in those parts of norway under our control.Supreme WarCouncil:Arrangementsfor 9th Meeting.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 104thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that on theprevious evening a message had been received that General Gamelinwas coming over to discuss the latest position in regard to theoperations in Norway. (This was in lieu of the suggested visit of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to Paris to see general gamelin.)A Meeting had been held at 9 - 30 the previous evening, attended by himself, the Foreign Secretary, the three Service Ministers andthe Chiefs of Staff, at which a discussion had taken place withM. Corbin and General Gamelin. He had explained that changesin the situation seemed likely to call for modification of the decisions reached at the Eighth Meeting of the Supreme War Council heldin Paris earlier in the week. M. Corbin had indicated that hethought it would be desirable, in the circumstances, that the position should be discussed at a further Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil. Arrangements had accordingly been made for M. Reynaudand M. Daladier to come over to a Meeting of the Council that afternoon.The Prime Minister added that he thought it would be necessaryto deal at the Council not only with Scandinavian affairs, but also with the latest developments in the Italian situation (see Minute 7below).The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The 5.   The Prime Minister drew the attention of the War CabinetMediterranean, to a telegram received from Mr. Osborne at the VaticanProtection of (No- 49- DIPP, dated the 26th April, 1940), stating that SignorBritish shipping Mussolini had imposed on the Grand Council his decision to enter(Previous the war on or about 1st or 2nd May, and that he would do soReference:        by attacks on Malta and Gibraltar.W M (40) 102nd        In view of this information the Prime Minister suggested that conclusions,      instructions should be given immediately to take the further action,Minute 10.)&apos;      which it had previously been decided to defer, for diverting british shipping from the Mediterranean.The War Cabinet considered  in particular the following measures : (a) that liners sailing outward to Australia and New Zealandvia Suez should be routed via the Cape, except mailsteamers;(b) that liners, tramps and tankers proceeding to and fromthe Far East, the East side of India and East africa should be routed via the Cape;(c) tramps bound for Mediterranean not to discharge or loadEast of Tunis unless taking Government stores to Egypt,Palestine or Turkey (this would cut out Italy, Malta,Danube and Egypt, but would allow loading of ore in north Africa); tankers not to load at Constanza orHaifa except for Egypt, or destinations East of Malta;
and agreed : That the measures mentioned in (a) and (b) above shouldbe put into effect immediately, but that the action under(c) should be deferred.Italy.Naval situationin theMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 104thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in additionto the information received from Mr. Osborne (see Minute 5 above),he had been informed that the Italian Naval Attache in london had stated that it was to be hoped that this country would not regard as a casus belli a decision by Italy to settle ^tfp matters withYugoslavia.The First Lord recalled that the German Naval Attache in rome had recently made enquiries regarding the movement of theBritish Fleet in the Mediterranean. The sum of this informationgave cause for considerable anxiety. His own inclination was toretain the two Battleships now at Gibraltar at that port, and notto send them to the Eastern Mediterranean.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that there wasground for grave anxiety. It appeared, however, that Italianshipping was still proceeding normally. On tJhe previous day he(the Foreign Secretary) had had an amicable talk with the italian ambassador regarding trade relations. The Ambassador had,however, been somewhat disturbed at the action taken by theMinister of Economic Warfare in holding up 14 Italian ships at malta and Gibraltar, and had complained that the hold-back systemof guarantees was no longer being operated. Signor Bastianinihad added that Italian feeling was not anti-British, but that italy was suffering from a feeling of claustrophobia.After further discussion, the War Cabinet agreed to leave tothe discretion of the First Lord the decision whether the twoBattleships at Gibraltar should be moved to Alexandria. The FirstLord said that he would defer a decision until the afternoon.The War Cabinet was also informed that a Meeting of theCommittee on the Co-ordination of Departmental Action was being held that morning to consider what action should be taken in thelight of the information received as to Italian intentions.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Italy.Allied policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minutes 1and 8.)Proposeddemarche toGreeceregarding an expedition to salonika.7. The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthe Chiefs of Staff Committee had considered at their meeting that morning the question of the proposed approach to the GreekGovernment regarding the despatch of a force to Salonika. Theyhad reached the conclusion that no approach should be made untilthe full military implications of the despatch of a force to Salonikahad been examined by a joint Allied military body. Experience in scandinavia had strengthened their previous view that the establish-ment and maintenance of a force at Salonika with the Alliedresources at present available would be impracticable if war with italy resulted. The proposed demarche to the Greeks might resultin our being driven into sending an expedition, and we should nothave the anti-aircraft defences nor the air forces available to defend a  force landed in Salonika.The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff emphasised that conditions were very different from those which we had obtained in the Great War,when small forces had been able to&apos; be landed and maintained, inview of our command of the sea. At the present moment we should find it very difficult indeed to find the shipping for a Salonikaexpedition, but it was just possible that this difficulty might be overcome.   It was the air which was the deciding factor.   Our
experience in Scandinavia had confirmed the conclusions whichhad been reached in all our pre-war studies, that it was quiteout of the question to land troops unless they had adequate air defences. We should require for Salonika probably 200 light and heavy anti-aircraft guns and a considerable number of fighter air-craft. If these could not be made available, our forces there would suffer the same fate as the Abyssinians in 1935 and the troops whichhad been landed recently in Scandinavia. There could be no doubtthat the air factor had greatly increased the advantage of the sidewhich was working on interior lines. Even if we had the airforces and anti-aircraft guns that would be needed, it would be a difficult operation to land them and establish them ashore. But wehad not got the guns and aircraft at the present time. The french had always been keen on the idea of an expedition to Salonika, butit seemed essential that we should now get down to bedrock withthem and ask them precisely what air forces and anti-aircraft gunsthey were prepared to find. If their reply was satisfactory, welland good, but otherwise we would have to make it quite clear tothem that the idea of an expedition must be ruled out.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs observed that the representations of the Chiefs of Staff put a new complexion upon our obligations to Greece and Turkey. The first question to besettled was how we were to deal. with the French on this matter.We had agreed with them, at the Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil held on the 23rd April, that we should make the demarcheto the Greek Government before the Staffs had completed their technical examination of the problem. We should now have to go back to them and say that in our view it was essential to reach agreement on the military implications before any diplomaticapproach was made to the Greeks or to the Turks.The Prime Minister said that this question would have to beraised at the meeting of the Supreme War Council to be held that afternoon (see Minute 4). We should have to say that thepreliminary investigation by our own Staffs had disclosed serious difficulties, and that on this account we thought it better to postpone the demarche to the Greek Government until after the Allied staffshad completed their examination of the whole problem. The french would certainly have to be handled tactfully, and we should haveto avoid giving the impression that we were trying to back out ofthe undertakings we had given at the last meeting of the supreme war Council.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the nextpoint which would arise was the larger issue of what action weshould take if Italy committed an act of aggression in Yugoslavia.The French would certainly wish to send an expedition at once to salonika that had always been their idea presumably with a viewto keeping open a back door into Yugoslavia from which we might ultimately be able to support her.Considerable discussion followed on this question, during whichthe following points emerged : (i) The Chiefs.of Staff had recommended in W.P. (40) 134that, in the event of Italian aggression against Greeceor Yugoslavia, we should go to war with Italy, accepting the fact that this would probably entail the withdrawalof British forces from southern Norway and the restric-tion of the campaign in Scandinavia to operations inthe Narvik area.(ii) On the one hand, the view was expressed that this wouldbe the right course to take. Italy would have definitelythrown down the challenge, and we should have no other-course but to accept it.   If we did not, we might findAction in theevent of ItalianaggressionagainstYugoslavia.
ourselves forced later on to go to war with Italy butin a very much more disadvantageous position, withall our influence in the Balkans gone.(iii) On the other hand, it was urged that it might be to our advantage to let Italy get thoroughly involved in opera-tions in Yugoslavia, while we developed our resources,particularly on the naval side, which would be consider-ably increased in the next few months. The economiceffect of blocking both ends of the Mediterranean wouldbe considerable. Once Italy was thoroughly involved, we might then take the opportunity to make a direct attack upon her. To remain on the defensive everywhere would place a great strain upon us, but we could strike afew shrewd blows at Italy, such as, for example, the bombardment of her railways, which were vulnerable to sea attack. We might also attack her arsenals andpossibly the industrial districts in the north. The effectof such an attack might be very far reaching.(iv) It was pointed out that the French might not consent tosuch action, and in any case we had no agreement withthem for the use of their aerodromes for such an operation. The availability of French aerodromes forsuch an undertaking was essential.(v) In answer to a question by the Prime Minister, the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said he would not favour adeclaration of war on Italy unless we were preparedto deliver a determined attack at Italy&apos;s war potential.If the Salonika project materialised, there was a dangerof our air resources becoming so dispersed that we shouldnot have a sufficient force left to make direct attacks on germany and Italy.(vi) We should have to assess carefully the chances of being able to hold Greece and Turkey on our side if we didnot immediately declare war. There might perhaps be some doubt as to whether Turkey would consider Italianaggression in the northern part, of the Adriatic as acasus belli under the terms of the Anglo-Franco-turkish treaty, but according to the strict interpretation of theTreaty, this would certainly be an &quot;act of aggression in the Mediterranean area.&quot; If, therefore, we became involved in war with Italy on this account, the Turks would be bound to come in. Nevertheless, it was doubtfulwhether the Turks could do very much against the dodecanese by themsleves. They were dependent upon us for the necessary naval and air forces. The impor-tance of ascertaining the attitude of Turkey in the eventof an Italian attack on Yugoslavia was emphasised.The important consideration was to keep Turkey onour side.(vii) The War Cabinet was informed that the British military attache-designate at Rome had met the Italian military attache in London recently. The latter had said he hoped Great Britain would regard an entry by Italyinto Yugoslavia as a &quot; private &quot; war to secure her own position in the Adriatic in case the Germans moveddown there. It was generally agreed that a strong hintshould be given through the same channel that, in sucha contingency, we should go to war with Italy, and thatwe should not shrink from air attack on Italianindustries in the north. Such a communication mighthave a valuable deterrent effect.
Action against The discussion then turned on the question whether, if the warGermany in the spread to the Mediterranean, our proper course of action would beevent of Italian to make a direct attack on German oil targets. We could not remainhostility: on the defensive everywhere, and we might have to make up ourattack on oil minds to open large scale air warfare and face the consequences.fiXlted Tlle Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Staff weresugges e . already engaged in an appreciation of the situation from this angle.Without prejudging the issue in any way, his feeling was that air attack on the German oil targets would probably be the best course to take. If the French pressed for a large diversion of force to southern Norway, we should have to say that we were nervous offrittering away our resources of bomber aircraft in Scandinaviawithout any real chance of turning the Germans out of the country.Our proper course therefore was to concentrate our efforts in Norwayon the Narvik area only, and to attack the enemy directly at hismost sensitive spot. It would be necessary, however, to lead theFrench very carefully up to this conclusion. It could not bediscussed, except in general terms, until the Air Staffs appreciationhad been completed.It was generally agreed that the whole problem of war with italy would have to be raised with the French at the Supreme WarCouncil in the afternoon. It would inevitably arise, either outof the discussion on the merits of the campaign in Scandinavia, orfrom the discussion on the proposal to postpone the proposeddemarche to the Greek Government on the subject of Salonika.The Prime Minister observed that M. Reynaud had emphasised in his letter to him the necessity for looking at the war from thebroadest point of view. We should have to point out to the French that the campaign in Norway must be viewed in relation to other and wider commitments. At the present time the French wereconcentrating their attention on northern Europe and forgettingthe possible implications in the Mediterranean.The discussion then turned on the plan of campaign which weshould adopt if Italy came into the war against us. The allied military Committee were already engaged in examining variousdeterrent measures against Italy. The question of bombing Italianindustries in the north would also need to be examined by theAllied Staffs. It was questionable whether we could afford to splitour bomber force and divert some of our strength from directattacks on Germany to attacks on Italian industry. It was recognised, however, that even a limited offensive against Italianindustry would have a very big moral effect in Italy and might, there-fore be justified. The Inter-Service Security Board were consideringthe possibility of some action in the south of France which wouldmake the Italians think that we were contemplating an offensiveof this nature. As soon as the French and British Staffs had worked out their plans, these would have to be discussed with theTurks.The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that the Chiefs of staff report on the implications of possible Italian action in theMediterranean, to which reference had already been made in thediscussion (W.P. (40) 134), had been prepared very hurriedly andthe particular implications of a hostile Spain had been ratherglossed over. Even before the days of the air factor it had alwaysbeen recognised that we could use Gibraltar only if we had a weakor friendly Spain at the back of it. If we had a hostile Spain now,and, in consequence enemy air bases in the hinterland of Gibraltar,the base would be quite unusable. The scale of air defences at gibraltar could not be brought up to the scale existing at, forexample, Scapa for a long time. We should be. no better off evenif we succeeded in capturing Ceuta, on the opposite side of thePolicy for theconduct of war against Italy.Implications ofSpanishhostility.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 95thConclusions,Minute 8.)
Straits, by a land invasion from French territory. Ceuta wouldbe just as vulnerable to air attack from Spain as Gibraltar.The War Cabinet agreed as follows :- (i) That in the event of Italy committing an act of aggression against Yugoslavia within, say, the next twenty-four hours, we should not immediately declare war on Italy.(ii) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should endeavour to ascertain at the earliest possible moment the probable Turkish reaction to an Italian attack on yugoslavia.(iii) That the Secretary of State for War should arrange forour Military Attache (designate) to Rome to have afurther conversation with the Italian Military Attacheand convey to him that, although he was not speakingfor his Government, he was of the opinion that Italycould not attack Yugoslavia with impunity. A reference might also be made in the conversation to the vulner-ability of the industries in Northern Italy to air attack.(iv) That at the meeting of the Supreme War Council to beheld that afternoon, the Prime Minister should take thefollowing line : (a) He should open up the question of the use of Frenchaerodromes by the Royal Air Force, for thepurpose of attacking industrial areas in North-west Italy. Inter-Allied Staff talks would benecessary, and should be arranged.(b) He should refer to the proposed joint approach tothe Greek Government, to ascertain what attitudethey would adopt in the event of an Italianaggression on Yugoslavia, and whether theywould consent in that eventuality to accept allied forces at Salonika; and he should ask that this approach should be postponed until the Frenchand British Staffs had considered together thepractical measures involved in the despatch of an allied force to Salonika.(c) He should also inform the French representatives ofthe action proposed under (ii) above.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,April 27, 1940.
