The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the homewardand outward bound Norwegian convoys were proceeding on their way.The S.S. Gardenia, a British ship of 3,745 tons, not in convoy,had been mined and sunk North of Cromer Knoll.The trawler Halifax had exploded a mine in her sweep, andhad sunk after efforts to beach her had failed.H.M. ships Wren, Wolsey and Guillemot had all been damaged in collision, but not seriously.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 3.   The Secretary of State for  War said . that there wasSituation^ nothing of importance to report.(Previous Xhe War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Reference:W.M. (40) 66thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had nowheard from the French that they wished the proposed Royal marine operation to be jwstponed for two months, although this periodmight be lessened by two weeks. A statement of their reasons wasbeing sent to us. The First Lord gave reasons why the postpone-ment of the operation would be undesirable, and suggested that theissue was of sufficient importance to justify its discussion &apos;at anearly meeting of the Supreme War Council.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he alsofavoured a meeting of the Supreme War Council in the near future.The events of, the last few days had shown some absence of harmonyof view over Finland, and this would be restored by a meeting. Hequestioned, however, whether it would be wise to hold a meetingimmediately, since this might give the impression that we viewed the collapse of Finnish resistance so seriously that it was necessaryto hold a meeting at once to consider our next step.In further discussion, the Secretary of State for War said thatone problem which could usefully be discussed was the strength ofthe Allied forces which, in the opinion of French High Command,was required for security on the Western Front. This information would show what forces could be regarded as available for employ-ment in other theatres.Supreme WarCouncil:proposal for ameeting.Royal marine operation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 66thConclusions,Minute 3.)[21005]
The view was also expressed that, before holding a meeting, itwould be desirable to consider what further points could bediscussed, and to clarify our own ideas on the matters to be reviewed by the Supreme War Council.The War Cabinet :-Took note of the suggestion that a meeting of the supreme war Council should be held in the near future, and invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the service ministers to put forward suggestions as to matters whichshould be discussed at the Council.Italy.Visit of Herrvon Bibbentrop.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 65thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 220, Dipp, dated the 11th March, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, reporting that he understood froma reliable source near to Count Ciano that one of the chief reasons of the visit was to impress Signor Mussolini with the might ofGermany. He had not yet received a full report from Sir percy loraine.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)M. Daladier&apos;sspeech.Stoppage ofmilitary supplies to Finland.6. The Prime Minister said that he had asked the ForeignOffice to obtain the text of the speech made the previous day byM. Daladier in regard to the scale on which the Allies had beenprepared to come to the aid of Finland. If the speech had beenmade as reported in the Press, it might be difficult to leave thematter as it stood. It looked, however, as though the newspapershad pieced together different parts of M. Daladier&apos;s speech and had then placed their own interpretation upon them. It might well be,therefore, that each individual passage of the speech could bejustified. He (the Prime Minister) had to answer a Private notice question that afternoon, and the statements attributed toM. Daladier might well prove embarrassing.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thoughtit likely that there might be more than one version of M. Daladier&apos;sspeech; and that the official version would be innocuous. M. Corbinhad said to him the previous evening that he hoped he (the foreign secretary) would read the official report of M. Daladier&apos;s speech and not that reproduced in the Press.The Secretary of State for Air reported that he had, theprevious evening, given orders to hold up the despatch to Finlandof British aircraft and also of the French aircraft in transit through this country.The Prime Minister thought that the despatch of armamentsshould now be held up, and that, as soon as it was known that theFinnish Government had finally come to terms with the U.S.S.R.,such deliveries should be finally stopped. The question of recoveringconsignments already in transit might be more difficult and hesuggested that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should consider the whole question as a matter of urgency, in consultationwith the Service Ministers.The War Cabinet : Invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, inconsultation with the Service Ministers  To examine as a matter of urgency the whole positionas regards war material awaiting despatch, or already in transit to Finland; and to give the necessary instructions.
United States ofAmerica.Mr. sumner welles&apos; visit to europe.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 58thConclusions,Minute 6.)[21005]7. The Prime Minister gave the following account of the.impressions which he had gathered in discussion with Mr. sumner welles :-Mr. Sumner Welles appeared to have been informed by theGermans that they were certain of winning the war, that they intended in the near future to launch a tremendous offensivedirected entirely against this country. While in Berlin,Mr. Sumner Welles had received information of the varioussubterranean movements working in favour of some more moderate Government; but he had reached the conclusion thatthe German offensive would be launched before any suchmovement came to a head.Mr. Sumner Welles had therefore made up his mind that,if any peace proposals were to stand a chance of success, theymust be put forward on the basis that Herr Hitler eitherremained in the German Government, or nominally retired butremained a leading personality in Germany. Mr. Wellesrecognised that any proposals on this basis would raise a verydifficult question for the Allies in view of their resolve, at the outcome of the war, to achieve security against furtheraggression in the future.Mr. Welles had said that in Germany, just as much as elsewhere, he had heard of the need for security in the future.The Germans were convinced that, if we won the war, it was our intention to divide up Germany into small fragments. Heconcluded, therefore, that if, on his return to Washington, he were to give any hint to President Roosevelt as to a possibleline on which peace proposals might be based, it would benecessary for those proposals to be such as, on the one hand, togive the necessary sense of security to the Allies, and, on theother hand, as not to require the elimination of Herr Hitler.Mr, Welles&apos; idea was that the necessary sense of security couldbe obtained by general disarmament of so far-reaching a character as to give to the European countries complete confidence that they need have no further fear of aggression by Germany. He had in mind also the possibility of an inter-national air force which would act as a&apos; sanction to preventGermany from descending on small nations in the future.He (the Prime Minister) had taken the line thatMr. Welles was aiming at the impossible. The more he helped to make it possible for Herr Hitler to retire from the nominalheadship of Germany and, while securing peace, to be able to claim that he had come out of the war without loss of prestige,the more unacceptable to the Allies would be the solutionproposed. The Allies had gone into the war to convinceGermany and the world that force did not pay, but a solution on the line suggested would enable Herr Hitler to claim thatit did. He (the Prime Minister) had rejected the theory thatit was possible to secure disarmament first and confidencesecond. The exact reverse was the case. It was fantastic tobelieve that it would be possible to persuade nations which hadlived for so long under terror of Germany to give up the meansof defending themselves, unless there was a complete changeof heart in Germany. He had put the following three points to Mr. Welles : (i) Germany was the author of all the world&apos;s presenttroubles. If that danger were once removed, theworld need not fear any other nation, not even theU.S.S.R. or Japan,(ii) A satisfactory peace could not be achieved till therehad been a real change of outlook in Germany anda Government established in that country havingthe same attitude to peace as the Allies.b 3
(iii) A satisfactory peace could not be secured until the peoples of the world were convinced that in factsuch a Government had been established inGermany.He (the Prime Minister) was seeing Mr. Welles againthat afternoon. He proposed to add as a final word thatthe best security for the peace of the world was the unitedstrength of France and Great Britain. It would be a long time before confidence could be restored, and, while he would beprepared to make a start on a programme of disarmament,that programme would need to be very gradual, the first steps in particular being taken very cautiously. If those firststeps proved successful, the later ones would be easier to achieve and could be carried out more rapidly. The only formof disarmament which he thought would be practicable wasqualitative disarmament, since quantitative disarmament was much more difficult to check.Mr. Welles had made it clear that the United States would never give any guarantee to Europe, but that she would beprepared to take a share in the international supervision of disarmament and also in economic reconstruction. He ha,dalso promised that President Roosevelt would make no peace proposals in public without first informing us privately. Thesame assurance had been given in a letter which Mr. Welleshad brought him from President Roosevelt.The Prime Minister believed that President Rooseveltwould make some attempt to bring the war to an end, even if that attempt should be embarrassing to us. It was particularly important, therefore, that Mr. Welles should be under noillusions as to our position. He thought it likely also that italy would succeed in manoeuvring herself into securing ashare in the putting out of the Presidents peace proposals.The Fi7,st Lord of the A dmiralty gave the following account ofwhat had transpired when he had seen Mr. Sumner Welles : He had told Mr. Welles that the people of this country hadbeen greatly imposed-essed before the war by the strength of feeling in the United States that Nazism must be crushed. Now thatwe had entered the war we must, and should, fight it to a finish.If we and the French were to become separated, it would never be possible again to achieve security in Europe.As regards the peace settlement, he (the First Lord) had said that he looked to the establishment of some international body on the lines of the League of Nations, and also to theestablishment of an international tribunal for dealing withdisputes of a justiciable character. He had also said that hehad advocated the establishment of an international air force.He had made it absolutely clear, however, that in his opinion there was no value in discussing possible peace terms untilGermany had been absolutely defeated, and that peace propa-ganda in the United States at the present time would only doharm. He had pointed out also that, if we were beaten by theGermans, we might have to surrender our fleet, in which caseGermany would at once have a fleet stronger than that of theUnited States.On the question of disarmament, he had taken the line thatthe distinction between offensive and defensive weapons was entirely fallacious, since, after an act of aggression had takenplace, it might happen as in the last war that the so-calledoffensive weapon was required to enable the victim to fight the aggressor. He had made it clear also that no disarmamentcould be regarded as satisfactory unless it provided also forequality in the means of re-armament, since otherwise the
naval programme,1940-41.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 37thConclusions,Minute 7.)(1)The War Cabinet had before them A Memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty(W.P. (40) 53) reviewing the present position regardingNaval construction and making proposals for the 1940New Construction Programme.(2) A Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (40) 95)covering a Memorandum prepared by the Naval Staffon British-Japanese naval strengths.The principal points which arose in the course of discussion were as follows : (1) The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the memorandum prepared by the Naval Staff brought out the great strength of theJapanese Fleet in capital ships. The Far East might constitute theprincipal problem with which we should have to deal in the years immediately following the war, and it would be unsatisfactory toinclude, in any Fleet sent to the Far East, ships not of at leastequivalent speed to the Japanese, and with guns of an equal range.This was an argument for pressing forward at the earliest opportunity with the construction of the 16-inch-gun ships already sanctioned by Parliament. We should have to lay down two new capital ships a year if we were to be certain of keeping ahead ofthe Japanese. Further, it seemed likely that by 1942 the japanese would possess 4 ships of the pocket battleship type, carrying eithersix or nine 12-inch guns. Vessels of this type could be matched bythe British battle-cruisers but by no smaller elements of our Fleet.(2) In order to provide for the latest developments of anti-U-boat and anti-mining warfare, it was proposed to include in the1940 New Construction Programme only one capital ship (see (3)aggressor State could so reorganise its factory system as to bein a position once more to re-arm in defiance of the terms of thepeace settlement.In general, he had taken the line that our only course nowwas to fight to a finish, even though this meant putting all tothe stake. Mr. Kennedy, the United States Ambassador, had said that the United States would be ruined if the war wenton. He (the First Lord) had denied this, and had pointed outthat in all countries the standard of life was much higher now than at the time of the last war. Mr. Kennedy had admitted that on his return to London he had found that opinion in thiscountry against premature peace had hardened greatly.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he and the Secretaryof State for Air had done their best to impress upon Mr. Wellesthat, if we pursued our course resolutely, we should win the war.Mr. Kennedy had told him that many people in the United states were afraid that, if they gave the Allies any assistance, evenfinancial, they would ultimately be dragged into the war. For thisreason they wanted the war stopped at all costs through fear of becoming involved. It was very important, therefore, thatMr. Welles should realise the strength of our resources, and shouldnot go back to Washington with the impression that peace proposals,the real object of which was to reassure American fears, would servealso to save us from destruction.The Secretary of Slate for Foreign A ffairs said that he thoughtit likely that the full German proposals would be given toMr. Welles on his return to Rome, since Signor Mussolini had informed him that he expected to have very important information to communicate to him on his return.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.
below), and also to postpone for the present the laying down of the16-inch-gun battleships Conqueror and Thunderer. The SeaLords, however, had agreed to this postponement with great reluctance and on the understanding that the decision not to proceedwith the 16-inch-gun ships Conqueror and Thunderer should be reviewed before the end of the calendar year, when the positionought to be clearer. It must not be forgotten that it took up to fiveyears to build a capital ship; this was one of the reasons why theBoard of Admiralty took a serious view of our capital ship position.(3) The single new capital ship now to be laid down was theVanguard, which might be described as a battleship-cruiser. TheVanguard would be a vessel of great structural strength; by using the four spare 15-inch-gun turrets of the &quot; Ramillies &quot; class, she could be completed six months earlier than ships of the design ofthe Conqueror and Thunderer, and at a saving of  2,000,000.Although Table I attached to W.P. (40) 53 showed an estimated expenditure of  400,000 in 1944 in respect of the completion of theVanguard, it was, in fact, hoped that this vessel would not takemore than 3J years to build.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt someapprehension over the laying-down of the Vanguard, which might in the end turn out to be an additional vessel, over and above thenormal capital ship programme. If there was, in fact, any prospect that the Board of Admiralty might, in a few months&apos; time, wishto proceed with the Conqueror and Thunderer, why should not oneof these vessels be laid down at once, instead of the suggested&quot; battleship-cruiser &quot; ?It was pointed out in discussion that for all practical purposes the Vanguard would be a battleship. A vessel of this type wouldnot hesitate to take on a hostile 16-inch-gun ship.(4) The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that, inaddition to the vessels of the types in question already sanctioned,it was proposed to lay down in the 1940 New construction programme 16 Destroyers,34 Escort Destroyers,30 Whalers,16 Submarines.He believed that not all these vessels could be laid down at present.For example, 16 of the Escort Destroyers would not be laid downuntil about October. The U-boat danger might diminish in thecourse of the summer. Would it not, therefore, be appropriate to review in September the number of smaller vessels to be includedin the Programme ?The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he woiild welcome such a re-examination.(5) In reply to a question by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the First Lord said that the monitor Marshal Soult was being putin hand in view of the possibility of a German occupation of theDutch or Belgian coasts. In addition, the Terror was being brought home from Singapore, and the South African Government hadreleased the Erebus. Vessels of this type were a necessary tacticalprovision.(6) The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the verylarge figures which Naval expenditure would attain in the financialyear 1940-41. The cost of the 1940 New Construction Programmefalling to be met in 1940 was estimated at  21,250,000. The costin 1940 of the New Construction Programmes of earlier years would be  99,500,000. Adding to these figures all the other items of expenditure which went to make up Navy Estimates in an
ordinary year, a total of  338,000,000 was reached for 1940-41.This enormous figure would not, however, become public, owing tothe recent decision to withhold the details of the Service Depart-ments&apos; expenditure during the present war.The Chancellor added that he had nevertheless to thank theBoard of Admiralty for effecting economies in several importantdirections; e.g., the 1940 New Construction Programme includedno aircraft carriers or cruisers. The Admiralty also proposed to slow down the construction of the Lion and Temeraire.(7) In reply to a question by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the First Lord of the A dmiraliy said that the amount of Navalshipbuilding which it was intended to put in hand outside these islands was negligible not more than, say, 5 per cent, of the total.It was proposed to build a few light escort vessels in canada and 10 minesweepers in Australia. In the latter case the object was to make certain slips available for the construction of merchantshipping.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was apprehensive,in view of the dollar position, with regard to any Naval construction in Canada. The Treasury would be grateful for as long a noticeas possible if it was intended to proceed with any orders in Canada.This was agreed to.(8) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he hoped, in about six weeks&apos; time, to report on the progress made with themerchant shipbuilding programme, since the responsibility for that programme had been taken over by the Admiralty.(9) The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether the FirstLord was satisfied that the Programme could be carried out, havingregard to the steel and man-power required.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the man-poweraspects of both the Naval and Mercantile shipbuilding programmes were under constant review. As regards steel, the Naval Construc-tion Programme could be met within the figure of 825,100 tons ofBritish steel, which represented the allocation to the Admiralty bythe Joint Production and Materials Priority Sub-Committee.It might also be possible to ease the steel position by breaking up the Derrfiinger, which had been salved at Scapa Flow, togetherwith the Centurion and Caledonia. The First Lord said that hewould also look into the possibility of salving the Royal Oak. Inthis way the equivalent of some 60,000 to 80,000 tons of steel mightbe made available.(10) The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that hewas prepared to support the programme before the War Cabinet,but that he wished to draw attention to the serious decision on naval policy involved in so considerable a slowing up of our programme ofbattleship construction. No doubt we must assume that we couldnot fight Germany and Japan at once. Again, Japan might be sofar weakened as to be unable to carry out to the full her present programme of naval construction. But, even so, it seemed likely that, after the end of the present war, the danger spot would be inthe Far East and that Japan would have a serious advantage overus in the matter of 16-inch battleships. We had, of course, to beatGermany first, and he would not suggest any reduction in theprogramme for the construction of destroyers, escort vessels, &amp;c.But he felt some doubt about the proposal to construct as many as40 submarines. Possibly, too, he would be ready to abandon theconstruction of the Vanguard, if this would make it possible tosecure the 16-inch ships at an earlier date. Every effort should bemade to press on with the construction of these 16-inch ships as early as possible.
Norway.Chartering ofNorwegiantankers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 55thConclusions,Minutes 1and 2.)Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,March 13, 1940.The Prime Minister suggested that the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence might discuss this aspect of theprogramme further with the First Lord of the Admiralty.The War Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the 1940 New construction programme recommended by the First Lord of theAdmiralty in W.P. (40) 53.(2) Took note-&apos;(a) that the Minister for Co-ordination of defence would discuss the capital ship position with theFirst Lord of the Admiralty;(b) that the number of vessels of smaller types to be laiddown in 1940 should be subject to review in, say,September 1940;(c.) that the Admiralty would consult with the Treasuryif it was desired to place orders for ship construc-tion in Canada.9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (40) 75), requesting authority&apos; tonegotiate with the Norwegian Government for the chartering ofadditional Norwegian tankers. Consideration of the memorandum was deferred to the following day, in order to allow time for further discussion of the proposals between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the other Ministers concerned.
