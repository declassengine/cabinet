The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 1.)Attack on shipping in oslo fjord.Attack onTrondhjemaerodrome.Reconnaissancesof theNorwegiancoast.Aalborgaerodrome.1. The Secretary of Stale for Air said that six Whitleys had carried out an attack on shipping in Oslo Fjord the previous nightDetailed reports had not yet been received.and all had returned.An attack had been carried out the previous night onTrondhjem aerodrome (Vaernes) by three Whitleys, but no reports had yet been received. Two of these aircraft had returned safely,but one had been forced to land on the sea near the Shetlands andone of its crew was missing.Three Blenheims were standing by for an attack on stavanger aerodrome.Reconnaissances of the Norwegian coast had been continued,with the following results : Bergen.50-60 merchant vessels had been observed, but no warships.No aircraft had been seen at the seaplane base.Trondhjem.Five merchant vessels had been observed but no warships,and three merchant vessels had been observed five miles to theSouth-West of Trondhjem.Haugesund.One destroyer or gunboat had been observed alongside thepier. The ship had opened fired and the aircraft had been hit twice. One Dornier 18 had been observed moored in the harbour and one large Norwegian freighter (12,000 tons)moving out. Also five merchant vessels (average 2,000 tons)had been seen in Bommel Fjord all heading seaward. no military activity had been seen in the town.The Secretary of State for Air also referred to the result ofthe reconnaissance of Aalborg aerodrome in Denmark which hehad mentioned at the War Cabinet on the previous day. Thisaerodrome was full of enemy troop-carrying aircraft and reportsshowed that it was one of the focal points so far as troop carryingto Norway was concerned. The aerodrome was situated outside thetown and was easily identifiable. It was easier to reach than, say,Oslo. The Air Staff were definitely of the opinion that it shouldbe bombed, and he agreed with this view. It was true that Norwaywas at Avar with Germany and the Danes were not. The norweigen minister, whom he had seen the previous day, had said that they regarded this aerodrome as one of the key points, and the effect onNorwegian morale of its being bombed would be excellent. It was true that the Germans might retaliate on our aerodromes and mightinflict loss on us. In his view, however, the operation should takeplace that night, if the weather was suitable.The Prime Minister said that he agreed that this aerodromeshould be bombed. The argument that we were to do nothing in denmark, because the Danes were not at war with the Germans,could not be sustained. He did not think that such an attack would bring retaliation any more than did the bombing ofTrondhjem aerodrome.In answer to a question, the Foreign Secretary said that he saw no necessity to inform the Danish Minister in London of theoperation.[21179] b 2
Enemy activity There had been an attack on three drifters off Peterhead theoff our coasts.    previous morning and a Heinkel had appeared over the Shetlandsshortly after 3 p.m., where it had been engaged indecisively by aGladiator of the Coastal Command.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of these statements.(ii) Authorised the Secretary of State for Air to give ordersfor the bombing of Aalborg aerodrome.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 2.)Norwegianoperations.PI.M.S. Furious.H.M.S. Suffolk.PI.M.S. Renown.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 88thConclusions,Minute 3.)PI.M.S. Hardy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Action byBritishsubmarines.Enemy mine-laying.Shipping losses.MediterraneanFleetmovements.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinetdetails of naval operations off Norway.H.M.S. Furious, whilst off Tromso, had sustained slight damage to her turbines from a near miss.The damage caused to H.M.S. Suffolk when returning fromthe bombardment of Stavanger had been serious and she was nowbeached at Scapa. He feared that it would be some time beforeshe would again be available for service.IT.M.S. Renown had suffered slight damage in her encounterwith Scharnhorst and would be away from service for a short time.The survivors from H.M.S. Hardy were due to reach london that evening and suitable arrangements had been made to welcomethem.H.M. Submarine Sea Lion had reported that 2 darkened ships had been approached in the East Coast mine barrier on the2nd April, but had escaped owing to high speed.The Polish Submarine Orzel had reported that she had sunkthe German ship Rio de Janeiro (5,260 tons) on the 8th April, east of christians and (South).Enemy aircraft had laid magnetic mines the previous daybetween Yarmouth and the Downs. Three magnetic mines hadbeen exploded off Ramsgate very shortly after being laid. Trafficthrough the Downs was to be released that morning.Enemy aircraft had been sighted over the Shetlands at 4 p.m.on the previous day and shore batteries had been in action. Nobombs had been dropped.Five destroyers were hunting U-boats which had been reportedeast of the Orkneys.The S.S. Stvainby, a British ship of 4,935 tons, bound from narvik to the United Kingdom loaded with ore, had been torpedoed and sunk on the morning of the 18th April 23 miles north-east ofMuckle Flugga in the Shetlands.The First Lord informed the War Cabinet of certain Fleetmovements that were contemplated in the Mediterranean in thenear future, and in which the French naval authorities were co-operating. In view of the predominance of the French naval forces in the Mediterranean, the French would expect to be giventhe Naval Command in that area, but would be prepared to takeorders from the Supreme Naval Command in London, in the same way as our Military Forces took orders from General Gamelin&apos;headquarters in France.
Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 3.)Generalsituation.Press reports.3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that a telegram hadbeen received from Admiral of the Fleet Lord Cork and Orrery,containing the outline of the plan which had been agreed between himself and General Mackesy for action at Narvik with the forces now at his disposal.General Carton de Wiart had advanced to a point just west of Steinkjaer, and hoped to be in occupation of Verdal that night.One thousand men had been landed at Andalsnes and anotherbattalion would be put ashore that night. This force was being provided with a number of 3-7 inch naval howitzers. It was believed that the Norwegians were in possession of Dombaas.Commenting on the general situation, the First Lord said that approximately 8,000 men had now been put ashore without anycasualties. W.T. communication had been established by meansof &quot; portmanteau &quot; sets.Further statements were made on dispositions and future operations in Norway, a record of which is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Attention was drawn to articles in The Daily Express by theLondon  correspondent  of   an   Oslo  newspaper   regarding   thepossibility of operations in the Trondhjem area, and to a map inThe Daily Sketch drawing special attention to Trondhjem.The Prime Minister said that this matter had been raised atthe Military Co-ordination Committee, and that he was taking steps to deal with it.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that enquiries should also be made as to the information given in theFrench Press as to operations in Norway.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 4.)Western Front.TheMediterranean.Protection ofBritish shipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing of importance to report from the Western Front.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.5. The Minister of Shipping made a statement regarding theposition of British shipping in the Mediterranean and the measureswhich could be taken for its diversion :  The number of British ships in the Mediterranean variedfrom day to day. On the 16th April, for example, there were217 ships, while on the 18th April this number had fallen to168. There was, however, always a large number of ships,including very valuable fast liners, engaged in trade with india, Australia and the Far East.If it were decided to clear all British shipping from theMediterranean, a period of between 5 and 7 days would berequired for the purpose, provided those ships which had justentered the Mediterranean at either end could be turned back.Complete diversion of this kind would, however, cause verygreat confusion.There were, however, certain preliminary steps whichcould be taken which would produce a valuable effect in a periodof from 10 to 14 days : (i) Orders could be given to all ships (numbering atpresent 36) now in Australian waters to follow the cape route on their return voyage. That wouldinvolve a delay of about 7 days in the case of theslower ships, and 5 days in the case of the fasterones. No great inconvenience would result, and valuable ships would be rendered safe from attack.
6. In the course of the discussion recorded in Minute 5 above,the Minister of Shipping said that he was proceeding on theassumption that in all circumstances it would still be possible forus to send British ships into the Mediterranean as far east as Tunis.If this were not possible, he could not maintain the import to thiscountry of the required supplies of iron ore, now that Narviksupplies were unavailable, unless he had recourse to supplies fromBrazil, which involved a much longer haul.Iron Ore.Supplies from north Africa.(ii) Most ships outward bound from this country passing through the Mediterranean carried cargo for theBritish forces in the Near East. This cargo,which was discharged at Haifa, Port Said and alexandria, amounted at the present time to15,000 tons a week. It included a good deal ofmeasurement cargo, e.g., mechanical transport(mainly ambulances) for the Australian Expedi-tionary Force. It would clearly be most incon-venient if it were found necessary to issue ordersat Gibraltar to ships carrying such Governmentcargo to proceed to Suez via the Cape, since thiswould involve a delay of between 25 and 30 days.As a first step, it would be possible to arrange forthe Government cargo for the Near East to be concentrated in the minimum number of ships; thiswould enable the remaining ships to be diverted tothe Cape, if necessary, without being under thenecessity thereafter of proceeding to Suez todischarge. No great inconvenience would be causedby the issue of orders for concentrating cargo inthis manner, though in one or two cases it wouldprobably be necessary to unload cargo alreadyloaded in British ports.If further action were decided upon, a large number of separatesteps would require to be taken.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wasin favour of preliminary action being taken in the two directionsindicated by the Minister of Shipping.The Prime Minister agreed. No harm would, in his judgment,be done if later it became known to the Italians that we had orderedBritish ships now in Australia to proceed home by the Cape insteadof through the Mediterranean.In reply to an enquiry by the Minister of Shipping whether itwas desired that no action should be taken in the case of ships nowat Colombo and elsewhere homeward bound from the Far East, thePrime Minister thought that it would be better to defer taking action for a clay or two. In the meanwhile, the political situation would be kept under constant review by the Foreign Secretary, andthe War Cabinet would be in a position to determine whether thesituation called for further measures.The War Cabinet (i) Invited the Minister of Shipping to take steps at once toput into operation the preliminary measures for theprotection of British shipping in the Mediterranean,indicated at &quot; X &quot; in his statement as recorded above,(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary to report at once to the WarCabinet if he thought that the political situation called for further precautionary measures.
Italy.Proposals of theFrench war committee.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 8.)Beception in italy of thePrimeMinister &apos;sspeech on the balkans.BeportedGerman threat to Hungary.Count Teleki&apos;visit to Rome.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, as agreed by the War Cabinet the previous day, he had instructed our ambassador in Paris to communicate to the French Governmentour views on the proposals of the French War Committee on thesituation which would arise if Italy attacked Yugoslavia (TelegramNo. 100 DIPP to Paris).At a dinner the previous evening, the Italian Ambassador had told Mr. R. A. Butler that the Prime Minister&apos;s speech regardingour attitude to the Balkans had been very well received in Italywhere it had had a reassuring effect.On the other hand, an official of the French Embassy had shown the Foreign Office the previous evening a telegram received from aNetherland source, according to which eight German Divisions hadbeen moved to the Hungarian Frontier. In addition four or fiveGerman Divisions were reported from Vienna as having proceeded to the Slovak Frontier on the 11th April. If Herr Hitler had not obtained definite promises from Signor Mussolini at the Brennermeeting, he might think that the best way to force Italy&apos;s handwould be to threaten Hungary, since in that event Italy could not remain inactive and might seek to recoup herself in Dalmatia.The foregoing supposition was, to some extent, supported bya report regarding Count Teleki&apos;s visit to Rome received from whatwas said to be a most reliable Vatican source. The substance of thisreport was as follows : Until the Brenner Meeting, Signor Mussolini had never been completely confident of German victory, but he had returned from that meeting a changed man. He was said tohave been completely overcome by the brilliant plan of campaignplaced before him by Herr Hitler. Since that time he had become extremely secretive and had not discussed his intentionseither with the Military High Command or with Count Ciano,his chief confidant being the Secretary-General of the FascistParty.During his visit to Rome, Count Teleki had been strongly pressed by Signor Mussolini to come into the war on the sideof Germany; Signor Mussolini had said that he was confidentof German victory if Italy and Hungary were to play the partsallotted to them in the German plan of campaign. He did not,however, give particulars of that plan to Count Teleki. TheDuce had told Count Teleki that care would be necessary tofind some suitable casus belli and had suggested that a militaryadvance by the Western Powers in the direction of the Danubewould prove very suitable for this purpose. Count Telekihad given no definite answer to Signor Mussolini&apos;s suggestion and had said that he must consult his Government. CountTeleki had informed the Vatican that he was convinced thatMussolini&apos;s decision to take sides with Germany was genuine.He had also said that he understood that it was part of theplan to disperse the Allied Forces over widely separatedtheatres of war before the main German attack was launchedby Herr Hitler. When the moment came, there was thepossibility of surprise attacks being made first on Corsica and gibraltar, and later on North Africa. Recently Herr hitler had been making great efforts in Madrid to win General Francoover to his side, but was not believed to have achieved muchin this direction.   It was possible that the course of military
operations in Norway, coupled with certain indications receivedfrom Washington, might have done something to damp signor mussolini&apos;s ardour.Views of the The previous day M. Momtchiloff, the Bulgarian Minister, hadBulgarian called at the Foreign Office on his return from Sofia, where he hadMinister in met the Bulgarian Minister in Berlin, who was also on leave. the berlin. latter had taken a pessimistic view of the situation from the Germanstandpoint. Operations in Norway had not proceeded according to plan; it had originally been intended that once Norway was occupied, Germany should advance south-eastwards down the danube and that this should be the signal for Italy to enter thewar. The time-table, however, has been upset by the course ofevents and it was likely that these latter developments would nowbe postponed.Report of The Foreign Secretary drew attention also to a telegramItalian No. 454, dated 16th April, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,intentions Washington, reporting that he had been informed that day by areceived from high official of the State Department that it had been learned from washington. a competent source that the German Army Command had been strongly opposed to the Norwegian adventure and that, if herr hitler were now to meet with serious reverses on land in the West,the Army Command would probably overthrow the Nazi regime.According to this source, information from Rome did not point toItaly taking any action at present.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he hoped that wewould take an early opportunity of placing our relations with Italyon a more solid basis. There was the strongest objection to thepresent situation in which we were liable to be attacked by Italy inthe Mediterranean at any moment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs felt that Italy&apos;attitude would be greatly affected by the course of events in Norway.He hoped to bring before the War Cabinet the broad question of our policy towards Italy. In the meanwhile, he would prefer to reservea judgment as to the line which we should take.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that steps should betaken to review the measures which would have to be put intooperation on the outbreak of war with Italy or if war with Italybecame imminent.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.. (ii) Instructed the Secretary to make arrangements for a reviewto be undertaken by the appropriate Sub-Committee ofthe War Cabinet of the measures which would have to beput into operation on the outbreak of war with Italy or if war with Italy appeared imminent.Western Front.Action to betaken if theNetherlands or belgium is invaded.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 96thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that as agreed by the War Cabinet he had sent to His Majesty&apos;ambassador. Paris, the terms of our communication to the FrenchGovernment in regard to the action to be taken by the Allies ifthe Netherlands or Belgium were invaded. (Telegram 217 Saving.)This telegram had crossed telegram No. 137 DIPP, dated18th April, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, which gave particulars of the instructions issued by the French Govern-ment to the French Ambassador in Brussels concerning the actionwhich he should take in the event of a German attack on theNetherlands. These instructions suggested that the French Govern-ment were firm in their decision to move Allied troops into Belgiumin the event of a German attack on the Netherlands, whether or

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Telegram No. 546,&quot; dated 16th April, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador. Washington, containing the following report from a competent observer who had just travelled through the southern part of the U.S.S.R. :-Long food queues were to be seen everywhere, and the food shortage was expected to continue. At the Groszki oil wells,the refineries were densely congested, the oil lying about every-where, with the result that the area was highly vulnerable tofire; the same was true of Baku. The observer had visited anumber of Black Sea ports where he had seen no evidence ofany kind of naval or military preparations. He had got theimpression that the Soviet Government had no intention ofgiving the Geimians more than the minimum of supplies.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs drew attentionto Telegram No. 289 DIPP, dated 18th April, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Representative, Stockholm, containing the following report from the Naval Attache to the Director of Naval Intelligence,which the Norwegian Naval Attache had received from the SwedishDefence Department : On the 17th April German troops had embarked intransports at Memel. Two or three thousand German troops had landed on the Danish Island of Bornholm. There were about 200 German fishing craft and a large number of aircraft on this island.According to a later message from Admiral Evans for the first sea Lord (Telegram No. 295 DIPP, dated 18th April, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Representative, Stockholm) no anxiety was beingcaused in Sweden either by the massing of German troops in fishingboats and small craft at Bornholm or by the presence of 40,000troops with transports at Korsoer.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Sweden.PossibleGermanintentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 88tbConclusions,Minute 7.)U.S.S.R.Tradenegptiations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 7.)11. The War Cabinet had before them a Note(W.P. (G.) (40) 106) by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs covering a Memorandum which it was proposed to hand to theSoviet Ambassador in reply to the approach which the latter had made on the 27th March.The operative part of the Memorandum which it was proposedto hand to M. Maisky was as follows : &apos;&apos; It will be realised that at the present time it is of paramount importance for His Majesty&apos;s Government so to adapt their economic policy as best to further their war effort.Any trade agreement concluded with a neutral government therefore must be related to present war conditions. Inparticular, Flis Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to bereassured as to the amount of Soviet goods going to Germanyand as to the destination of goods imported into the soviet union from abroad i.e., that these were not destined for germany, but for use in the Union itself.[21179] cnot an invitation to do so was received from the Belgian Govern-ment. If any assurance in the contrary sense had been given to theBelgian Ambassador in Paris, it would seem as if it had beenintentionally misleading.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to learn whatconcrete proposals for a trade agreement the Soviet Governmentwould be prepared to make, having regard to the foregoingconsiderations.&quot;In the course of a statement explanatory of his Note, theForeign Secretary referred to the following points :- (1) The question of resuming trade negotiations with russia had been mentioned in the course of his recent con-versations with His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in the balkan countries, and with His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Moscow. The general view had been that, while therewas not much ground for hope, it would not be rightto leave unexplored this method of improving therelations between the two countries.(2) The matter had its political aspects in our own country; anattempt to negotiate a trade agreement with russia might act as a lubricant, to ensure a better reception incertain Parliamentary quarters for our recent trade agreement with Spain and for the trade agreement which we hoped to negotiate with Italy.(3) The Soviet Government themselves probably had political reasons for desiring better relations with this country.They knew that Baku was in danger from the air, andthat the Murmansk region would be exposed to a similardanger, if we established ourselves in Narvik.(4) There were certain commodities, e.g., timber, which itwould be very useful to us to be able to obtain fromRussia.(5) If trade negotiations with Russia began, we should not enter those negotiations with any great expectations. Inthe first place, we should find it impossible to preventthe internal produce of the Soviet Union being exported to Germany, although something might perhaps beachieved by pre-emption. In the second place, we couldonly hope for a limited measure of success in preventing the re-export to Germany of goods imported into theSoviet Union from abroad.(6) Without being unduly optimistic, it might be said thatthere was a reasonable chance of a limited agreementof a barter character emerging from the proposednegotiations. In return for the right to pre-emptcertain commodities, we might allow the Soviet union to import certain other commodities (e.g., rubber andcopper) on a rationed basis, calculated by reference toher internal consumption.The Minister for Economic Warfare thought that the second part of the suggested bargain, namely, the rationing of certainimports into the Soviet Union, was the more possible of attainment.The Prime minister thought that it would be very bad for thiscountry&apos;s credit if the Soviet Union were allowed to follow theirhabitual tactics of spinning out the negotiations.The Foreign Secretary said that&apos; this danger could be avertedby giving the Russians at the appropriate stage of the negotiationsa time-limit of, say, a month, in which to conclude a bargain.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was ingeneral agreement with the method of approach to the SovietGovernment proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Minister for Economic Warfare assumed that it was not intended that the Contraband Control should cease, during thenegotiations, to exercise a strict control over imports into the soviet union.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 94thConclusions,Minute 7.)
The War Cabinet(i)Approved the Memorandum, attached to W.P. (G.) (40) 106,which the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed to hand to the Soviet Ambassador,(ii) Agreed that there could be no question of any relaxation of our contraband control over Russian imports pendingthe conclusion of a trade agreement.contraband control.Control ofsupplies toGermany fromthe Far Bast.(previous references:W.M. (40) 68thConclusions,Minute 1; 76thConclusions,Minute 8,and 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)12. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 108).The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled thatthere were two steps on which the War Cabinet had decided, inagreement with the French Government, to prevent contrabandfrom reaching Germany through Soviet Russia. The first was thatwe should use our control of raw materials to obtain the agreementof the Japanese Government to the limitation of supplies to Russiaand Germany. The second was that orders should be issued to theCommander-in-Chief, China Station, for the interception of ships of all nations destined directly or indirectly for Vladivostok. Itwas to this latter course that the Commonwealth Government had raised objection. He need not remind the War Cabinet of thehistory of Australian anxieties on this score and of the negotiationswith Mr. Casey prior to the despatch of the first Australiancontingent. It was undesirable to arouse fresh fears at a time whenthe second batch of the Australian Expeditionary Force wasleaving, when six Australian destroyers were doing useful service in the Mediterranean, and when there had been discussion as to theposition of the Netherlands East Indies. Moreover, we should need the co-operation of the Australian Government in our negotiationswith the Japanese, since the former were large exporters to Japan.Mr. Menzies&apos;s argument that the interception of Japanese ships would jeopardise the prospects of our negotiations with them was supported by Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s telegram No. 605 from Tokyo.It was there suggested that, in preference to a preliminary holding up of Japanese ships, we should try to obtain an assurance, such asthe Japanese had already offered to give in respect of rubber and tin, that no contraband consigned either direct to Vladivostok orfor transhipment at a Japanese port would be carried in Japaneseships.The Secretary of State asked the War Cabinet to approve the three recommendations contained in paragraph 5 of his memorandum.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that he was concerned at the time needed for consultation with both Tokyo and washington, under the procedure proposed by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs. If we were to decide not to stopJapanese ships, we should have to settle whether we could stop the ships of other neutrals. He asked for authority to beginnegotiations at once with the Japanese Government on the lines suggested by Sir Robert Craigie in his telegram No. 605 already referred to.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that, if wedelayed taking action, there was a danger, as suggested bySir Robert Craigie, that vested interests in contraband trade wouldbecome established in Japan. We could not forgo the right to intercept any shipping whatever if the evidence justified it, and he did not think that this would cause trouble either with the UnitedStates or with the Japanese Government. To exempt Japaneseships would be to discriminate against the shipping of other nations.He proposed that no exception should be made in favour of any
