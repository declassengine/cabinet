The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that there had beenSituation. no enemy activity near our coasts the previous day or night.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 99thConclusions,Minute 1.)R.A.F. activity.Stavanger Formations of cloud flying Blenheims had twice attempted toaerodrome. reach Stavanger, but the sorties had had to be abandoned owingto lack of cloud cover. The previous night the aerodrome had been attacked by a formation of Wellingtons. Heavy and light bombs had been seen to explode among fifteen aircraft, six of which, itwas believed, had been destroyed. In all, some fifty aircraft hadbeen observed on the aerodrome. Direct hits had also been scoredon the crossing of the runways.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air said that it wouldseem that Stavanger aerodrome was still fairly fully used, and thatthe bombardment by H.M.S. Suffolk had not done a great deal of damage. The Naval Staff would no doubt consider whether, in thesecircumstances, such bombardments were worth the risks involved.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that such a bombard-ment should produce good results, but the weather had beenunfavourable on this occasion and the liaison between the spottingaircraft and HALS. Stiff oik had broken down. In addition, theaircraft which should have protected HALS. Suffolk from air attack had not made contact with her.Aalborgaerodrome.Mine-laying.Western Front.coastal command.The Secretary of State for Air, continuing, said that Aalborgaerodrome had again been attacked the previous night by a forma-tion of six Wellingtons, four of which had obtained hits. Onebuilding had been set on fire and five other fires had been started.Fleavy anti-aircraft fire had been encountered,. and one Wellingtonhad been observed to be heavily engaged. One Wellington had failedto return.A force of thirty-six Hampdens had undertaken mine-laying operations the previous night, of which twenty-five machines had successfully completed their task. One Hampden had failed toreturn. Every endeavour was being made to complete these mine-laying operations whilst there was a moon, in order to free the machines for other operations at a later date. Whilst the mine-laying operations were in progress, a number of enemy convoys and ships had been reported.The Hurricanes of No. 73 Squadron with the Advanced air striking Force had had a series of successful air combats withMesserschmitts. On the first occasion eight Flurricanes had attackedtwelve Messerschmitts 109 and shot down two, which had been seen to crash. A third was believed to have been badly damaged. OneHurricane had been hit during this fight and forced to land.The same squadron, later in the day, had encountered a forma-tion of three Messerschmitts 109 and had shot one down in flameseast of Borg. In a third combat this squadron had attacked fiveMesserschmitts 110 and seven Messerschmitts 109, with the resultthat two Messerschmitts 110 had been shot down in flames, whilstthree other enemy fighters had been severely damaged. TheHurricanes had sustained no casualties.The Coastal Command had continued their reconnaissances theprevious day, but there had been nothing of particular interest toreport.   Low visibility and bad weather had resulted in a number[21194]of their tasks having to be cancelled.b 2
Proposed The Chief of the Air Staff asked to be given discretion tobombing of       bomb the aerodrome at Westerland on the Island of Sylt.   It wasWesterland       believed that considerable use was being made of this aerodrome byaerodrome        German aircraft employed in operations in central Norway.   The(Island of Sylt). operation differed slightly from the bombing of the Ffornumaerodrome on Sylt, inasmuch as this latter target at the south endof the Island was far from human habitation, while the Westerlandaerodrome had houses nearer to it.   There had been a report thatall civilians on the Island of Sylt had been evacuated.Th Secretary of State for Air said that he did not think this operation differed from the bombing of Scapa by the Germans andhe hoped that discretion to bomb Westerland aerodrome would begiven to the Air Staff. At the same time he would like to pointout that aerodromes themselves were not really very good targets,as the enemy could move quite easily from one to the other.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Agreed that the Air Staff should be given discretion toattack Westerland aerodrome.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 99thConclusions,Minute 2.)Narvik area.Shipping losses.Enemy mine-laying activities.2. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that the railway bridge east of Narvik town had been blown up on the 20th of April.Our destroyers were preventing repairs being made.The S.S. Cedar Bank (5,159 tons), which had been on her wayto Andalsnes with a cargo of motor transport, had been torpedoed and sunk whilst in convoy. The other ships in the convoy had allsucceeded in getting into Andalsnes safely and had unloaded theircargo in daytime without disturbance.Four mines had been exploded off Coquet Island. Onemagnetic mine in Liverpool Bay and six in the Downs had alsobeen destroyed. Shipping in this area had been held up for themoment.Reference was also made to certain proposed mining operations.The details of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached, are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by the deputy chief of Naval Staff.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 99thConclusions,Minute 4.)Attitude of thePress.3. The War Cabinet were informed that the situation namsos was not clear, but it was evident that our forces were facedwith a most difficult situation. The town of Namsos and the rail-head had been destroyed, and the pier damaged by air attack,although no casualties had been reported amongst either the british or the French troops. The French transport Ville d&apos;Algers had arrived at Namsos on the previous night, but had been sent awaywithout unloading.Discussion followed on existing dispositions and projectedoperations, and on the attitude of the Press with regard to events in Norway.
A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;^ Standard Pile of War cabinet conclusions.Sweden.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 98thConclusions,Minute 4.)Germanassurance toSwedishGovernment.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 323 DIPP, dated the 21st April, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Representative, Stockholm, reporting that the GermanGovernment had informed the Swedish Legation in Berlin that they intended to send three to five more Divisions to Norway. TheGerman Government had explained that they had made this com-munication in order that the Swedish Government should not bealarmed lest the German Government intended to use these troopsagainst Sweden.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.(previous erence:W.M. (40) 99thConclusions,Minute 7.)Proposedapproach to signor mussolini.5.&quot; The Secretary of State for Foreign A if airs drew attentionto telegram No. 201 DIPP, dated the 20th April, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Athens, reporting that the Military Attachehad found the Greek Military authorities that day much lessalarmed regarding the immediate prospects.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs again referred tothe agreement which had been reached as to the proposed approach to Signor Mussolini by the Pope, by President Roosevelt and theKing of Italy. Mr. Taylor had asked whether we could do anything which, without having the appearance of collaboration, would havethe effect of strengthening the appeal to the Duce. Some two orthree days previously he (the Foreign Secretary) had considered thedesirability of His Majesty the King also sending a letter to theKing of Italy, and a draft of such a letter had been pi^prepared. Hehad consulted Sir Percy Loraine, who was in favour of the despatchof such a letter, but Sir Noel Charles, who had also been consulted,did not favour this course. He had given instructions to theForeign Office to communicate on this subject with the King&apos;private Secretary. He proposed that, if it were decided to proceedwith this project, and if His Majesty concurred, the letter shouldbe signed and despatched to Rome, on the understanding that thequestion whether or not it should be delivered to the King of italy should depend on a last-minute decision to be taken in Rome in thelight of the advice received by Mr. Myron Taylor. The latterconsidered that it was important that any action which we might take should synchronise with the action to be taken by the Pope and president Roosevelt. The tone of the letter would be friendly butfirm.Discussion ensued as to whether, on balance, it was advisable that such, a letter should be sent. In favour of this course, it was urged that, while the letter might not do much good, it was difficultto see that it could do any harm. On the other hand, it was pointedout that, if Italy chose to make the letter public, they might claim that we were afraid of any action which they might take. The king of Italy now appeared to be in close relations with Signor Mussolini,and that the former was likely to show the letter to the Duce, who might well publish it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer summed up the position by saying that, while the War Cabinet was hesitant about thissuggestion, they would be content with any decision which might betaken by the Foreign Secretary in consultation with the PriiMinister.rime
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in thelight of the Cabinets discussion, he would give further considera-tion to this proposal before taking any action. The fact that theostentatious approaches to Italy made by M. Reynaud had producedno effect was, perhaps, a further argument against the despatch ofthe proposed letter.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.contraband control.Control ofsupplies toGermany fromthe Far East.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 98thConclusions,Minute 8.).6. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs referred tothe decision reached by the War Cabinet on the 19th April(W.M. (40) 97th Conclusions, Minute 12), suspending for three days the issue of instructions to the Commander-in-Chief, China Station,for the interception in Pacific Waters of ships of all nations thought to be carrying cargo of suspect destination, and laying it down that japanese ships should only be intercepted occasionally where theevidence gave strong grounds for suspicion and after reference tothe authorities in London. As a result of further discussion between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Minister ofEconomic Warfare and himself, the Minister of Economic Warfarehad now agreed that no ship of any nation should be interceptedwithout prior notice to the Foreign Office and Dominions Office.The Minister had said that he had no intention of arranging for the interception of any ship in the immediate future.The War Cabinet-Took note that the Minister of Economic Warfare wouldnot issue instructions for the interception in PacificWaters of any ship thought to be carrying cargo of suspectdestination without giving prior notice to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,April 22, 1940.
