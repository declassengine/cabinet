Royal Air Force on their admirably planned and successfullyexecuted operation against the German seaplane base on the island of Sylt. The exploit redounded to the credit not only of the RoyalAir Force but of the British Empire in the eyes of the world. Hesuggested, and the War Cabinet warmly agreed, that their apprecia-tion should be conveyed to the members of the Air Staff who hadplanned the operation and to the Royal Air Force personnel whohad carried it out.The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet that,apart from the one aircraft which had been brought down by german AA. fire, only two machines which were virtuallyundamaged, had been hit by shell splinters. One of the lessons ofthe raid was the difficulty of countering night attacks even in brightmoonlight. Heavier casualties would undoubtedly have beensuffered in a daylight raid.The Secretary of State for Air thought that the provedimpossibility of preventing air attack at night was a factor whichoperated to the advantage of our numerically inferior bomber force.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that, from the pointof view of the efficacy of close-range weapons, the results of the raid were encouraging.In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for Air said thatthe Germans had a good close-range weapon, similar to the Boforsgun. But so far as was known, they did not possess a close-rangepredictor.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence asked what progress had been made in the provision of instruments of theR.D.F. type for enabling anti-aircraft guns to engage unseentargets.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to enquire into the matter.The War Cabinet :-(a) Took note of the above statement.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to convey thecongratulations of the War Cabinet to those concernedin the planning and carrying out of the operation against Sylt on the night of the 19th/20th March.
Air attack onNorwegianconvoy,March 20th.Publicityregardingattacks onneutralshipping.Iron Ore:German importsfrom Sweden.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 73rdConclusions,Minute 7.)The Dutch S.S. Phobos (7,412 tons) had been damaged,probably by a mine, off the East Coast. The ship had been towed tothe Downs, where she was now at anchor. Seven survivors from the danish ships Viking (1,153 tons) and Bothal (2,109 tons) had been landed. They had reported that their vessels had been torpedoed50 miles from Wick.The outgoing Norwegian convoy had been attacked by aircraft at dusk on the previous day. Two skuas protecting the convoy had made contact with seven enemy aircraft and had driven them off.Our aircraft claimed to have hit all the enemy aircraft. The resultsof the attack on the convoy were as follows : Norwegian S.S. Svinda (1,267 tons) abandoned and reported sinking.Scandinavian S.S. Torra EUse (721 tons) damaged.Swedish S.S. Ulklippan (1,599 tons) hit by an incendiarybomb.The Prime Minister thought that greater publicity should begiven to the continual attacks on neutral vessels, in order to create a sense in the public mind of the way in which neutral ships werebeing sunk, and neutral seamen killed or drowned by the Germans.This applied particularly to the two Danish ships reported as sunk.It would not, however, be desirable to attract undue attention to the losses sustained by the neutral ships in convoy, which, moreover,were relatively light.*The Secretly of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldtake steps to ensure that the attention of neutral Governments was drawn to the attacks on neutrals.Continuing, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that the anti-submarine trawler Lowdock had been sunk in collision on the19th March.  There was only one survivor.S.S. Barnhill (5,439 tons) had been attacked and set on fire byan enemy aircraft off Beachy Head. The ship had been beached andsalvage vessels were on the scene.A specially-fitted aircraft had exploded a magnetic mine offHarwich on the previous day.No less than 15 ore ships, with a total tonnage of 80,000 tons,had arrived at Narvik during the past ten days and had sailed, or were about to sail, for Germany.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.Distribution ofGermanDivisions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 73rdConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that the German2nd Armoured Division had now moved into the area opposite the saar; the 56th Division had moved from Bohemia to CentralGermany; and two more divisions had moved from Polazid to central Germany. The general trend of troop movements inGermany was towards the W&apos;est.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
German-soviet relations.(previous references:W.M. (40) 50thConclusions,Minute 3, andW.M. (40) 66thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Paris, had received information from anAustrian source that the Germans had sent submarine instructorsto Murmansk, Odessa and Kronstadt, in order to render Sovietsubmarines fit for service, and had despatched valuable instruments and other equipment for this purpose. According to this source, itwas understood that it would be possible to render between 110and 120 Soviet submarines fit for service. This report had been communicated to the Admiralty and was being examined by theNaval Staff.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Prance. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that(Previous according to a telegram received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Reference: Paris, M.

Affairs; that he had secured the adherence of MM. Chautemps andM. Reynaud&apos;s Mandel; that he hoped to persuade M. Daladier to remain at theprospect of Ministry of Defence and that it was his intention to secure, ifforming a possible, a representative in his Government of the Socialist Party,Government. though probably not M. Blum himself. According to a latermessage, M. Reynaud had now secured the adherence of MM. deMonzie, Campinchi and Dautry. M. Corbin, whom he had seenthat morning, had confirmed generally the foregoing information.The latter did not know whether M. Daladier would consent toremain at the Ministry of Defence and thought that he wouldprobably be guided by the Radical-Socialist Party which he was meeting that day. The collapse of M. Daladier&apos;s administration was entirely due to public feeling regarding Finland; M. Corbinhad agreed that M. Daladier&apos;s Government might have survivedif our successful raid over Sylt had taken place two days earlier.British reply to He (the Secretary of State) had informed M.

(This message hadbeen passed on by the French Government to the French ambassador in Rome, who had informed Sir Percy Loraine.)The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Supreme WarCouncil.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 73rdConclusions,Minute 6.)He had further informed M. Corbin that we considered thatthe sooner a meeting of the Supreme War Council could be held the better. M. Corbin had replied that only the crisis in france had prevented a decision from being taken on this question; he explained that if M. Reynaud succeeded in forming a Government,he would probably meet the Chamber on Saturday, the 23rd March,and be ready for a meeting of the Supreme War Council towardsthe end of the following week. The Foreign Secretary had urgedthat an earlier date should be fixed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Belgium.allied assistance in theevent of aGerman attack.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 73rdConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Chief of the Air Staff said that there was a point inconnection with Allied assistance to Belgium in the event of aGerman attack which was not at present clear, and on which theChiefs of Staff desired a Cabinet ruling, after which it might bedesirable to consult the French. He recalled that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs in his Memorandum (W.P. (40) 98) had said : &quot; Sir Lancelot Oliphant should take the opportunity ofemphasising once again that the effectiveness of our aid would depend on the promptness with which an invitation was addressed to us . . .This passage might be interpreted to mean that the Allied forces should not enter Belgium, even after a German violation of thatcountry, until the British and French Governments had receiveda formal invitation from the Belgian Government to do so. On theother hand, when the War Cabinet had considered the question ofwhat action we should take in the event of the invasion of Holland,it had been decided that we should, if necessary, send troops into belgium, even if the Belgian Government gave no active assistanceto the Dutch. It was therefore logical that, if Belgium wereinvaded by Germany, our troops should enter Belgium even if the belgians did not invite us in.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs confirmed that thiswas the view which was taken by the Foreign Office; and in supportof this he mentioned that in a communication recently sent toBrussels the passage which concerned an invitation from the belgians had been so phrased as to ensure that it did not imply thatwe should necessarily wait for an invitation from the Belgians.The Prime Minister thought that it would obviously be preferable that we should receive an invitation from the BelgianGovernment. At the same time, he considered that our instructionsto the British and French Commanders-in-Chief in France shouldbe so framed as to enable them to issue the necessary orders to advance into the Low Countries immediately, whether or not they received an invitation from the Belgians. The latter should not,however, be informed of this.The Chief of the Air Staff said that, whilst we ourselves mightbe quite clear about the aotion which should be taken, the executiveorders to march would be given by General Gamelin, who in turnmight, under existing arrangements, have to receive authority fromthe French Government. It was, therefore, most desirable toascertain what precisely the position was, so as to ensure that therewould be no delay if and when the emergency arose.Discussion then ensued as to how the.necessary approach shouldbe made to the French.The Secretary of State for War suggested that advantage mightbe taken of the visit which the Chief of the Imperial General staff was now paying to General Gamelin to ascertain the position.
France.SuggestedAnglo-FrenchDeclaration notto conclude aseparate peace.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 120thConclusions,Minute 9.)8. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on a suggested Anglo-FrenchDeclaration not to conclude a separate peace (W.P. (G.) (40) 86and 87).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it was not now necessary to obtain an immediate decision on these detailed proposals. The War Cabinet had already agreed that we should consult the French in regard to such a Declaration, which would clearly have to be discussed at a Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil. At the moment there was no French Government to consult and he did not therefore propose to ask the War Cabinetto give a decision at once on the actual text which he had putforward. It was probable, however, that a new French Governmentwould like to mark its entering on office with the issue of such aDeclaration and he proposed therefore to continue consultations withthe Dominion Governments, so that we could raise the matter atthe appropriate moment.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs read a letter fromthe Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa (P.S. 26/6), datedthe 20th March, to the effect that, having regard to the politicaltension in the Union, his Government could not join in the proposed declaration. Further, unless its usefulness was beyond question,they felt inclined to question the policy of making such a Declara-tion at all, even if it were confined to the French and UnitedKingdom Governments. The letter drew an analogy with the ParisEconomic Resolutions of 1915, which had later raised serious difficulties in the last war, and expressed the fear that a referenceto close economic co-operation would be misinterpreted by theUnited States of America and other neutrals as indicating an intention to form an Allied Woe directed against the rest of theworld.The Prime Minister said that he did not attach greatimportance to this line of argument.   He thought, on the contrary,The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was desirable that the Belgian Governmentshould invite us to enter Belgium as soon as that country was invaded by Germany (assuming that they had notinvited us to enter Belgium before the invasion started).(2) Agreed that, notwithstanding (1) above, if Germanyinvaded Belgium, the Allied forces should immediatelymove into Belgium, without waiting for an invitation from the Belgian Government; but that our intentionin this respect should not be made known to the BelgianGovernment, lest this should give them the impression that it was a matter of indifference to us whether they invited us to enter their country.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for War to communicate theabove Conclusions at once to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, who was at present visiting general gamelin, and to request him to enquire whether it wasalso the intention of the French High Command to move into Belgium immediately that country was invaded byGermany, without waiting for an invitation from theBelgian Government.(4) Invited the secretary of State for War to communicate theresults of this enquiry to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, who would take the matter up withthe French Government, if there was any differencebetween the two Governments.
that world opinion was counting on close co-operation between france and Great Britain after the war as providing an element of stability in Europe, and that a Declaration such as was proposed would therefore have a good effect on neutral opinion. Further,French opinion and morale were not so entirely reliable that we could afford to neglect a Declaration which might very well strengthen thehands of some future Government at a time of difficulty.The Minister without Portfolio said that he had been informed by Professor A. J. Toynbee, who had recently been visiting Paris,that the French circles with which he had been in touch were strongly in favour of an early announcement of the closest possibleunion between France and Great Britain during and after the war.The Minister suggested that, if the Declaration were expanded tocover future financial and economic co-operation, reference shouldalso be made to co-operation in foreign and colonial policy.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would consider this suggestion.The War Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the suggestion that the FrenchGovernment should be asked, at a suitable moment, toconsider the issue of an Anglo-French Declaration (a) to the effect that the two Governments would notconclude a separate peace; and(b) to emphasise their intention to continue the closest possible co-operation after the conclusion ofpeace.(2) Deferred any decision on the text to be suggested for sucha Declaration.british expeditionary force.Supply oflabour.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 69thConclusions,Minute 11.)9.   The War Cabinet had before them An Extract from draft Minutes of a Meeting of theMilitary Co-ordination Committee (W.P. (40) 104);A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (G.) (40) 78).The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence summarised theviews expressed at the meeting of the Military Co-co-ordination committee on the 18th March. The First Lord of the Admiralty&apos;view was that the &apos;&apos; lines of communication &apos;&apos; installations absorbedfar too high a proportion of the total troops in France. TheSecretary of State for War had explained that the large numbers in the bases and on the lines of communication were needed : first,because of the effect of mechanisation on the size of the maintenanceinstallations, and, secondly, because of the length of the lines ofcommunication in France, the wide dispersion of our bases among16 different ports and the lack of accommodation in the forward area due to crowding by refugees. The present demands had been carefully scrutinised by the Commander-in-Chief, who could not hold himself responsible if the labour were withheld.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that, in hisopinion, it was not reasonable to compare our requirements in labour with those of the French or the Germans, who were fighting in theirown country and had been able to prepare in advance the necessaryaerodromes, roads and railways. The present demands for labour had been very carefully prepared and scrutinised. Nevertheless,the War Cabinet might like a further examination carried out.On the assumption that further labour . would have to beprovided, a decision should be given at once to send to France a portion of three Divisions, in order that immediate labour require-ments might be met while further sources were being opened up.
In the course of the discussion on this question the followingpoints were made : (a) The training of the three Divisions in question was already being held up by lack of equipment, and their employ-ment in France would not retard the ultimate date bywhich these Divisions would be fit to take their place inthe line.(b) It was proposed to bring these troops back from France inAugust, when further sources of labour should beavailable. They would not be brought back, however, if some arrangement with the French authorities could bemade by which the complete Divisions could continue their training in France.(c) The morale of the troops concerned would suffer less from employment on labour duties than from lack of equip-ment during their training period in this country. the divisional Commanders reported that the troops were&quot; aching to go.&quot;(d) The three Divisions in question the 12th Division fromKent, the 46th Division from the Midlands and the23rd Division from Lancashire contained a proportionof men under 19 whom it would be undesirable to separate from their units in the event of them being sent to France. If, however, they were to go to France,it would be necessary to make a statement in Parliamentexplaining the position and the reason for the action proposed.The Secretary of State for War emphasised the importance of meeting the immediate requirements of labour. This could only bedone by sending portions of these three Divisions to France. As tothe numbers concerned, the Adjutant-General was going to Franceand would explain to the Commander-in-Chief the view taken inregard to this large demand for labour. Steps would be taken toensure that the demands for labour put forward represented theminimum requirements, and that the demands were checkedmonthly.He thought that voluntary enlistment of young men betweenthe ages of 18 and 20 might well prove attractive. He proposed,however, to make enquiries of those who could advise him as to the response which such an appeal would secure. He would be grateful for the help of the Minister of Labour and National Service in thismatter.The Secretary of State added that mechanisation was one ofthe causes contributing to this high demand for labour. The scale of mechanisation suitable for a small army was not, however,necessarily suitable for a large army. The General Staff were already examining the possibility of reducing the scale of mechinisation-sation for later contingents of the British Expeditionary Force.If this proved feasible, it might be expected to have some effect on future labour demands.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was grateful tothe Secretary of State for War for the way in which he had met the criticism he &quot;had made of the original scheme. That criticism was entirely met by what the Secretary of State had said. Nevertheless,he hoped that it would not prove necessary to bring these troopsback across the Channel to finish their training. He also hopedthat it might be possible to impart a military character to the workof these Divisions during their life in France. Possibly they might take their turn in the line at intervals.The Prime Minister thought that the civilian population weresometimes apt to be critical of the large bodies of troops now in this
country, who were entitled to draw a larger food ration than them-selves, and apparently had plenty of petrol. The contrast washeightened by the fact that some of the units concerned were unable, apparently, to do a full day&apos;s work through lack of equipment. The decision to send these troops to France would tendto relieve this contrast.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, as a temporary measure, portions of three divisions, not required as such for the British Expedi-tionary Force, should now be sent to France and used on labour duties. These units would be sent armed, andwould spend part of their time in France on militaiytraining.(2) Agreed that men under 19 serving in the units coveredby (1) should not be sent to France until the Secretaryof State for War had had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Opposition Leaders. Provided noobjection was raised, the men under 19 should laterrejoin their units in France.(3) Took note that the Secretary of State for War proposed (a) to intensify the recruiting effort, in order to increasethe number of voluntary recruits for the auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps from the age group 35 to 50;(b) to make enquiries as to the probable response to anappeal for voluntary enlistment of men aged 18and 19 for labour duties in France;(c) to examine again the possibilities of labour from theColonies, and particularly the West Indies;(d) to institute further enquiries for the purpose ofestablishing the minimum labour requirements ofthe British Expeditionary Force.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.March 21, 1940.
