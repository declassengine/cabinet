The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy air activity.Scandinavia.stavanger aerodrome.North-west germany.British AirForces inFrance.Norwegian coastreconnaissances.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that enemy air activityoff our coasts on the previous day had been very limited. A fewtracks had been plotted in the Kinnairds Head area, and one offYarmouth.The weather conditions on the previous day had been so badthat there had been little air activity on either side. The Air Stafftook the view that, if the weather had been better, enemy air attacks off the Norwegian coast would have been on a heavier scale.Air attacks which had been planned against objectives in norway and Denmark had had to be cancelled owing to adverse weather conditions.Six Blenheims had been despatched at 10-30 the previousmorning for an attack on Stavanger aerodrome but had had toabandon their task owing to lack of cloud cover. All aircraft had returned.Three Whitleys had made a night reconnaissance off North-west germany the previous evening. Preliminary reports indicatedmovement on the road Osnabruck-Oldenburg, believed to be lorriesmoving north. Vehicles had also been observed moving north onthe main road Hanover-Luneburg-Hamburg. and a number ofbarges moving on the Ems-Weser Canal.  All aircraft had returned.A night reconnaissance of road and rail movement in the areaDusseldorf-Munster-Osnabruck-Hanover-Paderborn had been made,but no extensive activity had been observed.The result of reconnaissances on the Norwegian coast had been as follows : Bjorne Fjord : One merchant vessel of 1,000 tons had been observed entering the Fjord at 8 a.m. the previous morning.Haugesund : Several merchant ships alongside the wharveshad been observed, together with 14 ships moored in the bay.The latter target had been bombed from 7,000 feet but no hitshad been registered. The aircraft carrying out thisreconnaissance had been hit in the engine by machine gun fire,but had returned to its base.Bergen : About 40 merchant vessels had been observed inthe harbour and one ship alongside the North quay had been seen to be on fire. Seven merchant vessels had been observedat anchor two miles south of Bergen.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The NayalSituation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 2.)Air attacks onFT.M. Ships.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave particulars of the movements of H.M. Ships.[21180]H.M.S. Cairo had reported that she had been unsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft off Namsos 6 p.m. the previous evening.H.M. ships A uckland, A fridi and A rethusa had also beenunsuccessfully bombed early on the previous morning.The French cruiser Emile Bertin, which had been escorting thefirst French convoy, had been attacked by an aeroplane off Namsosat 6 p.m. on the 19th April and had been damaged by one hit. she would have to be docked.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Commander-in-Chief had informed him that he was apprehensive regarding theb 2
possible results of dive-bombing attacks by enemy aircraft out ofcloud. Owing to the very short warning given, it was very difficultto counter this operation. The First Lord hoped that the U.P.weapon, of which about 40 were now ready, would be able to provide some defence against this form of attack.The War Cabinet took note of the statement.[The rest of the First Lord&apos;s statement is recorded in Minute 3below. ]Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that all four transports of the first French convoy had arrived at Namsos and had completed disembarkation. Thesecond convoy of three ships, escorted by two destroyers, was expected in the Clyde that morning. The landing of BrigadierMorgan&apos;s brigade in the Andalsnes area had been completedwithout opposition.Lord Cork and General Mackesy were in close touch at Narvikand some progress in that area might be hoped for soon. At thesame time, we must face the fact that there might be as many as ,000 of the enemy in the area. Narvik was of vital importanceto us, and it was essential that it should be in our hands in good time before the ice melted in the Baltic. Unless we had the area in our control and our forces established on the Swedish frontier;and were in a position immediately to interfere with the ore-fields if necessary, the Germans would be very likely to demand from Sweden the right to reinforce their troops as soon as their shipping could get up to Lulea. We had therefore only a month in which to liquidate the position at Narvik, and it was of theutmost importance not to have our attention diverted by operationselsewhere from our principal objective, which had always from thevery start been the control of the Galivare ore-fields.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in answer to aquestion, said that there should be no particular difficulty in getting a small force through, even if the railway had not been repaired.As far as we knew, the damage to it was not very serious. Asmall force firmly ensconced was very difficult to turn out of its position in the difficult country in which the operations would betaking place. We should take the first opportunity to reorganisethe Norwegian forces operating in Northern Scandinavia and touse them to assist us in that area.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that it might be agood thing if a Press communique were now to be issued to theeffect that we had now carried out a number of successfuldisembarkations in Norway, that some thousands of troops hadbeen landed without casualties or other mishaps, and that none ofour ships taking part in the landing operations had been hit.The , War Cabinet approved the issue of a press communique to the above effect.Considerable discussion also took place on plans for further operations in Norway, a record of which, together with theconclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
Sweden. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention(Previous to Stockholm Telegram No. 302, dated the 19th April, in which reference:        Mr. Mallet reported that the Germans were saying that our attackW.M. (40) 95th  on Narvik was intended as a prelude to entering Sweden, and conclusions,      occupying the Kiruna ore mines.   Mr. Mallet believed that a greatMinute 6.)        effect would be produced in Sweden if the Prime Minister couldrepeat in the House of Commons the assurance which he (Mr. Mallet)had been authorised in Telegram 177 DIPP to Stockholm to give to the Swedish Government.  Failing this the Swedish government might be encouraged to publish our assurance.Some discussion ensued as to whether we should now give apublic assurance that we intended to respect the territorial integrity of Sweden. It was pointed out that the Germans were withoutrivals in the technique of infringing a country&apos;s neutrality bysubterranean methods. If they applied these methods to Sweden,we might find it embarrassing to be bound by a public assurance that we intended to respect Sweden&apos;s territorial integrity.On the other hand, it was pointed out that if Germany took any action of this kind, a new situation would have arisen which wouldrelieve us of any pledges which we had given.The suggestion was advanced that we should make a newpublic statement to the effect that we would respect Sweden&apos;sterritorial integrity so long as she, for her part, was careful to refrain from unneutral conduct. It was felt, however, that a con-ditional assurance would be of no value.The War Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform His Majesty&apos;minister in Stockholm that there would be no objection tothe Swedish Government publishing the assurance whichhe had been authorised to give them. (Telegram 177 DIPPto Stockholm.)Supreme WarCouncil: 8thMeeting.Operations in scandinavia.Western Front:action to betaken in theevent of aGerman inva-sion of the low countries.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 92ndConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The War Cabinet were informed that the Prime minister had received a letter from M. Reynaud raising certain points inregard to the Scandinavian operations to which he attached greatimportance. M. Reynaud had asked that the Prime Minister andthe First Lord of the Admiralty should go to Paris on Monday, the22nd April, to discuss these matters.This invitation had been accepted.The attention of the War Cabinet was also drawn to the Reportby the Chiefs of Staff circulated the previous evening as to the air action to be taken in the event of a German invasion of the low countries (W.P. (40) 132). This Report showed that discussions between the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Air Forcesin France, and General Gamelin had left a number of important points unresolved. It was proposed that this matter should bediscussed at a full Meeting of the Supreme War Council on tuesday, the 23rd April, which would be attended by other british ministers.It had been decided that there should be a special Meeting ofthe War Cabinet on Sunday, the 21st April, to discuss the questionswhich would be raised at the meetings in Paris on the 22nd and23rd April.The War Cabinet took note of these arrangements.Italy.Proposals of theFrench war committee.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Paris telegram No. 146 DIPP, dated the 19th April, in whichHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador reported that the French Governmenthad agreed to the procedure proposed in Foreign Office telegramNo. 100 DIPP to meet the situation which would arise if Italyattacked Yugoslavia. The necessary instructions had been givento the French Chiefs of Staff.
probable intentions of theItalianGovernment.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that this topic alsomight appropriately be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of theSupreme War Council (see Minute 5).The Foreign Secretary said that the situation as regards signor mussolini&apos;s probable intentions was much the same as before.There were more rumours than solid facts to build upon. He under-stood that the Yugoslav Government took the view that the dangerof an Italian descent on the Dalmatian coast had diminished(telegram No. 143 from Belgrade). The Turkish Minister, whom hehad seen the previous day, had been in general agreement with ourview as to the dangers of a policy of inaction in the event of an act of aggression by Italy against Yugoslavia.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Italy.Naval situationin theMediterranean.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The First Sea Lord raised the question of the naval situation in the Mediterranean.. With so much on our hands in thenorthern theatre of war, it was difficult for us to find the naval forces required for the eastern half of the Mediterranean, whichit had been agreed with the French should be our responsibility.This half of the Mediterranean was, of course, the more importantstrategically in the event of Italian hostility, and it had beensuggested to the French that it would be desirable to have in this area as large an Allied naval force as possible, by drawing, ifnecessary, upon the French naval forces in the western half. Themoves to this area should be made before the outbreak of war with italy. The French had welcomed the proposal, but only on thecondition that a French Admiral should command the Allied fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. While, however, the French offered to send three old battleships to the Eastern Mediterranean, they asked us to find all the destroyers for their escort. TheCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, had expressed the view thatthere would be serious political repercussions, particularly in egypt and Turkey, if we handed over command to the French in theEastern Mediterranean. He (the First Sea Lord) was strongly opposed to making such a concession to the French, and, as analternative, proposed that we should build up a holding force in theEastern Mediterranean which, though it could not at first operateoffensively, would at least suffice to cover the sea line of communi-cation between Turkey and Egypt and support any operations bythe Allies on land. H.M.S. Malaya was due for refit. This couldbe carried out at Malta, where she could remain at 48 hours&apos; notice.Later, she might be joined in the Eastern Mediterranean by two further capital ships, and by some of the older cruisers. This wouldbe a much more satisfactory solution than an Allied force underFrench command in the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly sinceAlexandria had been fitted up as a base for British forces.The War Cabinet endorsed this proposal. There was generalagreement that it would be most undesirable for the naval command of the Eastern Mediterranean to be in French hands, but at thesame time the French Government would have to be handledtactfully. They were giving us the command of all the forces in norway, although at times the total number of French troops there might exceed that of the British troops.The War Cabinet (i) Expressed general approval of proposals for building up aEastern Mediterranean,(ii) Agreed that the Allied naval dispositions in theMediterranean should be discussed by the First Sea Lordwith Admiral Darlan in Paris on Monday, the22nd April, on the lines indicated above.the First Seadefensive fleetLord&apos;sthe
contraband control.Control ofsupplies toGermany fromthe Far Bast.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 97thConclusions,Minute 12.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to thedecision taken by the War Cabinet on the previous day that theMinister of Economic Warfare should have authority to startnegotiations with the Japanese Government on control of the con-traband in the Far East on the lines suggested in telegram No. 605from Tokyo.His attention had now been drawn to the fact that the supreme war Council had laid it down that these negotiations should notbe begun without prior notification to the United States Govern-ment.A telegram had been received from Lord Lothian (No. 563)emphasising that the proposed negotiations with Japan wouldrequire most careful handling, if we were to avoid exasperating theUnited States Government. Lord Lothian recommended that theUnited States Government should be consulted both on the general question of our relations with Japan in regard to contraband control in the Pacific, and on the details of our negotiations with japan should they be proceeded with.The Foreign Secretary said that he had not been able to consult the Minister of Economic Warfare on the matter, but he thoughtthat the opening of negotiations with the Japanese Governmentshould be delayed for two or three days in order that the position vis-a-vis the United States Government might be cleared up. TheForeign Secretary was not certain whether it would be better totell the United States Government of the line that we proposed totake with Japan, or to invite them to discuss the position generally with us.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he also would be glad if the opening of negotiations with the JapaneseGovernment could be delayed for a few days, in order that a replymight be received from the Canadian Government.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Economic Warfare to defer, for afew days, the opening of negotiations with the JapaneseGovernment on contraband control in the Far East, inorder to enable the position vis-a-vis the United StatesGovernment to be cleared up, and a reply to be receivedfrom the Canadian Government.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,April 20, 1940.
