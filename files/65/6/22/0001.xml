Supreme WarCouncil: 6thMeeting.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister gave an account of the Sixth Meetingof the Supreme War Council held the previous day. (The,record of the Meeting, and of the Resolutions agreed upon, is being-circulated to the members of the War Cabinet.)M. Reynaud had been accompanied by M. Campinchi, Ministerof Marine, and M. Laurent Eynac, Minister for Air. M. daladier had been unable to attend for the reason that his injured leg wasgiving him trouble.M. Reynaud had been full of energy, and had shown obvious-anxiety to take active measures. He (the Prime Minister) had thought that we might have some difficulty in dealing with certain of the proposals put. forward by the French Government, which hadnot been very well thought out. On our side, however, the groundhad been very carefully prepared, particularly in respect of theaction proposed in regard to Norway and Sweden. In advance ofthe Meeting the French Delegates had been furnished with copiesof an Aide-memoire setting out the action proposed in regard tothese two countries. It was evident that they had misinterpretedour Paper as a manoeuvre to shelve action in Scandinavia, and thatthey had been agreeably surprised to find that we were prepared totake action at an early date. Possibly on this account, the french had been much more accommodating than we had anticipated inregard to the Royal Marine Operation. The chief opponent to this operation was apparently the President, M. Lebrun, who wasnervous that it would involve retaliation in the form of air attacks on French industry. M. Reynaud, however, had made it clear thathe was hopeful that he could overcome M. Lebrun&apos;s objections.M. Reynaud&apos;s comment on this operation had been that it wasinteresting. Neither he nor his French colleagues seemed to expect any great results from it.(The further discussion which ensued in regard to the proposed operation in Norwegian Territorial Waters, and the royal marine Operation, is recorded in Minute 2.)   &apos;South-east europe.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 6.)German oil supplies from roumania.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 2.)Considerable discussion had ensued in regard to South-east europe. M. Reynaud had pointed out that Germany&apos;s two weakpoints were to be found in her need for iron-ore and oil respectively.He had agreed, apparently, that there was little hope of our being able to support Roumania with military forces, but he took the viewthat the destruction of the oilfields at Baku was a sure, decisive andeasy operation. M. Reynaud had shown himself too ready todiscount the objections likely to be made by the Turks to any attempt on the part of the Allies to take action against Baku without havingfirst taken them into our confidence. The basis for this viewappeared to be some rather casual conversations between the turkish minister for Foreign Affairs and the French Minister at Ankara.He had replied on this point by quoting from telegram No. 231DIPP, from Ankara, which confirmed our view that the Turks would strongly resent any action by the Allies which might involveTurkey in war, unless she had previously been consulted. the outcome of the discussion had been that a study should be under-taken by the French and British experts into the possibilities ofcarrying out an air attack against the Russian oilfields in theCaucasus.The Prime Minister then referred briefly to the other matters which had been referred to at the Council. It had been agreed thatsuch action as might be possible should be taken to diminish oiltraffic from Roumania to Germany.
Belgium and theNetherlands.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 3.)Joint declara-tion on unity of purpose.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 7.)Pipe line from iraq to Tripoli.strengthening of blockademeasures.contraband control in the bar East.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 8.)Aircraft fromthe U.S.A.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 35tbConclusions,Minute 2.)The Supreme&quot;War Council.Agreement had been reached on the policy to be followed in theevent of Belgium and/or the Netherlands being invaded byGermany, or of the Netherlands agreeing to the grant of naval,military, or air bases to Germany. It had also been agreed thatcertain possible contingencies should be studied by the French andBritish staffs.As the War Cabinet were aware from the communique issued after the meeting the previous afternoon, a joint declaration onunity of purpose had been agreed upon. The French representatives had produced a revised draft, which differed from that approvedby the War Cabinet. As, however, it seemed to be an improvementin some directions, it had been accepted.He (the Prime Minister) had undertaken to examine the french proposal for doubling the pipe line from the Iraq oilfields toTripoli.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the french ambassador had raised this question as a matter of urgency abouta week previously and he had undertaken to examine it.The Prime Minister said it had been agreed jointly to examinethe possibility of tightening the blockade, with special reference tothe imposition of quotas on neutral countries where this appearednecessary.The French had accepted our proposals that the extensionof contraband control in the Far East should be effected in two stages; the first by restricting the export to the U.S.S.R. of commodities on the contraband list from the United Kingdom andFrance and their Colonial Empires, and, if possible, from theDominions, India and Burma; the second to take the form of anattempt to reach an agreement with the Chinese, Japanese and theUnited States Governments to restrict supplies for Soviet Russia.The French had accepted the proposal submitted by the Anglo-French Purchasing Mission in the United States; and it had beenagreed that discussions should take place at once to determine theallocation of the orders for aircraft between the two countries.It had been agreed in principle that the Supreme War council should hold more frequent and more regular meetings. It had been further agreed to examine the question of forming a permanentAllied Secretariat to the Supreme War Council.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertooksubmit proposals on this subject to the War Cabinet.toThe War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet thatbad weather had interfered to some extent with air operations, but three enemy raiders had been plotted off the coast between Kinnaird&apos;sHead and Wick the previous morning. One of them had beenintercepted, and shot down into the sea.An enemy aircraft had been sighted over the Shetlands, but had not been intercepted.There had been three air attacks on the Norwegian convoys inthe course of the day, and, though a few bombs had been dropped,no damage had been done. One of the raiding aircraft had been seen by fighters, but had escaped into the clouds.A Division of French destroyers had been bombed North ofOstend in the evening, but had not been hit.Six Blenheims had gone out to search for and attack enemyflak ships, but had not seen anything.Nine Blenheims had gone out to search for enemy destroyers and patrol vessels reported off the Danish coast. These had notbeen seen, and a submarine which had been sighted had been lostowing to bad weather and rough sea.Some ships had been seen in Danish territorial waters whichhad fired our signal of the day.Photographic reconnaissance of German bases had been attempted, but had been prevented by the weather except atCuxhaven. A cruiser of the Hipper class, and a number of smallervessels, had been observed at that place.A Hudson belonging to the Coastal Command had had a sharpengagement with two Dorniers lasting half an hour. Its portengine had been put out of action, but it had succeeded in returninghome safely. Both Dorniers had been hit, and it was believedthat one of them had failed to reach its base.A Whitley, which had been in the air&apos; for seven hours on a reconnaissance in North-West Germany, had lost its way, and hadbeen shot down by the Dutch over Holland.The Prime Minister enquired what instructions were given tothe pilots of aircraft to govern their behaviour in the event oftheir being found over neutral territory by neutral defendingaircraft.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to investigate the matter,and to report to the War Cabinet.
The Naval 4.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty gave the War cabinet situation. details of the movement of convoys, and of the S.S. Queen Mary,(Previous Mauretania and Aquitania.Reference: In addition to the enemy air attacks on convoys which had.M. (40) 76th been reported by the Chief of the Air Staff, H.M. Trawler WistariaConclusions, had been attacked at 8 p.m. 20 miles North of Kinnaird&apos;s Head,Minute 10.)       but had not been damaged.One Skua of the Fleet Air Arm had made a forced landing inthe sea, but the crew had been rescued.U-boat interned The U-21, which had grounded off Mandal on the coast ofin Norway. Norway, had been refloated in a damaged condition, and had been interned by the Norwegians. A strong German protest was expected,but the German case had been considerably weakened by a statement made by the German Military Attache in Norway, in which he had requested the Norwegian Government to release the submarine, onthe grounds that the crews of German submarines wereinexperienced in navigation, and were not well acquainted with the laws of neutrality.(Previous H.M.S.  Unity, the submarine which had picked up eightReference: Dutchmen from an open boat in the North Sea, had been delayedW.M. (40) 75th by bad weather, but had now arrived at the Forth. The DutchmenConclusions, were all stretcher cases, and he had made arrangements, which he Minute 2.) hoped would be successful, for their landing to be photographed,so as to give full publicity to the brutal manner in which neutralseamen were treated by the Germans.The Norwegian S.S. Burgos, 3,220 tons, in convoy, had been mined and sunk off Cromer. The whole crew had been rescued.For some unexplained reason the ship had been one and a half milesout of the swept channel at the time.The recent magnetic storms, which had been attributed to theappearance of a sun spot, had been instrumental in explodingbetween 20 and 30 German magnetic mines.The Prime Minister said that, in their morning News Bulletin,the B.B.C. had first given the Admiralty account of the air attackon a convoy which had taken place the evening before, and had followed this with the German account, in which it was statedthat the convoy had been dispersed, and a number of hits registeredon ships. The B.B.C. had said nothing to draw attention to theinaccuracy of the German broadcast, but had simply left the listenerto choose for himself between the two. He was at a loss tounderstand why it was necessary for the B.B.C. to publish theGerman account at all, since it was broadcast by the Germans solelywith the object of disheartening our people and the neutrals.General agreement was expressed with this view.The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the statement by the First Lord,(ii) Invited the Prime Minister to take up with the appropriate authorities the present practice of the B.B.C. in broad-casting the German account of events at sea.B.B.C. news bulletins.The Military 5.   The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothingSituation. of interest to report.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 75th ---Conclusions,Minute 3.)
Western Front.Action in theevent of aGerman inva-sion of holland and/or Belgium.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of the War Cabinet to telegram No. 51, DIPP, dated the27th March from the British Minister at The Hague, reporting a conversation which he had had with the Netherlands Minister forForeign Affairs. The latter had promised a further interview after consulting his Government, but had been very discouraging in thefirst instance as to the prospects of his Government being willingto make any favourable response to our invitation to them to consult with us as to arrangements for helping them to resist a german invasion.   This was regrettable, but not unexpected.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Soviet Union.general relations,and resumptionof trade negotiations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 97thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theSoviet Ambassador in London had come to see him on the27th March to enquire if we would now be willing to resume our negotiations for a Trade Agreement with the Soviet Government.If we were willing to do so, he hoped that, as a first step, we shouldstop taking such action as the interception of Soviet ships by our contraband Control, which was bound to irritate his Government.When the Foreign Secretary had pointed out to him that any trade negotiations must take account of the fact that it was essential forus to maintain the blockade of Germany, and that the Russians hadnot been encouraging when the possibility of a War Trade Agree-ment had been suggested at an earlier stage, M. Maisky had repliedthat he would not now exclude the possibility of negotiating anAgreement of this character. His Government were very appre-hensive of the intentions of the Allies i  in certain quarters of theglobe.&quot; When the Foreign Secretary had pointed out to him thatthere was bound to be talk of this character when the Soviet union was in such close relations with Germany, he had replied that therewas no military alliance between the Soviet Union and Germany,their relations were no more than those of normal friendliness, and soviet policy was dictated solely by consideration for Sovietinterests.The Foreign Secretary thought that it was not likely that much would come of suggestions of this character, as it was clearly thepolicy of the Soviet Government to keep the war between the Alliesand Germany going, to their own advantage. He had, however,sent a copy of the record of this conversation to the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Minister of Economic Warfare, as hethought it advisable to explore the possibilities somewhat further.It might be that it would be distinctly advantageous to us from thepoint of view of the Board of Trade to increase our trade withRussia; and the Minister of Economic Warfare might be able tosay that it would be an advantage to us to secure an agreement for rationing the imports of valuable materials into Russia andfor restricting her oil deliveries into Germany, even if this meantan increase in exports from Russia to Germany of other goods, suchas wheat and timber, to pay for the German manufactures which russia needed. No reliance could, of course, be placed uponRussian observance of an Agreement of this character; but it was just possible that their desire to establish better relations with us,and their fear of an attack on Baku, might induce them to agree toprovide us with means of satisfying ourselves as to the actualquantities of oil delivered to Germany. He would therefore be reluctant not to explore the matter fully, and he proposed to bring it before the War Cabinet when he had received the replies of thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister of economic warfare. So far as the French Government were concerned, whileM. Reynaud did not seem anxious to improve relations with Russia,
and had been keen only on the bombing of Baku, M. Campinchi hadremarked to him that, if only we could detach Russia from Germany,we should have won the war.The First Lord of the Admiralty stressed the importance of using the threat of bombing Baku as a weapon in any negotiationsof this character.The Prime Minister said that it was important that such negotiations, if begun, should not be drawn out by the Russiansas part of a scheme to use the interval in improving the defencesof Baku. Subject to this, he agreed with the line taken by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs that the possibility of resuming trade negotiations  with  the  Soviet   Government  should  be explored on the lines described by him in the discussion.Turkey.Proposed visit of the foreign secretary.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 76thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that.had discussions with the British diplomatic representatives in the balkan countries who were being recalled to London could not nowbe fixed for an earlier date than the 8th April. His visit to Turkeycould not, therefore, take place until about the middle of April,and he would prefer that, if it were to be made, it should, if possible,be announced some time in advance. This would help to create animmediate impression of Allied activity and would also avoidspreading the idea that he was going out to Turkey to carry out some special scheme concocted at his meeting with our diplomatic representatives from the Balkan countries.He therefore had in mind to telegraph at once to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Ankara, asking him to tell the Turkish Minister forForeign Affairs that he (Lord Halifax) was anxious to meet him fora frank talk. The object would be to persuade the Turkish Govern-ment, if possible, to issue an invitation, or at any rate to agree toan announcement that both Governments thought that such a talkwould be useful. He no longer thought that it would be necessaryto return with any definite achievement to place on record, but was inclined to think that the fact of the visit being paid at all would create a sufficiently strong impression on world opinion.He then raised the question whether such a visit should be confined to Turkey, or whether he should also visit Athens orBucharest. Turkey was the only country with which we had a bilateral agreement. It would probably offend the Roumanians, ifhe went to Athens without going to Bucharest, whilst to visit bothwould make his visit into a Balkan tour. A visit to Athens andnot Bucharest could, however, perhaps be defended on the groundthat his route would take him very close to Athens and that it wouldbe discourteous not to pay a visit there. In any case, subject tothe agreement of the Turkish Government, he would suggest thatsoundings should be made to find out whether a visit to Rome wouldbe welcomed there. If the suggestion were not welcome to signor mussolini, it should not be pursued.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it was proposed,though not yet definitely decided, that HALS. Warspite should proceed about the middle of April to serve as flag-ship of theMediterranean Fleet. It would be most appropriate for theForeign Secretary to travel in a vessel of this character.
The Prime Minister said that, if it were contemplated that the visit should result only in the issue of a general communique andnot in any specific achievement being announced to the world, hethought that there were advantages in including other countriesbesides Turkey in the itinerary. If Turkey only were to be visited,he thought it essential that some more definite achievement shouldbe recorded. In any case, the Foreign Secretary should visit Turkeyfirst and other countries only on his return journey.The War Cabinet agreed :  That His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Ankara should beasked to sound the Turkish Government as to their attitude to the proposal that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should pay an official visit to Turkey at an earlydate.Richmond Terrace. S. W. 1,March 29, 1940.
