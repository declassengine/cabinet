Soviet-German 1.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theTrade. Minister of Economic Warfare on Soviet-German Trade (W.P. (G.)..- , (40) 72).        &apos;. , &apos; . :.    ,   ,The Minister of Economic Warfare said that the principal;: v conclusion of his Memorandum was that, if steps were not now- taken, by 1941 the effect of our blockade on Germany might be largely: nullified if the present Russo-German plan to improve transport facilities across Russia, especially from Vladivostok and Dairen,were successful.   Information received since his Memorandum was prepared reinforced this conclusion.   Extensive plans were beingmade to use communications across Siberia and certain materials,especially copper, tin and rubber, were already finding their way, across Siberia.   The effectiveness of our blockade depended on our success in depriving Germany of four main classes of goods.  First,oil, where our prospects of success were uncertain; secondly, iron ore, which was now out of the picture; thirdly, fats, which involvedpre-emptive purchases, and the allocation of adequate foreign exchange, which the Treasury might or might not prove able tofind.   Finally, there was a class of essential goods, principally non-;; ferrous metals and rubber, in respect of which our blockade was atthe moment effective, as we had already pre-empted the available supplies in Europe. A leak of these goods through Vladivostokwould be extremely serious. The French had already approachedus on this subject and had themselves been anxious to take far-reaching action under the resolution of the League of Nations* calling for assistance to Finland against Russian aggression.,,The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the possibility that supplies might reach Germany from the port of Murmansk,being shipped to that port along the north coast of Siberia. he understood that a number of ships were being prepared for thisvoyage, which would be possible as soon as the ice had melted.The Minister of Economic Warfare said that he had not sofar obtained information on this point, but it seemed likely thatVladivostok and Dairen would be the main sources of leakage.The Minister then referred to the five recommendations setout on pages 2 and 3 of his Memorandum.The first was a drastic restriction of supplies from allied countries to Russia.As regards the second, he was not sanguine that it would bepossible to come to an arrangement with the Japanese to limitsupplies sent to Russia and Germany. The Japanese wouldprobably ask for a change of our attitude with regard to the Sino-Japanese war and for exemptions from our interference with german exports to Japan. This would be embarrasing. Moreover,it was doubtful whether an assurance from the Japanese Govern-ment would prevent supplies leaving Japan, in view of the prevalence of corrupt commercial practices in that country.(Previous ^s regards the third suggestion an understanding with the reference&apos;:        United States at the moment the United States were hot veryW.M. (40) 21st  willing to co-operate.Conclusions,Minute 1.)(Previous The fourth suggestion was that we should reach an under-Reference: standing with the Chinese Government about her exports to RussiaW.M. (40) 27th (a question that had been raised in connection with the detentionConclusions, of the Soviet ship Selenga) and the outlook for this was minute 4.)        unpromising.The fifth suggestion was that we should communicate to theFrench Government the action which we intended to take in regardto the four points outlined above and should ask them for their co-operation, and that we should, in addition, suggest a morerigorous form of contraband control in the East Indies. In his[21007] B 2
Memorandum he had suggested that this contraband control mightbe confined to Soviet vessels and possibly also to Dutch vessels. now that the Finnish war was ended it seemed impossible to discriminate against Russian vessels, and the contraband control would have tobe extended to the Norwegian, Italian and other ships trading inthese waters. He would therefore ask for such contraband control as was possible in the circumstances which, though not fully effective, might act as a deterrent to Russia. Ships sailing north from the East Indies had to pass between the mainland of Chinanorth of Hong Kong and the Island of Formosa, and it wassuggested that the ships detained should be taken into French Indo-China, where they would be judged under French Prize Law, which gave a greater chance of condemnation than the British.The Foreign Secretary said that he was broadly in agreementwith the proposals suggested by the Minister of Economic Warfare.Since the Memorandum had been prepared two events had occurred,namely, the ending of the Finnish war and the change in the attitudeof the United States with regard to co-operation in our contraband control measures. He still thought, however, that the state department should be approached on the subject, even thoughMr. Morgenthau had made it clear that little more was to beexpected. He was convinced that the trans-Siberian route might prove a serious leak in our blockade and that it could only be effectively stopped if we were to reach an understanding with japan and the United States. With regard to Japan, we were not withoutbargaining counters. He concurred in the general procedure suggested by the Minister of Economic Warfare.Attitude of the In reply to the Minister without Portfolio, the Minister of dominions. Economic Warfare said that he had consulted with the Secretaryof State for the Dominions on the question of the co-operation ofthe Dominions in withholding raw materials, and had received an encouraging reply. It had been pointed out, however, that japan was an important market for Australian and South African wool,which these Dominions might be reluctant to lose.Attitude of The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the ColonialColonial Governments were  ready  to co-operate.    Direct  shipments  to governments Vladivostok and Dairen were already)r controlled and negotiations were being undertaken at Tokyo with regard to excessive shipments of rubber to Japan The pressure which we could exerciseon Japan through the supply of Empire raw materials could be supplemented by offering concessions with regard to the control of japanese imports into the Colonies. The main difficulty, however,... was the rubber production in the Dutch East Indies. It wouldbe useless to control our own exports to Japan and Russia aslong as the Dutch exports continued. It was for this reason thatcontraband control was essential. He had been examining thepossibility of using Hong Kong as a control station.Position of The Permanent Under-Secretary of State, India Office, saidIndia. that direct shipments from India to Russia were under control; butthe most important contribution that the Government of india could make to this problem was through the agreement between itand the Japanese Government with regard to export of raw cottonfrom India and the import of Japanese cotton manufactures intoIndia.  The existing agreement under which these two trades were: linked together had recently expired and a new agreement wasbeing negotiated.   The agreement was of very great commercialv       importance to Japan.   Hitherto, the quantity of cotton bought by japan under this agreement had, in effect, been left for the japanese to decide, it being stipulated that India would only accept acertain quantity of cotton manufactures if the Japanese bought a&apos; ;     -.,      certain quantity of Indian cotton.  Under war conditions, however,it was important to be sure that the Japanese were not importing
The Soviet shipBelenga.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 27thConclusions,Minute 4.)too much cotton. After consultation with the Ministry of economic warfare, the India Office had already suggested to the Governmentof India that it might be necessary to introduce into the new agreement a provision that exports of raw cotton to Japan shouldbe rationed month by month. He now suggested that the Govern-ment of India should at once be warned that it might be desirableto make the conclusion of these negotiations dependent on a satis-factory conclusion to our negotiations with Japan on the general question. There might be some difficulty in securing the agreementof the Government of India to this course, but, if they were notwarned at once, there was a danger that we might lose thisbargaining weapon.The Prime Minister said that the Government of india should be warned forthwith of the negotiations on which we intended to embark with the Japanese.The Minister of Economic Warfare asked for a decision whether the Soviet ship Selenga, which was still detained in Hong-Kong, should be released. The War Cabinet had already authorised the release of the ship, but it had been hoped to obtain in return from the Chinese Government, who were interested in its release,particulars of their trade agreement with the Soviet Union and some agreement to limit the exports of essential materials to the soviet union. This had not been secured; but nevertheless he thoughtthat the ship should now be released. It would be impossible tosecure the condemnation of the cargo from a British Prize Court.The French had asked that we should give them notice of our intention to release this ship so that they might recapture her. Ithad been the French intention to seize the cargo on this ship undercover of the League of Nations resolution with regard to assistanceto Finland. There would be no justification for this action under international law. Moreover, it seemed to the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare that, if we released the ship and the Frenchseized the cargo, this would appear to reflect on the efficiency of our blockade.   He did not favour this course.The Foreign Secretary said that, provided that it did not leadto difficulties with the French, he thought that the ship should be released. He was influenced by the need to assist the ChineseGovernment, who were victims of aggression on the part of Japan,even though the release might be of some assistance to the soviet union, who had been aggressors in the case of Finland.The War Cabinet-(1) Approved generally the course of action proposed by theMinister of Economic Warfare, as summarised in thefive recommendations on pages 2-3 of his Memorandum,subject to the following modifications : (a) that use should be made of our control of supplies to japan of raw materials from the Dominions,India, Burma and the Colonies, for the purposeof obtaining the agreement of the JapaneseGovernment to limit supplies to Russia andGermany (see Recommendation (2));(b) that authority should be &quot;given for the interceptionin Pacific waters of ships of all nations thought to be carrying cargo of suspect destination (seeRecommendation 5 (b)).(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies, acting in consulta-tion with the Minister of Economic Warfare, to take action on the lines indicated generally in theMemorandum.
(3) Invited the Secretary of State for India to inform theGovernment of India that it would be undesirable thattheir present negotiations with the Japanese in respectof a prolongation of the cotton trade agreement shouldbe concluded until a satisfactory understanding hadbeen come to with Japan with regard to the general question of re-exports to Germany and the Soviet Union;and to report to the War Cabinet the response to this communication.(4) Agreed that the Soviet ship Selenga should now be released, notwithstanding that it had not been possibleto come to an arrangement with the Chinese Governmentto regulate the Chinese exports of certain raw materials to Russia, provided that this did not involve us in difficulties with the French Government.Norway.CharteringNorwegiantankers.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40)conclusions minute 9.)2.   The War Cabinet again had before them a Memorandumof    by the Minister of Shipping (W.P. (G.) (40) 75) asking authority for negotiations with a view to chartering Norwegian tankers inaddition to those to be delivered under the existing ShippingArrangement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed this67th proposal on the previous evening with the Ministers concerned, andhad reached the conclusion that in spite of the heavy financialburdens involved it should be seriously considered. 145 Norwegiantankers were already under contract to be time-chartered to us. Ofthese 86 had already been delivered, but new rates of hire wouldhave to be negotiated in May and the Norwegian owners would bein a strong position for forcing us to pay considerably higher rates.One way to strengthen our position in these negotiations would beto obtain control of some of the additional tankers now in question.To hire the whole 50 Norwegian tankers that might be available at the present market rate would involve an additional burden,payable in gold or dollars, of  13,000,000 per annum, in addition tothe  38,000,000 per annum which would be the cost of hiring at thepresent market rate the tankers covered by the existing agreement.Taking into account economies in oil consumption already securedand other possible reductions, he was not satisfied that we should need all 50 additional tankers for our own purposes. If, however,we could strengthen our bargaining position in relationto the hire of Norwegian tankers as a whole by obtaining20 or 30 of these additional tankers, he favoured the transaction as likely to give us a financial saving in the long run.The Secretary for Mines said that the Oil Board had calculatedthe long-term needs of the British and French Empires and theSouth American bunker stations. The first estimate was that 644tankers would be required, a number far in excess of those available.Reductions in the estimated requirements of the Admiralty, theWar Office and the French made it possible to reduce this estimateby 47, and further reductions were possible, e.g., if Australia wereto impose petrol rationing. It was, therefore, not possible to give an exact estimate of our long-term requirements in the matter of tankers, but there would certainly be a shortage and it was clearthat the additional Norwegian tankers now under discussion wouldbe most valuable.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that he could see no hopeof our being able to sweeten the negotiations by offering to helpNorway by the supply of armaments; nor could he support thesuggestion that we should exempt Norwegian vessels from calling atthe Kirkwall Contraband Control Station; nevertheless, he hoped
that we should endeavour to secure these 50 tankers which wouldbe very valuable for the Navy. It was also important to prevent them being used by others to our detriment.The Minister of Shipping said that if we could obtain controlof all 50 tankers, we could probably make a profit out of hiringout to others any that we did not require for our own purposes.He had little hope of successful negotiations with the Norwegian^ Shipowners alone, because it was clearly to their interest to remainfree to secure the highest possible rates for their vessels in the open market. He therefore advised bringing pressure to bear throughthe Norwegian Government. Negotiations had not yet been begun,and it was only an intelligent guess that the most hopeful methodswould be the offer of armaments or of some relaxation in regarding to Contraband Control at Kirkwall.   Possibly the close of the campaign in Finland might have altered the attitude of theNorwegian Government in the matter of armaments. Mr. Hambroand Mr. Metcalfe, of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, would shortly be leaving for Norway in any case, and could start negotia-tions on whatever basis the War Cabinet might decide.The Secretary of State for War said that it was quite impossibleto offer Norway any anti-aircraft guns, whether or not of the latestdesign, unless perhaps some which had already been despatched to Finland could be recovered.It was generally agreed that negotiations should be begun withthe Norwegian Government and the Norwegian Shipowners as quickly as possible.The Prime Minister suggested that the Minister of Shippingcould give sufficient instructions to the negotiators in the light ofthe discussion in the War Cabinet, after any necessary consultations with the other Departments concerned. The matter should again be brought before the War Cabinet as soon as it became clear what we should have to offer in order to obtain control of the tankers thatwe wanted, and what rates we should have to pay for the tankerscovered by the existing arrangement.Re-routeing of The Chancellor of the Exchequer also referred to the subsidiaryOil supplies. proposal mentioned in paragraph 4 on page 2 of the Memorandumby the Minister of Shipping, that we should secure an economy intanker tonnage by increasing our supplies of oil from Venezuelaand the Gulf of Mexico, and decreasing our supplies from Iran.He was strongly opposed to this proposal. It would disturb ourrelations with the Shah, and probably make it necessary to compen-sate him, while we should at the same time lose our own profits fromthe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and incur heavy additional dollar expenditure. In any case, it was estimated that re-routeing would increase imports by only 400,000 tons per annum, which was equivalent to chartering only eight additional tankers.The Minister of Shipping said that re-routeing might become essential in the future, but it was not possible to express any opinion at the present time.: The Secretary for Mines said that, in addition to the long-term problem, which he had already mentioned, the Oil Board were concerned with the short-term problem of the present position of oil stocks in this country. Since the beginning of the war, oil stocksof all kinds in Great Britain had dropped from roughly 6 - 6 million tons to roughly 5-5 million tons, the decrease being in admiralty and Civil stocks, the latter mainly in fuel oil. The decline had takenplace in the first two months of the war, and since then stocks had remained practically constant. It was to deal with this short-term problem of building up stocks that re-routeing had been proposed.If this course was not approved, he would ask that the Oil board should be instructed to reconsider what could be done to build up
Civil stocks possibly by allowing them an option on some of the reserves of the Service Departments. The Admiralty had alreadyallowed them an option of this kind to the extent of 60,000 tons. Ithad been the intention of the Oil Board that the proposal forre-routeing should be referred in the first instance to the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary, and they had notwished at this stage to bring it before the War Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First Lordof the A dmiralty said that they very much hoped that the proposalfor re-routeing our oil supplies would not be adopted at thisiuncture.   General agreement was expressed with this view.The War Cabinet: (i) Invited the Minister of Shipping to initiate negotiationswith the Norwegian Government and the NorwegianShip-owners&apos; Association with a view to (a) chartering further tankers in addition to those covered by the existing Shipping Arrangement ata rate approximating to the present market rate :(b) at the same time securing an agreement that weshould be entitled to continue after May to hirethe 145 tankers covered by the present agreement for a further period at a rate not substantially in excess of the rate which we had agreed to payin November.(ii) That the negotiators should be instructed not to commit themselves either to the Government or to the ship-owners, but to report progress when they saw whatconcessions we might have to offer to obtain control ofthe tankers, and what rates would be payable.(iii) Decided that no steps should be taken for the present tore-route our oil supplies so as to increase our supplies from Venezuela and the Gulf of Mexico at the expenseof supplies from Iran.Flying Boats. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them, a Memorandum by the diversion of Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (G.) (40) 76), together with a jointCivil Flying Memorandum by the Minister of Information and the Postmaster-Boats for General (WP. (G.) (40) 80).military duties. The Prime Minister said that the Secretary of State for Air&apos;proposal to take over these flying boats for military duties was avery serious step from the point of view of civil aviation, and also of prestige. It would mean abandoning what might be thebeginning of very valuable commercial relations. The feeling infavour of keeping civil aviation alive was very strong in the Houseof Commons, and he was sure that the diversion of these flying boatsto military purposes would be severely criticised by members. Sucha diversion would no doubt be an advantage from the military pointof view, but he was not convinced that it was a necessity in presentcircumstances.The President of the Board of Trade said that he would greatlyregret the withdrawal of these flying boats for service use. services such as the transatlantic mail service provided traders with a valuable means of keeping in touch with overseas markets.The Minister of Information said he viewed with concern theSecretary of State for Air&apos;s proposal, and asked if there were no military boats available with the necessary range for the work forwhich  it  was  proposed   to  employ  these  civil  flying  boats.
Alternatively, he suggested that not all the civil flying boats shouldbe taken for Service use, but either only the Cabot and Caribou or only the &quot; G &quot; boats.The A ssistant Postmaster-General said that before the war the fast transatlantic ships had carried the mails. The ships at present engaged on the transatlantic service sailed at irregular intervalsand provided an intermittent service. The Clipper service had alsobeen somewhat intermittent, and there was greater pressure on space in the boats.The Minister without Portfolio, speaking for the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, wished to place on record that thefailure to provide a British Transatlantic Air Service this year would give rise to great disappointment in Canada and Eire.The Secretary of State for Air said that no one regretted morethan he did having to ask for the diversion of these civil flying boats for military purposes, and he agreed that he would have tomeet severe criticism in the House of Commons. The proposal was put forward in order to provide proper protection for seabornetrade. He did not think the submarine or mine menace had yet reached its full development, and these boats would be invaluablefor deep-sea reconnaissance.In reply to a question, the First Sea Lord said that, if newswas received that a raider was operating in the Atlantic, it was proposed that these flying boats should operate from bases in the shetlands, at Halifax, in the West Indies, Sierra Leone and the cape. In order to cover a sufficiently large area, it was not sufficientto operate one boat by itself.The Chief of the Air Staff said that these boats would beinvaluable in locating raiders and submarines. The latter were nowtending to work further out on the Western Approaches.The Prime Minister said he appreciated the value of theseboats in locating raiders. At the moment, however, there were noGerman raiders at sea and he could not regard the employment ofthese boats for Service purposes as a vital necessity. They mightbe diverted at a later stage if the need arose.The War Cabinet (1) Agreed that, for the time being, no further Civil flying boats should be diverted for military duties; i.e., for thepresent the Cabot and Caribou should continue in service with the Royal Air Force, but the three boats ofthe &quot; G &quot; type should be regarded as available for the resumption of the North Atlantic mail service.(2) Agreed that all preparations should be made to enable thethree boats of the &quot; G &quot; type to be made available for service with the Royal Air Force at short notice, shouldthe situation render this course necessary.(3) Agreed that steps should be taken to fit out bases for theoperation of these flying boats at the following places : The Shetlands,Ffalifax,Sierra Leone,The West Indies,The Cape.[21007]c
Scandinavia. 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the(Previous First Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (40) 96).Reference: A record of the discussion which took place, and of theW.M. (40) 67th Conclusions reached by the War Cabinet, is contained in theConclusions, Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Minute 6.)Effect of Soviet-Finnish treaty on our naval situation.Assistance to finland.Stoppage ofmilitary supplies to Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 67thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence reported that,as arranged at the Meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin,he had, in consultation with the Service Ministers, examined as amatter of urgency the whole question of war material eitherawaiting despatch, or already in transit to Finland. The positionin this matter was as follows : --As regards naval and military stores, an arrangement hadbeen made with the Finnish Legation by the Departmentsconcerned some two months previously under which the title to the material in question passed from us to the finnish government at the time when the material in question was handed over to the shipping agent at the port of loading inin this country. This was the normal arrangement under theExport Credits Guarantee System. In the case of aircraft which were to be flown to Finland, it had been agreed that the title should pass to the Finnish Government at the aerodromein this country from which the aircraft were to be flown, and,in the case of aircraft to be sent by sea, as from the date onwhich the aircraft were delivered to the Finnish representatives at the manufacturers&apos; works in this country.Orders had been given that no more material in this countrydestined for Finland should be handed over. A considerable quantity of material had already been handed over, and loadedinto a ship at Leith. Other material had been handed over tothe Finnish authorities and was still in transit over the scandinavian railway system. As regards the latter, theSecretary of State for War had that morning received atelegram from the Military Attache in Sweden reporting thatthere was great congestion on the railway at Tornio and asking for instructions. The contingent of British volunteers was alsoheld up at that point.Sir Alexander Cadogan had seen M. Gripenberg theprevious day, and had informed him that we were anxious tosecure the return to this country of war material still in transit.M. Gripenberg had demurred to this suggestion, arguing thatthe material in question had been handed over to the finnish government, and was now their property.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that too much regard should not be paid to the fact that, under the arrangements made,the material in question became the property of the Finnish Govern-ment at the port of loading, since the whole transaction in virtueof which it had been handed over to the Finnish Government was based on the assumption that Finland was at war with the U.S.S.R.,and required this material for that purpose.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that thebest course would be not to argue the case on legal grounds withthe Finnish Government, but to take it up on the broader basisof equity and common sense. He thought that we should make adirect approach to the Finnish Government.
The War Cabinet agreed : (a)(b)That the despatch of material now in this country whichhad been destined for Finland should be stopped.That the material which had been handed over to theFinnish Authorities and loaded into a ship now atLeith for transit to Scandinavia should be unloaded.(c) That all possible measures should be taken to secure thereturn of as large a part as possible of the war material which we had already handed over to the FinnishAuthorities, and which had left this country.That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make an approach to the Finnish Government for the purposeof securing the return, in accordance with (c) above, ofthe war material which had actually left this country.(d)The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 67thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.reconnaissance of heligoland bight.6. The Secretary of State for Air said there was very littleair activity to report.There had only been two unidentified raid plots during theprevious day. One had approached within 60 miles of Spurn Headat about 11 a.m. The second raid plot had appeared at about p.m. 15 miles east of brightling sea, indicating that the aircraft was at a height of about 1,500 feet. This aircraft might havebeen engaged in mine-laying.A total of 47 patrols had been despatched, involving 111 air-craft, and the usual convoy, Channel escort and shipping protectionpatrols had been carried out.During the morning two Blenheims had carried out a reconnaissance of the Heligoland Bight. Extremely bad weather conditions had been encountered, with low cloud and poor visibility.Nothing of interest had been seen.With one or two exceptions, due to bad weather, the usualsearches and patrols had been completed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty reported that at 11 - 47 a.m.on the 13th March the German S.S. Eschersheim (3,303 tons) had reported herself sinking two miles off Hirtshals, on the north coast of Jutland. The crew had taken to the boats and had apparently been picked up by a lifeboat. This ship was known to have beenloading at Brake, near Bremerhaven, on the 9th March.H.M.S. Dunedin, with the German prize Hannover in tow, had arrived at Kingston, Jamaica, on the morning of the 13th March.At 4-26 a.m. on the 13th March the Armed Merchant CruiserMaloja had intercepted, south of Iceland, the German S.S.La Coruna (7,414 tons), which had sailed from Rio de Janeiro onthe 3rd February. La Coruna had scuttled herself, and the crewhad been picked up by Maloja, who had returned to her patrol.The previous afternoon, the 13th March, the S.S. A thelviking(British tanker,  8,779 tons)  had rammed and sunk the  S.S.
Rossington Court (British, 6,922 tons) about 600 miles east ofHalifax. Both ships had been in the homeward-bound convoyH.X. 26. The crew of the Rossington Court had been saved, andthe A thelviking was returning damaged to Halifax.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 8.
