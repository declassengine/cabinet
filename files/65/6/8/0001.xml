The air situation.(previous kef erence  :W.M. (40) 62ndConclusions,Minute 4.)Enemy activity.Leaflet raid on german-occupiedPoland.reconnaissance of Ruhr andRhine areas.1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat during the afternoon of the previous day enemy aircraft hadbeen engaged in operations against our shipping over the North-East Coast between the Tay and Newcastle. One enemy aircraft a Heinkel 111 had been intercepted at great height and shot downin the sea East of Aberdeen, one of the crew who had escaped in adinghy having been rescued by one of our high-speed surface craft.There had been a recrudescence of enemy raids as darkness had fallen, between 6-30 and 8-15 p.m., off Elamborough Head, the EastAnglian Coast and the North Foreland. Against these raidsFighter Command had, in all, sent up 129 patrols, involving 325aircraft.Two Whitley aircraft had dropped leaflets over Poland onehaving reached the vicinity of Poznan, and the other a point justEast of the German-Polish frontier.A special reconnaissance of canals and waterways in the Ruhrand Rhine had been made by three Whitleys.Patrols of enemy        Two Hampdens had carried out night patrols over enemy sea-seaplane bases,   plane bases, and near Sylt had dropped bombs on a small warshipand a larger vessel which had challenged with a white light.CoastalCommandactivity: U-boatsunk.Attack on enemy patrol vessels.The usual patrols, searches and convoy escorts had been flown by Coastal Command. During these a submarine had been sightedand attacked off Wick. One 250-lb. bomb had fallen within 30 feet of the estimated position of the submerged submarine, and a longoil streak had appeared. A second aircraft had been summonedand had dropped two bombs on the position of the submergedsubmarine, as shown by the oil patch, and more oil had risen to the surface. The aircraft had returned to their base for more bombs,and in the meantime two destroyers had arrived. These had droppeddepth charges and had reported that the submarine was on the seabottom.There had been two engagements between Hudsons of coastal command and Heinkel 115s. In both of these our aircraft had hadthe best of the engagement, the enemy being put to flight after beingdamaged.Three enemy patrol vessels had been attacked near Borkum,two 250-lb. bombs having fallen close to the target. Intensive andaccurate anti-aircraft fire had been encountered from all threevessels.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 61stConclusions,Minute 2.)Interception ofGermanmerchant shipUmguaya.Air attacks on shipping.2. The Chief of Naval Staff gave the War Cabinet a reporton the naval situation covering the previous two days.Particulars were given of the movements of. the Home Fleet.The German ship Uruguaya (5,846 tons), which had leftPernambuco on the 10th February, had been sighted by aircraft from H.M.S. Berwick on patrol in the Denmark Straits on the6th March. Berwick had closed, but her boarding-party had found the ship flooded and on fire, and had sunk her by gunfire.The East Coast Convoys had been attacked by enemy aircraftboth on the 6th and 7th March. On the 6th the attacks had developed at 7-10 p.m. on two North-bound convoys, one off the[20974] b 2
Humber and one off the Tyne. S.S. Rosedene (British 376 tons),alone, had received slight damage from concussion from twelvebombs, the nearest of which had fallen about 10 feet away. On the7th, the attack had developed at 7-15 p.m. on the South-bound convoy off Cromer. This attack had been driven off without damage to the convoy. One ship, however, which was not in convoy, hadbeen bombed and set on fire off Smiths Knoll. This was theS.S. Amelia Lauro (Italian 5,335 tons), bound from Newcastle toItaly with coal. Three of the crew had been wounded and one killed.She was now at anchor burning fiercely.During the raids on the evening of the 6th the Cross SandsLight Vessel had been bombed and machine-gunned, and nine bombs had also been dropped close to the Outer Dowsing Light Vessel.During the raids on the 7th, the attack on the Outer Dowsing LightVessel had been renewed with a further seven bombs. No hits hadbeen scored, but one engine had been put out of action. The lightwas, however, still working. The Light Ships were not armed, nor was it intended that they should be.Shipping losses. Belated reports had been received about the sinking of two ships. About 4 a.m. on the 4th March S.S. Thurston (British-3,072 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk off Land&apos;s End, not in convoy. This ship had previously collided with and sunk the Frenchsteamer S.N.A. 1 (2,700 tons), whose crew she had picked up. Therewere only three survivors from the Thurston and none from theFrench ship. A report from Rotterdam stated that on the 5th march the S.S. Grutto (Dutch 920 tons), bound from London to Rotter-dam, had been lost with all hands 20 miles North of Dunkerque.The cause of the loss had not been given.At 9-50 p.m. on the 6th March two drifters had sighted asuspicious vessel in the war channel north of Blyth which, on beingclosed, had made off to the South-East too fast for the drifters toovertake. As it was suspected that this vessel might have beenminelaying, the North-bound Convoy had been ordered into the Tyneuntil the channel had been swept. This had been done on the 7thand nothing had been found.  Normal traffic had been resumed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 3.   The Secretary of State for War informed the War cabinet situation. that nothing of importance had occurred on the Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 62ndConclusions,Minute 5.)The western front.Finland. In the Karelian Isthmus Soviet troops had continued their attacks across the ice of the Gulf of Viipuri, had captured some small islands and, according to Reuter, had gained a foothold at two points on the coast of the mainland. Elsewhere in Finlandnothing of importance had occurred.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 62ndConclusions,Minute 7.)4.   The War Cabinet considered the following papers : (i) Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 86).(ii) Draft telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Helsinki(W.P. (40) 87).(iii) Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Helsinki (W.P. (40)88).(iv) Note communicated by the French Embassy (W.P. (40) 89).A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached bythe War Cabinet is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File ofWar Cabinet Conclusions.Royal marine operation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 61stConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff on the Royal Marine Operation.A record of the discussion which took place, and of theconclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.Censorship of mails andContrabandControl.Censorship ofUnited Statesmails: proposedContrabandControl Base at st.. John&quot;, NewBrunswick.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (40) 85) regarding (i) the questionof the censorship of United States mails, and (ii) the establishmentof a contraband control base at St. John, New Brunswick. A draft telegram to the United Kingdom High Commissioner at Ottawawas also attached for communication to the Canadian Government,embodying the outline of the scheme for the proposed base, and proposing the lines on which, if the Canadian Government agreed,a joint approach with them should be made to the United StatesGovernment.The War Cabinet:  Approved the despatch of the draft telegram to the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner at Ottawa contained in w.P. (40) 85.Norway.Release ofBritish prisoners from theS.S. Altmark.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that adraft had now been prepared, by the Admiralty and Foreign office in consultation, of the Note to be addressed to the norwegian government in answer to their protest against our action in theA it mark case. The legal contentions put forward by the norwegian government were very carefully dealt with in the draft, which hadbeen approved by the Legal advisers of the Departments concerned,and also by,the Attorney-General. After dealing with the demand of the Norwegian Government that this case should go to arbitration,the draft proceeded on the following lines : If the Norwegian Government were to press thissuggestion, there were a number of highly pertinent considera-tions which we should have to raise; but we hoped that, now that the Norwegian Government had expressed their opinion and we had expressed ours, they would not press theirsuggestion for arbitration; this was npt in our view so mucha case where one party was in the right and the other was inthe wrong, as a case in which from their respective points ofview both parties were in the right; we trusted therefore thatit would be possible to dispose of this case in this manner andto avoid any break in the friendly relations between the twocountries.
He wished to know whether the members of the War Cabinet desired that the draft as a whole, or the passage in it dealing with thisparticular aspect of the question, should be circulated to them.The War Cabinet: Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to&apos;despatch to the Norwegian Government the draft Note inregard to the Altmark case, in the form which he had agreed upon with the Departments concerned, withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet.Italy.economic relations:subjection ofGerman sea-borne coal to enemy export control.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3.)X8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegrams Nos. 14 and 15, dated the 6th March, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, The Vatican, dealing with the serious deterioration in Anglo-Italian relations likely to result unless a.quick settlement could be achieved in regard to the coal question.After the previous meeting of the War Cabinet an Interdepart-mental Meeting had taken place at the Ministry of economic warfare, as a result of which a compromise on the following lineshad been put forward :  Under this arrangement the coal in the Italian ships whichhad been stopped would proceed through the ordinary processof Prize, in the machinery of which it had already become involved. At a certain stage the Admiralty Marshal would inform the Italian Government that it was open to them (underthe Reprisals Order) to purchase the condemned coal if they so desired, if an appropriate method of payment could be devised.On this latter point two suggestions had been made : (i) that the Italian Government should give a sterlingbond;(ii) that the Italian Government should pay for the coalby paying lire into a blocked account in Italy.It would be part of the above arrangement that the ItalianGovernment should give a binding undertaking to purchase no more sea-borne coal from Germany for the duration of the war.The Minister of Economic Warfare was inclined&apos; to prefer(ii) to (i), as being easier to defend in Parliament.He (the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs) had, however,felt that, whichever of these methods of payment were adopted, thedevice would be transparent, and he himself would prefer openly to cancel the orders made for the arrest of eight or ten Italian coalships, or whatever number might be agreed upon, in exchange fora binding undertaking on the part of the Italian Government to buyno more sea-borne coal from Germany for the duration of the war.The Minister of Economic Warfare thought that the mostimportant point was not the precise nature of the concession, butthe means of justifying any concession to Parliament and to other neutral Governments. He believed that such a justification couldbe found on the grounds that the incident had been due to a definitemisunderstanding and not to defiance on the part of the ItalianGovernment. Whichever course were to be adopted, the question arose whether (i) we should wait for an Italian initiative, or(ii) whether we should act ourselves. The previous day it had looked as though the Italians would make a move. More recent informa-tion showed that this was now unlikely. The Minister of economic warfare was lunching with the Italian blockade representative that day, and hoped to extract some admission of misunderstandingfrom him in order to afford a pretext for setting the ball rolling.
The Goal 9.   The Lord Privy Seal said that the programme of specialSituation. coal trains which he had described to the War Cabinet at the(Previous Meeting referred to in the margin was now proceeding.   certain reference-.        difficulties, however, had arisen.   The London and North EasternW.M. (40) 60th   Railway had represented that the measures taken to ensure theConclusions,      running of special coal trains involved very great restriction of minute 1.)        passenger traffic.   In particular, it had been necessary for them tomerge into one two important express passenger services to theNorth.   Further, the passenger trains were arriving several hourslate.   The Railway Management wished therefore to modify thepresent arrangements and to restore these two trains.   This, how-ever, would mean a reduction of 10,000 tons a week in the amountof coal brought to London and the South by train.The War Cabinet would also remember that coal traffic hadbeen accorded the same priority as perishable foodstuffs and otherurgent stores, including those for Service establishments. AMeeting had been held that morning of the Transport Priority Sub-Committee, at which the Service representatives had stated thattheir programmes were thereby being seriously delayed, and had urged that coal traffic should cease to be accorded the presentmeasure of priority.The Lord Privy Seal said that, while he could not say howserious were the delays to the Service programmes, he felt that itwas essential to continue for the present the special measures whichhad been taken to deal with the coal situation.The Prime Minister agreed with this view. The coal situation was still serious, and, while the position was just being held, no progress had yet been made in building up stocks. In his view,there could be no question of restoring passenger traffic while thecoal situation remained as serious as it now was.   He was notIf, however, this came to nothing, he (the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs) intended that afternoon to send for SignorBastianini, the Italian Ambassador, and put the suggestion to him,at the same time instructing Sir Percy Loraine to make a similarcommunication to Count Ciano.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was opposed tothe solution put forward at the Interdepartmental meeting, whichhe thought savoured too much of a device, the main object of whichwas to put a favourable appearance on the transaction. Thisobject, however, might be completely defeated if the Italian Govern-ment, as they might well do, disclosed the full position. he therefore much preferred the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, provided that we succeeded in obtaining a definiteagreement with the Italian Government as regards the future.The Prime Minister said that our purpose was to stop german exports and not to injure Italy. The amount of coal in the ships which had been stopped was trifling when compared with the normalannual coal exports from Germany to Italy. It would be well worthreleasing these ships, or some of them, if in return we could secure a satisfactory arrangement to prevent further sea-borne exports ofcoal from Germany to Italy. A settlement on these lines would bevery similar to that we had made with the Japanese Governmentin the Asama Maru case.The War Cabinet agreed : That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should endeavour to reach a settlement of the coal difficulty withthe Italian Government on the lines of his proposal at&quot;X &quot; above.
familiar with the position in regard to the Service programmes,but he thought that the present priority should continue for anotherweek.The War Cabinet agreed :  (1) That the programme of additional trains for the carriage of coal to London and the South must be continued forthe present, notwithstanding the serious curtailment of passenger traffic thereby involved.(2) That coal traffic should continue to be accorded the degreeof priority which it at present enjoyed for another week,subject to review thereafter.Richmond- Terrace, S. W. 1,March 8, 1940.
