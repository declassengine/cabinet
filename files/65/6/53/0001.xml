The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 107thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.Royal Air Forceactivity.Use ofsearchlights.Attacks onU-boats.1. The Secretary of State for Air said that only three trackshad been plotted off our coasts during the period, one east ofLowestoft which had travelled parallel with the coast, another40 miles off Spurn Head, and a third in the North Foreland area presumably a reconnaissance.   No interception had been made.No daylight operations had been carried out by bomber command, owing to adverse weather reports. During the nightsix Whitleys had attacked Fornebu,. but searchlight glare and heavyanti-aircraft fire had prevented observation of results. OneWhitley had not returned.The Prime Minister said that -prima facie we might have something to learn from the Germans in the use of intense search-light glare        defensive weapon.The Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of Statefor Air were invited to give instructions for the study, as amatter of urgency, of this method of using searchlights.Patrols of Hudsons and Blenheims had been maintained overthe Andalsnes area at intervals during the day. Between 9 and10-30 a.m. eleven aircraft had been seen; two Heinkels and oneMesserschmitt 110 had been engaged without definite result, thoughthe Messerschmitt had appeared to be in difficulties. One of our aircraft had been damaged on landing in the Shetlands. A secondpatrol had engaged two Junkers 88. The rear gunner of one hadbeen put out of action and the aircraft had appeared to be in difficulties.No enemy activity had been seen on the frozen lakes or fjordsin the vicinity of Grotlien. Molde had been seen to be burningfuriously.In Bergen harbour 20-30 merchant vessels of about 3,000 tonshad been seen. A Hudson had attacked one of the merchant vessels in Bjore Fjord, obtaining a near miss which was believed to have caused damage.   The vessel had been disguised.Two flying boats which had gone to Namsos and Andalsneswith Army officers had returned to Invergordon.Two enemy submarines had been sighted and attacked west of the Shetlands and it was believed that a hit had been obtained on one of them. ^ A third had been sighted midway between the shetlands and Norway, after our aircraft had expended all itsbombs.The War Cabinet took note of this statement..The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the A dmiralty informed the War cabinet situation. that H.M. submarine Unity had been sunk in collision with a(Previous merchant ship in the Tyne.     An officer and three ratings were reference: missing, but it was possible that they were alive inside the sunkenW.M. (40) 107th submarine.Conclusions, The First Lord gave particulars of the additions to the FleetMinute 2.) &apos;      expected in the months of May and June.Th First Lord said that he had been considering whether, inorder to counter German allegations that the Royal Navy had suffered severe losses in the fighting off  Norway, it might be a goodplan to make a full statement in reply to a Parliamentary Question.The First Lord read a draft of a statement which had beenprepared.In discussion, it was agreed that the statement presented afavourable picture, and that there was much to be said for its publication.  On the other hand, publication of this statement might
lead to questions as to why it was still possible for Germantransports and supply vessels to use the Kattegat and Skagerrak.Generally it was felt that it would be prudent to defer makinga statement for a few days, in view of the difficult operations nowpending.The War Cabinet agreed That a decision on the publication of the statementprepared by the First Lord of the Admiralty should be deferred for a few days.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 107thConclusions,Minute 3.)Narvik area.Namsos.Trondhjem.Fleet Air Arm.Andalsnes andthe southern front.NorwegianRoyal FamilyandGovernment.3.   The War Cabinet was given the following information : (i) Two battalions of the 24th Guards Brigade and two battalions of Chasseurs Alpins were gradually closing inon Narvik.(ii) The Polish destroyer Blyskawica, which had been sent toSalt Fjord to frustrate a possible German landing there,had reported it empty.(iii) There had been considerable enemy bombing in the Namsosarea during the previous twenty-four hours. The trawlerAston Villa had been bombed, but without casualties.The trawler Gaul was ashore in Namsos Fjord after being hit, but it was hoped to refloat her that day.(iv) HAL ships Ivanhoe, Icarus and Impulsive had successfullylaid mines off Hitteren in the Trondhjem area duringthe night 29th-30th April.(v) It was reported that the forts at the entrance of theTrondhjem Fjord were only very lightly held byAustrian troops.(vi) Ark Royal would be joined by the aircraft  carrierGlorious and Valiant that day for operations off theTrondhjem area. Glorious would be carrying reinforce-ments of aircraft for transfer-to Ark Royal.(vii) Enemy air forces had been active in the Andalsnes area onthe previous day. Molde, Christiansund North andAndalsnes had all been bombed, and at 11-45 a.m. Moldehad been in flames and communications with Andalsnessevered. By 9 p.m. Fleetwood had had 30 bombs aimed at her and had expended practically all her ammuni-tion. The ship had not been hit, but had sustained4 casualties. She had sailed later with 40 casualtiestaken off from the shore. The bombing of Andalsneshad continued until 10 p.m., and Brigadier Hogg had reported the situation as uncommonly grave. From areport received from a midshipman of the Fleet air arm, there seemed to be a considerable amount ofdisorganisation and confusion at Andalsnes.(viii) Glasgow had embarked His Majesty the King of Norway,the Crown Prince, members of the Government, theBritish and French Ministers and their wives, and23 tons of gold at Molde during the night the29th-30th April. King Haakon had asked to be putashore at Tromso. Our Air Attache had reported thatthe King seemed in very good heart.(ix) The 15th Infantry Brigade was holding a line South ofDombaas, where they would remain until that night (the30th April-lst May) to cover the withdrawal of theNorwegian troops. There had been severe bombing bylow-flying aircraft.(x) Reports had now been received of the splendid way the15th Infantry Brigade had fought at Otta, where theyhad destroyed 3 German tanks.
Invasion ofGreat Britain.precautionary measures.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 66thConclusions,Minute 5.)Question ofrecalling Britishregularbattalions from india.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 58thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. In reply to a question by the Minister without Portfolio,the Secretary of State for War said that the question of the defenceof the United Kingdom against invasion had been discussed at theMilitary Co-ordination Committee on the previous day. The Chiefsof Staff had been instructed to re-examine the existing plans forthe defence of the &quot;United Kingdom against invasion, and to reportto the Committee. In view of the shortage of trained troops in thecountry, he (the Secretary of State for Wrar) had been invited toconsider the advisability of bringing back from France theremainder of the Fifth Division and of authorising the issue of thenecessary orders, if he thought desirable.The Minister without Portfolio said that there were manylessons to be learned from the ruses adopted by the Germans intheir attack on Norway : for example, the sending of false messages,the cutting of telephone wires, and the need for a thorough examina-tion of ships entering our ports. He thought that all the elements of Home Defence should be put on the alert.The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled that, early inSeptember 1939, he had raised the question whether regular british battalions serving in India should be recalled and replaced byTerritorial battalions. If this country was short of fully-trainedtroops, he thought that this course should again be examined.The Secretary of State for War explained that the small number of fully-trained troops in this country was due to the factthat the War Cabinet had decided that the newly-formed divisions should be sent to France as early as possible. In regard to theBritish Divisions in India, the policy had been to use these Divisionsas a reservoir of trained personnel from which Officers, N.C.O.&apos;sand men were being continually withdrawn to stiffen the territorial divisions.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, as a resultof this policy, about one-half of the British Regular Battalions inIndia now consisted of Territorials or of young troops. Further,if any units were brought home from India, it would be necessaryto re-equip them.The Prime Minister said that the Chiefs of Staff, in carryingout their review of Home Defence, would no doubt take into full consideration the First Lord of the Admiralty&apos;s suggestion.The War Cabinet :-Took note that the Chiefs of Staff were re-examining theexisting plans for the defence of the United Kingdomagainst invasion, and invited them, in this connection, totake into account (a) the First Lord of the Admiralty&apos;s proposal for thewithdrawal of Regular Battalions from India :(b) the need for drawing the attention of all Home defence units to the stratagems adopted by the Germans in norway, and to the importance of devising suitablesafeguards.(xi) A force of Blenheim fighters were being flown that day torefuel in the vicinity of Andalsnes. It was hoped thatthese aircraft would reduce the intensity of the german air attacks and provide a measure of air protection forthe withdrawal.A record of further discussion on this subject, and of theconclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.
Norway. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heVisit to London had just received a telegram from Sir Cecil Dormer, reporting thatof Norwegian the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs and another NorwegianMinisters. Minister proposed at once to come to London to confer.   Sir CecilDormer suggested that he should be allowed to accompany them.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.U.S.S.R. 6.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Consul, New York, according towhich the insurance companies had reported that the gold whichit had been intended to ship on the Italian liner Rex had now beentransferred to the Manhattan, If this meant that the Rex was not going to sail, it must be interpreted as a bad sign.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.Navaldispositionsin theMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 107thConclusions,Minute 5.)10. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that it was doubtfulwhether after all the three French battleships would be available tojoin H.M. Ships Royal Sovereign and Malaya, since the Frenchwished first to carry out some minor repairs. This was unfortunatesince the repairs could easily have been carried out at Alexandria.It would be necessary in the course of the day to decide whether ornot the two British battleships should be allowed to proceed.
467W.M.108(40).      298Ita&apos;y- 11.   The Secretary of State for War said that, if we were toPrecautionary become involved in war with Italy, it was extremely important that,measures. if possible, we should have three days warning, in order that variousforces might be moved to their war stations, defences manned, andother similar action taken.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he under-stood that it was decided to give immediate orders to man the defences at Alexandria, Haifa, Malta and Gibraltar, and to move the Armoured Division in Egypt into the Western Desert. He saw no objection to the defences being manned (although this would nodoubt become known to the Italians), but he was more doubtful about the move of the Armoured Division.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff enquired whether there would be any objection to this move being carried out,provided it was done under the guise of manoeuvres.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, if thiswas practicable, he would have no objection to the Division beingmoved.(Previous A discussion then took place on the question whether similarReference: precautionary measures should now be taken with regard to theW.M. (40) 105th other Services and also on the civil side. As regards the latter,Conclusions, the War Cabinet were informed that the whole question had been minute 6.)        reviewed by the Co-ordination of Departmental Action Committee.The War Cabinet agreed (a) That immediate orders should be issued for the manningof the defences at Alexandria, Haifa, Malta, and gibraltar, and for the Armoured Division in Egypt tobe moved to the Western Desert, this move to be carriedout under the guise of manoeuvres.(b) That the Chiefs of Staff, or their representatives, in con-sultation with representatives of the Foreign Office,Dominions Office, India Office and Colonial Office, should consider whether in their view there are any further measures of a precautionary nature which should betaken at the present time; and if these measures are notrequired now, to make arrangements to ensure that thedecision to put them into operation will be taken withoutdelay, as and when the situation demands.Gibraltar. 12.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that measures to the War Cabinet, at their meeting on the 28th April, had approvedenable the arrangements being made for the evacuation in case of need of surplus civilian Service families from Gibraltar. The Oversea Defence Committeepopulation to had been considering the case of the surplus civilian population,be evacuated. other than Service families, which amounted to about 13,000 old(Previous men, women, and children.  It would be very desirable, on militaryReference:        grounds, to evacuate these before an attack developed.   The matterW.M. (40) 106th had been tentatively examined; French Morocco was the mostConclusions,      suitable destination, as making the smallest call on shipping.Minute 4.) If the War Cabinet agreed that it would be desirable toprepare a scheme for the evacuation of these persons, an immediateapproach to the French Government would be necessary to get their agreement to the local authorities on both sides making plans.The Governor would have to be given compulsory powers for usein case of necessity, but the scheme would not be put into operation without a decision by the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet were informed that much of the evacuationmight be done by making use of local ferry boats. General Nogueshad been approached unofficially in the past, and had agreed toprovide space for the evacuees.
Italy.Allied policy inthe event of an italian attackon Yugoslavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 107thConclusions,Minute 4.)The War Cabinet (i) Agreed that the Governor of Gibraltar should be givencompulsory powers to evacuate the surplus civilian population, on the understanding that the scheme wouldnot be put into operation without a decision by the WarCabinet.Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to approach the French Government forthwith with aview (ii)(a)(b)to obtaining their agreement in principle to theevacuation of the surplus civilian population of gibraltar to French Morocco; andto the preparation of the necessary plans by the localFrench and British authorities in consultation.13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the policy to be adopted inthe event of an Italian attack on Yugoslavia (W.P. (40) 141).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, if Italyattacked Yugoslavia and we did not at once declare war, he thoughtthat we were bound to get involved in war with Italy later on, after having passed through a period of twilight in which the FightingServices would have been greatly embarrassed in the Mediterranean.In this twilight period, we should also have tightened our contraband control against Italy, with the result that signor mussolini would be able to claim that we had forced him into thewar through adopting a policy of sanctions. If war was inevitable,,it was much better that it should come about as a result of an Italianact of aggression. If Italy were to invade Yugoslavia, we couldnot do nothing; while, if we took some intermediate action short of declaring war, we should inevitably later be drawn into war in less favourable circumstances. For these reasons, he was disposed to feel that our proper course in the circumstances contemplated would be to declare war on Italy. The concurrence both of theFrench and Turkish Governments would be required, and it mightwell be that this would not be forthcomingIn the course of the subsequent discussion, the following considerations were brought forward : (i) One of the arguments supporting the conclusion that weshould declare war on Italy was that by doing so weshould put heart into Yugoslavia and the other balkan states. The fact that we should not be able to assistYugoslavia directly might, however, produce the opposite result.(ii) The situation would be different if at the outset of thewar we could inflict a heavy blow on Italy. This couldbe achieved by the bombing of the industrial areas inNorthern Italy. The attitude of the French at the last meeting of the Supreme War Council had seemed to bethat they were not at present prepared to contemplateit immediately. If we were to attack such areas inNorthern Italy, the Germans would certainly retaliateat once against either France or ourselves.(iii) On the question whether it would be to our advantage thatthe declaration of war should be made by Italy orourselves, it was pointed out that, if we were to declare war, it would be easier for Signor Mussolini to rally his fellow-countrymen against us. On the other hand, theshock caused to public opinion in Italy by our declaring war might be very great.(iv) The view was expressed that it was most dangerous todecide so grave a matter as peace or war with Italy onthe basis mainly of our anticipations as to the probable
internal reactions in Italy. If Signor Mussolini attackedYugoslavia, there would be profound anxiety in Italy asto our probable attitude, which from our point of view would be very salutary. This anxiety would, however, be destroyed if we ourselves were at once to declare war.(v) It was impossible to predict what kind of attack italy might make on Yugoslavia; and this was another reasonagainst precipitate action. She might confine herself toseizing strategic points on the Dalmatian coast; or she might make an attempt to overrun the whole of yugoslavia, though she would not risk the latter courseexcept in agreement with Germany. If we were to refrain from declaring war, it might well happen thatthe uncertainty regarding our attitude might restrainItaly from attempting the latter course. Moreover, the degree of resistance offered by the Yugoslavs might havean important influence on the scale of Italian operations.(vi) The large oil stocks held by Italy constituted an important element in the problem. If we were to declare war on italy, this oil would be at the disposal of Italy and herGerman all)7.(vii) If Yugoslavia was attacked, she might make an appeal for help to the Allies. It might be well for the wholequestion to be discussed frankly with Prince Paul; andthe suggestion was made that, at the same time, heshould be approached regarding possible measures forhindering oil supplies reaching Germany by the Danube.Yugoslav co-operation in the immediate prepara-tion and eventual execution of these vitally importantmeasures ought, it was urged, to be made a conditionof any promise of assistance by the Allies.(viii) If Italy attacked Yugoslavia, and we did nothing, therewas a risk that the whole of our position in SouthEastern Europe would collapse. There would also bea strong demand at home for action against Italy. It&apos; should be remembered that the Chiefs of Staff had reported that, from the military point of view, thebalance of advantage would lie in favour of ourdeclaring war on Italy, provided that we could attack the industrial area in Northern Italy.(ix) If on becoming involved in war with Italy the Turksallowed us to enter the Black Sea, we should securegreat advantages, but it was by no means certain that theTurks would agree to this course, since they were not yet ready for war with Soviet Russia. We were under no obligation to come to the aid of Yugoslavia, if she were attacked. The French, however, were under an obliga-tion to consult in that event.(x) If we became involved in war with Italy, the germans would quickly get a grip on that country, and we shouldhave to face German aircraft and German submarinesoperating in the Mediterranean. Further, the danger of spain being drawn into the war against us would be greatly increased.The Minister without Portfolio urged that, before a decision was taken, the War Cabinet should be informed of the facts and figures as to the strength of the Italian naval, military and airforces.At the conclusion of the discussion the Secretary of State saidthat he did not ask for an immediate decision from the WarCabinet; he would have a frank discussion with M. Corbin in orderto explore the mind of the French Government, and he would take steps also to ascertain more fully the view of the Turkish Govern-ment and of certain Balkan States.   He would bring the matter
back to the War Cabinet when these consultations had been com-pleted. It must be realised, however, that we might at any momentbe forced through Italian action to take an immediate decision.The Foreign Secretary added that it would be helpful if the Britishand French Staffs were to furnish an up-to-date statement of themilitary action which it would be open to the Allies to take inthe event of their becoming involved in war with Italy. the appreciation submitted before the war was now out of date, as theresult of subsequent developments.The War Cabinet agreed (1) To take no decision at the present stage on the policy tobe adopted in the event of an Italian attack on yugoslavia.(2) To take note that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed to discuss the question further with the FrenchGovernment, the Turkish Government and the Govern-ments of certain of the Balkan States.(3) That arrangements should at once be made for the Britishand French Staffs to prepare an up-to-date statement ofthe military action which it would be open to the allies to take in the event of their becoming involved in warwith Italy.NorwegianTanker Tonnage.Tankers bound for Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 102ndConclusions,Minute 11.)14. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs raised thefollowing question relating to Norwegian tanker tonnage :  There were six Norwegian tankers, under time-charter toItaly, which were due to proceed to that country with cargoes of oil. This oil belonged to Italy, and the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare felt that it would be impossible to prevent it being sent to that country. The Ministry of Shipping and theAdmiralty feared, however, that if these tankers were allowedto proceed to Italy to discharge, the Italian Government might subsequently hold up the tankers themselves. It was accordingly proposed that these tankers should be allowed toproceed to Italy in pairs for the purpose of discharging, thesecond and third pairs not to be allowed to proceed until theearlier pairs had discharged their oil and left Italian waters.In most cases the time-charters to the Italians would expirewhen these particular cargoes had been discharged; and itwould then be easier for the Norwegian Government themselvesto requisition the vessels.The Minister of Shipping said that the Norwegian authorities had agreed in principle the previous day to requisition allNorwegian tankers, but they had not yret taken the consequentaction; they did not feel that it would be possible for them to take special action in the case of tankers time-chartered to Italy.Further, they thought that it would be easier to requisition empty-than full tankers. The requisitioning of these tankers would thus be facilitated if they were allowed to be unloaded.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed with the course ofaction proposed. He added that the German aggression againstNorway and Denmark had enabled us to acquire control of some750 ships aggregating 3 million tons.The War Cabinet agreed That the six Norwegian tankers under time-charter to theItalians should be permitted to proceed to Italy todischarge, subject to an arrangement by which not morethan two of these tankers would at any one time be in italian waters.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,April 30, 1940.
During the three weeks of the Norwegian campaignthe Germans have claimed to have sunk or damaged eightBritish capital ships, one aircraft carrier, 20 cruisers,fifteen destroyers, fifteen submarines, and 39 transports -tqtal 98.    These figures are obtained by adding together the daily claims made &quot;by the German wireless, and theycertainly make a most imposing total.    Actually the followingBritish warships or auxiliaries have been sunk:-4 Destroyers    .   .   , H.M.S.  GLOWWORM, H.M.S. HUNTER,H.M.S. HARDY, H.M.S.  GHURKA.3 Submarines    .   .   . H.M.S. THISTLE, H.M.S.  TARPON,H.M.S.  STERLET.5 of H.M. .   .   . RUTLANDSHIRE, HAMMOND, LARWOOD,Trawlers BRADMAN and CAPE SIRETOKA.There have been no other losses.The GHURKA remains the only warship in the royal navy to have been sunk by a bomb from the air.    During thesame period seven anti-submarine craft of the latest patternhave joined the fleet and many destroyers which wererefitting have re-joined.    The numbers and the tonnage of anti-submarine craft at the disposal of the Admiraltyafter these three weeks&apos; fighting are to-night substantially greater than when the invasion of Norway began three weeks ago.In this same period perhaps nearly two thousandbombs have been cast from high or low upon the Britishwarships and auxiliary craft and upon the convoys theyhave escorted and protected.    Frequently fifty or sixtybombs have been cast upon a single ship during an afternoon,It has been a common experience for ships to be forseveral hours under continuous bombing attack, and sometimes

more than a score of dive-bombing attacks have beenmade upon a single ship without injury.    On one occasionat Liliesjonas, an anchorage in a Norwegian fjord, twotransports - one of eighteen thousand tons -- bothcarrying large numbers of troops were subjected to fivehours&apos; bombing with no other protection than thatafforded by the guns of two anti-aircraft cruisers; butneither was hit.    It is astonishing that so few bitshave been obtained.    The only ships hit by bombs apartfrom H.M.S. GHURKA and the 4 trawlers already mentionedare one battleship, H.M.S. RODNEY (suffered minor damageonly, thanks to good armour protection); one largecruiser, H.M.S SUFFOLK upon which nearly seventycasualties were inflicfted but which came home under her own steam at 18 knots; one anti-aircraft cruiserH.M.S. OJURACOA, which suffered 83 Casualties but returnedacross the North Sea at over 15 knots; one sloop H.M.S.PELICAN which suffered, about 70 casualties, and had tobe towed home; and one other sloop H.M.S. BLACK SWAN,which, after 4 days&apos; continuous attack, was hit bya &quot;bomb but sustained no casualties and remained upon her station.      One transport, the CEDAR BANK, carryingstores was sunk by a U-boat with the loss of 15 of her crew.    The total number of hits obtained by the german air force on British warships, auxiliaries andtransports during all this time of constant fightinghas been 10, or about 5 per thousand.

Against this the guns of the fleet, to whomthe continued practice has been invaluable, and thefighting aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, apart altogether from the Royal Air Force, have shot down 40 German aircraft and damaged certainly notless than 15.      A steady toll has been taken byBritish and Allied submarines of enemy transports ontheir way to the invasion of Norway.     30 transportsand store ships have &quot;been sunk, scuttled or set on fire with a loss of life which has certainly exceededseven thousand,,     A further 10 transport or storeships have been struck by our torpedoes and probably sunk.     The known or admitted loss to the German warfleet, already very inferior in number to the British,may be summarised as followsCapital ships damaged ... 2Cruisers sunk ... 4Destroyers sunk ...11U-boats sunk ... 5The injury to the German Navy in these three weeks has been so substantial as to alter theentire balance of Naval power,   and to permit animportant re-distribution of the main Allied fleets,in a sense favourable to their interests especiallyin the Mediterranean,,During the same period the British MercantileMarine has gained - apart from the use now obtained of norwegian and Danish shipping - upwards of 40,000 tonsover losses.
