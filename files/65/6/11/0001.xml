Russia.Military -implications ofhostilities in1940.     .(Previous :References:W.M. (40) 35thConclusions,Minute 9, andW.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,  !Minute&apos;2.)      ;1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report by theChiefs1 of Staff on the Military Implications of Hostilities withRussia in 1940 (W.P. (40) 91).The Chief of the Air Staff explained that the Paper did notpurport to be an exhaustive appreciation of the whole problem ofa war with Russia, but the Chiefs of Staff had reached theconclusion that there was no action, which we could take against russia which would bring about the early defeat of Germany.Russian action against us would be more in the nature ofembarrassing diversions than vital blows. Such diversions wouldhave a high nuisance value, since they would make serious demands on air defences and aircraft, of which we were short at the presenttime. The most serious danger would be the threat to India and afghanistan. It would be very difficult to meet India&apos;s demands for defences against Russian air attack. As regards Afghanistan,the Chiefs of Staff thought that it would be essential to send activeassistance in the event of an invasion of that country by theRussians. They had therefore recommended that the Governmentof India should be invited to examine this question as a matter of urgency.The most effective way in which we could strike at Russiawouldr be to attack the Caucasian oilfields, from which Russia drew80 per cent, of her oil supply.   Interference with these oil supplies would have a very definite effect on Russia, and serious reper-cussions on Germany, in view of her dependence to a large extent on Russian oil.   Plans for the operation were being worked out,but it was not an easy one to undertake.   The distances involved were great, the country was difficult, and there were considerableair&quot; defences in the area, which it was believed were being increased.: We had no war experience of such an operation, but the Air Staff&quot;estimated that 3 bomber squadrons, operating for a period of from6 weeks to 3 months, would probably put the oilfields out of action- v&apos;;   &quot;-altogether.   Serious interruption to supplies would probably begin&quot;- \o - much earlier.   Casualties to civilians would, however, inevitablyresult, and our existing bombardment instructions would have to be revised.   There were no suitable squadrons in the Middle East. available for this operation at present; but the necessary aircraft( &quot;&apos;&apos; could be sent, though only at the cost of depleting our home air&quot;force and reducing the striking force available in the event of a&apos;.  German invasion of the Low Countries.   Operations against the caucasian oilfields would, of course, involve crossing either Turkishor Iranian territory, and were therefore dependent on the co-opera-tion of these countries.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that the---/- prospects of either Turkey or Iran fighting actively on our sidewere at present remote, unless their own interests were directlythreatened.   His impression was that Russia feared Germany and:. did not want to see Germany too strong.  At the same time, she didnot wish to go to war against us, and would only do so if shethought that she would gain some definite advantage thereby.We could not do much against Russia unless we had Turkishco-operation, and he did not think it was to bur advantage to declare war on Russia.   Nevertheless, he saw no reason why weshould be deterred, by fear of Russia making war on us, from any action which we might wish to take to our own advantage elsewhere..      v As for.the despatch of bomber aircraft to the Middle East in... preparation for operations against Baku, he would prefer to wait.There seemed little likelihood at present of hostilities with russian the near future.The Chief of the Air Staff explained that the Chiefs of Staffdid not propose that modern bombers should be despatched for this a;:   &quot;purpose now.  He had, however, arranged to hold in Egypt certain[20995] b 2
modern aircraft which were being sent out to re-equip the squadrons at Aden. This diversion had not resulted in any weakening of ourmetropolitan air force.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence observed that thepossibility of war with Russia had not been brought to the noticeof the great majority of Government Departments. If hostilitiesdid break out, many of these Departments would be vitallyconcerned, and it was for consideration whether the action to betaken in the event of war with Russia should not be examined bysome body similar to the War Book Committee that had functionedin peace time. Questions such as the seizure of Russian shipping,for example, would have to be considered.It was generally agreed that, if war with Russia did break out,it would probably be limited to certain theatres and would not amount to a formal declaration of war. Our action in each of theselimited theatres would have to be decided on its merits. In any event, a decision on this matter could safely be deferred for afew days.The Secretary of State for India agreed that Afghanistan was our weakest spot. India&apos;s present war plans did not envisagesending any forces to Afghanistan at all, and, indeed, no such forces were at present available. If war did break out with Russia,she was almost certain to stir up trouble in Afghanistan and occupy the northern provinces. He agreed with the Chiefs of Staff thatwe should then have to do something to support Afghanistan. the muslim world would regard it as a test of our ability to help smallnations, and we could not plead, as we had done in the case ofCzecho-Slovakia and Poland, that geographical considerations made it impossible for us to send assistance. India&apos;s lack of air defences(Previous was aig0 a serious matter.   The two Blenheim squadrons which reference: were to be converted to fighters would hardly suffice against theW.M. (39) 108th scaie Gf attack which the Russians might bring to bear on northernConclusions,       IndiaMinute 7.)The First Lord of the Admiralty doubted whether Russianbombing on northern India would seriously increase our difficulties it might even bring home to the Indians that they could not hope to protect themselves entirely with their own resources. He wasnot at all in favour of sending land forces into Afghanistan. Itwould surely be better to attack the Russian communications with air forces, since this would certainly delay their advance for a very long time. Such an operation would be much easier than thedespatch of considerable land forces, which would certainly have great difficulty in co-operating effectively with the Afghans.The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that air forces were not atpresent available for such an operation. He thought that plans should be drawn up on the basis of the resources available at present.The Prime Minister suggested that, in view of theimprobability of our being involved in general hostilities withRussia, it might be as well to wait and see the outcome of presentdevelopments in Finland before embarking on an exhaustive enquiry into the possibility of an expedition into Afghanistan.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence asked whether betteruse could not be made of the large man-power resources availablein India. In the last war India had provided 5 Divisions and2 cavalry divisions for operations outside India. Conditions had,of course, changed, but up to the present time only 1 Indian division hand left the country. Indian troops might be used for a numberof duties which did not necessarily involve a high standard of equipment.
The Secretary of State for India said that 1 Indian Brigade,was earmarked for despatch to the Anglo-Iranian oilfields, and authority had now been obtained from the United Kingdom Govern-ment for 2 more Brigades to be raised, so that the whole of the forcenecessary for the defence of this area could be provided from India.It would be 3 to 4 months, however, before these 2 additionalbrigades would be ready.The War Cabinet-(i) Took   note   of   the   Report   by   the   Chiefs   of   Staff(W.P. (40) 91).(ii) Agreed that, having regard to the present international situation, a decision should be deferred for a few daysas to the recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff that theGovernment of India should be invited to examine thequestion of giving help to the Government of afghanistan and to consider the provision of forces for despatch into that country.Assistance to finland.(previous preference:W.M. (40) 65thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The War Cabinet gave consideration to an aide-memoireby the Chiefs of Staff on Assistance to Finland (C.O.S. (40) 264 (S)).A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Royal Marine 3.   A record of a statement by the First Lord of the A dmiraltyOperation. on this subject, and of the ensuing discussion, is contained in the(Previous Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Reference:W.M. (40) 65thConclusions,Minute 7.) j_The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 65thConclusions,Minute 1.)reconnaissance of heligoland bight: U-boatsunk.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 60thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Secretary of State for Air informed the &quot;War Cabinetthat successful daylight reconnaissances into the Heligoland Bighthad been carried out on the previous day by two Blenheim aircraft,which had returned safely. One of these had attacked an enemy submarine on the surface midway between Heligoland and theSchillig Roads. Four 250-lb. semi-armour-piercing bombs had been dropped, one of which had been seen to hit just forward of theconning-tower. A second bomb had made either a hit or a close miss.The pilot had seen both ends of the submarine sticking upwardswith water covering the middle. The submarine had sunk, leaving a large patch of dark oil on the surface.The aircraft had continued its reconnaissance to the SchilligRoads. No salvage operations had been seen at the position wherethe submarine had been bombed on the 4th March, but four buoyswere present, disposed in a square.Three or four barrage balloons had been seen at Borkum at,500 feet.
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 65thConclusions,Minute 2.)  .Shipping losses.5. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that there had been no attacks on British shipping duringthe previous day. Attacks on neutral ships had been made asfollows : (a) The Dutch S.S. Eulota (6,236 tons), bound from Rotterdamto Curacao, in ballast (not in convoy), had been hit,probably by a torpedo, 120 miles south-west of Land&apos;sEnd. The bows, which were still afloat at 5 p.m., hadbeen sunk by H.M.S. Broke. H.M.S. Wild Swan hadpicked up the survivors. Two destroyers were searchingfor the submarine, of which the presence had been confirmed by a D.F. at 11 a.m.(b) The Dutch S.S. Amor (2,325 tons), not in convoy, had been mined and sunk 25 miles north-east of the north foreland.   The crew had been saved.(c) The Greek S.S. Niritos (3,854 tons), not in convoy, had been damaged by a mine in the swept channel 10 miles north-east of the North Foreland. She had been stillafloat at 10 p.m., anchored in the Downs. The channelhad been closed and north-bound traffic had been stoppeduntil the channel was swept.A magnetic mine had been exploded on the previous day in theswept channel in the Firth of Forth. Traffic had been temporarily stopped, but a new channel was now in use.At 5 p.m. on the previous day the British S.S. Clan Stuart(5,760 tons), outward bound to Beira, in convoy, with a generalcargo, had been in collision and had sunk off the Start. Whilesearching for this ship, H.M.S Veteran had been in collision withS.S. Horn Shell and had damaged her stem. Horn Shell had alsobeen slightly damaged.  Both collisions had taken place in fog.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 65thConclusions,Minute 3.)Western Front.Finland.   .6. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing of importance to report from the Western Front.       HIn Finland there had been some fighting, both on the KarelianIsthmus and in the sector immediately north of Lake Ladoga. TheRussians appeared to have made some minor advances in the gulf of Viipuri, but no changes of importance had occurred.The morale of the Finnish G.H.Q. was said to be very low, andthis, combined with the exhaustion of the troops, might have serious consequences. There were, however, signs that the Russians might require a pause before they could continue their offensive.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,March 12, 1940.
