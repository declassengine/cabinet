contraband control.french proposals forrationingneutrals.(previous references:W.M. (40) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2,and 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)A&quot;1. THE War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister for Economic Warfare (W.P. (G.) (40) 93).In a statement explaining his Memorandum, the Minister for economic Warfare informed the War Cabinet, that M. GeorgesMonnet, the new French Blockade Minister, was coming to london on the following day, with a view to discussing with him thetightening up of the Contraband Control, with special referenceto the rationing of neutrals. The Supreme War Council had passed a Resolution at their last Meeting &apos;&apos; that the French and british authorities should undertake an examination into the possibilityof making the blockade more effective by imposing quotas on suchneutral countries as might be thought necessary.&quot; The &quot;FrenchMission appeared to have been informed by their Ministers that theSupreme War Council, in passing this Resolution, had accepted theprinciple of rationing, and that only the machinery was referred for discussion to the experts; the Minister for Economic Warfare,however, proposed to interpret the Resolution as requiring his department to study the possibilities rather than to apply a decisionalready taken.The Minister pointed out that the possibilities of rationingdepended on the circumstances of the countries concerned. He drew attention to paragraph 3 of his Memorandum, which showed thatthe adjacent neutrals could conveniently be grouped as follows : (a) the Northern neutrals, with whom we had concluded war trade Agreements;(b) Russia and Italy, in the case of which there appeared tobe little prospect of arranging effective War trade agreements;(c) the Balkan countries, whose overseas imports we couldcontrol to whatever extent might be necessary to preventre-export to Germany, but who supplied Germany mainly with their own domestic products.The Minister suggested to the War Cabinet that the following lines should be laid down for his guidance in his discussions withM. Monnet: (i) To agree that we should seek to graft rationing arrange-ments for commodities of special importance on to theWar Trade Agreements with the neutral countries withwhich we have concluded these Agreements, without,however, pressing them so far as to provoke thedenunciation of these Agreements.(ii) To point out to M. Monnet the political difficulties involvedin any attempt to ration Italy and to refer back to theWar Cabinet for further instructions on this point.(iii) To  propose  the  adoption  of  the  procedure  already authorised in regard to rationing of cotton imports, viz.,that we should seek to fix quotas by agreement, but,failing agreement, should be empowered to enforcerationing, the quotas for this purpose being fixed on abasis which takes full account of all legitimate needs ofthe countries concerned.(iv) To    explain    the    objections    to    making    nayicertscompulsory and to the detention of all un-navicertedcargo.The principal points made in discussion were as follows : (1) Russia was the country from which the greatest leakageinto Germany was taking place, and which thereforecaused the most anxiety to the Minister for economic warfare.(2) Italy was the &apos;&apos; next leakiest&apos;&apos; country, but up to the present we had dealt with her very tenderly, in pursuance ofour object of detaching her from Germany.    (see minute 2 below.)[21110] b 2
(3) If our present Contraband Control policy vis-d-vis italy was to continue, any action on our part to ration tbeNorthern neutrals would expose us to the charge ofunfair discrimination against them.(4) The Minister for Economic Warfare said that the stocksof oil held in Italy were already far above the country&apos;snormal requirements. These stocks now stood at-6 million tons and, if orders placed were taken intoaccount, might amount by the end of the year to3-8 million tons- a much higher figure than that of anyother neutral. The stocks had been reckoned to be the equivalent of seventeen months&apos; supply at Italy&apos;s present estimated rate of internal consumption. The object ofthis great accumulation might be (a) to form a war reserve for Italy herself;(&amp;) to place Italy in a position to render vital aid toGermany, if called upon; or(c) to increase Italy&apos;s bargaining strength,  vis-a-visboth Germany and the Allies.(5) Italy was building oil storage for an additional two million tons. This was required if she intended to keep her oilreserves at about the 4,000,000-ton mark.The Minister for Economic Warfaxe said that he was at presenttaking advice on the legal aspect of rationing neutral countries.It was essential that we should take no action which might subsequently be rendered nugatory by judgments in our own PrizeCourts. The Prize Court might well refuse to condemn a cargounless his Department were in a position to produce evidence thatthat cargo was destined for the enemy&apos;s use. We should landourselves in difficulties if we seized a cargo of oil consigned to a neutral country which could produce evidence that the oil was required for its own internal consumption or had been purchasedin order to increase its own reserves.In reply to questions, the Minister undertook to let the WarCabinet have further information on the following points : (i) The geographical location of the new oil reserves whichwere being built up in Italy.(ii) The annual consumption of oil in Italy over a period ofyears.(iii) The stocks of oil held in Italy over a period of years,distinguishing if possible between stocks for naval use,aviation petrol, and civil stocks.(iv) The stocks of oil held in Italy at the beginning of the abyssinian campaign.The War Cabinet (1) Gave general approval to the proposals of the Minister for economic Warfare contained in W.P. (G.) (40) 93 and summarised at &quot; A &quot; above.(2) As regards Italy (see Minute 2 below), authorised theMinister for Economic Warfare to inform M. GeorgesMonnet that our whole policy in regard to Italy wasbeing examined by the Foreign Secretary, withparticular reference to contraband control measures, andthat he (the Minister for Economic Warfare) would take part in this examination.Italy &apos;s oil stocks.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 79thConclusions,Minute 8.)
Italy- 2.   Discussion on the preceding Minute showed that the actionAnglo-Italian which we could take in regard to rationing neutral countriesrelations. generally depended largely upon whether it would be possible to(Previous ration Italy.   This led to a general discussion on Anglo-ItalianReference: relations, in the course of which the following points were made : C^nciusions78th (*) The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that on the minute^T&apos; outbreak of war it had been a matter for consideration&apos; whether we should call upon Italy to declare herself asfriend or foe. An improvement in Anglo-italian relations had set in, and it had been thought right toallow the position to develop, in the hope that italy would come over on to our side. He thought, however,that we might again have to consider whether we shouldcall upon Italy to define her attitude.(2) The Prime Minister expressed general agreement with thisview, but thought that it would be desirable to wait fora time, and at any rate until the position in France hadbeen consolidated. At the same time he thought that signor Mussolini was rather presuming on our goodwill.(3) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet that Sir Percy Loraine had been of theopinion that matters were going well for us in Italy, andthat the one thing which we should avoid was puttinga point-blank question to the Italian Government as totheir intentions. It would be important to ascertain whether Sir Percy Loraine (who was now in London)was still of the same opinion. Count Ciano, with whomour Ambassador had established most cordial relations,had always maintained that we should not seek tointerfere with the natural development of signor mussolini&apos;s policy.(4) The Foreign Secretary said that M. Corbin had told him that General Gamelin and Marshal Badoglio were onfriendly terms, and that General Gamelin felt assured that as long as Marshal Badoglio was in command of theItalian land forces, we need not be afraid that italy would come into the war against us. If, however,Marshal Badoglio were to be removed from his post,,this would be a dangerous sign.(5) The War Cabinet were informed that, according toMr. WTedgwood BeUn, who had recently been in Italy,the pro-Ally sentiments of the great majority of thepeople were unmistakable. Indeed, they were so strongthat it would be difficult for Signor Mussolini to draghis country into war on Germany&apos;s side. There was some evidence that German war material was being sentto Spain through Italy, bearing Italian marks.Germany&apos;s stock, however, was said to stand much higher in Spain than Italy&apos;s.(6) Reference was made to Count Ciano&apos;s position and torumours that he was out of favour with his father-in-lawand might be removed from his post as Minister forForeign Affairs. Did our. Ambassador&apos;s relations withCount Ciano remain as cordial as they had been in recent months ?(7) Doubt was expressed whether Italy was in a position totake part in a major war. A suggestion was made that signor Mussolini&apos;s technique was probably to keep usguessing and to raise his value by creating anxiety as tohis intentions.(8) Reference was made to Italian naval and military preparations.   As regards the latter, the War Cabinet[21110] b 3
were informed that these did not appear to be of thekind which the Italian Government would take if theywere thinking of early entry into the war; i.e., the men being called up were, for the most part, raw recruits,and not reservists.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements, and invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toexamine our whole policy in regard to Italy, withparticular reference to Contraband Control measures, inconsultation with the Minister for Economic Warfare.Broadcasting.Proposed g.e.e-tion of a newhigh-power station near theEast Coast.3. The War Cabinet had before them, a Note by the Ministerof Information (W.P. (G.) (40) 92) submitting a proposal for theerection of a broadcasting station near the East Coast, to providea long-range daylight service to Western and Central Europe on long wave or medium wave.The Minister- of Information explained that the proposedstation would command practically the whole of Germany, and that from this point of view the fact that it would be 150 miles nearerthan the existing station at Droitwich made all the difference. he appreciated that there was a small risk that the station might never be put into useful service, but he concluded on balance that therewas a sufficiently high chance of its being badly needed, to justifyhim in asking for the expenditure to be incurred. If the station were already in existence, it would undoubtedly be already in use for propaganda purposes, provided there were no objections by theAir Ministry. If it were completed before the conclusion of thewar, he would propose to find out at once whether the Air staff were willing to withdraw their objections, so as to enable it to beused.The Secretary of State for Air said that there were threeobjections to the proposal from the Air Force point of view.Masts of 500 ft. would be a danger to navigation, particularly at night; the proposed transmitter would afford a directional aid to enemy aircraft; and the station, if near to the coast, wotild provide them with a valuable visual guide. He did not, however, considerthat the project ought to be abandoned on account of these objections, and the considered view in the Air Ministry was thatit should be approved subject to the provisos that (i)(ii)(iii)the masts were limited to 350 feet in height;when there was reason to expect hostile air attacks, thetransmitter should operate only with the consent of theSecretary of State for Air;the station should be sited at least 15 miles inland.The First Lord of the Admiralty raised the question whether we could afford to give priority to the demands for materials and skilled personnel, which the proposal would involve, in view of theimportant competing claims in the same field. He also suggestedthat, if the station were to be erected at all, it would be worth whilebuilding the masts to the full height of 500 feet.The Minister of Information said that only very small quantities of steel would be required for the construction of thestation, and that the complete staff would consist of some 30 to 40men. He did not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the technicaloperators required. The masts could, if necessary, be built to aheight of 350 feet in the first instance, but so constructed that theirheight could be increased later.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if it were agreedthat on general grounds it was desirable to proceed with the
221W.M.81 (40).      148proposal, he was prepared to agree from the point of view of theexpenditure involved. He had in mind particularly that it might very well be essential after the war for this country to possess a powerful transmitting installation. The proposal would probablyinvolve a supplementary estimate for the broadcasting vote.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theForeign Office attached great importance to the political arguments in favour of the proposed station.The Prime Minister suggested that, if the War Cabinet were generally in favour of the proposal, it should be referred to theMilitary Co-ordination Committee to consider in greater detail.The Committee could examine the requirements of the Air Staff,and the Air Ministry Wireless Research Staff, and also the questionsof priority which had been raised, and could take any necessarydecisions and then report to the War Cabinet.There was general agreement with this proposal.The War Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the proposal set out in w.P. (G.) (40) 92 for the erection of a high-powerbroadcasting station near the East Coast.(2) Invited the Military Co-ordination Committee to consider this proposal, with special reference to the points raised in the discussion, to take any necessary decisions, and toreport their conclusions to the War Cabinet.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 80thConclusions,Minute 2.)Enemy activity.Royal Air Eorceactivity.Sunderland-Junkers combat.4. The Secretary of State for A ir informed the War Cabinetthat enemy aircraft had been off the East Coast between 8-40 a.m.and 8-15 p.m. on the previous day. In all, twelve aircraft had beenplotted in the Wick-Aberdeen area, and between Berwick and the humber. There had been attacks on shipping off Northumberlandand near Fair Island, but these had achieved no damage.An unidentified raider had crossed the coast at 11-50 a.m. nearCromer. It had flown over South-East England at a considerableheight above the clouds, and had left the coast at Selsey Bill. Theaircraft had not been intercepted, but as there had been heavy cloudover the whole area, it was unlikely that it had achieved any useful purpose.A Spitfire had intercepted and shot down a Heinkel 111forty miles North-East of Whitby at 12-38 p.m. Three survivorshad been picked up and landed at Scarborough. The Spitfire hadcaught fire and alighted on the sea, and the pilot, who was injured,had been picked up and taken to tlartlepool.The Chancellor of the Exchequer commented on the excellentimpression which had been created by the account of this episodein the newspapers that morning.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air said that at   - 50 a.m. a section of Skuas, while on convoy patrol, had intercepteda Heinkel 111 6 miles off Kinnaird&apos;s Head. Another section hadintercepted a Heinkel 111 over the convoy at 11-30 a.m. but inneither case had the results been conclusive.No operations had been carried out either by Bomber Commandor by British Air Forces in France during the previous day.Very few of the usual patrols and searches by Coastal command had been possible on account of weather conditions. Thirteenconvoys, however, had received protection.There had been a notable performance by a Sunderland of204 Squadron which had been sent out to protect the outward-boundNorwegian Convoy, which was being shadowed by enemy aircraft.This flyins:-boat had encountered two Junkers 88 which had
approached from the North-East. A running fight at a height of100 feet had taken place between the aircraft, flying on parallelcourses. The Sunderland had brought all guns to bear, and after-two or three minutes, the enemy aircraft had broken off the engage-ment. Five minutes later four more Junkers had appeared and,flying very low, had attacked on the tail of the Sunderland. the rear gunner had held his fire till the enemy were within 100 yards,,and had then opened fire and shot the leader down into the sea.Whilst this was going on, the first two Junkers had been droppingbombs on the Sunderland from about 1,500 feet, but without effect.Two officers of the Sunderland had received slight injuries fromsplinters, and the aircraft, which had returned safely, had been hit in several places, including its petrol tanks.A further combat had also taken place between two Gladiatorsfrom Sumburgh and a Heinkel, which had been attacking a shipEast of the Shetlands. The Gladiators, having intercepted theenemy aircraft, had opened fire at 400 yards, closing to 100 yards,but the enemy had made off apparently undamaged.The Secretary of State for Air said that he had been informedthat two large German cruisers had been sighted off Heligoland,and that a Bomber force was being dispatched to attack them.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 80thConclusions,Minute 3.)Raid on Scapa.2nd April.Attacks onconvoys.5. The First Lord of the Admiralty, referring to the raidon Scapa on the 2nd April, said that of the 20 enemy aircraft which had started from Germany only five or six had been seen/over Scapa. They had skirted the batteries, whose fire they clearlyhad not liked, and had unloaded their bombs at random. It was believed that two, if not three, enemy aircraft had been brought&apos;&apos;down by our gunfire. &apos;:;On the previous day there had been widespread attacks on ourconvoys, during one of which the enemy aircraft had remainedoverhead for one-and-a-half hours, but the convoy had not been hit.An indication of the long endurance of German aircraft was thefact that the particular aircraft which had found time to spendone-and-a-half hours over the convoy had then been 450 miles fromthe nearest German aerodrome.Apart from air attacks there had been no enemy attacks on shipping.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the First Lordsaid that, although we had been on the look-out for salvageoperations, there had been no evidence that the Germans had succeeded in raising the British submarines which had been sunknear the German coast.The Prime Minister referred to the report which had appeared in the newspapers that morning about gunfire which was said tohave been heard off Bergen, and of a German aircraft which was alleged to have subsequently landed near but not on stavanger aerodrome, and to have been set on fire by its crew.This Report was not understood, but it was thought that theenemy aircraft might have been destroyed on account of cyphers orof secret instruments carried.
The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 80thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.The Secretary of State gave the War Cabinet particulars ofthe formation and movements of certain Divisions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for War.german submarines.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 54thConclusions,Minute 6.)Reporteddespatch to the black Sea.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto Telegram No. 18 (Saving), undated, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Athens, reporting that the Political Director of the Greek ForeignOffice had stated that a report had been received from Ankara tothe following effect: Germany was said to be sending to Bulgaria, by the danube, submarines in parts which were being forwarded to Varna. According to some sources, the submarines were probably destined for the U.S.S.R. It was also stated thatthe King of Bulgaria had said that Germany was sendingsubmarines and magnetic mines to the Black Sea with allspeed, and that only after a few months, when the necessaryquantities had arrived, would Roumania be attacked.Sir Michael Palairet had added that the Political Director hadbeen unable to vouch for the accuracy of the Report, but had passedit on for what it was worth.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Supreme WarCouncil: 6thMeeting.Royal marine operation.Proposed actionin Norwegianterritorialwaters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 80thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad had a telephone conversation the previous evening with sir Ronald Campbell on the question of the approach to be madeto M. Daladier in regard to the Royal Marine Operation. Up tothat time Sir Ronald Campbell had been unable to see M. Reynaud,but he did not anticipate that he would meet with any difficulties with the latter once he was able to see him. As a result of this discussion the Prime Minister had sent to Sir Ronald Campbellby telegram (No. 58 to Paris) a personal message for delivery toM. Daladier as soon as M. Reynaucfs consent had been obtained.If M. Reynaud agreed to the proposed procedure, Sir RonaldCampbell would himself deliver the telegram to M. Daladier. Itwas expected that a definite reply would be received in the courseof the day. As arranged at the previous meeting of the WarCabinet, the texts of the Notes to be delivered to the Norwegian and swedish Governments had been telegraphed to His Majesty&apos;representatives at Oslo and Stockholm under suspendedinstructions. There was therefore nothing more to be done at themoment.The Prime Minister said that he thought that some reply from paris might be expected in the course of the day. The change in procedure which had been adopted had the advantage that sir Ronald Campbell would be able to see for himself whatimpression the message made on M. Daladier, and would also beable to give him explanations and, if necessary, press the case upon-him.
The Par East.German exportsto Japan.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 7.)contraband control in theFar East.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)-Establishmentof administra-tion underWang Ching-Wei in Nanking.Sir robert craigie&apos;sspeech.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 79thConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that at an interview the previous day, the Japanese Ambassador had expressedthe hope that it would be possible to avoid all difficulties betweenthe two Governments in regard to the question of German exportsto Japan, and, on the instructions of the Japanese Government, had put forward a proposal that we should permit a small number ofships to proceed to Japan. These ships would carry exportsrequired to complete the Japanese defence programme, and which,according to the Ambassador, had been paid for before the27th November, 1939. If we agreed to this proposal, the JapaneseGovernment undertook to make no more applications for the exemption of German exports from our control. The foreign secretary said that he had promised the Ambassador that thisproposal should be examined, and he had since referred the matter to the Ministry of Economic Warfare. His advisers took the viewthat there might be scope for bargaining regarding the number ofships to be exempted, and that the proposal was worth examination.The Foreign Secretary had taken the opportunity of asking theJapanese Ambassador whether he thought it likely that the two:Governments would be able to reach agreement regardingcontraband control in the Far East. The Ambassador had repliedthat the position of the Japanese Government, at the time when this matter had last been raised by Sir Robert Craigie, had beenthat, while they had been unable to accept the legal principles onwhich we based our action, they would not have raised trouble with us if we had carried out the measures proposed without asking for their express consent. It was thought, however, the ambassador had spoken rather too optimistically.He had told the Japanese Ambassador that the JapaneseGovernment would be well advised to avoid raising with us thequestion of the recognition of the puppet Government established at nanking under Wang Ching-Wei.As regards Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s recent speech, the foreign secretary had reassured the Chinese Ambassador, who had expressed anxiety on the subject, by saying that we had arranged,by means of a question in Parliament, to counter any impression that we were contemplating a change in policy towards the far eastern question. From a recent telegram received from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, it appeared that the StateDepartments apprehension had been allayed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,April 4, 1940.
