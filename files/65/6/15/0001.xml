The Ail-Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 69thConclusions,Minute 1.)Enemy activity.reconnaissance of Tersehelling.Patrols of enemyseaplane bases.Leaflet raids:Warsaw.Attrition ofBritish andGerman AirForces.Berlin blackout.1. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that, during thecourse of the previous day, some 18 enemy aircraft had been plottedover the North Sea. None of these aircraft had approached close to our coasts and they had presumably been engaged on recon-naissance flights. Air activity in Germany itself had been veryslight for the last three days.On the previous clay it had appeared probable, from anintercepted wireless message, that a German mine-layer and patrolvessel were operating to the Westward of Terschelling. A numberof aircraft had been sent out to investigate, but nothing had been sighted.Night patrols had been carried out over Borkum, Norderneyand Sylt. One of our aircraft had flown over Sjdt at a height of100 feet, but nothing had been sighted.Two Whitleys had been despatched from England on theprevious night to drop leaflets on Warsaw. Both aircraft had landed safely in France, but reports of the flight had not yet beenreceived. This was the longest reconnaissance flight which we had so far carried out, the aircraft having been nearly 12 hours inthe air.  A number of other leaflet raids had also taken place.A Hudson patrol North-West of Terschelling had had arunning fight with a Heinkel with inconclusive results.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence asked whether, asa result of the German policy of sending only a small number of aircraft to our coasts, the degree of exhaustion suffered by our AirForce was greater than that which we were causing the german air Force.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff agreed that to meet a verysmall number of German raids we were employing a large numberof fighter patrols. On the other hand, our raids over Germany, suchas the patrols over the seaplane bases, and, to a certain extent, ourleaflet raids, were causing a considerable amount of fighter activityby the German Air Force. The wastage through crashes was fairlyheavy, but experience had shown that the wastage rate tended to rise when flying was reduced below a certain level. It was true,however, that our fighter pilots had been having an exhausting time.In reply to a question, the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff saidthat, according to Mr. Sumner Welles, Berlin was better blackedout than London. Field-Marshal Goring had admitted to-Mr. Sumner Welles that our aircraft had been over Berlin.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 69thConclusions,Minute 2.)Soviet S.S.Mayaltovsky.H.M. Aircraft-Carrier Eagle.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there was nothing of importance to report.The S.S. Mayakovsky had been intercepted 120 miles East of japan. Weather conditions had made boarding impossible andthe ship was being escorted to Hong Kong. She carried a cargo of4,000 tons of copper.A bomb, presumed to have been one of the ship&apos;s outfit, hadexploded on board the aircraft-carrier Eagle on the China Station.One warrant officer and 12 ratings had been killed and 5 ratingsseriously injured. The ship was on her way to Singapore to havethe damage repaired.[21009]b 2

Sir Alexander Cadogan drew attention to telegram No. 21,dated the 15th March, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, the vatican, reporting that the rumoured meeting between signor mussolini and Herr Hitler would, in fact, take place at the Brenneron Sunday, the 17th March.The Military 3.

According toMr. Osborne&apos;s informant, Italian needs could not be met fromGermany, owing to lack of rolling-stock and to the very poor quality of coal which Germany was able to send.Mr.? Sumner Sir Alexander Cadogan drew attention also to telegram No. 53,Welles to be dated the 15th March, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, thereceived by the Vatican, in which Mr. Osborne reported having been informed byPope. Mr. Myron Taylor that Mr. Sumner Welles would be received inaudience by the Pope when passing through Rome on his return journey.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Soviet-Finnish 5.   The Permanent  Under-Secretary of State for ForeignTreaty. Affairs reported that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had(Previous the previous evening had an interview with M.

The FrenchGovernment felt that the various objections put forward in theBritish Note of the 29th February were no longer valid.Moreover, it was reasonable to consider the question whetherthe behaviour of Norway and Sweden during the Finnish war had, in fact, been as neutral as the Allies had a right to expect,since, in practice, these States had adopted an attitude whichfavoured German policy, and thej^ had, moreover, clearlyaccepted German recommendations. There was also the plainfact that they had neglected their duty to help the victim of soviet aggression. The French Government considered itnecessary, from the point of view of public opinion in neutralKb-
The Balkans.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 10.)Effect of Soviet-Finnish Treaty.6. A discussion took place regarding the situation created inSouth-Eastern Europe by the ending of the.Finnish-Soviet war, inthe course of which attention was directed to the following con-siderations : (i) The decision of the Roumanian Government, reported inthat morning&apos;s Press, to remove the ban on the IronGuard and to restore its members to their formerpositions was probably an indication of the increasedpressure which Germany now felt able to exert uponRoumania.(ii) The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported thatat a meeting the previous day the Dominion high commissioners had enquired whether we proposed totake any diplomatic action in South-Eastern Europe.For example, did we propose to take any further actionin regard to the position of Turkey in the event of anattack on Roumania ?(iii) The view was expressed  that,  with  the  removal ofGermany&apos;s fears for her supplies of Swedish ore, hermain anxiety as regards raw materials would be the inadequacy of her oil supplies. For this reason alone,it was likely that Germany would increase her pressure on Roumania. Particulars were given of measures, someof which had been taken and others of which were con-templated, which had as their object the curtailment of roumanian deliveries of oil to Germany.(iv) If the report of an imminent meeting between Herr hitler and Signor Mussolini proved to be well founded, thepossibility could not be excluded that an arrangement might be come to under which Italy would benefit at theexpense of roumania..Yugoslavia,   and   Germany  at  that  of countries, that the Allies should do something to prove thatthey still had at their disposal means of taking action.M. Gorbin had added that each time the Allies had taken action which might be described as strong rather than correctsuch action had had a most advantageous effect on neutral opinion.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had undertakenthat the French Government&apos;s Note should be given urgent consideration. He had explained that, while he did not in anyway underrate the arguments put forward by the FrenchGovernment, he felt that there were two ways in which thegeneral problem facing the Allies could be viewed, namely : (a) the first, which was advocated by the French Govern-ment&apos;s Note, stressed the importance of taking theinitiative and of impressing neutrals with our ability to take strong action;(b) the second was to consider whether it might now bepossible to develop in a manner satisfactory to ourselves a belated recognition by the threeNorthern States that they might form some sort of alliance.From this second point of view, it was essential that theAllies should not act in such a way as to force Norway and sweden onto the German side. Both these countries weredominated by fear of Germany, and care must be taken to do nothing which, while insufficient to overcome that fear, mightnevertheless forfeit a measure of Norwegian and Swedishgoodwill, which otherwise would be useful to us.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
(v) There was general agreement that it would be a great advantage to us if Turkey were to permit us to send afleet into the Black Sea, since we would be enabledthereby greatly to strengthen our contraband control andalso to exercise pressure in that part of the world whichat present was not open to us. Unfortunately, theprovisions of the Montreux Convention made it very unlikely that Turkey would permit our Fleet to pass through the Straits, until she became a belligerent.The Soviet military reverses in the Finnishcampaign had no doubt greatly increased Turkey&apos;confidence in her ability to protect herself, but the factthat Finland had had to make peace with the U.S.S.R.had probably weakened Turkey&apos;s belief in our power toassist our friends.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,March 16, 1940.
