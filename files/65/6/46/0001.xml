The Air 1.   The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff- informed the War cabinet situation. that there had been very little enemy activity during the daylight(Previous hours on the previous day.  During the night, however, 33 plots had reference: been recorded. A number of parachutes had been seen to drop andW.M. (40) 100th enemy aircraft had evidently been engaged in mine-sowing, mainlyConclusions, in the areas of the Humber and the Thames Estuary. A numberMinute 1.)        of our fighters had been sent up but had not encountered the enemy.Lack of cloud cover had prevented air attacks on Norwegianobjectives, including Stavanger, during daylight hours. During the night two Whitleys had left to attack Jonsvatnet Lake nearTrondhjem, but had been unable to find it in bad visibility. TwoWhitleys had successfully attacked Kjeller and Fornebu aerodromes this being the first occasion on which we had reached the Osloaerodromes.Six Whitleys had successfully attacked Aalborg aerodrome.They had encountered more intense aircraft fire than any yetexperienced, and one aircraft was missing.Three of our aircraft had seen what appeared to be a shipburning 20 miles west of the Jutland coast.Coastal Command aircraft had successfully reconnoitred LakeJonsvatnet, near Trondhjem, where they had seen twenty-two enemy aircraft. These were dispersed about the lake, and a number ofthem were believed to be out of action. The frozen surface of thelake was deteriorating.Hudsons had attacked the petrol tanks at Bergen during theprevious afternoon. One tank had been hit and a large column of black smoke had risen from it.A submarine had been attacked by a Hudson without result170 miles east of Aberdeen.Six Swordfish had carried out mine-sowing during the nightwithout interference. Provided the weather remained clear duringthe next five or six nights it would be possible to complete ourmine-sowing programme.Long distance fighters were in process of being moved to scotland for the purpose of intercepting enemy bombers operatingalong the Norwegian coast.A Royal Air Force Technical Party had reached Norway toprepare for the reception of Gladiators, which were due to arrive onthe 25th.The Minister without Portfolio hoped that it might be possibleto carry out attacks on oil supplies at Oslo, where the bulk of norwegian oil was said to be stored. There were 200,000 tons of oil at Copenhagen. He appreciated that the possibility of such attacks would depend on whether the targets were sufficientlyisolated. The Ministry of Economic Warfare had been asked tosend full particulars to the Air Ministry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised the question of thepossibility of fitting floats to fighter aircraft to enable them to operate in the Norwegian fjords.The Vice-Chief of the Air Staff said that the fitting of floatsto Spitfires was under technical examination at the moment. Iftechnically feasible, there would be no operational difficulty.The Vice-Chief of the Naval Staff said that the admiralty were pressing on with the fitting of floats to Rocs.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[21197]
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 100thConclusions,Minute 2.)Enemy mine-laying.Publication ofshipping losses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)Publication ofother news of value to theenemy.2. The Vice-Chief of the Naval Staff said that the enemy hadbeen very active in laying mines off our coast. This was probably in retaliation for our mine-laying in the Baltic. There were 130ships in the Downs. The ships which had been degaussed werebeing permitted to sail, but others were being held up until the channels had been swept.The Norwegian S.S. Bravore, 1,400 tons, had been sunk by a mine in the Downs.  Five of the crew of 18 had been rescued.The Vice-Chief of the Naval Staff said that, whereas we were kept completely in the dark by the Germans as to the effect of ourown mines, as soon as British or Allied ships were sunk by Germanmines the news was published and broadcast. He cited as a furtherinstance a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief of Home fleet to the effect that the Germans had not been aware of our landing at Namsos until news of this landing had been broadcast by theB.B.C. While it would probably not have been possible to keepnews of this operation secret for very long, the action taken by theB.B.C. in this case had nullified the very careful steps taken by theBritish force landed at Namsos to disguise their arrival.The Vice-Chief of the Naval Staff urged that a stop should beput to the present practice of allowing the newspapers to publishnews of value to the enemy.The Lord Privy Seal said that on the previous day he andSir Horace Wilson had had a long talk with the Minister ofInformation, the Chairman and Director-General of the B.B.C. andthe Director-General of the Press and Censorship Bureau. TheB.B.C. had been most anxious to do all in their power to help. Boththe B.B.C. and the newspapers, however, said that the service departments did not give them sufficient guidance in these matters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the broad-casting of news by the B.B.C. was even more important than its publication in the newspapers. News broadcast by the B.B.C.became known in enemy countries instantly, and was regarded as having an official character.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, as an interim measure, toarrange that the Press and the B.B.C. should not publishnews of shipping losses by enemy action for the next three days.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to bring before theWar Cabinet at an early date the question of with-holding from publication by the Press and by the B.B.C.of items of news (such as particulars of sinkings ofships by German mines) which might be of value to theenemy.Operations in norway.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 100thConclusions,Minute 3.)Narvik area.3. The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff informed the War Cabinetthat H.M.S. Furious had reported that enemy parachute reinforce-ments were arriving regularly at Narvik. The Furious had nofighters and consequently found difficulty in dealing with thesituation. The numbers which had been landed were not known,but it would be possible for a single aircraft to carry 20 men,including arms and machine guns.Lord Cork had warned the population of Narvik by a norwegian broadcast that the town might be bombarded. Thepreliminary bombardment might start that day.The Secretary of State for War said that the most seriousfeature in the situation at Narvik was the fact that the germans had been allowed to send a trainload of food and medical supplies tothe Swedish border over the Swedish railways.   They would thus
be able to keep their forces in Narvik supplied with food. The &quot;WarOffice had made immediate representations to the Foreign Office onthis matter. An interview which the British Minister in Stockholmhad had with the Swedish Foreign Minister on the questionappeared most unsatisfactory (Telegram No. 34, Saving from Stockholm). This interview had taken place immediately on mr. Mallet&apos;s hearing of the passage of the train from the norwegian government.Namsos area. The Vice-Chief of Naval Staff said that the French transportVille d&apos;A kjer which had been turned away from Namsos on the21st, had re-entered at dusk on the previous night and haddisembarked French troops and stores.S.S. Blackheath carrying mechanical transport and ammunition for Brigadier Phillips&apos; Brigade had also succeeded in unloadinghalf her cargo, and would be returning to Namsos that night, ifpossible.The sloop A uckland had had 47 bombs aimed at her during theprevious afternoon, but had suffered no serious injuries. She andthe Calcutta were remaining at Namsos to provide anti-aircraft defence. This was not the proper use for these ships, but their presence would be necessary until the land anti-aircraft gunsarrived. These had been urgently despatched in a Danish ship which should reach Namsos within the next two or three clays.Andalsnes. H.M.S. Arethusa had landed the R.A.F. Base Staff with 45 tonsof petrol at Andalsnes during the previous night, and was nowreturning to this country.Enemy aircraft had been very active at Andalsnes during thewhole of the previous day, but the jetty had not been hit. Therailway, however, had been cut by German bombers in several placesbetween Andalsnes and Dombaas and would take twelve hours to repair.The sloop Pelican carrying the Port Base Staff for Andalsneshad been bombed. Her engines were out of action and she was nowin tow, bound for Lerwick. The Base Staff had, however, beentransferred to another ship, and should since have been landed atAndalsnes.Three cruisers and six destroyers with troops and stores had sailed from this country on the previous day and should reachAndalsnes that night.The landing of troops and stores had been successfully carriedout on the night of the 21st-22nd.Three aircraft of the Hudson Battle Flight had left Wick fora demonstration flight over Andalsnes.   Their endurance would not permit them to be there for probably more than half an hour, but their mere appearance would have a good moral effect.Arrival of H.M.S. Arethusa, now on her way back to this country wasNorwegian bringing with her the Norwegian Director of Shipping, who hadDirector of been instructed by his Government to organise and assume controlShipping. of all Norwegian shipping.   This would be of great help.   TheMinistry of Shipping had been informed.Further discussion as to the military situation in Norway is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,April 23, 1940.
