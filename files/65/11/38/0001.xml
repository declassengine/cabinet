The forces now being prepared for theNorwegian ports would be organised and loaded for anunopposed landing.

(40) 45thConclusions,Minute 1.)reply by putting forward the alternative which wewere considering, namely, the laying of the minefield.The War Cabinet:-Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to revise the draft reply to the French Government, soas to include the two points given above.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs read to the War Cabinet Telegrams Nos. 141 and 142from Helsingfors.      (Copies of these telegrams are attached).Telegram No. 141.     The Foreign secretary proposed to reply to the two questions put by theFinnish Minister for Foreign Affairs, in paragraph 6,on similar lines to the reply which had been given tothe King of the Belgians on 14th January, 1940.K    Hewould say that, whereas it was impossible to guaranteeanything, the Finnish Government could be sure that,if our two countries were both in the war as Allies, weshould do everything in our power to maintain the integrity of Finland, and that the whole resources ofthe British Empire would be exerted in the commonstruggle.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.Telegram No. 142.     The War cabinet considered this telegram paragraph by paragraph.It was generally thought that the suggestion,in paragraph 3, that assistance to Finland under theAllied plan should be by &quot;armed volunteer formations&quot;rather than by Regular armed forces would be the kind33   W.M. (40) 13th Conclusions, Minute 1.

2B8of subterfuge which would raise great difficulties for the French and ourselves, but would not affectGermany&apos;s attitude.     The presence of large Britishand French forces passing across Sweden would be equally distasteful to the Germans whether or not theywere called &quot;volunteers&quot;.     On the other hand, it wassuggested that, by using the fiction of &quot;volunteers&quot;,we might avoid war with Russia;    though this was doubtful as the Russians were not officially at warwith Finland at all.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew attention to the fact, mentioned in paragraph 4of the Telegram, that the Finnish Minister for ForeignAffairs had gone straight to Stockholm to tell theSwedish Government of the impending appeal.     this meant that the whole plan would be disclosed to sweden forthwith, which was contrary to therecommendations made by the Chiefs of Staff that nothing should be disclosed until 5th March.He had thought of telephoning to Stockholm to stop the communication which the Finns were proposing to make.     He had not done so, however, first, because he had always thought that a longer time would benecessary for negotiations with Norway and Sweden than hadbeen allowed for, and, secondly, he thought that the swedes would be likely to keep quiet about the whole matter, as it would . not   be in their interests to let it leak out.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF pointed out thatthe Swedes would immediately have to consult their

5andinavia:afftaversations.previous conference:[.(40 ) 43rdnclusions,nute 1).military advisers, who were in very close touch withthe German Army, and it was in this way that theleakage would he likely to occur.It was generally felt that the balance of argument was in favour of letting things take their course;   and, furthermore, that the Finns and Swedesshould be told that the Allies were not only willingto give Sweden extensive military assistance, but were actively making preparations to do so.     Theactual scale of this assistance would not, of course,be disclosed, unless we reached the stage of staff conversations with the Swedes, as it would to a largeextent be affected by the Swedish capacity to receivethe forces we planned to send.     The Swedes should,however, be assured that we were taking the matterseriously, and that the assistance would be on a large scale.The War Cabinet agreed:-That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should reply to Telegrams Nos.141 and 142 from Helsingfors in the sense of the above discussion.The War Cabinet had before them a Report bythe Chiefs of Staff on the subject of &quot;Scandinavia -Staff Conversations&quot; (W.P.(40) 70).THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that when considering the question of the Staff conversations which it would be necessary to hold with the Swedesand Norwegians, it had become apparent to the Chiefsof Staff that these would have to be on a very much

broader basis than such conversations usually were;and would have to cover not only military but alsofinancial and economic matters.     For these reasons the Chiefs of Staff recommended that a specialDelegation, headed by a Minister, should be ready toproceed to Scandinavia as soon as might be necessary;and furthermore, in view of the shortage of time, thatthis Delegation should be constituted forthwith to study the various problems involved.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that thearguments in the Report were very convincing.     he asked whether the situation envisaged by the Chiefs ofStaff would not have disturbing repercussions on ourshippingsTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL considered that it would add to our shipping difficulties.In further discussion the view was expressed that it was unlikely that the Norwegians and Swedeswould accept our offer of help;    and that the best hope was that they might gradually be brought round to accept our help.In the circumstances, it was felt that, asthe Chiefs of Staff proposal would involve theDepartments concerned in much work which might eventually prove to be wasted, it would be better to wait for a few days, until the reactions of the Swedesand the Norwegians to our proposals became known.

The War Cabinet(l) Expressed general approval ofthe views in the Chiefs of staff memorandum (W.P..(40)&apos; 70) as tothe scope of the Delegation required(S) Deferred a decision for a few daysas to the appointment of theproposed Delegation.(3) Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to inform the WarCabinet as soon as, in the lightof developments in Scandinavia, he considered, that the time was ripe for the appointment of a delegation on the lines proposed.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,

SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION.Prom;   FINLAND.Decypher.      Mr. Vereker, (Helsingfore).February 25th, 1940.D. 11.03 p.m. February 25th, 1940.R. 12615 a.m. February,26th, 1940.No. 141.MOST SECRET.Deputy   Chief of the General Staffs telegram to Ling of February 20th.2.     On my arrival by air yesterday I was informedthat Minister for Foreign Affairs desired to see me andBrigadier Ling as soon as possible.     I accordinglyarranged that (gr. undec.) see Monsieur Tanner in the evening.     This enabled me to discuss telegram withBrigadier Ling who had already explained proposals to prime Minister and Field Marshal Mannerheim.3w     Mr. Gurney introduced me to Minister for ForeignAffairs after which I had some minutes private conversation which consisted chiefly of an extremely cordial welcome to Finland.4.     Brigadier then joined us and I read out toMonsieur Tanner the proposal in regard to tne Finnishappeal for assistance contained in above-mentioned telegram.5.     Monsieur Tanner replied that Finnish Governmenthad in fact already begun preliminary enquiries at stockholm as to attitude of Swedish Government.     Theresults had not so far been encouraging but he would try and let us know more tomorrow.

6*     Minister for Foreign Affairs then putsome questions to me concerning which he saidFinnish Government would like to have more precise information.     He said that as intervention ofAllied troops on behalf of Finland would automatically place Finland on side of Allies;first, would Allied Governments be prepared to guarantee territorial integrity of Finland andwould Finland&apos;s present frontiers be embodied infinal peace treaty?     Secondly, would financialassistance be granted to Finland for duration of thewar?     I said that I would of course have to referthese questions to Your Lordship.Repeated to Stockholm No. 16,

SPECIAL -DISTRIBUTION.From; FINLAND.Decypher. Mr. Vereker (Helsingfors).25th February, 1940.D.   Midnight 25th February, 1940.R.    1.00 a.m., 26th February, 1940.No. 142.MOST SECRET.Further discussion took place this afternoon,Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs being present.2.     Prime Minister began by asking for strength of proposed Allied contingents, and time it would take (? forthem to arrive).     He was informed that according to allied programme the appeal to Norway and Sweden was fixed for March 5th on the assumption that contingents would beready to move about March 15th and should be in concentra-tion area in Finland mid-April;    their strength would amount to over  0,000 men but very heavily armed:    theywould only (? be, omtd..) in northern sector.3.     Discussion then centred on question as to howtsroops were to be conveyed across Norway and Sweden.Prime Minister read out note just received from swedish government to the effect that latter would continue topermit passage of munitions and &quot;volunteers in small groups&quot;but were not prepared to allow passage of regular armed forces which would in their opinion inevitably enlargearea of conflict and turn Sweden into a battleground.Prime Minister then asked me very earnestly whether itwould not be possible so to frame the proposed appeal to allied Powers, Norway and Sweden for assistance .ns to make

mention of &quot;armed volunteer formations&quot;, ratherthan of regular armed forces, on precedent of spanish (?civil war).     Brigadier and I, speakingpersonally, consider this to be merely a quibble but,if any (? such) camouflage should enable theNorwegian and Swedish Governments to swallow pill inthe eyes of their own people and of the world, we feel it is worth trying.4.     As time is very short, it was decided thatMinister for Foreign Affairs should proceed tonightto Stockholm to inform Swedish Government thatFinnish Government intend to make their appeal ondate mentioned, and on these lines.5.     Minister for Foreign Affairs then asked ifany assurance could be given that extensive military assistance would immediately be forthcoming forSweden in^case Swedish Government agreed to passageof Allied troops and so incurred attack by Germany(grp. undec) both Brigadier and I felt ourselvesnot empowered to give any assurance as to definitescale of assistance without reference to your lordship.   As, however, (? pledge of) such assurancewould definitely strengthen Finnish approach to sweden in the course of next few days I beg thatHis Majesty&apos;s Minister at Stockholm and I may beinformed urgently of views of His Majesty1 sGovernment in this matter.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 142 of25th February;   repeated to Stockholm No. 17.

(40 ) 72), containing vne record of a furtherinterview which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had had, on the morning ofthe 24th February, with the Soviet Ambassador, aboutthe terms put forward by Russia for ending the Finnishwar.     The Memorandum also contained suggestions forthe lines of a telegram to the Finnish Government,which should tell them of the approach by the SovietGovernment.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that theproposed telegram might have to be somewhat modified in the light of more recent information.     Some doubthad been expressed as to whether telegram No. 112 fromHelsingfors had been correctly interpreted, but theproposed reply would not be sent until he had made sureon this point. (See telegram 76 to Helsingfors.)     TheForeign Secretary said that he thought the Finns shouldbe made aware that the Russians had made this demarche *Otherwise, if Russia overran Finland, there would be a danger that the Russians would say that such an eventneed not have happened if the British had made the finns aware of the Russian offer.     He did not think itfair to the Finns or prudent to ourselves to say nothing.

MlGeneral agreement was expressed with theview that we should tell the Finns that- we had had thisdemarche and that we should not communicate theproposed terms to them unless they asked to he informed of them.The War Cabinet:-(a) Authorised the Foreign Secretaryto despatch a telegram to theFinnish Government on the linesof the draft contained in w.P.
