THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEBTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 12 2It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.COPY MO. tffcW.M.  (40) 12th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.WESTERN FRONT.possible german attackon holland and Belgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 11thConclusions,Minute 5. )THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEexplained that the Cabinet had been called to discusslater reports from Belgium (Telegrams Nos. 7 and 9 fromBrussels).     According to these telegrams, the BelgianGovernment anticipated an attack by the German Armyin the near future, and in that contingency looked tous and the French for support.The Minister said that he had had some talkon the telephone with the Prime Minister, who had agreedthat a telegram should be sent to our Ambassador in brussels emphasising the importance of starting staff conversations at the first opportunity.    This had beendone.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that sir Roger Keyes, after seeing the King of the Belgiansin Brussels, had motored to G.H.Q., from where he hadtelephoned to the First Lord a message from the King ofthe Belgians.    This message asked whether the BritishGovernment would agree to the following conditions:-(1) No opening of negotiations for peace withoutparticipation by Belgium.(2) Guarantees for the complete restoration ofBelgium&apos;s political and territorial status and also of her colonies.(3) Help for the economic and financial restoration, . ,of Belgium............

123     jIf these conditions were agreed to, sir roger thought that the King of the Belgians wouldbe able to persuade his Minister to invite Frenchand British troops into Belgium at once.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY added that hehad discussed the foregoing message on the telephonewith the Prime Minister who had strongly disliked thesuggestion that the Belgians should, at this late hour,attach conditions to receiving help from us.     In thePrime Minister&apos;s view, this was not the time for givingguarantees other than those implicit in a military alliance.     He (the First Lord) had instructed sir roger Keyes to take this line with King Leopold,while at the same time expressing to him our very greatsympathy with Belgium in this time of great anxiety,and saying that the most useful step would be toestablish immediate Staff conversations.     He had also told Sir Roger to emphasise that any idea that theFrench would wish to retain any part of Belgian soilat the end of the war - an idea which appeared to he currentin certain Belgian circles - was fantastic.Sir Roger Keyes had asked what advice should begiven to King Leopold as regards publishing documentaryevidence of the impending German attack.The First Lord had pointed out that the questionof publication was a matter for the Belgians, but *that the timing of the publication might be a matterof very great importance.    According to King Leopold,the Germans did not know how much information oftheir plans was in the possession of the Belgians.

The War Cabinet were informed that Sir RogerKeyes was now on his way back to Brussels where he was due to arrive shortly before 3.0 p.m.Information had also been received that the belgians were engaged in removing the harriers betweenBelgium and Prance.THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE ICR FOREIGN   AFFAIRSiSfcgowmed the - War Cabinet of the despatch of a telegram toBrussels, a copy of which is attached to these minutes.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that thepoint which struck him most forcibly in the Belgianapproach was that in return for certain guarantees,which appeared to him more or less implicit inan alliance, the Belgians might he prepared to invitethe Allied Armies to enter their country, before an invasion had taken place.     He thought that this wouldbe to our very great military advantage.     If the Germansattacked and we were successful in reaching the Warve-Namur Line, we should surely consider this an immensevictory.THE CHIEF of THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF most strongly agreed.     No doubt the Germans would attackas soon as they knew that we had gone into Belgium,but with even a few hours&apos;s start, we ought to be ableto reach the Warve-Namur Line first.Discussion then took place whether the       &apos;instructions given to Sir Roger Keyes ought to be such as to give the Belgians every encouragement toissue an invitation which would be so very much to our military advantage.       This was clearly a matter onwhich the Prime Minister should be consulted.

The discussion then turned on whether theFrench Government should he consulted at this stage.It was suggested that they might have strong viewson the question of advancing into Belgium before aGerman invasion, and thus precipitating great battleson the Western front.It was generally felt that two parallelcommunications should be made to the French:-(a) By the Foreign Office, to inform M. Daladierof the questions asked by the King of the belgians through Sir Roger Keyes, and to discover his attitude towards this proposal.(b) By the Chief of the Imperial General staff to General Gamelin, to enquire at whatnotice tbe Allied Army could start itsforward move in the event of a request fromthe Belgians to enter their country.At the request of the War Cabinet the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence telephoned to the Prime Minister,and obtained his permission for the making of these communications to the French forthwith.A further discussion then took place on themilitary implications of acceding to a request by theBelgian Government to enter Belgium in advance of aGerman invasion, - -On the one hand, it was pointed out that, ifthe line Namur-Antwerp could be made good, we should secure the following military advantages:-(a)   The allied line would be shortenedvery considerably.

(b) On account of this shortening of the line,and as a result of a junction with theBelgian Army, our effective strength onthe Western front would be increased byanything up to 40 Divisions.(c) The resistance of the Belgian Array wouldbe greatly strengthened by our presence.(d) We should secure the aerodromes requiredfor the operation of the Royal Air Force,and deny them to the Germans.On the other hand, an advance into Belgiumwould only be advisable provided it could be startedsufficiently early to ensure that the Allied Armycould establish itself on a prepared line, before being subjected to overwhelming air attack.     TheGermans would probably start their advance in the morning, and the Allied Army should therefore, ifpossible,    move during the previous night.     It was for this reason that it was most important to discoverfrom General Gamelin the degree of readiness maintained by the Armies for their advance, and how soon afterthe order was given the troops could be in motion.The effect of the prevailing fog was referred to,and it was argued that the Germans would not begintheir invasion until the weather was clear, as other-wise they would lose the advantage of their air      ,superiority.     Moreover, the Allied Armies wouldbe able to utilise the day as well as the night fortheir advance.

Enquiry was made as to whether any communicationhad been held with the Dutch Government, and theWar Cabinet were informed that, so far, no messageshad been received, and no Staff contacts had beenmade.Consideration was given to the question of whether an approach should now be made to the BelgianGovernment, as a first stage towards setting in motionthe plans, prepared under the direction of the minister without Portfolio, for preventing valuable assets in belgium falling into the hands of the Germans.It was decided to defer this question untilthe next meeting.The War Cabinet(l)   Invited the Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to arrange for a message to be sent to Brussels, instructing sir roger Keyes to inform the King of the belgians that he (Sir Roger) was not yet in a position to answer the questions whichthe King had asked, which were still underconsideration.     Sir Roger should beinformed that there was the possibility that the instructions conveyed to him by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty on the telephoneearlier that morning would be modified.(2)   To invite the Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to inform the FrenchGovernment immediately of the questions putby the King of the Belgians to Sir RogerKeyes, and of the possibility that the BelgianGovernment might invite the French and british armies to advance into Belgium before itwas invaded by Germany;   and to discover theattitude of the French Government towards thisproposal,(5)   To invite the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff to enquire of General Gamelin at what;;.otioe the French and British Armies would beready to start their forward move throughBelgium in the event of a request from the belgians to enter their country.(4)   Decided to meet again that afternoon whenthe reactions of the French Governmenthad been ascertained.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1, ,14th January, 1940.\
