MINUTE 2.Confidential Annex.(23rd February, 1940.)In the course of discussion on thepreceding item, the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that there was one element in thesituation which, although not strictly relevant, theWar Cabinet should have in mind.     If the fear of invasion by Russia was lifted from Norway and sweden, this would leave them menaced only byGermany.     A conversation which the Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had had on the previous evening with the Soviet   Ambassador was there for every relevant, and he proceeded to read a note^ofthis conversation to the War Cabinet.   Briefly,M. Maisky, who said that he was speaking on instructions, had indicated that Russia wanted tomaintain her neutrality, and that she had no ideaof invading Norway or Sweden after the Finnishsituation had been liquidated.     He had givenMr. Butler the terms on which Russia would beprepared to make peace with the Finns.     These wereeven more severe than the offer which had led tothe Finnish war in the first place, but he had saidthat if these terms were not accepted, the war would go on until Finland was defeated.     We should then have lost for ever the goodwill of Russia, but should not have saved Finland, which would be another Abyssinia in our diplomatic history.

The view was generally expressed that itwould he most unwise to have anything to do withthe Russian proposals,,     If we communicated themto the Finns, one of two things might happen.Either we should give an impression that we thought the terms should he accepted, or we should give theimpression that we wished to encourage the Finnsto resist,   in which event they would feel that theyhad a strong moral case for pressing us to give themsufficient help to enable them to   put up an effective resistances     The best way of dealing withthe matter would be to inform M. Maisky that, if his Government wished to get their proposalsconsidered, they should make them direct to the finns;   but that, if the war continued, Anglo-soviet relations would undoubtedly become progressivelyworse.The War Cabinets-Agreed that the Foreign secretary should deal with M. Maisky&apos;sproposals on the above lines.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTSECRET. Copy No,   25[N 2252/G]Viscount Halifax to Mr. Le Rougetel (Moscow).(No. 73.)Sir, Foreign Office, February 22, 1940.THE Soviet Ambassador called to see Mr. Butler this evening at his ownrequest. He said, on entering, that he had not come to talk about thes.s. Selenga. He had more important matters to speak about. Since their lasttalk he had been in communication with his Government and he was now speakingon instructions from them.2. M. Maisky recalled that in their last talk they had run over the various questions which interested the two Governments. In the first place he had authority to speak about the Soviet-German Trade Agreement. This certainlywas an agreement of considerable scope, but it was of a purely economiccharacter. From the Soviet point of view it was hoped to obtain considerable quantities of machinery, machine tools and military equipment. But there wasno intention of entering into a military alliance with Germany. He said that hethought that Mr. Butler might have observed, in studying Soviet statesmen overthe past few months, that they were not simpletons. To make a military alliance with a nation like Germany already at war was a far bigger commitment thanthe Soviet Union would care to undertake. Soviet policy was, in fact, one of neutrality in the world war, as he had told me in September last. The soviet union would not move from this neutrality vis-a-vis the main belligerents, GreatBritain and France, unless they were attacked by either.3. Mr. Butler asked the Ambassador whether this definition of Soviet policyapplied to the Middle and Near East. He said that it certainly did. He didnot anticipate that after their experience in Finland his Government wouldindulge in further foreign adventure. They were, however, fortifying theCaucasus, since they, on their,side, had apprehensions. The arrival of the Anzactroops and the presence in the Near East of a large French army caused themapprehension. Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government had recently given a credit to Iran which caused them to be nervous in that quarter of the world.Mr. Butler replied that no doubt we had both of us reason to be nervous ofthe other.4. Reverting to the north, the Ambassador said that the Russian objectives in Finland had been of a strategic character in order to safeguard the western approaches to Leningrad and the northern portion of the Union. He did notconsider that similar arguments would apply to protecting the southernapproaches to the Union through the Bosphorus. Nor did the Soviet intend to invade Northern Norway or North Sweden. There was no question of theiraiming at occupying Narvik. Mr. Butler asked him whether assurances of this character had been given to Norway and Sweden, and he said that he thought theyhad.5. M. Maisky said that he now came to the most important thing which he wished to tell Mr. Butler. During their previous conversation he had noticed an interest on Mr. Butler&apos;s part as to how the Finnish war would be likely to end.He himself had said on that occasion that the Russian troops would have toproceed to the bitter end. He would now, however, alter his answer as a result ofan exchange of views with his Government. His Government would be ready tomake peace with the Finns on similar terms to those offered before the war broke out. The &quot; military people,&quot; as he described them, insisted, however, on makinga more extended provision for the defence of Leningrad than had previously beensuggested to the Finnish Government. Mr. Butler asked M. Maisky at this stagewhether the Soviet Government would negotiate With the Government at Helsinkiand not with the puppet Government.  His Excellency said that he considered10896   [20872]
that a peace settlement could be arrived at with the Government at Helsinki onthe following terms : (a) Retention by the Soviet of the islands in the Gulf of Finland which they already occupied.ip) The lease of Hango and a few islands round.ic) The retention by the Soviet of the western half of the Rybachi Peninsula.(d) The cession of the whole of the Karelian Isthmus to the Soviet.   Thesouthern frontier of Finland would then run on a line : Vipuri,Sortavala and then curving round the north of Lake Ladoga in theneighbourhood of Kitela to the present frontier of the Soviet Union.This would mean that the whole of Lake Ladoga would be on the side of Russian territory.(e) Soviet troops would retire from Petsamo as some quid jyro quo for the extra territory to be ceded in the Karelian Isthmus.(/) No compensation for the cession of these districts would be offered tothe Finns, and in this respect the terms would be different from thoseoffered before the war.   Compensation was out of the question afterthe great expense and trouble of the war.6. The Ambassador said that in the view of the Soviet military experts,although the Mannerheim Line was not yet destroyed or passed, it was broken.If terms of the type that he had put to Mr. Butler were not accepted now, theWar would have to go on. He was most anxious himself for Great Britain andthe Soviet Union to improve their relations. If terms such as these were accepted,there would be a turning-point. If not, he anticipated that Finland would rankin our diplomatic history with Abyssinia, since, owing to its geographical positionand the difficulty of adequate help being sent there, and the obvious reluctance of Sweden and Norway to send armed forces apart from volunteers, the russians would eventually overrun the country. Then we should have done just enoughto excite Russian animosity for many years without doing enough to save Finland.7. Mr. Butler told the Ambassador that when they had talked togetherpreviously they had neither of them been acting on the instructions of their governments, nor had they been giving official messages to each other on major policy. On this occasion he thought that M. Maisky&apos;s message was too important for him to make any observations without consulting me. The Ambassador saidthat he fully accepted that position and he also accepted the present officialposition of His Majesty&apos;s Government, which was that we should offer help to finland under cover of the League of Nations resolution. He agreed withMr. Butler as to the strength of feeling in this country against the Soviet action and also that it was impossible to say whether the Finns would accept such terms as he had suggested. He would, however, be interested to hear, if possibleto-morrow, what impression his messages had made upon the mind of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.8. Mr. Butler told the Ambassador that he would see that he received somemessage when His Majesty&apos;s Government had had time to consider what the ambassador had told him. It should be added that M. Maisky told Mr. Butlerthat he thought that these suggestions had not been put to any other Government.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.

The full detailsof these steps are set out in the Appendix tothis Annex..,The War Cabinet took note of thestatement by the Chief of the AirStaff and agreed as follows;-(a) T-o accept the recommendation ofthe Chiefs, of Staff, endorsedat the Meeting by the deputy chief of Naval Staff, that the transportation of the personnel for the projected expeditionshould be carried out in smallliners only, to the exclusion of the two 42,000 ton linerswhich had been earmarked under theoriginal plans, (see Paragraph 1of Appendix);   and that thenecessary adjustments to theoriginal plans should be madeaccordingly, particularly witha view to minimising the risks which would be entailed by the consequent overloading of thesmall liners,(b) To take note of Telegram No. 8,dated the 21st February,fromSir H. Kennard (His majesty?ambassador to the Polish government at Angers   objecting to theinclusion of Polish troops in theproposed expedition (see Paragraph3 of Appendix); and to invite theForeign Secretary to inform theFrench that in our view both on political and on military groundsthis part of the project should notbe proceeded with.

MOST SECRET,, APPENDIX. COPY NO. U 5PROGRESS REPORT.WEEK ENDING THURSDAY. 22nd FEBRUARY. 1940.MOVEMENT PROGRAMME.I. . The provisional time-table given to the &quot;WarCabinet last week holds good.Further investigation of the embarkation facilities in the Clyde has disclosed that it will not be possible to load the store ships at this port.     The Clyde will thereforebe used for the embarkation of personnel and M/T only.Storess ammunition and petrol will be embarked in bristol channel ports.     This will involve an increase of two days in the time of passage for these shipss but no increase inthe amount of merchant shipping taken up will be necessary.There will 9 however., be some addition to the naval escortingforces.The above arrangements apply only to the transportation of the main expedition.     The store ships forthe first echelon will load at the Clyde9 and no change inthe programme for the sailing of these convoys will thereforebe necessary.Use of Large Liners for Personnel Shins.Under the original plans two 42s00O-ton liners,the &quot;Empress of Britain&quot; and the &quot;Aquitania&quot;9 were earmarked for personnel in addition to 11 smaller liners.     The Caiefsof Staff are of the opinion that the use of these large ships would be unsound owing to their great vulnerability and theneed of spreading the risk of sinkings as much as possible.The personnel could be transported in the 11 smallerliners which are being taken up if the carrying capacity ofthese smaller ships was increased by about one-third.     Theobjections to this are:-(i) There would not be sufficient boats and raftsto carry the complement in these ships ifthey were sunk by enemy action.(ii) It is desirable for the troops to arrive asfresh as possible9 since they may be subjected to heavy air attack at the port of disembarkation.     Overcrowding of ships is therefore to be avoided if possible.(iii) If ships are loaded to their maximum capacitythere is no safety factor for last-minuteadditions which may be necessary.

The Chiefs of Strff feel that these objections are insufficient to outweigh the risks of the use of the two largeliners, but they understand that the Ministry of Shippingconsider that the deficiency of lifeboats and rafts rulesout the proposal to use tne smaller liners only.     TheMinister of Shipping will no doubt state his objections to theWar Cabinet.It should be added that no additional small linersof the necessary speed are available for the expedition.Only slower ships could be found, which would reduce the speed of the convoy by 3-4 knots.     This would not be acceptable.ADVANCBLISITT OP THE STATE OF READINESS OF &quot;STRATFORD&quot; FORCE.2. As already reported to the War Cabinet the state of readiness of force &quot;Stratford&quot; (Trondhjem, Bergen and Stavanger)has been advanced.     Troops will be ready to move as from theearly hours of the 26th February.     From the date of theCabinet decision it will take 3^-4 days for this force toreach the Norwegian ports any time after the early hours ofthe 26th February.3. CO-ORDINATION OF ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE FRENCH.General Audet, who is to be the senior officerwith the French contingent, has been in London duringthe last week, and has been engaged in detailed discussions with the Service Planning Staff.     As a result of these discussions weJiave now definite information of the composition of the French contingent.     It transpires that the brigade of Chasseurs Alpins is now almost entirely mechanised..It is proposed to ship the French contingent in threeechelons, as follows1st Echelon.4,000 personnel.141 vehicles150 animals3,000 tons of stores.2nd echelon.4,600 personnel450 vehicles (including some tanks).200 animals5,000 tons of stores.3rd echelon.4,500 personnel (mainly Poles),128 vehicles.3,500 tons of stores.The idea of using the Foreign Legion in the firstcontingent has apparently been dropped by the French,     ThePoles are being sent mainly on political grounds, and willnot be fully trained troops..     They will however be ofgreat use as labour.

4.     MOVEMENT OP TH3S 5TH DIVISION FROM FRANCE. 282The War Cabinet may be interested to know that themovement of the 5th Division from France is not due to begin until some days after the first convoys of the expedition have set sail.     There is therefore no questionof these troops being withdrawn from the B.E.F.unnecessarily.5.     General Gamelin?s Proposals for Immediate Assistanceto Finland. &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot;-&quot;-&quot;*&quot; &quot;&quot;*Information has been received from General Audetregarding General Gamelin&apos;s proposals to send a smalltoken force immediately by air for the assistance off inland.     The project has not been worked out in anydetail by the French,    hut   their proposal is to send100-115 men by air to Bergen via England and Scotland.By impressing civil aircraft a further 100 men could besent.     How it is proposed that these men should travel onfrom&apos; Bergen the French do not say, but they realise thatthe project could not be carried through without norwegian and Swedish co-operation, which at present appears hardlylikely.     General Gamelin is not keen on the proposal,because such action might disclose our whole plan premature-, turely. ,The Air Ministry calculate   that by commandeeringevery available largo civil aircraft in the country, itwould only bo possible to transport about 40 men, completewith personal arms equipment and winter clothing, direct to Turku, the nearest Finnish aerodrome.     If the aircraft could refuel in Norway and Sweden about 440 men could becarried.The Chiefs of Staff do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by the despatch of a small forceof this nature, even if it wore feasible.6.      POSSIBLE SCALE OF AIR ATTACK ON TRONDHJEM.The Chiefs of Staff have given further considerationto the question of enemy air attack on Trohdhjem.     In theevent of a German blockade of tho Baltic ports, and of aGerman occupation of southern Sweden, Sweden will have to depend for the majority of their import requirements onTrondhjem and the railways used by the Allied forces insouth Sweden.These requirements havo boon the subject of a detailed examination by the Ministry of Economic Warfare.If the Germans succeeded in reaching the line of the lakesin south Sweden, the greater part of the industry and population of Sweden would lie behind their lines.     Theresponsibility for feeding this part of Sweden would therefore be theirs.     There is insufficient statistical information available to enable an exact calculation ofthe import requirements of the civil population of theremainder of Sweden to be made, but in the opinion of theMinistry of Economic Warfare the civil population might he

90 QCa oi) zl)maintained on imports amounting to 1^2 million tons ayear through the port of Trondhaom.     A lower rate of import might be found adequate in the first few months,during which available stocks could be drawn upon.   Themaintenance tonnage of the Allied  forces, when all havearrived, will be at the rate of about 1 million tonsa year0The Chiefs of Staff arc of the opinion, after taking all the relevant factors into account, that the risks to Trondhjem and its communications may be reason-ably accepted as part of the price wo may have to pay for seizing the ore fields and thus hastening the end ofthe war.7.      AIR DEFENCES OP THE B*.SB POSTS.13 first-line balloons are the most that can bemade available in the first instance for the air defenceof the bases.     It has therefore been decided to concen-trate those at Trondhjem, which will then have anadequate balloon defence.     To spread them betweenTrondhjem and Narvik would mean that neither base hadadequate   protection.9 of the balloons will be moored to trawlers,which will move over with the first convoy. There willbe sufficient time to set up the balloon barrage betweenthe arrival of this convoy and that of the first echelonof the main body. The light anti-aircraft guns will hedisembarked at the same time as the balloons.8.      AERODROMES IN NORTHERN SCANDINAVIA.Investigation has shown that the aerodromes innorthern Scandinavia aro likely to be unusable, owingto the thaw, for about one month, somewhere between themiddle of May and the end of June.     The Swedes are,reported to be trying to arrange for seaplane squadrons to co-operate with their land forces in the event oftheir being involved in hostilities during this period.It is probable that Komi aerodrome (in Finland) will beusable even during the thaw, since it has firm gravelrunways.We reauire the use of Boden aerodrome and to overcome this difficulty, it is proposed to purchaseportable runways consisting of cocoanut matting withan overlay of chain link fencing, such as has been successfully used recently at Wick.     The possibilityof using Fleet Air Arm seaplanes for Army co-operationwork is also being examined by the Admiralty andAir Ministry.

9o    SECURITY ERASURES.The Ihtetf-Service Security Board are acting onthe policy already approved by the War Cabinet.Arrangements are being made for calculated leakagesabroad and indiscretions in the provincial Press in thiscountry referring to the movement of troops to theMiddle East.     Similar arrangements are being made by the commanders-in- Chief in the Middle East.      Wirelesstraffic between the United Kingdom and the Middle East isto be increased for purposes of deception.     Otherdeceptive measures such as preparations for the reception of shipping in the Middle East, are under active consideration.10. PLANNING FOR OPERATIONS IN THS PETSAMO AREA.In accordance with the agreement reached with theFrench at the 5th meeting of the Supreme War Council9 thepossibility of a landing at Petsamo has been further examined.     A full appreciation was drawn up by theBritish Military Representatives on the Allied military committee, which has been approved by the Chiefs of Staff,who instructed that it should now be discussed with theFrench Representatives on the Allied Military Committee.A landing in the Petsamo area presupposes that thecooperation of Sweden has not been obtained.     In thesecircumstances operations to seize the Gaiivare area wouldnot be practicable.     The project must therefore be judged on its merits as a means of supporting the Finnsagainst Russia.     The object of the operation would beto cut the Murmansk railway and subsequently captureMurmansk as a base for further operations.The broad conclusions which emerge from the appreciation are as follows:-(i) A landing on Russian or Finnish territoryis impracticable.(ii) A landing at Kirkenes (an adjacent Norwegianfjord) would be the only practicable meansof getting ashore, but would involve theviolation of Norwegian territory.(iii) Even if a landing was effected, it would notbe possible to capture Murmansk itself in the time available before the Russians at murmansk could be heavily reinforced by sea from Archangel..(iv) The most that could be done would be to clear the Russians out of the Petsamo area andpossibly the Ribaoh^ Peninsula, but this initself would not materially reduce the pressure on the FinnsoThe Chiefs of Staff are therefore of the opinionthat an operation at Petsamo would fulfil no useful object.If the French High Command agree with this, no further action on the proposal will be required.     It is understoodthat General Garaelin is net at all in favour of the project.In the meanwhile the possibility of a landing at Petsamo isnot being taken into account in our preparations for the major project,
