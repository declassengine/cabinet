THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.- MOST secret copy Mo. /,ASSISTANCETO FINLAND,I (previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions ,Minute 5.)W.M.. (40) 48th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.(2lst February, 1940.)THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF,introducing the Report by the Chiefs of staff committee on the Time Factor for Force &quot;Stratford&quot;(W.P.(40 ) 63), explained that it was desirable forthe troops to arrive in the Norwegian ports before11.0 in the morning in order that they might bedisembarked the same day.   They would have to sailfrom the United Kingdom early in the morning on theprevious day.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF referred to a-statement by the Prime Minister recorded in the Minutes of theMeeting of the War Cabinet on the 3rd January(W.M.(40) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 1, confidential annex, page 8), in which the Prime Minister had saidthat he concluded that we should be able to forestallthe Germans in the occupation of the Western ports of Norway.   In point of fact, it was by no means certain that the Germans  could not forestall us atStavanger.   It would be necessary for us to obtainthe prior agreement of the Norwegians to enter thisport, and if negotiations to this end were set in motion, knowledge of them might come to the Germans.In this event the Germans could land an air-borneforce in Stavanger before we could reach it.   Theyhad considerable numbers of parachute troops in North

Germany, and many civil aircraft which, could be usedfor the transport of troops.   A German force landed in this way would have to be maintained by air unless they had the use of the port of christians and and therailway running thence to Stavanger.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF expressedthe view that this would be a very hazardous operation for the Germans to undertake.   Stavanger was a town ofsome 40,000 inhabitants, many of whom were trained asvolunteers.   Even very small forces could successfullyresist an air-borne invasion of this nature.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat the Finnish Minister, when referring to suppliesof war material which were being sent from Germany,through Norwegian waters, to Russian forces in theNorth, had suggested that mines might be laid outsidePetsa.mo, and had said that there was a Finnish naval officer at present in London who knew all about thelocal conditions.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that atelegram had just been received by the Admiralty inregard to further munition ships passing up theNorwegian coast on the way to Petsamo or Murmansk.He would gladly arrange for an examination of thepossibility of laying a minefield outside Petsamo.The War Cabinet  (1) Took note of the Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Committee (w.p .(40) 63):(2) Took note that the First Lord of theAdmiralty would examine the possibilityof laying a minefield outside Petsamo.. . .iohmond Terrace, S*W.l.
