Uo) &apos;iei^&apos;mii^!^Qm*:.umjT^rip^&apos;Confidential AiaaexV9-3CANDINAVIA.(previous reference:W,M,(40)l6thConclusions,Minute 9).Pench views.Policyjin scandinavia and Finland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS Saidthat he had seen the Swedish and Norwegian Ministers onthe previous day in accordance with the Conclusions of theWar Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin.   Theformer had expressed himself as personally in complete agreement with the arguments put to him, and wouldtelegraph for permission to pay a visit to Stockholm inorder to put his views  before hisGovernment.    The Norwegian Minister had not reacted toobadly to the suggestion that the Norwegian Governmentshould themselves lay a minefield in their territorial waters.    But he did not delude himself into believing thatthe Norwegian Government were likely to accept thissuggestion.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL observed that, according toa report in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; of the 18th January,the Swedes had recently concluded an agreement with Germanyto ship Ant more iron ore to them in the future than theyhad ever done in the past.    If this were true, it disclosed^a very different situation from that which had been represented by Mi Wallenberg,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had had an interview with the French Ambassadorthe previous day, from which it appeared that the French were much concerned that we had done nothing to stop the Narviktraffic.    It would probably be necessary to hold a meeting

Capture of theNorthern OreFields in the face of Scandinavian-scandinavian Opposi-tion.Authorityrequired for detailed plans and Prepara^-tions oShippingProblem.of the Supreme War Council in the near future todiscuss the whole question of our policy in scandinavia and Finland.The War Cabinet then turned to consideration ofa Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the practicability of the capture of the northern ore fields in the face of Scandinavian opposition (W.P.(40) 24).THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that the Chiefs ofStaff were of opinion that it would be possible, thoughprobably difficult, to land a force at Narvik in the face of opposition, and ultimately even to breakthrough Norwegian and Swedish opposition on the route to Galivare.   But this could not be done in time to forestall the Germans in the ore fields during thecoming Spring.   As a practical proposition, therefore,the whole operation must be ruled out.The War Cabinet next considered a Report by theChiefs of Staff on the instructions and authority which the Service Departments required to enabledetailed plans and preparations to be made for variousoperations in Scandinavia which were under considera-tion (W.P.(40) S3) .THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF explained that the threeoperations in northern Scandinavia, southern norway and southern Sweden were all closely inter-connected,and thai the Chiefs of Staff had therefore dealt withthem in one comprehensive papere     He emphasised thelarge commitment which would be involved in theprovision of the necessary shipping.   At the presenttime we had no personnel ships immediately availableto convey the forces required for any of the operations.Those used for the British Expeditionary Force inFrance v;ere not suitable, o&apos;v7ing to the length of the voyage and the adverse weather conditions which mustbe expected.

The shipping required for the initialNarvik force of two brigades would not be very large,--but it would increase as the size of the force grewfrom two brigades to two divisions.     The shippingrequired for despatch of a force to the ports in southern Norway was also not very much;   only fivebattalions and ancillary troops would require to be transported.     The force for south Sweden, however,would be a very much larger commitment.     Some 80,000men and 10,000 M.T. vehicles would have to be shipped.If a single base at Trondheim only were used, 12liners for personnel, 38 M.T. ships, 6 store ships,3 petrol ships and 3 ammunition ships would be needed, and it would take 60 days to put the forceashore.    By using Namsos, a port about 100 miles north of Trondheim, as a subsidiary base, it would bepossible to reduce the time to 30 days, but theamount of shipping required would be almost double.The net loss of carrying capacity involved in taking up this amount of shipping would be about 3W,000dead weight tons.The Chiefs of Staff had worked on theassumption that the forces would be sent in April,and if this was to be done a decision would be requiredvery soon.     Liners at present earmarked for thetransport of the Australian Expeditionary Force wouldhave to be used, their places being taken by largerships such as the QUEEN MARY and the MAURETANIA.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff explained that the initial force proposed for. southern

Sweden amounted to 2 divisions, i.e. some 24,000fighting men. The remainder of the 80,000 were required for the base and lines of communication.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY observedthat it was of some comfort to see from these figuresthe very large commitment which the Germans would assume if they undertook the invasion of southern sweden.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed outthat the Chiefs of Staff had only been asked to statewhat instructions and authority the Service Depart-ments would require to enable detailed plans and preparations to be made.     The last paragraph oftheir Report, however, asked for immediate authorityfor taking certain steps.     This seemed to be somewhat premature, since the whole conception of operations in Scandinavia was based on the assumptionthat we should have the co-operation of the -Scandinavian countries, which in fact we had not yetobtained.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF agreed that the wording of the last paragraph was misleading, but pointed out that if the forces were to be ready toact in April, certain decisions would be required inthe immediate future.     For example, a decision toretain the 44th and 42nd Divisions from the III Corpswould.have to be taken by the 2nd February.     The&apos;taking up of shipping, however, might be deferred until a little later..&apos;THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether it wouldmake any difference to our preparations if the three

operations were undertaken simultaneously or at different timesj     For example, assuming that we hadthe full co-opei*ation of Sweden, would the Gaiivareforde he heeded at all?THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that if we put in a force at Narvik to hold the Gaiivare fieldsit was at least possible that the Germans woul$ invadesouthern Scandinavia.     We should have to be ready,simultaneously with, or even a little before, thedespatch of the Narvik force to obtain control of the ports in southern Norway.     We should also have to bein a position to offer immediate assistance to Swedenin the south.     Even if we had the full co-operationof Sweden, we should have to send a force to theGaiivare area to protect it against the possibility ofa Russian attack or a German landing at Lulea.     Wecould not depend on the Swedes doing this for them-selves without our assistance.It was generally agreed that all threeforces must be ready to move simultaneously, and thatpreparations should be made accordingly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR emphasised that the greatest danger from Germany in south Swedenwas probably that of air attack.     The assistance which we could give, however, against this form of attack was very limited.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was necessaryto make full preparations for sending forces to scandinavia, but that their chief value might well beas a bargaining counter with the Swedes.     He was anxious not to divert tod much effort and money to thepreparation of forces which might not be used after all.Subject to this consideration,   however* we shouldadvance our plans and preparations as -far as possible.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF pointedout that the Narvik force to seize the Galivare fieldswould have to operate under winter conditions, since itmust arrive in the area before the ice broke in the BalticOtherwise the Germans might forestall it by a sea-borneexpedition to Lulea.   A good deal of special equipment&quot;THE MINISTER WITHQUT^PORTFOI^the Army and Air Forces proposed were considered bytho Chiefs of Staff to be adequate, in conjunctionwith the available Swedish forces, to defend Swedenagainst an attack by Germany and Russia.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFreplied that an Appreciation of the numbers for thatpurpose could not be given without conversations with the Swedish General Staff.&quot;It seemed very doubtful&quot;&apos;&quot;^ we should ever gex ouairConversations with Sweden..There was some discussion about the arrangementsbefore the holding of the meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil at which plans for action in Scandinavia would bediscussed..    The following were the principal points which emerged s.-(j\ It was open to question whether the French realisedfully that operations on a large scale in Scandinavianext May would involve a considerable diversion of.  our effort from France.    If the 44th and 42ndDivisions, which were now earmarked for France, werenot retained in England, it would be difficult tofind the necessary troops for Scandinavia.-(ii) General Gamelin had himself informed the Chief of theImperial General Staff that he was prepared toprovide one brigade of Chasseurs Alpins for the ,Narvik expedition.(iii) It would be preferable that operations in Scandinaviashould be primarily a British responsibility.&apos;Administrative difficulties would be increased iflarge numbers of French troops were sent as wellas British.(iv) It might be possible to obtain some of the shipping .required from the French, who might also be askedto make some contribution towards the cost.(v) It would be necessary to work Out our plans in greater detail, and to be clear as to the full implications of a Scandinavian campaign before discussing with theFrench the question of the division of responsibility between the Alliesi

(40)  18th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 11.Confidential Annex.FINLAND.operations by the PolishNavy.In the course of the discussion on Item 10THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatthe French Ambassador had referred to the possibilityof naval operations in support of Finland in theneighbourhood of Petsamo.   The French were notprepared to go to war with Russia at present, but . Corbin had suggested that Polish naval forces might be used, perhaps assisted by French warships,suitably disguised and acting at night.   The three destroyers and two submarines, which constituted thewhole of the Polish Navy at present, were attachedto the British Navy, but there was no reason, fromthe political point of view, why they should not operate as an independent Navy in support of Finland.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF said that one of our submarines which had recently returned from the area in question had reported considerable activity at murmansk and Petsamo.   The Russians had no naval forces of any size there, and there would be no       &apos; &apos;technical reasons why the Polish forces should noteffect considerable damage to Russian shippingsThe difficulty, however, would be fchat they would be working from British bases .
