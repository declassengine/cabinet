(40) 43rd CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.(16th February, 1940).THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF reported to the WarCabinet the progress which had been made up to date inthe preparations for the proposed expedition to scandinavia.    As, soon as the War Cabinet had authorised the Service Departments to go ahead with full preparations,an Inter-Service Planning Staff had been set up.    A dailymeeting was held in the War Office to discuss with executive authorities in the various Ministries thedetails of plans and preparations, thus ensuring close and continuous co-ordination.    This Staff worked on thebasis of a directive which had been drawn up by theChiefs of Staff (0.0.8.  (40) 238 (S)),Working in close collaboration with thisInter-Service Staff there was an Inter-Service SecurityBoard co-ordinating all arrangements for ensuring secrecy.This was composed of officers from the intelligence staffs of the three Services, and a representative of M.1.5.    Itkept in close touch with the Foreign Office and theS.I.S.    The Middle East was being used as cover forthe expedition^.An Inter-Service Signal Board had also been set up, which co-ordinated all signal arrangements.

Basis of The basis of planning was to disembark the planning.forces in Scandinavia at the maximum ,possible rate atwhich they could be absorbed by the transportationfacilities in the country     Three separate groups had tobe catered for, namely;-(i) The force for Galivare and Finland.(ii) The force to secure the ports in SouthernNorwayo(iii) The force to co-operate with the Swedes in southern Sweden,,Limiting The principal factor which limited the ratefactors inthe despatch of disembarkation was the capacity of the transportationof troops.facilities in Scandinavia.    It was calculated that thegreatest daily intake which these facilities permittedwas about 1500 troops with the ammunition,  stores, supplies and petrol which had to accompany them.o    The principalbase port would be Trondheim, but from this port therewas only one single line railway running to the eastward,which at the present only took about six trains a day eachway.    It might be possible to increase &quot;this number to twelve trains a day each way, but this could only bedetermined after detailed discussions with the Swedes.    Ifthe Baltic ports were blockaded by the Germans, Swedenwould have to depend to a very large extent onthis lineof communication for the imports required for her ownpopulation.    These requirements would probably use threetrains a day each way.    It must also be remembered that a heavy scale of air attack might be launched againstTrondheim,    The Chief of the Air Staff thought that such attacks would almost certainly materialise0

Movements,, A movement plan had he en drawn upbased on the fullest use of the port facilities in Norway and the employment of 15 liners, 24MoT ships and 18 store ships.        The port ofembarkation would be the Clyde, but the warshipswhich would carry the troops to secure thesouthern Norwegian ports would sail from Rosyth,The earliest da-te on which the first troops coulddisembark in Norway was the 20th March and, to achieve this, the process of loading store ships would have to begin on the 1st M?.rch.    Storestook considerably longer to load than personnel.The store ships would sail in advance of the personnel ships, which would leave about three days after them.    It would thus be possible for thetroops   to remain in their peace stations untilthe actual decision to despatch troops had beengiven.Time factor;, If the troops ?/ere to arrive in Norwayon the 20th March,  the decision to despatch them would have to be given by the War Cab:net on the11th March,    There was, however, a later limitingdate for this decision.    If we were to give any useful assistance to the Finns when the thawcame about 20th April,   our.troops would have tobe landed by about the 3rd April,    Nine dayshad to be allowed between the Cabinet decision todispatch troops and the arrival of the troops9If, therefore, they were to arrive by the 3rd april the   decision would have to be reached by the25th March,    It was true that the present was an
c:(
exceptionally hard winter, but this did notnecessarily mean that the thaw in Finland wouldbe much delayed beyond the normal date.    The dateof the thaw was determined mainly by the depth ofsnow.    The break-up of the ice in the Baltic, onthe other hand, was likely to be later this year,even if the warmer weather set in quite early,since the depth of ice would be greater than usual, owing to the hardness of the winter.From these considerations it would beseen that there was only about fourteen dayslatitude in the date on which the decision ofthe War Cabinet to despatch the expedition wouldhave to be made,THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERALSTAFF, in answer to a question by the PrimeMinister,said that the thaw would not impedemovement   to any serious extent under peace conditions, - but would prevent any active operations0Our -troops could therefore move up into positionduring the thaw, provided that their movementwas not opposed.Considerable discussion followed as tothe implications of the time factor,,    Thefollowing were the principal points which emerged:-(i)   It might take some time to induce the Finns to accept directintervention on the part of the Allies0They would realise that such anacceptance would probably involveadding Germany to their enemies,,

(ii) If the Russian attacks on the MannerheimLine seemed likely to succeed, the Finnsmight be driven to make a broadcast appeal for assistance quite soon   even withinthe next few days.   On the other hand,they might well be able to hold up theRussian attacks.   The Russians wouldhave to penetrate a very considerable distance beyond their present line before they could obtain room.to manoeuvre betweenLake Ladoga and the sea.    It would not be practicable for the Germans to take the&apos;Finns in the rear by a sea-borne expeditiontill the ice broke in the Gulf of Bothnia.They could, not move any considerable forceover the ice, which was very rough,(iii)  If the Finns succeeded in holding upthe Russians on the Mannerheim Line,the Swedes would probably be reassured,and there would be little chance of theiracceding to our domands for passage.   at best there would probably be a considerable time spent in argument with them on thispoint, after the Finns made a broadcastappeal for help,(iv) It would be necessary for us, if we were tohave any chance of inducing the Swedes toallow our troops to enter Scandinavia, tobe able to reassure them as to the extentof the support which we could give them.This could only be done if we were able tohold staff conversations with them.(v) It was suggested that on this account itwould be desirable to try to induce the swedes to open staff conversationsimmediately.    On the other hand, it was argued that if we did this, the Swedes would immediately put pressure on Finland not to appeal to the World for assistance.    Theymight offer to send considerable forcesof their own instead.    They would back up this argument by pointing out to the Finnsthat the extent of the assistance which wewere sending was very small.    The Swedeswould also say that our help to Finland wasonly being sent as a cover for our realintention of gaining control of theSwedish ore fields.    The probable Swedishattitude was well set out in the record ofthe conversation between the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Swedish minister in London (See Despatch of 10th February,1940, No.66 to Stockholm).(vl)   In view of these difficulties,  it wassuggested that it would be better to make our demand for passage almost immediatelyafter the Finns issued their appeal for help,I and to have the expedition ready to jumpin to Scandinavia immediately after thisdemands    It was pointed out, on the otherhand, that such action would be represented to the World by our enemies in a most unfavour-able light.

DetailedTime Table,Scale of equipment-of theForceSo(vii) In any event, in order that; we should be ina position to say to the Swedes that we were,immediately ready to come to their assistance,all preparations should go forward on theprogramme which had been worked out andloading operations should begin on the 1stMarch.(viii) The political and military factors were so closely inter-dependent, that it would bedesirable for the whole question of the time factor to be closely examined by the Chiefsof Staff and the Foreign Office inconsultation.(ix) It was clearly hecessary that we shouldconcert our diplomatic action very carefullywith the French and should agree beforehandwith them as to the steps to be taken underthe various conditions which might arise,such as a premature issue of a broadcastappeal by the Finns.THE FIRST SEA LORD then explained that atime table had been drawn up to cover the whole move-ment.     Taking the day on which the War Cabinet gave theorder to despatch troops as Dl, the leading troops would arrive in Norway on D9.     These would consist of:-2,000 troops and 2 store-ships for Narvik.1,400 troops embarked on 2 cruisers foreach of Bergen and Stavangerj    and1 Battalion with advanced parties forthe Southern Sweden expedition, in2 liners for Trondheim..The remainder of the troops would arrive in a seriesof echelons - the whole movement being complete byD76*     One fast and one slow convoy would sail everyfive days.      The total move involved   100,000 troops and 11,000 vehicles.Discussion took place upon the number of vehicles which would accompany the expedition.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thoughtthat the number of vehicles proposed was very high,,and was not consistent with the proposal to send an

expedition equipped on a light scale.    It appeared that, for every two trains filled with menthere would he four trains filled with stores; andthat the vehicles would choke the roadse    If theGermans landed a force in Southern Sweden equipped with vehicles on this scale, it would make very little progress.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that the scale of vehicles to accompany the army had been cut down to a minimum.,    Included in thetotal of the vehicles, was every gun, every ammunitionlimber, every trailer, and every motor-bicycle..    TheFrench brigade of Chasseurs Alpins, which would bethe spearhead of the troops entering Finland, andwhich would number about 7,500, had 1,100 mules, 40carts, and 300 mechanical vehicles, and even thenwould be relying on us entirely for all transport for maintenance      There was no justification for the suggestion that the British Army was equipped with vehicles on too high a scale.    As regardsmaintenance, Divisions now in France required 700tons a day.    If active operations were in progress,they would require 1,000 tons a.day0    Maintenance forthe Scandinavian expedition had been calculated at500 tons per day, and the third-line transport, whichnormally carried supplies and ammunition from railheadto Divisional areas, had been almost entirely cut out.

A German expedition into Sweden would notbe equipped on a smaller scale than ours;   nor was its progress likely to be as fast as ours.      They wouldhave to be prepared for action against the Swedesimmediately after landing, and they were unaccustomedto operations of this kind.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that, in anycase, the Germans might not invade Sweden, as,provided there was no interference with their iron ore supplies, it would be greatly to their advantage to keep Sweden Out of the war.     They would be muehmore likely, he thought, to attempt to seize theSouthern Norwegian ports, including Oslo, so that theywould be a position to develop attack, both on anybases we might have established further north, andalso to extend operations over the North Sea.Move of THE FIRST SEA LORD then gave the War Cabinettroops from France. the details of the plans for moving the 5th division and the Chasseurs Alpins from France.     The personnel of the former would be brought by train across England,and embarked at the Clyde.    It might be possible fortheir equipment to be found from resources in GreatBritain, so as to avoid having to bring it by sea from france, and this was being further examined.The French troops with the British SkiTroops, which were to train with them, would move direct from French ports, and rendezvous with British convoysleaving the United Kingdom.

Naval Thirty-six Destroyers would &quot;be required forarrangements.escort duty, and arrangements were being made for anti-submarine defences at Norwegian base ports.     an aircraft carrier would also be used to enable theGladiators and Lysanders of the air component to beAir flown off to aerodromes in Scandinavia at the earliestarrangements,possible moment. The Blenheims would fly direct fromthis country, and it was hoped to provide balloons forTrondheim.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO expressedanxiety at the small size of the air component, andat the fact that the aircraft of which it would be composed were not all of the most modern types* The scale of air attack on Sweden would probably be very heavy,not only from Germany, but also from Finland, if russia succeeded in overrunning that country.     he felt that, unless we were in a position to reinforceour air forces in Scandinavia very rapidly, the Swedeswould not consider that our assistance was worthhaving, and would do all they could to keep us out.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that theChiefs of Staff were concerned with the air aspect ofthe Southern expedition.   The Germans had 1,300 heavy bombers, with sufficient range to engage Trondheim.-The Forces we could send to oppose them were limited by the aerodromes available in Scandinavia.     Forexample, at Trondheim there was only one small aerodrome,and at other places modern fighters could not be operated.

Prom our own point of view, provided we gotin on the Northern line, and seized the ore fields, wewere prepared to pay the heavy price which might heexacted in Southern Sweden;    and it was for this reason that the Chiefs of Staff had been prepared to recommend the sending of the maximum possible force to help the swedes, even in the face of the air attack which wouldprobably develop.Reference was made to the suggestion whichhad been made by the Chiefs of Staff in their originalappreciation, that, with the object of providing a deterrent against attack on Scandinavian cities, we might make a public declaration that any such attack would be regarded by us in the same light as an attackon our own cities?This was a matter which would have to be fully discussed by the War Cabinet, and with theFrench.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe method of retaliation against river transport whichhe was evolving would be ready for application by themiddle of March, and would not be open to the sameobjections as an attack on a thickly populated districtlike the Ruhr.     This also was a matter on which adecision would have to be taken, but he knew that theFrench were in favour of the project.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said he would like to hear more fully what the FirstLord&apos;s project involved, and suggested that the FirstLord might put his proposals before the War Cabinet.

The War Cabinet:-(1) Took note of -(a) The oral report hy the first sea Lord on the progress of preparation for intervention in scandinavia and Finland;(b) The Reports by the Chiefs ofStaff on the employment of Alliedland forces in Scandinavia and finland (W.P.(40) 51) and theprotection of Oslo aerainst air attack (W.P.(40) 55):(2) Invited the Foreign Office and theChiefs of Staff to examine, inconsultation, the inter-relation of diplomatic and military action, andto report thereon to the War cabinet as early as possible;(3) Agreed that it would be necessary toobtain the prior concurrence of theFrench to any diplomatic action thatit might be decided to take vis-a-visNorway, Sweden or Finland, after consideration of the Report referredto in (2);(4) In view of the fact that the situation might develop rapidly, invited theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs to take preliminary soundings of theFrench Ambassador as to the Frenchviews of the steps to be taken inthe various situations which might arise as the position developed;(5) Agreed that any decisions which theWar Cabinet might reach as to anannouncement that we should regardair attacks on Scandinavia in thesame light as an attack on our owncities    would need to be agreed withthe French Government;(6) Took note, with reference to thepreceding Conclusion, that the FirstLord of the Admiralty would take anearly opportunity to describe to theWar Cabinet his proposals for actionagainst German river traffic.Richmond Terrace,.S*W*1.
