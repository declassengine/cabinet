&apos;    THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 269It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.SCANDINAVIA.Stoppage oftraffic in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W. 11.(40)45thConclusions,minute 3. )W.M.COPY NO. (Cj(40) 46th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 9.Confidential Annex.(19th February, 1940).THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY referred tothe question of the stoppage of traffic in norwegian territorial waters hy the laying of a minefield, whichhad &quot;been under consideration by the War Cabinet attheir previous meeting (W.P.(40)60).   He realised thatthe War Cabinet had wished to defer a decision on thispoint for a few days, but he was anxious that theyshould meantime give him authority to make allpreparations.    It would be five days before the ships could be assembled, the stores prepared, and everythingmade ready to sail.    No opportunity so good as thepresent one might recur.Norway, by her action over the ALTMARK, had given us good grounds for pointing out that we werenot prepared to run the risk of similar events inthe future.    Norwegian territorial waters were being used by the Germans to obtain supplies, to forwardmunitions to Russia, and for the passage of warships.The whole responsibility for stopping this action restedupon a small Power,, which-had shown itself unable to resist threats.    By laying a minefield, we should forcetraffic into the open sea, and thus relieve the norwegians of their heavy responsibility.    Our action would no doubt lead to a protest by Norway, but they

could plead that they had not the resources to sweepup the mines, and might even suggest to the Germansthat they should come and sweep them themselves - which,of course, they would be unable to do.The First Lord thought that, by laying aminefield, we should not prejudice the larger operation which was being planned.    On the contrary, we mightsucceed in provoking Germany into an imprudent actionwhich would open the door for us.    It was essentialto link our action with the ALTMARK incident, and notto allow time to elapse in hesitation and argument.If preparations were begun now, the War Cabinet wouldhave, at the least, five days before a decision need be made, and no great inconvenience would be caused ifthe operation were put off from day to day thereafter.It would be necessary to give notice of our intentionto lay a minefield, but he would not favour a diplomaticargument with the Norwegians on the subject.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had not had time to study the question, andalthough there was much to be said for the proposed stepit was most important that the right method should beadopted in carrying it out.    He was only prepared toagree to preparations being started if it were fully understood that, in doing so, he was not giving any measure of consent to the proposal.In the discussion which ensued, it was urgedthat we should not lose the opportunity which theALTMARK incident afforded, and that, in consequence,we should be ready to act.

It was pointed out that the Foreign Office wereawaiting a reply to their protest to the norwegian government at their action towards the ALTMARK, andthat this reply might give the opening we desired.For example, we might say that as Norway was unable to perform her duties as a neutral, it was necessaryfor us to take this action.It was generally felt that, although theeffect of laying a minefield, as suggested, might beunfavourable for our chances of getting in to helpFinland and seizing the orefields, those chances were likely in any case to depend upon Germany taking some action which afforded us an opening,,    Everything pointed to a quickening of the tempo of events in Finland and scandinavia, and this opening might come through animmediate German reaction to the laying of the minefield.It would therefore be desirable for the small forcesdesigned for the occupation of Stavanger, Bergen andTrojadheime to be ready to move when the. minefield was laid.It would be im pcgs&amp;unt to k no won what date these forces could be ready.It was suggested that these forces mightsuffer severely from air attack.    the CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF, however, said that they wouldbe quite capable of looking after themselves after they were landed, and could not be dislodged by german air action.It was also pointed out that if Germanybombed Norwegian towns, this would stiffen the scandinavian attitude, and might open the way for usin the North.

The War cabinet authorised the   First Lord of theAdmiralty to make all preparations,so that, if it were subsequentlydecided to lay a minefield in norwegian territorial waters, therewould be no delay in carrying out theoperation.
