COPY NO.      / jW.M.(40) 13TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.WESTERN FRONT. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the War Cabinet of possible *he events which had taken place since their meetingGerman attackon Holland that morning,and Belgium,(a)   Sir Alexander Cadogan had visited the French(previous reference:       Embassy, and had communicated to the French AmbassadorW.M. (40) 12 th conclusions, &quot;the message received from King Leopold through Sir RogerMinute l).Keyes.     He had told him that a temporizing reply hadbeen sent through the same channel, and invited him toinform M. Daladier immediately of what had occurred, amdto ask for his reactions as early as possible.     A repl,yfrom the French Government had been received, which was as follows:-(i)   they agreed that we could give the assurances asked for, and(ii)   that if King Leopold would invite ourarmies to enter Belgium, that would beof great military advantage.     But in orderto have the full benefit of that advantage,we must be ready to move immediately the      1King issued his invitation.Pending a decision by His Majesty !s Government,the French Government, who had received no suggestionfrom Brussels about these assurances, or the invitation to enter Belgium, would make no move,

(b)   As mentioned above, a message had heen sentto Siff JRoger Keyes asking him to tell King Leopold thatthe matter was under consideration, and that a reply wouldhe sent as soon as possible.(e)   A telegram had been received from The Hague(No.8 of 14th January, 1940), the gist of which was asfollows:-The Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs,in an interview with Sir N. Bland, said that,although he thought something might be brewing,he had nothing to show what it was.   Suchindications as were available pointed rather to next Wednesday than to to-day.   Certainextra defensive precautions were being taken in holland.The Minister for Foreign Affairs wasoutwardly completely calm, and thought thatthe invasion of Holland would be an act ofsuch folly that even the Germans wouldhesitate to embark upon it.   From the military point of view, he thought that the presentmoment was particularly unfavourable, as the break-up of thick ice on the rivers made pontoonbuilding impossible.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF informed the War Cabinet that he had been unable to speak toGeneral Gamelin on the telephone, but had spoken toLord Gort and General Howard Vyse.The Allied troops were at four hours&apos; notice,i.a. their advance could start four hours after the receiptof the order.The French agreed as to the advantages to be gained from getting a start over the Germans.   they proposed to move by night, or in fog, to avoid the dangerof heavy air attack on marching columns.In reply to the Prime Minister, the Chief ofthe imperial General Staff said that he had asked general gamelin by telegram whether he thought that the advantage

to &quot;be gained &quot;by reaching the forward line in Belgium atthe invitation of the Belgians outweighed the disadvantages of precipitating a great battle, which might otherwise be altogether avoided.     No answer had yet been received to this question.     There was no doubt, however, in the minds of either the French or ourselves^ as to the great advantages to be gained by fighting on the line Namur-Antwerp.Some discussion ensued as to the method bywhich the advance would be carried out, and the relativeadvantages of securing the forward line, or of remaining in the present position, and thus avoiding the risk ofan encounter battle.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the forward motorised troops of the Allied Armiescould reach the line Namur-Antwerp in about six hours.The occupation of this line should be complete in forty-eight hours.     Twelve hours start over the germans should allow us to be in sufficient strength on theline to he certain of holding it.The Germans would of course find out immediatelythat a move had started, but they might have difficultyin arranging for their own attack to start earlier than it had been planned.Discussion then turned on whether the BelgianGovernment would be induced to invite Allied troops into Belgium by guarantees of the kind asked for by theKing.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed the view, with whichthere was general agreement, that nothing short of direperil would convince the Belgian Government of the wisdom of inviting us into their country;   and even then theywould only do so if they were quite certain that aGerman attack was about to take place.-3-

The Prime Minister then read to the War Cabinetthe draft of the reply which he proposed to send to theKing of the Belgians through Sir Roger Keyes.In discussion of the terms of the draft, thefollowing points were made:-(a) It should he made clear in the reply that the French shared in anyguarantees or assurances given.(b) It should be emphasised that thestipulations made hy the King of the belgians could only he accepted provided the invitation came at once.A number of alterations to the draft to meet these points were agreed upon.    A copy of the reply inits final form is annexed to these Minutes.It was agreed that a copy of the telegram Shouldbe sent to the French with a message to the effect thatit was assumed that they would give similar assurancesto the Belgians.Discussion also took place as to the accident t*the German aeroplane containing the two Staff Officers,who had had possession of the papers describing theGerman plan of invasion of Belgium.     There was generalagreement with the view that there were a number ofsuspicious circumstances attending the whole affair, forwhich a variety of explanations could be advanced.

THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO suggested thatit would he undesirable to make any mention to the Belgians,at the present moment, of the demolition plans.   We had been informed on the previous day hy a Belgian who had come over hy aeroplane, of an indirect channel ofcommunication with the Belgian Minister of Transportthrough the British Military Attache in Brussels.    this might prove a suitable channel for communication on the demolition scheme at a later stage,THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the demolitionscheme should not be mentioned for the present.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFemphasised the importance of ensuring that no action wastaken to put the Belgian demolition scheme into effectonce the Allies had advanced to the Wavre-Namur Line,although it might still be desirable to carry out theDutch demolition scheme and the occupation of Walcheren^THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY informed theWar Cabinet that the naval arrangements in connection withthe Walcheren scheme could be started at two hours1 notice.The position of Holland was referred to.    It waspointed out that we had given a guarantee to Belgium, butnot to Holland, and that there was almost certainly some arrangement between Holland and Belgium as the result ofthe meeting between Queen Wilhelmina and King Leopold.Further, in the telegram sent to Brussels that morningwe had stated that we presumed that the Belgian Governmentwere in touch with the Netherlands Government, whom wehad not yet approached.    It was decided to take no actionin regard to Holland.

The War Cabinet :-(l) Authorised the despatch to Brussels,for communication by Sir Roger Keyesto King Leopold, of a reply to theKing&apos;s questions, in the form annexed to these Minutes; and agreed that a copyshould be given to the French Government.(2) Agreed that no action should be taken for the present in regard to thescheme for preventing valuable assets in Belgium falling into the handsof the Germans.6 Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,14th January, 1940.

APPENDIX.REPLY TO BE GIVEN BY STT? BOPtTCT? KEYJSTO THE KING OP. THE BELGIANS.We are ready to accept invitation to Britishtroops to enter Belgium and understand French attitude is the same.We are asked to give guarantees to Belgiumwhich go further than anything we have promised toFrance and which we might not he in a position to carryout at the end of the war.Subject to the above we are ready to promiseas follows if such an invitation were given at once -(l)   If Belgium thereupon becomes involved withthe Allies in hostilities against Germany we will not open peace negotiations withoutinforming Belgium and we should expect themto do the same with us.(2)   We will do our utmost to maintain the politicaland territorial integrity of Belgium and her colonies.(3)   If after the war Belgium is in need offinancial and economic assistance, we will include her in any assistance we may beable in conjunction with our Allies to renderin these respects.The King will realise that the value of the invitation will be seriously discounted from the pointof view of Belgium as well as ourselves unless the invitation is given in sufficient time to enable tfcieBritish and French troops to secure a strategicaladvantage of position before any German attack begins.
