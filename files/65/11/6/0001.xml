In this telegram the Ambassadorexpressed the view that Mr Kennedy, the United states ambassador in London, was behind the recent Americanpeace move.   Mr Kennedy was a Catholic, and a keenadvocate of peace, and he (the Ambassador) conjecturedthat his advice in this matter had carried weight with president Roosevelt.   The Ambassador, reported also thathe had learned that arrangements had been made for theUnited States.

(40) 6th conclusions; I/minute 8.Confidential Annex.SCANDINAVIA. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said(Previous       that according to a secret Report dated 29th December, 1939,Reference:W.m.(40)5th   the German Staff were fully prepared to carry out theConclusions,Minute 5. )     necessary measures in the event of Germany deciding onaction against the Scandinavian countries, and the preparations to this end had been made in the German Baltic ports.According to another Report,dated 22nd December, 1939,received from a source in Germany which had always provedreliable, Germany was not only making the necessary pre-reparations in the German Baltic ports, hut was taking nopains to keep secret the action so being prepared.    It mightbe their intention in this way to intimidate the ScandinavianStates.    It might, on the other hand, be merely that theGerman Staff had received orders to be ready, at short notice to carry out any action which Herr Hitler might decide upon.It was worth noting that according to this report steamerswere being loaded in the Baltic ports with various kinds ofwar supplies, that parachute troops had been prepared, that four divisions of a special kind had been assembled, andthat 400 transport aircraft had been assembled in north-east germany.Hitherto the action which we had contemplatedGermany might take against Scandinavia was an invasion ofsouthern Sweden, or perhaps of southern Norway, and it wason this problem that we had formed certain judgments..   was it possible that the Germans were contemplating a parachutedescent on the Swedish ore mines further to the north?   there might well be technical reasons which would show that such-1-jjOST SECRET.

a project was impracticable, but it would, he thought, be worth while for it to be examined from this point of view.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF thought that any suchattempt would be unlikely, since the supply problem alone would raise very great difficulties.It was agreed that this matter should be investigated,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatsubsequent to the meeting of the War Cabinet on Saturday, 6thJanuary, he had had an interview with M. Colban, the norweigen minister, at which he had handed him the aide-memoire setting out the action which in consequence of the recent flagrantviolation of Norwegian territorial waters by German naval forceswe were preparing to take to prevent the use of those watersby German ships and trade.   What had passed at that interviewmight be summarised as follows:-After M.  Colban had read the text of the aide-memoire,he had remained silent for a time, and, then speafcingwith some emotion and evidently chosing his words withcare, had said that this communication had come as acomplete surprise to him, and that, being withoutdetailed information on the subject, he could not say whether the facts of the German action were as statedin the aide-memoire.    Even if they were, however, his first personal reaction was that there was no logicalground for maintaining that three unfortunate occurrenceshad deprived Norwegian waters of their neutral character.For example, he had had occasion,as he (the Secretary ofState) was aware, to protest against violations of norwegian territory by British aircraft; but neither theNorwegian Government nor His Majesty1s Government nor eventhe German Government had regarded these acts as havingturned Norwegian territory into a &quot;theatre of war&quot;.    Tothis the Secretary of State had pointed out that therewas surely all the difference in the world between theaccidental crossing of the territorial limit in flightsnear, the -coast of Norway and the deliberate acts ofpiracy of which the Germans had been guilty.   Whileadmitting the difference, M. Colban had maintained that,so far as it affected the neutral character of norwegian waters, it was one of degree only, and that, in any event,three cases of sinking in three months did not prove that the German Government were deliberately treatingNorwegian waters as a war zone.    In such circumstances,His Majesty&apos;s Government might, he claimed, have been expected to draw the attention, of the Norwegian Governmentto these cases; but it was quite another matter, andin his (M. Colban1s) view unjustified, to claim thatNorwegian neutrality was now. a thing of the past......^............

The Secretary of State had replied thatthis was not our contention;   on the contrarywe saw no reason why Norwegian neutrality ingeneral should not continue to be maintained,and we certainly had no desire to see it disappearThe Germans, however, could not &quot;be allowed to benefit by rules of neutrality which they them-selves disregarded.     In the last war, for example,the Allies had held that similar German actions inGreek waters had entitled them to deny the use ofthose waters to German shipping;   and he (theSecretary of State) could see no difference ofprinciple in the present case.     M. Colban hadretorted that Norway could not be compared with greece in such matters.     In the last war, forexample, he himself had been personally concernedwith the arrangements for Norwegian coal supplies from this country, and the Ministry of shipping had admitted to him that the ships bringing thiscoal had all been adequately protected in norwegian waters.     The Norwegians were a people who never failed to defend their territory againstanyone;    and he (M. Colban) felt that Norway&apos;conduct as a neutral during both this war and thelast merited greater consideration for her position,and greater confidence in her will to defend her neutrality.     The Secretary of State had repliedthat he fully appreciated Norway&apos;s conduct in thelast war and her will to defend her neutrality now;but it was not, unfortunately, a question of willbut one of capacity, and the facts of geography, if nothing else, made it almost impossible to believethat the neutrality of ths waters along the wholeNorwegian coast could be adequately protected against a Power determined to-violate it,M. Colban had then asked why His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, who had already allowed some threeweeks to elapse since the last of the cases citedin the aide-memoire, could not wait a little longer to see what action the Norwegian Government could take to ensure respect for their neutrality insteadof threatening to violate it themselves withoutfurther ado.     In the absence of instructions fromhis Government, he could only give his personal views:   but he had assured him (the Secretary ofState) that it was, his sincere conviction that sucha threat was not justified by the premises of ourargument, based as it was on three cases only.He (the Secretary of State) had explained that,although the aide-memoire referred to these threeparticular cases,&quot; since they were well authenticated,our contention was that there was a general use of norwegian waters by German submarines which made such cases possible.     He asked M. Colban to believethat we in this country fully realise!thedifficulties of Norway&apos;s position;   but we had aright to expect that our position also should be appreciated.     Fighting as wewsre for our lives,we could not be expected to overlook the determina-tipn of the enemy to stick at nothing to destroy us3regardless of the rights of neutrals, and to allowhim to benefit by our respect for those rights,regardless of his conduct.

M. Colban had admitted that German.jrtrthlessn-ss.must be taken into account but that did not in hisviow prove that Norwegian waters wore a theatre ofwar,     In consequence he found it necessary at once to enter a strong and formal protest against theidea of any foreign naval forces operating in norwegian waters - a protest based not, of course,on any instructions but on his general knowledge ofthe policy of the Norwegian Government.     If thewords &quot;appropriate dispositions&quot; in the aide-memoiremeant, as he supposed they did, that Britishwarships would now regularly search and divert ships in Norwegian territorial waters, the Germans wouldnot remain passive ana a train of consequences wouldbe started, the result of which he feared would be toput an end to Norwegian neutrality.     He noted thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government expressed their reluctance to proceed with such measures;    and he could wellunderstand that they should be reluctant to takea step fraught with such dangerous possibilities.He still hoped that on reflection it would bedecided not to act in this wayc     He (the Secretaryof State) had replied that he would take note ofthe views expressed by M. Colban and would reportthem to his colleagues;   but he had held out no hopethat the decision would be altered.     He had askedM. Colban to convey the information in the aide-memoire to the Norwegian Government as soon aspossible, and to make plain to them the strong feeling in this country that one-sided respect forneutral rights could no longer be expected of us,and that a war could not be conducted on the principleof one side keeping all the rules and the otherbreaking them,     M. Coltan had replied that he wouldcertainly do this;   but he maintained that what we now proposed to do went far beyond merely equalisingthe position of the two belligerents in this respect.The aide-memoire, he said, would make a tremendousand painful impression on the Norwegian Government;and though he understood our point of view as wellas any Norwegian, he could not honestly think thatit was in our interests to take such action.     Wowould do well, he urged, to place more confidence in Norway and in her determination to maintain her independence.      She still hoped to maintain it, butthis step would make it more difficult to do so.As he had explained during the War Trade negotiations,German aggression should not be fought by attackingNorwegian interests;   and the present was a rmnhgraver case of the same procedure.     Our actionindeed might ultimately involve Norway in the war.... 4 i-.

He (the Secretary of State) had saidthat he could not see why this should he so,the Norwegian Government he presumed, wereprotesting to the German Government againstthe actions of German submarines in norwegian waters, and he supposed they might feel itnecessary to protest to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment against the action which we now contem-plated;    but this would not bring Norway intothe War.     M. Colban admitted this, but saidthat very little would then be needed to bringthe war to Norway.     He could not contemplatesuch a possibility, without horror, and thatwas why he had spoken so frankly.     He (theSecretary of State) had replied that he was grateful to M. Colban for his frankness andregretted to have been obliged to make such anunpleasant communication to him.     He realisedas well as M. Colban did that this was a gravematter, and, as he could tell from the lengthof time which had elapsed since the lastsinking mentioned in the aide-memoire, HisMajesty&apos;s Government had not taken thisdecision without grave deliberation.     Intaking !:.is leave M. Colban had said that thiswas indeed a grave matter.     Was it wise to risk an extension of the conflict?     Hesincerely hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould yet reflect in time on the consequences of such an extension, both to the norwegian government and to themselves.THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether M. Colban had stated whether in fact the Norwegian Government had madea protest to Germany, against their use of norwegian territorial waters.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat M. Colban had not answered this point;   and he (theSecretary of State) had not asked him.     Throughout,M. Colban showed great emotion and it had been an extremely painful interview.     On the day following the interview (i.e. on 7th January, 1940) M. Colban had called at the Foreign Office to say that he had just received a telegram from the Norwegian Foreign Officestating that while the Norwegian Admiralty admitted thatone of the ships mentioned in the aide-memoire had been

sunk inside Norwegian,territorial waters, they challengedour version regarding the place at which the two other ships had been sunk.     It was quite clear therefore thata dispute would arise.between the Norwegians and ourselvesregarding the facts cited in the aide-memoire.Immediately after the interview with M. Colban,he (the Secretary of State) had seen M. Prytz, theSwedish Minister, to whom he had handed a copy of the aide-memoire which he had given to the Norwegian Minister,at the same time explaining that as a matter of courtesywe wished to inform the Swedish Government of the actionwhich we intended to take in Norwegian territorial waters,since considerable quantities of Swedish goods wereshipped to Germany from Norwegian ports.     The courseof this interview might be summarised as followsWhen M. Prytz had read through the aide-memoire,he (the Secretary of State) had explained thesituation with which we were now faced.     german submarines had first ignored the order of theNorwegian Government prohibiting submarinesfrom entering Norwegian territorial waters andhad then committed in those waters what couldonly be described as acts of piracy.     HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not be expected toallow this state of affairs to continue in which british trade and shipping were exposed toattack, while they continued to accord a one-sided respect to waters used by the attackers.Nevertheless even now His Majesty&apos;s Government,although faced with the most inhuman acts ofpiracy were only preparing to take an actionwhich was in fact no more than a tightening oftheir blockade.     Nevertheless, the norweigen minister had been much disturbed at the communication which he (the Secretary of State)had just made to him, and had been veryapprehensive of the possible consequences to norway of our action.     He had even suggestedthat Norway might thereby become involved inthe War.     He (the Secretary of State) had told M. Colban that he did not see why this should follow.     He would, however, be glad ofM. Prytz&apos;s view on that point, and on theprobable effect of our action on Sweden.

M. Prytz had replied that speakingunofficially he could say that he had expectedHis Majesty&apos;s Government to take this step,and had so informed the Swedish government as soon as he had heard of the sinking of ships by Germany in Norwegian territorial waters.    he did not think that it would produce muchreaction in Sweden, since Sv/edish interests didnot seem directly involved, except in the caseof shipments of iron ore;    and, though theSwedish Government would no doubt deplore our action and might even be moved to protest against it, if appealed to by the norwegian government on grounds of Scandinavian solidarity,he did not believe that any strong anti-Alliedsentiment would be created in Swedish publicopinion.    The main point of interest to theSwedish as well as to the Norwegian public would be the prospect of German reprisals;   buthe did not see how Germany could bring Swedeninto the matter, though German reprisals against trade with the United Kingdom might ultimately affect the trade of the port ofGothenburg.He (the Secretary of State) had aaidthat he was interested to hear these views;and he had asked M. Prytz; whether, if he wereto put himself into the position of the norwegian government, he would take so serious a view ofthe matter as M, Oolban had seemed to do.M. Prytz; had replied that it was all a questionof possible reprisals from the German side.The latter of course might try to protect theircommerce and so risk a naval engagement in norwegian territorial waters;   but so far as he(M. Prytz) could see, nothing short of an actual German invasion of Norway need reallycompromise Norwegian neutrality;   on the whole he wass inclined to think that nothing short ofsuch action would fundamentally alter theposition or would cause Norwegian public opinion to turn against the Allied cause.   He (theSecretary of State) had rejoined that this wasthe impression which he himself had gathered from what M. Colban had said.    The latter had seemed chiefly concerned to emphasise the danger to Norway from German reprisals against our action rather than to contest the rough justice of the action we proposed to take.   M. Colban1 schief sentiment had seemed to be one of alarmrather than of indignation.M. Prytz then remarked that, while hecould not say of course what attitude theNorwegian Government would adopt, he did feelthat there was no great danger of hostile reaction in Sweden, and problably not even asmuch danger of such a reaction in Norway asM. Oolban had tried to suggest, provided always

that the object of our action ?;as to defendourselves against German illegalities, and to tighten the blockade of Germany but not to bringScandinavia into the war,     This would be the test both in Sweden and in Norway, and he feltthat it was- in our own interests to emphasisewhat he called the &quot;blockade&quot; aspect of thequestion.     He (the Secretary of State) had replied that our intentions were indeed toprotect oursdvess and to harm Germany, but notto bring the Scandinavian countries into thewar against their will;     he would see that everything possible was done to make this plainto the Scandinavian public, and he would be grateful if M, Prytz would make this plain tohis Government.   This M. Pryta promised to do.Since the interview recorded above he had however receivedTelegram No. 7 dated 7th January, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;charge d*Affaires, Stockholm, which threw a very differentlight on the attitude of the Swedish Government.     this telegram might be summarised as follows:-The Secretary-General of the SwedishForeign Office had sent for Mr. Pollock latethe previous evening (7th January, 1040) and had read aloud the text of the Note communicated bythe Secretary of State to the Norwegian Minister,the text of which had been telegraphed to Stockholm,by the Swedish Minister.    The Secretary-General,whoA clearly angry, had said that in the view?of the Norwegian Government none of the instances,of the torpedoing of British vessels withinNorwegian territorial waters cited in the aide-memoire had been clearly established^ and that,even if they had been, they formed an inadequatepretext for the deliberate and publicly admittedviolation by His Majesty&apos;s Government of Norwegianneutrality.    The consequence of this step wouldprobably be the German occupation of Denmark, andpossdbly the end of the independent existence ofall the Scandinavian countries.    He had added&quot;I should have thought that the BritishGovernment had the fate of a sufficient number of smaller States on their consciences as it was&quot;0Mr* Pollock had replied that he had not  -himself been informed of the action contemplated, -but he knew that the Admiralty, as the result ofthe most careful investigation, had establishedbeyond any doubt whatever that more than one ofthe vessels in question had been torpedoed insideNorwegian territorial waters;   he therefore-suspected tha^ the Norwegian Government were trying to conceal the fact.    He had gone on tosay that he guessed that the decision of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to take this action immediately

was based upon disturbing reports received regardingincreased exports or iron ore both from Narvik andSxeloesund.   He had told the Secretary-General of his conversations with M. Wallenberg &quot;based upon theinformation received from the Ministry of economic warfare, and had added that in his opinion the onlychance of persuading His Majesty&apos;s Government to postponeaction was to provide immediate and far-reachingassurances that the spirit of the secret understanding between the Swedish and the British Government regardingSwedish exports of iron ore to Germany would be loyallyobserved.    He then said that His Majesty&apos;s Government,in negotiating the War Trade Agreement, had apparently been influenced by the consideration that it was worththeir while to sacrifice a trump card, namely the powerto control supplies of iron ore to Germany, in order toensure for the time being at any rate that Scandinaviawould not be involved in the war.   His impression was,however, that considerable doubt existed as to thequestion whether from the British point of view thissacrifice was worth making; and there seemed to himno object in trying to hide this fact.   He feared,therefore, that if His Majesty&apos;s Government were given any cause to believe that the Swedish Government wereplaying Germany&apos;s game, they might decide to take such steps as they thought necessary to protect theirown interests.The Secretary-General had replied that this was his impression aiso, but that any method of preventingGermany from receiving iron ore was better than the onenow proposed which was a deliberate violation of norwegian neutrality.    &quot;It would be better&quot;, he had said&quot;for you to slip in and sink the ships on the quietthan for you to declare that you were justified in so doing&quot;.   He then added &quot;thinking out loud we might evenconsider telling the German Government that in view ofcertain threats received we could not supply the many longer from Narvik&quot;.    Finally, the Secretary-General had begged him (Mr. Pollock) to do all thathe could to urge postponement of action for a fewdays, pending further consideration of the position.He added that he would look into the question of theiron ore companies&apos; present activities and would communicate with him (Mr- Pollock^ again on thefollowing day   (8th January, 1940),In submitting this telegraphic report, Mr. Pollockstated that his impression was that the swedish government were genuinely frightened, and that theymight go a long way in order to induce His majesty&apos;s government not to take the action proposed.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the attitude ofthe Swedish Government as reported in the foregoingTelegram suggested that something had happened very recently to alter the situation in Sweden,-THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS        ^said that it was necessary now to wait for the officialnotification of the reaction of the Norwegian and swedish Governments to the action we proposed to take,,It was possible that the Swedish Government might offer to take steps greatly to reduce supplies to Germany,        &quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said thatin that event the Swedish Government would have no reply to offer when the Germans protested against suchaction,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS     &quot;said that during the week end he had received an inquiryfrom General Smuts as to the grounds we proposed toAdefend our policy of reprisals if it involved the sinking of ships.    After consultation with the Admiraltyhe had informed   General Smuts by telegram that it was   *not our intention to sink stay ships in norwegian territorial waters, but merely to arrest and divertships in such waters for examination for purposes ofSontraband Control,The War Cabinet(i) Invited the Chiefs of Staff toconsider/- the possibility of Germanyattempting to seize the mines inNorthern Sweden and/or the port ofLuliea by parachute troops.(ia) Agreed to await the official reply of the Swedish and Norwegian governments before deciding what further Action totake.Richmond Terrace, S.W, 1* -10-6th January, 1940,
