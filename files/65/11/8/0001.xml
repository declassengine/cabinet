TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET. COPY HO. 2-0W.M.  (40) 8th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.SCANDINAVIA. The War Cabinet had before them the followingPapersMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, giving an account of a   conversationon the 8th January between Mr. Charles Hambro,of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and theSwedish Minister in London (W.P. (40) 10).Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare,on the stoppage of all supplies of iron oreto Germany from the Northern Swedish fields(W.P.  (40) 11).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS gave the War Cabinet a summary of the communications which   had passed between the British and Scandinavian Governments,of the Scandinavian reactions to our proposal to stop the narvik traffic, and of certain conversations which had beenheld.The main points to which he drew attention were as follows.-(a) The Norwegian reaction to our proposal hadbeen bad, and had been expressed with considerable and real emotion by M. Colban.    Their attitudeappeared to be inspired by fear of Germany.    Theirprotest had been backed up by a message from the king of Norway to His Majesty, imploring us to reconsiderour Intention.(b) The Norwegian Minister had informed theForeign Office, the day before, of a telegram he had

received from the Norwegian Foreign Minister, to theeffect that, when the sinkings too&quot;&quot; plaoa early inDecember.- J:he Norwegians had immediately set upa systom. of naval escorts,, since when there had been no further attacks on shipping in territorial waters-(c.) The Swedish reaction had bean surprisiitglyunfavourable, in view of what was believed to i&apos;,e theSwedish attitude,- and of the general tonor of theearlier discussions which had J:aken place and of theway in which m. Prytz had received our communication.In view of the significance of the conversation which Mr.  Hambro had had with m. Prytz(recorded in W-P.  (40) 10)5 he (the Foreign Secretary)had arranged a meeting at the Foreign Office, at whicha full discussion had taken place between Mr. Hambroand others at the Foreign Office concerned with theproblem.-.The following were the main conclusions whichhad emerged from thVj discussion(a) There was general support for the view which had on several occasions been put forward to -Trie War Cabinet,- that the prospects of being able to undertake the major operation againstthe Northern orefields depended not so much on ourpresent action against the Narvik traffic asupon the imminence of the threat from Russia,In consequence, the Narvik project could beconsidered on its own merits, as a separateenterprise-

(b)   It was thought unlikely that germany would react by invading Norway.   Mr. Hambro hadbeen most emphatic that Germany would be reluctant to take drastic action against Norway, for fear that sweden would join in and that her supplies of ironfrom Sweden would then be jeopardised,,(c)     A further investigation of what would be gained by naval action in Norwegian territorial waters showed that 1,200,000 tons of ore might hestopped between 15th January and 15th May, and that,in addition, evasion of our Northern Patrol by surface ships and submarines would be made much moredifficult.(d) On the other hand, there were certaindisadvantages which we should incur if we took thestep proposed.    First of all, the Norwegians mightcontest the evidence on which our case rested, with sufficient success to make our action appear very high-handed:   secondly, other neutrals might be led tojoin in the strong protests which Norway and Swedenwould he hound to make:   and, thirdly, our actionin interfering with a small nation would be valuablefor   German propaganda, especially at a time when wowere publishing a Blue Book on the   Russiannegotiations, in which we emphasised the care withwhich we had respected those same interests last year.(e) I&apos;: was thought that there were three courses open to the &apos;&apos;0vernment:-(i)   To withdraw, and do nothing,(ii)   To carry on and fulfil our intention.

(iii)   To use the threat of naval interventionas a lever to press the Scandinavian countries to concede  what we wanted,     Norway and Swedcrwere much alarmed by the prospect of our action,,and might go a long way to meet our views, if,by so doing, they could prevail upon us not toviolate Norwegian Territorial Waters,This course of action was strongly advocated by Mr, Hambro,(f)   As to the demands which we might make on norway and Sweden, if we adopted the third course of action, it wassuggested that we might request Norway to stop providingpilots for ore ships.   We might also ask her to prohibit theexport of ore to all belligerents.    Finally we should onlyagree to adopt course (iii) if Norway undertook to make a war trade agreement on lines acceptable to us and would carry out our demands in connection with economic warfare.    Our demands;to Sweden would be that she should acquiesce in the stoppage of exports of ore from Narvik, make good her secretundertaking to lessen, by all means in her power, exportsof ore to Germany, and ensure that Germany did not make goodfrom Lulea the amount of ore which she had failed to get from Narvik,It was thought that all these demands could be fulfilled by Norway and Sweden without prejudicing their neutrality.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said he thought thatthe course of action suggested above would be worth trying.    Ifa balance sheet were drawn up, its advantages could be set out as:*-(l)   We would lose our imports of ore from narvik, but could make them good from elsewhere,(ii)   We would achieve our object without having to incur the disadvantages of violatingterritorial waters,,

(iii)   We should avoid damaging our relations with Norway.(iv)   We should not throw ourselves open to thecharge of oppressing small nations.(v)   We should not risk losing our shippingagreement with Norway.(vi)   If our demands were not accepted, our case for taking naval action would rest on firmer groundthan at present.He felt it was essential to keep our minds fixed on the larger problem on which we might have to embarklater, for which Scandinavian co-operation was essential;and although their attitude would largely be governed by russia, it would be a great mistake to forfeit the goodwil&quot;of Norway and Sweden without good cause.The suggestion had been made that a Minister,for example the Lord Privy Seal, should be sent over to impress on the Scandinavian Governments our view of thepresent situation, and to give a stronger exposition of ovcase than could be given by our diplomatic representativesHe was inclined to think that, although at a later stagethere might be great value in such action, it would be dangerous at the present time, in view of the very wideattention it would attract.     News had just been received that M. Wallenberg, who had led the Swedish Delegation inour war trade negotiations, was about to arrive in thiscountry by air.     No doubt he was bringing further news of the Swedish Government&apos;s attitude.     It would be advisable to hear what M. Wallenberg had to say before coming to an irrevocable decision.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL agreed that it would bea mistake for him, or any other Minister, to go to scandinavia new.   0 Such a visit would involve bothpublicity and delay.     He was much impressed with the

urgency of taking action to stop the Narvik trade.Every week that passed allowed a further quantityof ore to sail for GermanyeTHE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought thatthe compromise scheme now proposed had much to commend it if there were any chance that norway and Sweden would accept our demands.     He agreed,however, with the Lord Privy Seal that the need for action was urgent.     Every week the prize was meltingcTime would be consumed in the proposed negotiations,and, if we failed, we should be back again just where we started.It should- be remembered that our ultimate objective must be the stoppage of all ore from sweden, and we could never resi content with anundertaking from the Swedish Government to go slowon their supplies to Germany.     The new Paperproduced by the Minister of Economic Warfare shewedthe great effect on German industry of stopping the ore, not only on account of its iron content, but onaccount of its high phosphorus contents     germany would be forced to redouble her pressure on Sweden ifthe full quantities of supplies were not forthcoming?and we should find that neither Sweden nor Norwaywould be able to withstand this pressure and carry out their undertakings to us.     We should not deludeourselves with the idea that we could stop the oreby mere threats.     However, it was to our advantage that the Scandinavian countries should be embroiledwith Germany, and that the war should extend, to scandinavia.     During his recent visit to France, hehad found that the French High Command were in full agreement with this view, and were prepared, ifnecessary, to assist with Alpine troopso

THE PRIME MINISTER enquired what would bethe effect on our steel industry of cutting offsupplies of ore from Narvik.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE saidthat, since the war, we had not been obtaining suppliesof Swedish iron ore, with the result that our stocksof that kind of ore were almost entirely depleted.     a sudden stoppage of exports from Narvik, therefore,would, for the time being seriously hamper our steelindustry.     Some furnaces would have to close down.Given time, we could replace the Swedish ore bysupplies from Brazil, Spain, and North Africa.     Itshould not be forgotten, however, that, whereasGermany only relied upon getting a comparatively smallquantity   of ore through Narvik, and - over a year -could draw almost her full requirements from Lulea,the whole of our requirements of Swedish ore wouldhave to come through Narvik.Thus, if Narvik were completely closed,the Germans would only lose their winter supply,whereas, we should lose our whole year&apos;s supply, wfcichwould amount to some 2,000,000 tons.There was plenty of ore elsewhere to takethe place of the Swedish ore, provided shipping was available to bring it;    but some time must elapse before the alternative supply could be organised.A further important consideration was theextent of the German stocks of Swedish iron ore atthe present time.     He thought that, as Germanproduction had recently been on a comparatively small scale, their stocks might quite well have increased.

THxu PRISM. minister&amp;K said that he was less concerned with the reactions of Norway than of Sweden,whose goodwill it was essential to retain,     Sweden hadprotested vigorously against our demarche to Norway,and had taken the line that action against her neigh-hour was of vital interest to her.      In consequenceswe were no- in a position to bring severe pressure on her in the stapio way a a w^-^rn-ri-ri on Norway.     The latestReport hy the Minister of Economic Warfare (W,P.(40) 11)emphasised the importance of stopping the whole of thesupplies of Swedish ore to Germany.The attitude of other neutrals would probablybe largely governed by that of Sweden, and therefore wehad to ensure that we did not drive Sweden into makingtoo violent a protest, which might put us badly in the wrong in the eyes of the world.      It was difficult tosee why the Swedish reactions to our communication to norway had differed so greatly from what we had beenled to expect.       He was not yet satisifed as to thequestion whether we could carry out the Narvik projectwithout forfeiting the goodwill of Sweden.     Hesuggested   that before taking a final decision, weshould await the result of the forthcoming conver-sations with M. Wallenberg and explore the Swedishattitude thoroughly.      It might be after all that the swedes were prepared to co-operate with us in stopping the export of ore to Germany, as seemed to be indicatedfrom the report of the conversation between Mr. Pollockand M. Boheman.     At the same time we could notpostpone a decision indefinitely in this matter.

THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEsuggested that we should use the threat of actionagainst the Narvik traffic as a lever to put further pressure on the Scandinavian countries, in particularSweden,    We were in need of Swedish co-operation inorder to give assistance to Finland as well as to stop the ore going to Germany,   He urged that we shoulddemand from Norway and Sweden, as a quid pro quofor giving up action against the Narvik traffic,their active help, first to form a front against russia, based on the condemnation by the League ofNations of the   Russian aggression in Finland, and secondly in s topping the export of ore.    We couldpoint out that, if they would consent to theseproposals, we should be able to put in an allied force which would protect the northern iamapfieldsagainst the possibility of the Russians overwhelmingthe Finns in the spring and advancing into Sweden,We could in the same way protect the mines againstthe possibility of a German landing at Lulea when the ice melted.    We ought to make all preparations now,so that we might be in a position to send thenecessary forces for these purposes in the spring.We might indeed have to make it clear that we should send forces whether they liked it or not.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said there would be no difficulty in opening such conversations with Norway and Sweden, but they would almost certainly beg us not to send any officialassistance to Finland through their countries for

fear of the action which Germany might take against them.     He doubted whether assistance to Finlandwould prove of any value towards obtaining Scandinavianco-operation in stopping the ore.    There were howeveradvantages in talking to them very frankly about the ore traffic and asking them what they could suggest toassist us;,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY observed thatwe had now been considering the proposal to stop the narvik traffic for some six weeks, and so far we hadtaken no action.    He did not think that there was theleast likelihood of the Scandinavian countriesagreeing to take steps themselves to stop the ore, asthe Foreign Secretary had suggested.      They were far tooterrified of Germany.   He proposed, therefore, thatwe should immediately send a flotilla to stop the Narviktraffic in Norwegian waters and await the results ofthis action.    We could   make a very powerful case before the world for taking this step.    It now seemedvery questionable whether Germany would, in fact,invade southern Norway if we did this, and even if she did it would be to our general advantage.    Theneutral countries could not be permitted to tie our hands when we were, in fact, fighting to maintain theirliberties.We ought, at the same time as we took actionagainst the Narvik traffic, to make it perfectly clear to Sweden that whatever happened we were irrevocablydetermined that the Germans should not get the ore from the Galivare fields.    This stoppage of Germanore supplies: might result in shortening the war and

saving an enormous number of casualties on theWestern Front,    We had the necessary force, andwe could give an assurance to Sweden that we worldsupport her if Germany took action against hernIt was just possible that if wo showed our determination in this way Sweden might agree to cutoff the ore supplies to Germany by destroying theminefields herself, or taking some other action on her own account0    The programme which he therefore proposed was first to listen to what MeWallenberghad to suggest, but very little was likely to come out of this extent    The next step, which should followat the earliest possible moment,, would be to takenaval action to stop the Narvik traffic.-    Subsequentlywhen Norway and Sweden made their protests, as theyundoubtedly would, the Lord Privy Seal or whateverother emissary might be decided upon, might be sentover to Scandinavia, partly to explore ways and means of meeting the protests; of the two countrieF,-but also to make it clear that we were determined to stop the ore going to Germany ourselves unlessSweden did it for us,    It might be true that were quired the co-operation of Norway and Sweden if wewere to send in our own forces to stop the ore goingout from Lulea0    But in his view, the only way ofobtaining this co-operation would bo to face thesecountries with a choice of two evils.    We shouldhave to make them more frightened of us than theywere of Germany^THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that one possible result of taking action against the Narvik

traffic might he that Norway would stop supplies of-ore coming over to usa    In view of what had been said by the President of the Board of Trade this might place us in a very awkward position,    We had tobear this possibility in mind,,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that we were more likely to be   successful if we faced norway and Sweden with a fait accompli than if we enteredinto prolonged negotiations,.   He was afraid that if wotried to get the Scandinavian countries to take actionto stop the ore on their ov/n account, without doing anything definite ourselves, there would be a very long delay, during which Germany would be getting her supplies from Narvik without inters jl^n -    If the stoppage of the ore was likely to be the decisivefactor in the war, we ought to make up our minds totake drastic action without further delay0The discussion then turned on the steps whichshould be taken to prepare ourselves for the action we might have to take in the spring,,    It was recalled that authority had already been given for the purchase of clothing for the forces necessary to seize   certainports on the v/est coast of Norway against the contingency of a German invasion of that country, andthat detailed plans for these operations were nowbeing worked out.    If we were to be ready to send thelarger forces required for the bigger project ofseizing the northern minefield, however, preparationswould have to be made on a much larger scale and should start immediately.     The force required to seize the

Galivare fields.; jfemld be in position before the icebroke in the Baltic, since after that date the Germans?could send a sea-borne expedition to Lulea.The Chiefs of Staff had already forshadowedthe possibility that forces^ would have to be sent to/co-oporate with Sweden in the defence of the southern part of the country against German invasion, and plans for this also should now be worked out in detail,,   any minister who went to Sweden would have to be able togive assurances of armed support on a sufficient scale0The War Cabinet -(i)   Agreed to defer a decision on the narvik project pending the arrival in this country of M, Wallenberg:(ii)    Invited the Chiefs of Staff to advise the War Cabinet as to what instructions and authority the Service Departmentsrequired&quot;to enable detailed plans and preparations to be made for theoperations described in the Chiefsof Staff Report of the 31st December,(W,Po (39) 179, Paragraph 102 (iii)and (vi), vis0 ,(a) The despatch of a force viaNarvik to the Northern Swedishoref ields-;(b) The despatch of a force to co-operate in the defence ofSouthern Sweden:(iii)     Agreed that, pending the settlementof the instructions and authorityreferred to in (ii), the service department should have provis ionalauthority, in consultation with theTreasury, to make purchases of thespecial equipment that would benecessary for the forces proposed,,Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.10th January, 1940.
