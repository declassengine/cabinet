The line he himself had taken at his interview with M.

marmed forces through Narvik, hut that the Finnish minister was busy trying to persaade the two Governments to allowseveral thousand volunteers to filter through by thatroute in bodies of about 150 at a time.It seemed that Norway and Sweden might begot to the point of permitting quite large numbers of volunteers to pass through, and this idea led him toput forward the suggestion that we might consideronce more whether we could not do something in thisway.   What he feared, and in this he was supported byM. Corbin, was that when we had prepared our expedition,we might be met by a refusal from Norway and Sweden toallow it to pass.    As an alternative, the Petsamo project,even if on military grounds it were found to be possibleto undertake it, held out no hopes of decisive results.We should thus, in March, still find ourselves unableto help the Finns.Since the best way of securing the good will of Sweden would be to save the Finns, he thought thatwe ought to consider pushing through larger numbers of official volunteers, even though there might bemilitary objections to such a course.     These volunteerscould not achieve as much as an organised expedition,but, if the latter proved impossible, we might have to fall back upon the former?   and, from the political point of view, it would pay us to start now.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that the finns required 30 or 40 thousand men to save thesituation in the Spring.    It would be impracticable

to pass anything like this number of volunteers throughSweden,    As to the immediate problem, the only volunteerswhich would be of real use to the Finns would be menwho could work in the snow, and of these we had so faronly collected 360.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought thatit would be worth investigating further the possibilityof working fairly small bodies of men through as soonas possible.    The great thing, from the strategical pointof view, was to get our foot into the doorway intoScandinavia,,    Advanced parties on the Gaiivare railwaywould be very valuable.Security THE FIRST SEA LORD then informed the War cabinet of plans,of the proposals which the Chiefs of Staff recommended to safeguard the secrecy of plans and preparations nowin progress for action in Scandinavia.    They consideredthat it would not be sufficient to rely on informationnot leaking out.    Deceptive action would have to betaken to make the enemy believe that our preparations were designed for some different operation.The only plausible alternative to Scandinaviawas the Middle East, and they proposed to take anumber of steps designed to spread the idea that theforces were being prepared for that theatre.    Thedanger that the Germans might attempt to forestallus by going into Roumania forthwith was not great,mainly on account of climatic conditions.It-3-

0-4-The method by which the false scent would helaid would he co-ordinated by an Inter-ServiceSecurity Board,     Units would be ordered to submitsize rolls for drill clothing, sun helmets, etc.,and lectures on hygiene in Eastern countries wouldhe given to the troops.     Headquarters, Middle East,would be asked to continue preparations for advancedparties, reconnaissance for aerodromes, collection ofsmall craft, etc.       On the other hand, specialequipment for Scandinavia would be ordered undercover of assistance to Finland, and would only beissued to troops after they had embarked.     our policy in this matter would be co-ordinated with theFrench by direct approach to their High Command.If the Government approved this method ofdeception, the Chiefs of Staff thought that, at some stage, it might be desirable to inform the ItalianGovernment that we were contemplating moving additionaltroops to the Middle East, in view of the danger fromRussia.     Whereas the Italians might thus welcome our proposal, the Germans would be led by our preparationsin the Middle East to think that we had offensivedesigns in South East Europe, and that our disclosureto the Italians that we were strengthening our reserves in the Middle East was a blind..The War Cabinet expressed their agreementwith these proposals...

The War Cabinet(a) Agreed that Brigadier Ling shouldbe sent on a mission to Finlandwith the object of affording moral support to Field Marshal Mannerheir% andof providing us with accurate information of the situation.Brigadier Ling should be inpossession of full information about the projected Allied movesin Finland and Scandinavia, but should not disclose them to anyoneuntil he received orders to do so.(b) Requested the   Chiefs of Staff toexamine and report on the possibilityof passing &quot;volunteers&quot; throughNorway and Sweden into Finland, inthe manner suggested by the foreign secretary, on the assumption thatthe concurrence of Norway and sweden to the Allied plan for intervention in Finland would not be forthcomings(c) Approved the proposals outlined bythe First Sea Lord for safeguarding the plans and preparations now on foot for operations in scandinavia and Finland.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.
