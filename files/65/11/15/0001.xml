THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.COPY NOW.M.  (40) 15th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7,Confidential Annex.WESTERN FRONT.Possible german attack onNetherlandsand Belgium.(previous reference s .W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 7.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatthere was no news to report from France.     The Chiefof the Imperial General Staff had informed him thatit would take between twenty-four to forty-eight hours for the troops to get back into the positions occupiedbefore the emergency move, i.e. the positions occupiedon Sunday, 14th January, 1940B     The troops had nodoubt been put to considerable hardship, moreespecially the mechanised units which alone had been on immediate notice.One additional German Division had been identified opposite the German-Netherland frontierduring the preceding twenty-four hours.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs read to his colleagues a telegram which had beenreceived late the previous night from Sir Roger Keyes(No. 15 from Brussels).,     Sir Roger Keyes stated thatthe King of the Belgians understood the message sent tohim to be a limited guarantee, provided only theBelgian Government agreed to the British and FrenchArmies taking up certain strategic points at once.King Leopold had said that the guarantees for which hehad asked would help him in his relations with hisGovernment, but that the answer he had received wouldhave a bad effect if communicated to them.     The

advantage which the Allies would gain by taking upstrategic positions would, in King Leopold1s view,be out of all proportion to the sufferings inflicted on the Belgian people if they became involved in awar fought on Belgian soil.     The Belgian Governmentcould not be induced to enter a war while there was any hope of averting it.     King Leopold had expressed his belief in the genuine character of the documents which had been captured.     No doubt the documents, ifpublished, would be repudiated, but neverthelessGermany would make tremendous capital of the fact ifBelgian neutrality were violated by Great Britainand France.     He thought that it was in the paramountinterest of the Allies, as well as of Belgium, to leavethe onus for breaking Belgian neutrality on Germany,and that the guarantees asked for were no more thanthose given to Belgium before the last war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the telegrammade a deplorable impression on him, since it appeared that the Belgians had never intended to invite us to cross their frontier before the Germans invaded Belgium.It was agreed, however, that the King of the belgians occupied a very difficult and unenviableposition.Reference was also made to Telegram No. 14,dated 15th January, from Brussels.     In this telegramit was stated that, while the Belgians would not agreeto official tripartite Staff talks, the King hadpledged himself to ensure that all questions put to hisauthorities by the British and French militaryauthorities, to secure complete military co-operation,would be fully answered.     It was understood that- S -

various particulars were ready in sealed envelopes tobe handed to our Service Attaches on the outbreak ofwar.The War Cabinet -(l)   Took note of the above statements:(S)   Agreed that advantage should betaken of the present occasion topress strongly for co-operationbetween the Belgian, British andFrench military authorities (eventhough such co-operation fell short of official Staff conversations and invited the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs ^6&quot; seneTsTdespatch to Brussels in this sense.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.16th January, 1940.
