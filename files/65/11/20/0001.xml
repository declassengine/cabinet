Such an operation could, he assumed, only beundertaken by forces now engaged on other work and hewould therefore, like, to form an idea of the value to be attached to the proposal.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat the Soviet troops in the Petsamo area were notstrong in numbers and relied entirely for their supplies on their sea communications with Murmansk.Successful naval action against these communicationswould make it impossible for these troops to hold out for long and if they could be destroyed, a usefulmeans of access to Finland would be opened up.     Therewas no railway from Petsamo but there was a road alongwhich traffic was possible on sleighs and quite heavyloads could be transported.     The railhead was 200miles to the South.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought thatthe Polish Naval units (three destroyers and twosubmarines) now working with the British Navy, mightoperate off Petsamo and Murmansk with considerable effect.     They would have to be supported by us andbased on our ports, but as Poland was at war withRussia they could legitimately sink Russian shipswithout involving us in the charge of committinghostile acts against the Soviet.The War Cabinet were informed that the Chiefsof Staff were engaged on an examination of possibleAllied intervention in Scandinavia, and in particular of General Gamelin&apos;s views on the subject, and theirreport would very shortly be available.     In it theywould include an examination of all aspects of naval operations against Petsamo and Murmansk.The War Cabinet took note of theabove discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.

(40) 16thone lus ions,minute 8).W.M.  (40) 22nd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.(24th January,    1940).THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN&quot; affairs drew attention to two telegrams received from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, containing information regarding possible German intentions:-Telegram No, 15 Saving, dated 20th January,1940, in which Sir Percy Loraine reportedthat His Majesty&apos;s Consul, Turin No, 1, hadlearnt that a German engineer who had recentlybeen in Turin had been heard to boast (whenperhaps somewhat inebriated) that work was now proceeding in Germany on a new type of aircraft capable of carrying much heavierbombs than existing types.    The Germanengineer had also said that the Germans had- a method of dealing with the Maginot Line whichwould surprise the world.     The German was: -^rSr^t^aefg^^ Pos&quot;ion in aTelegram No, 16 Saving, dated 20th January,1940 in which Sir Percy Loraine.. stated that before having received the report summarised in the proceeding telegram he had receivedconfirmation of both the points mentionedfrom Marshal Balbo with whom he had had along talk the previous evening in an Italianprivate house.   Marshal Balbo seemedconvinced that the Germans would attack the&apos;-Maginot Line in April or May$   he said thatthey would bring some upleasant new weaponsinto action.     The only one which he mentioned was a new type of gun.    He also said that he had seen a new and formidableGerman bomberc     At the time when he had seenthis bomber only twelve prototype machines were in existence, but he imagined that this type was now in production.   He expressedthe view also that for the purpose of thepresent war the development of German airpower was three years in arrears?, and he presumed that every nerve was now beingstrained to speed it up   there might, hethought, be some surprises, in store for us.The Marshal had said also that GeneralBrauschitsch, whom he considered to be a fine soldier, had expressed to him hiscomplete confidence in the ability ofGermany to smash through the Maginot Line.

I SiMarshal Balbo admitted that the SiegfriedLine was hastily constructed and, inreply to a question by Sir Percy Loraine,SJ he had admitted also that the Maginot line was now very much stronger in depth thanit had been last year.In submitting this report Sir percy loraine said that he did not think thathis meeting with Marshal Balbo wouldbecome known in Borne j   and he hoped thatthe fact that it had taken place would betreated with the strictest confidence.The War Cabinet took notecf the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1..\
