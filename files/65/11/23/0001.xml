THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST   SECRET.COPY NO,W.M.(40^ S1ST CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1,Confidential Annex.(2nd February. 1940),SCANDINAVIA.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 28thConclusions,Minute 8).The War Cabinet had before them:-(a) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff onIntervention in Scandinavia - plans and Implications (W.P.(40) 35).(b) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff on french Proposals for Allied Assistanceto Finland (W.P.(40) 41).THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF introduced theReport on Intervention in Scandinavia (W.P.(40) 35),and said that the contents of this Report had not beendiscussed in detail with the French during the Chiefsof Staff&apos;s recent visit to Paris, though the questionof the time factor referred to in paragraphs 20*23had entered into the discussion on the French project for a landing at Petsamo.     The vital importance ofobtaining control of the northern Swedish ore fieldshad also been recognised by the French.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL staff said that General Gamelin had informed him that hewould offer no objection to the diversion to scandinavia of British troops now in England, nor tothe withdrawal of a British Regular Division from france, if there seemed any possibility of carryingout the big project of stopping Germany&apos;s iron ore ,supplies.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staffadded that General Gamelin was now no longer convinced-that the Germans would attack la the west thia year,and agreed that if we could force the Gernanv toundertake operations in Soandi**aviation,t&amp;*Be wouldinvolve a large diversion of German effort. Kis own per soraLview was that once the Germans were committed in.Sweden, an attack in the west was impossible.    In any event the diversion of effort would he greater for germany than for ourselves.THE CHIEF OF NAVAL STAFF then introduced the Chiefs of Staff Report on the French Proposals for allied Assistance to Finland (W. P. (40) 41).    TheFrench plan for an operation in the Petsamo area wasin two parts, (a) a landing by Allied forces in co-operation with the Finns, (b) the sending of 30,000or 40,000 volunteers into Central Finland,     Thefirst part of the plan could not be carried out withoutthe second, since unless the Finns were heavily re-inforced in the centre, they would be unable to spare  .anyone to clear the way for our landing.     After a landing had successfully been achieved, the proposal was that the Allied force should aim for Kandalakshaand cut the railway to Murmansk.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had just received a telegram from Parisgiving an account of an interview between our ambassador, and M. Leger.    The latter had enquire whether the French plan was properly understood inLondon.    It was not, he said, to make Petsamo the baseferamajor operation, but merely to effect a smalllanding there sufficient to make the Germans believeour objective was to lay hands on the Swedish Iron OreFields.    That would compel the Germans to invadeSouthern Sweden in an attempt to frustrate us*   the swedes would then appeal to us for help, and we could at once establish our base at Narvik*-2-

Ttiiu CHIi,F OF THE IMp jtI,,L GuMt,R*J. STaFF said thatthe idea expressed by M. Leger had not been mentioned atthe discussion in Paris.In the ensuing discussion the following pointsemerged:-(a) The French plan for action at Petsamo didnot appear to have been well thought out.It depended on the sending of a large forceinto Finland, through Norway and Sweden.If this were possible, it would be unnecessary to go to Petsarao at all.(b) Naval action at Petsamo would be a waste of effort,in view of the small amount of traffic to beintercepted, and the number of ships whichwould have to be taken from important taskselsewhere.(c) The occupation of Northern Finland by theAllies, though it might achieve a localsuccess, could have no effect on the outcome of the Russian invasion.    In the Spring, whenthe ice melted, the Russians and germans could land in the Gulf of Bothnia and turn the Finnish defences.(d) Whereas the French thought that by undertakingan operation at Petsamo we should stimulate the Scandinavian countries, into co-operation,this was by no means certain.(e) By operating against the Russians at Petsamo,we should accept all the disadvantages ofwar with Russia without the advantages ofsecuring a valuable prize, such as we should get if we occupied Gaiivare.In view of the above considerations, it was generally agreed that nothing would be gained by an operation of the type suggested by the French.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that we had never yet made it clear to the Scandinavian countries thatwe might be prepared to send a substantial force to and the  Finns,   He suggested that we should make Norway and

Sweden, face the realities of the situation and urgeon them that Finland, if unaided, was almost certain to collapse in May.       We should tell Norway and sweden that we were ready to intervene effectively to save her, provided that we had the co-operationof Norway and Sweden.     If these countries thenrefused their co-operation, the onus of Finland&apos;sbetrayal would rest upon them.     It would he essential,of course, to let the Finnish Government know that wehad made such an approach to the Scandinavian countries.Pressure from    Finland would then be added to ourown, and would certainly he a powerful factor.This proposal met with the general approvalof the War Cabinet.     In the discussion which ensuedthe following were the principal points that weremade:-(i) Finland had at present the sympathy of the whole world, and if shecollapsed, the blame would be laidat the doors of ourselves and theFrench.     It was, therefore, essentialto show to the world that we were ready to do our part, and to shiftthe onus on to Norway and Sweden.(ii) It should be made clear to theFinnish Government   that theprospects of their receiving sub-stantial assistance depended on theco-operation of Norway and Sweden,and they should be informedimmediately if the scandinavian countries refused to co-operate.(iii) It was probable that Norway and sweden would become alarmed immediatelywe made any proposal to send forcesthrough Narvik, since they would realise that the Germans might reactviolently to any threat to the securityof their ore supplies.     No reference should, therefore, be made to thequestion of the ore fields in our approach to the Scandinavian countries.

We should, however, make it clear thatif, as a result of their co-operation,Germany attacked them, we should he prepared to come to their immediate assistance with substantial forces..(iv) At the same time if we were able to sendin troops through Narvik to assist Finland,this would put us in a position to control the Galivare fields.(v) If Allied troops were sent in throughNorway and Sweden to assist Finland, the neutrality of these countries would not becompromised   vis-a-vis Germanybut only vis-a-vis Russia.(vi) We should not be able to base our actionon the provisions of Article XVI of theCovenant, since the Scandinavian countries had for long past made clear their refusal to he bound by this Article.     They had,however, subscribed to the recentresolution of the League of Nations con-demning the Russian aggression, and calling upon States Members to assist Finland,and this should provide us with sufficient justification.(vii) It would be necessary to send units ofthe Armed Forces of the Crown to assistFinland, but these should be sent as&quot;volunteers&quot; on the model of Italian&quot;non-intervention&quot; in Spain.   The french proposal for the formation of a volunteerforce of &quot;stateless&quot; men in France was impracticable.(viii) If we were to intervene effectively in scandinavia, and to assist Finland, itwas essential to push ahead with our preparations immediately.     The despatchof forces to assist Finland would involvepreparations on a rather larger scale than those envisaged in W.P.(40) 55.(ix) The action proposed would go a long wayto meet the obvious desire of theFrench Government, for political reasons,to send assistance to Finland.

The War Cabinet:-(i)   Approved the views expressed hy. theChiefs of Staff in W.P. (40) 41 inregard to the French proposals for^    Allied assistance in Finland;    and,in particular, that the Petsamo project,as propounded by the French, was a veryhazardous operation which, while it wouldbe likely txj- involve us in hostilities withRussia, could not by itself afford anydecisive measure of assistance to finland:(ii)     Agreed that it was of the utmost importanceto prevent Finland being overrun by russia,  in the Spring; and that this could only -be done by considerable forcesof trained men entering Finland from orvia   Norway and Sweden:(ill)     Agreed that action on these lines affordedthe most likely opportunity of enabling the Allies to obtain control of theNorthern Swedish orefields.(iv) Agreed that any forces sent to Finlandby this Country would have to be units ofthe armed forces of the Crown who wouldvolunteer for this Service, on the model of Italian &quot;non-intervention&quot; in spain,(v) Approved W.P,(40) 35 as the basis forpreparations for operations in Scandinaviain the Spring, subject to such modificationsand additions as may be necessitated for direct intervention in Finland.(vi)      Agreed that the co-operation of norway and Sweden, which, ma essential to this plan, could best be secured by an approach on the following lines(a) Unless a substantial force issent to Finland she will becrushed by May at latest:(b) We are prepared to join with Norway and Sweden in providing theforce required &quot;to prevent this. .,(c) If Norway and Sweden representthat action on these lines is

likely to result in their Toeing attacked by Germany, we would, in that event,give them substantial help.     We shouldbe ready to tell them the scale of our preparations and to have Staff con-versations.(d) We should make it clear to norway and Sweden that if they refused to play     jtheir part in this plan, the onus forthe over-running of Finland toy russia would, in the eyes of the world, rest upon them.(vii) Agreed that the Finnish Government should beinformed at the same time of our approach to Norway and Sweden, in order that theyshould likewise press Norway and Sweden toco-operate in this plan.(viii) Agreed that it. is of importance. that the finnish government should toe px&apos;umptly informedif Norway and Sweden are not prepared toco-operate in this plan.(ix) Agreed that the atoove Conclusions, in draft,should toe circulated to War Cabinet Ministers,and that, subject to any points which theymight wish to raise, these conclusions should form the basis for the line to betaken toy the British Ministers at theforthcoming meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.
