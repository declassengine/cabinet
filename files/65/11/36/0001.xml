It contained, however, aproposal that His Majesty&apos;s Government should at oncetake steps, on the strength of the ALTMARK incident,to seize Stavanger and the other Norwegian ports.He had contented himself with saying to M. Corbinthat a coup., dp. main, of this kind formed no part ofour plans.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that itwould be a grave error to authorise a landing in norway, in the face of opposition, as a mark of ourdispleasure at the line Norway had taken in the caseof the ALTMARK.   Even the firing of a few shots between british and Norwegian forces would be a most unfortunate-nate affair.    On the other hand, the laying of aminefield in Norwegian waters could almost certainly be accomplished without any kind of collision withNorwegian forces.   There were several places at whicha minefield could conveniently be laid.    If Norwegianships of war wore present at one of those places, itwould be an easy matter for our mine-laying vessels to remove their operations elsewhere.

THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that the proposal which Mo Corbin had transmitted seemed to show thatthe French Government had taken no notice whateverof the suggested time-table for the operations in aid of Finland, which we had communicated to them.The action which the French proposed would, in fact,probably make those operations impossible.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSassumed that the French considered that the prospects for those operations had now become unfavourable.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought thatthe chances of the larger plan materialising must now be admitted to be slight.     The facts of thesituation were all against them.   On the other hand,the stoppage of German traffic in Norwegian territorial waters, by provoking Germany to reprisals, might provide the Allies with a favourable opening.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.Richmond Terrace?

(40) 49th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.(22nd February, 1940)ASSISTANCETO FINLAND,(previous reference:W.M. (40)48thConclusions,Minute 6.) -THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs drew attention to Helsinki telegram No.112, dated 17thFebruary.   This telegram contained Mr. Snow1s account ofhis farewell audience with the President of the FinnishRepublic.   The Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs hadbeen present.The Foreign Minister had confirmed the Swedishrefusal to sanction the despatch of troopsen masse to Finland; the Finnish Governmenthad informed the Swedish Government inconsequence that they now had no alternative but to appeal to the Allies for help.    ThePresident of the Republic had then said thathe wished to request that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government would at once inform the Soviet Government that,if the latter would not respond to theFinnish Government&apos;s known desire to bringhostilities to an end, it would have an unfavourable effect on the future course of relations between the Allied Governments andthe Soviet Union.The President of the Republic had stated thathe put this forward as the only step whichcould be taken by the Western Powers whichoffered any prospect of any immediate relief for Finland.    The despatch of munitions wouldtake time, of men even longer.   Accordingly,the step in question represented the greatestservice that could now be offered.    he considered that, in view of possible developmentselsewhere, e.g. in the Caucasus, the step suggested would give the Soviet Government serious grounds for preoccupation and would, as the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs put it, in any case &quot;clear the ground diplomatically for any actionwhich the Western Governments might laterdecide to take&quot;.    If the step could be accompanied by any kind of naval or militarymoves, he considered that the effect would naturally be all the greater, but he did not wish to insist on this aspect.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he would prefer to defer his comments on this important telegram.    The message contained in it might hethe Finnish Government&apos;s supreme appeal to the UnitedKingdom and France.    If so, the message did not follow the lines which we had expected and desired.The following points were made in the courseof a preliminary discussion;-(a) The prospects of an Anglo-French military operation in aid of Finland, in the formoriginally contemplated, must now beconsidered as extremely dubious.(b) The Finnish Government might have secondthoughts as a result of the communication which Brigadier Ling was making to field marshal Mannerheim.    Brigadier Ling was now in Helsinki,.(c) The language which it was suggested theBritish and French Governments should holdto Russia amounted almost to a declarationof war.    There were very serious objectionsto that course.    Our war aim was the defeat of Germany, and the entry of Russia intothe war might make it harder, rather thaneasier, for us to attain it.(d) On the assumption that we were successful in applying pressure to Russia, the result would be a patched-up peace between Russiaand Finland.    This, again, would not help us to secure our war aim; it would setRussia, free to give a more extended measureof economic assistance to Germany.(e) The Finnish appeal might well have beenconcerted with the Swedish Government.    Inthis connection, attention was drawm to telegram No.70, dated SOth February, fromthe British Ambassador at Stockholm, inwhich the latter had argued that, if we wereever to obtain the consent of the swedish government to military intervention by us in scandinavia, we should have to find some means of convincing them of our ability to- protect them against combined aggressionfrom Russia and Germany.

(f) If we were going to consider seriously apolicy which would involve us in warwith Russia, it was very important for usto ascertain in the first instance whatwould he the reactions of the Turkishand Italian Governments.,(g) The SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR reminded the War Cabinet that our present plans for assistance to Finland were havingthe effect of delaying very considerablythe stage at which the British ExpeditionaryForce could play any considerable part onthe Western Front.    Troops were to be brought back from France to take part in theproposed Northern operations, and it might even be necessary for a time to suspendentirely the flow of equipment andammunition to the British ExpeditionaryForce.The War Cabinet took note of theabove discussion.Richmond Terrace, SoW.1.
