COPY NO. 2^W.M.  (40) 35th CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.I. .......   (7th February, 1940.)OPREME WAR THE PRIME MINISTER said that H. Daladier had0UNC.IL:th MEETING-0   expounded the French project for a landing at Petsamo, buthe had hinted that the idea had originated with the Finns andjssistancejb Finland.     was clearly not in any way anxious to press the scheme.I Previous        M. Daladier, however, had emphasised that if we turnedinference:1,M.(40)26th   down the Petsamo project, we must do something to help the[inclusions,fnute 7.)       Finns.    It was obvious that considerations of internalpolitics had a good deal to do with M. Daladier&apos;s attitude .He had been Prime Minister in France for much longer thanthe usual term of office of French Premiers, and this factor,combined with the general lack of active operations, had given rise to political intrigues in France on the part ofpersons who would like to see a change of Prime Minister.M. Daladier was therefore very ready to welcome our proposals for active intervention in Scandinavia.The Prime Minister said that he had explained theBritish proposals for the despatch of 3 divisions to scandinavia in order to give assistance to the Finns inthe Spring,before the break-up of the ice in the Balticopened the way for a possible German expedition.   He had emphasised that the administrative difficulties of such an enterprise would be considerable.,    Special clothing had tobe provided for winter conditions, but later on differentclothing and equipment would be needed, after the thaw came.Shipping and maintenance would present considerable problems,and there was much work to be done by the Staffs if the expedition was to be ready in time.   We had to prepare not

only to assist Finland, but also to support Sweden in caseof a German attack resulting from our action. ^The-generalsequence which we proposed was;-(i)   We should make full preparations for thedespatch of the expedition.(ii)   It would be arranged that Finland should issue an appeal to the world for assistance against Russia, addressing herself in particular to Norway and Sweden, who were her nearestneighbours and would be the next to he over-run by Russia.(iii)   We should then immediately approach the scandinavian countries and say that we were ready to answer Finland&apos;s appeal, but were quired free passage for our troops through their countries.   In these circumstances,it would be very hard for Norway and sweden to refuse.   The world would cry shame upon them if, owing to their intransigence, Finlandwere overrun.(iv)   Our forces would land at Narvik and Trondheimand move up to Finland through Boden.    in doing so, they would automatically securepossession of the Galivare ore fields.M. Daladier had expressed his entire agreementwith these proposals, but had pointed out that if norway and Sweden refused to give us free passage,it would beridiculous for us to be held up at the very last momentafter making all these preparations.    In these circumstances,we might have to do something at Petsamo.    The PrimeMinister said he had expressed the view that a refusal by-Norway and Sweden would be most unlikely in the circumstances,though he had agreed that if they went so far as to use force against us,they could stop our getting through by cutting the railways.    M. Daladier had seemed satisfiedon this point, but had asked that the Chiefs of staff should nevertheless examine fully the Petsamo project,lest in the w orst case we might have to fall backupon it.

The importance of the time factor had been emphasised in the discussions.     The 20th March wasthe critical date hy which our first echelon wouldhave to be ready to arrive in Scandinavia if we were tobe sure of forestalling the Germans.     All preparationswould therefore have to be pressed on with the utmostdespatch.     The French were prepared to contribute a brigade of Chasseurs Alpins, a brigade of the ForeignLeglofc and ponsftbly 4 battalions of Poles.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed outthat, although the expedition should be under british control, it was essential, for political reasons, thatthe French should be represented in some strength inthe forces.     The first echelon should certainlyinclude a French contingent.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that it was most important that nothing shouldprejudice the success of cur approach to Norway and sweden,     The Germans, suspecting our intentions, might possibly offer mediation to the Finnish Government, andif this were accepted,we should be placed in a serious difficulty.     He suggested therefore that we should givethe Finns immediately an indication that we wereprepared to come to their assistance with substantialforces, and thereby give them a chance of beating theRussians rather than of having to accept unfavourableterms of peace.In the discussion which ensued the followingpoints were mades -(i)   Secrecy in our preparations was essential, ifthe Finnish appeal was to have its full effect.(ii)   The Finnish Government had been toying witihthe idea of negotiating peace terms withRussia, and it would be better to make any approach on the lines suggested by the foreign secretary to Field-Marshal Mannerheim himself.Brigadier Ling was returning to Finland very shortly, and could be used as an emissary forthis purpose.

illCii )   The issue of the Finnish appeal would require careful timing.    our first echelon must he ready to moveimmediately the call came..   there might he some slight delay while the scandinavian c countries argued with us, hut when we demanded the right of passage we must he in a position tosay to. them that our troops were ready to sail at once not only toassist Finland, hut also to support them against Germany if necessary.Some discussion then took place on thedetails of the preparations to he madesTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatthe War Office had already received most of theauthorities they required, hut consultations wouldhave to take place with the Treasury on varioussquestions?, and with the Dominions Office in regardto Newfoundland loggers.   He urged that no time should he wasted in these inter-departmentaldiscussions.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER undertook that there would he no delay whatsoever on the partof the Treasury.THE PRIME MINISTER, in reply to a question,said that no decision had been reached as to whethertroops sent to Scandinavia would go in the guise of&quot;volunteers&quot; on the Spanish &quot;non-intervention&quot; model.Russia was not yet officially at war with Finland,apd we naturally desired to avoid open hostilities with Russia if it were in any way possible.   he fully realised, however, that there were greatpractical difficulties in despatching british forces in formed bodies which were not legally partof the Armed Forces of the Crown.

The War Cabinet(i) Took notes-(a) That their Conclusions as set out in w.M. (40) 31st Conclusions, Minute 1(i) to (viii), regarding assistanceto Finland and intervention in scandinavia, had been accepted by theFrench, subject to the proviso thatthe project for a landing at Petsamoshould be further examined by theAllied Staffs in case the scandinavian countries refused to give passage toour forces and we were thus compelledto adopt other methods of assistingFinland.(b) That the French had agreed to thecontrol of operations in Scandinaviabeing in British hands, but wouldprovide a contingent of French troops.(ii) Authorised the Service Departments, andother Departments concerned, to carry outimmediately the measures detailed inparagraph 24 of W.P.

(4Q) 35th oqasLggioiia, mihutb 7.(7th Pehruary,   1940).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs gave the War Cabinet the following particulars whichmust he regarded as highly secret, which Sir PercyLoralne had obtained from a reliable and well informedsource in Rome (Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s Telegram Ho, 25The Italian Government had decided to naovetwo Army Corps to the Brenner , and inaddition the whole of the Italian Cavalry wasstanding by for employment in Hungary if required.Signer Mussolini was infuriated with the behaviour of the German Government in regardto the Alto Adige and was accusing them offlagrant disloyalty.   He was however stillunfriendly to us.Marshal Badoglio had advised signerMussolini against relying toe much upon theinvincibility of the German Arr^ and had expressed the view that the French GeneralStaff waa the heat in europe.   When SignerMussolini had said that he would like tohave another opinion on this question. MarshalBadoglio had suggested that he should consultMarshal calviglia.   This was a noteworthysuggestion, for ever since the Italian defeatat Caporetto there had heen no love lostbetween the two Marshals.   Signer mussolini had subsequently consulted Marshal calviglia,who had confirmed the views expressed hyMarshal BadogllOoIn suhmitting this report Sir Percy Loralnehad asked that it might he treated asexceptionally secret, since, if it became known in Rome, it was so circumstantial in character, th.t the Italians would have little difficulty in tracing its source.The War Cabinet took note of the statementhy the Secretary of state for Foreignnd Terrace, 3,W.1.

MBTUTE 8.Confidential Annex.(7th February,.....^9,40).THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the previous evening Sir Alexander Cadoganhad received a most secret telegram from His Majesty&apos;ambassador. Chungking, which might be summarised asfollows:-After a conversation with the soviet ambassador to China, Sir Stafford Grippehad decided to go to Moscow by air.     sir stafford Grippe had gathered that theGovernment of the u       1. were now feelingapprehensive regarding their connectionwith Germany, and were looking for a wayout.     He (Sir Stafford Crippa) thoughttherefore that a visit by himself to Moscowmight be Useful.     The Soviet Governmentwere sending an aircraft to Urumtschi onthe Mongolian frontier on the 9th February,1940* to fly him to Moscow, and he expectedto be back at Urumtschi by the llth February.Between the 14th and 20th February he wouldbe in the province of Slnkiang and would return to Chungking on the 23rd Februarywhen he expected to be in a position tosubmit a report for transmission to him(the Secretary of State).   Sir ArchibaldClerk Kerr had asked him while in Slnkiangto do his best to find out the true position in that province.It was clearly not possible for us to stop sir stafford Cripps from going to Moscow, although his visit might give rise to misunderstanding.The War Cabinet took note ofthe above statement., S.W.I.
