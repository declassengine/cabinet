The High Commissioners had been greatlyattracted by the new proposal, and the Secretary ofState thought that they would be likely to recommend its

acceptance by their Governments if the Britishand French Governments decided to proceed with it.The High Commissioners were perhaps unduly optimisticas to the probable reactions of the Norwegian and swedish Governments.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggestedthat consideration should be given to the questionwhether Sweden should be informed diplomatically thatif Germany marched into Sweden, either by invasionor by invitation, we should have to regard thatcountry &quot;as a battlefield&quot;.     This would make itclear that Sweden must not treat German help as a&quot;soft option&quot;.     This suggestion met with general approval.At a later stage in the meeting, the foreign secretary said that he proposed to see M. Prytz, theSwedish Ambassador, later in the morning.     He did not propose to embark on the matters discussed at theMeeting of the War Cabinet held the previous evening,but merely to ascertain what M. Prytz himself had inmind.Certain amendments were agreed to inConclusion (i) to Minute 1 of the Meeting held theprevious evening, which, as modified, now reads asfollowsj-&quot;(i)   Approved the views expressed by the Chiefsof Staff in W.P, (40) 41 in regard to theFrench proposals for Allied assistance in finland;   and, in particular, that thePetsamo project, as propounded by theFrench, was a difficult operation which,while it would be likely to involve us in hostilities with Russia, could not by itself afford any decisive measure ofassistance to Finland, or secure theSwedish ore mines.&quot;The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W,1,

APPENDIX.British Legation,Stockholm,Des-patch No. 2. 20th January, 1940.Sir,I have the honour to bring to your notice thaton 18th January I received a visit from Colonel Garbea,who has served for the last few years as RoumanianMilitary Attache&apos; in Berlin, and left Berlin a few days agoto take up the appointment of Military Attache to Sweden,Norway and Finland.    He appeared friendly and anxious to talk, and was very full of what he confidently believesare the future plans of the German High Command, which i feel I must pass on, even though at first sight certain aspects; appear fantastic.    They are as follows:-1.     Germany&apos;s number one war-aim is the overthrowo  - fee British Empire, and they hope to achieve this by actually defeating Great Britain, whilstremaining upon the defensive against France.2.     Scandinavia is to be used as the stalking horse,and Germany aims thereby:-(a) to safeguard her iron supplies,(b) to obtain submarine bases flanking our trade routes,(c) to obtain air bases for air attacks onEngland,5.     The method by which this is to be done is asfollows.    The Russian conquest of Finland is tobe accelerated by German help, primarily officers,organisers and tacticians, to coordinate theRussian military effort.

4.     As soon as the Russian threat againstSweden really develops, i, e, as soon as the finns commence to crack, certain communities,i. e, the German community, (of which thereare some 8,000 in Sweden), and the stilllarger Swedish community whose predominantfear has always been Russia, will appealvociferously for German help, in much thesame way that the Sudeten Germans and theDanzig Germans appealed for help.Whether this help is accepted by Sweden as awhole, or not, German help will, however, come,The fi9?st step Germany will take will be tosecure the Narvik - Lulea railway and therebysafeguard her own iron supplies, and the secondwill be that South Sweden and South Norwaywill be occupied by German troops, under thepretext of protection against Russia,5.     From South Norway and possibly from Holland,which will by then probably have fallen into german handsf Germany will carry out intensiveair attacks on Britain, and Colonel GarTfreathinks possibly also a land attack, usingenormous air concentrations to ensure the safety of convoys on their two day passageacross the North Sea,6.     Germany now regards her battle front asextending from Basle to the Orkneys, andthe turning movement of the Maginot lineis to be carried out, not via Holland andBelgium into France, but via Sweden and norway into Great Britain,V-ii-

2ti7.     I asked Colonel Garbea on what he based thissomewhat surprising assertion, and he said he based it on; -(a) the presence in the Baltic of a large quantity of shipping, and a largenumber of troops who were graduallycollecting in the KIEL - WARNEMUNDarea;(b) the interest which is being takenby German agents in South sweden and South Norway, and the fact thatthe German General Staff recentlycarried out a very comprehensiveStaff Exercise on the particularoperation;(c) the fact that German pilots have beenacquainting themselves with the passages through the Sound to theSouth Norwegian coast;(d) the large number of reconnaissance flights, to no apparent purpose, thatthe German air force have been carrying out over North Scotland and england recently;(e) the fact that a large number ofmilitary and organizing experts haverecently left Berlin for Russia;(f) a boast was made to him by a Germanofficer which fits in with theoperation he had indicated.I have, etc.,(Signed) A.  SUTTON PRATT.Lieut. Colonel.Military Attache,,V.A.L. Mallet, Esq., C.M.G.,H.M.. Minister,Stockholm,-ill-
