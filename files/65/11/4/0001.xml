&quot;   THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT----- - 5QTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET. CpPY NQ.gfiftW.M. (40) 4th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.SCANDINAVIA. THE SECRETARY OP STaTE POR POREIGN AFFAIRS said(Previous      that the French Ambassador had asked to see him that reference:W.M.(40)3rd   afternoon, and he thought it likely that it might be to conclusions,Minute 9, )     give him the reply of the French Government to the note which we had sent them on the subject of Scandinavia.The Foreign Secretary also referred to the telegram (No.19) which he had despatched on the previous day to Lord Lothian, infoiming him of the terms of the communication which it was proposed to make to theNorwegian and Swedish Ministers.    In the draft of this communication which he had read to the War Cabinet onWednesday, 3rd January, he had referred to &quot;takingdispositions to prevent the shipment of goods down theNorwegian coast to Germany&quot;.   He had now amended thisby substituting a wider phrase of &quot;preventing the use of norwegian territorial waters by German trade&quot;; iphrase which covered traffic in both directions.The Narvik THE FIRST SEA LORD explained to the War Cabinet,traffic.by means of a chart, the method by which German ships from narvik were able to creep down the Norwegian coast in territorial waters.   A British ship laden with iron orehad recently proceeded down the coast, without leavingterritorial waters, and had made a careful study of the route followed..   The First Sea Lord indicated the spot at

which, if it were decided to interrupt the traffic, theBritish destroyers would operate; and he described the technique which they would employ.The object of their action would be to examineall traffic, whichever way it was proceeding, in a mannersimilar to that carried out by the Northern Patrol, and tosend in as prizes all German ships and neutral ships carrying contraband.   Depth charges would be employed in preference to guns, to divert the ships out of territorial waters.    This method was thought to be less likely to provoke counter action by any Norwegian war vessels thatmight be on the scene, and would minimise the danger tothe crews of the merchantmen.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER enquired whether any difficulty might arise from the fact that british ships from Narvik were apparently in the habit ofpursuing the same course as the German ships throughterritorial waters. -;THE FIRST SEa LORD said that British shipssailing from Narvik either went in convoy, or, if theysailed independently, they could be sent by a route wellout to sea.   The reason why ships had recently been sailingthrough territorial waters was probably due to the fact that two ships had recently been torpedoed just outside territorial waters. . *The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,5th January, 1940.
