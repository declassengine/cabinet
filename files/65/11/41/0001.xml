TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secreey of this document.MOST SECRET   -COPY No./^W.M. (40) 55th CONCLUSIONS., MINUTE 6.Confidential Annex.(29th February, 1940.)ASSISTANCETO FINLAND,(previous reference: .W.M.(40) 54thConclusions,Minute 4.)InterviewbetweenM. Corbinand Sir A.Cadogan.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS drew attention to a telegram (now somewhat out of date) , inwhich he had instructed His Majesty&apos;s Minister atHelsinki, on the suggestion of the French Government,to urge the Finnish Government not to make their appealto us dependent upon the agreement of the Swedish and norwegian Governments.In the meanwhile, he had just received a Note givingthe substance of a conversation that morning between. Corbin, the French An&quot;-) ass ado r, and Sir alexander cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, which may be summarised as followsThe Ambassador had said that the position in Finlandappeared obscure to the French Government in viewof the two following contradictory reports whichthey had received:-(i)   The Finnish Minister in Paris had called onM. Daladier at 8 p,m. the previous evening,and had said that he had received instructionsby telephone from the Finnish Prime Minister toexpress the gratification of the finnish government at learning that the British andFrench Governments were prepared to send troops to Finland, and their hope that it might bepossible for this aid to be accelerated.M. Daladier had said that the French Governmentwould certainly be prepared to accelerate their part of the plan, and he did not doubt thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government for their part would do the same as regards theirs.     The Finnish minister had explained that for the last two days Helsinki had been out of touch with london, but that instructions were being sentto M. Gripenberg, to make a similar communication to the British Foreign Office:(ii)   On the other hand, the French Minister inHelsinki, had telegraphed the previous day

reporting an interview which he had with   315M. Tanner, the.Finnish Minister for ForeignAffairs, on the latter&apos;s return from Stockholm.M. Oorhin did not know at what hour this telegram had been despatched, nor did he knowprecisely what it contained, since he had not seen its text.    It was, however, clearly of adiscouraging character.    M. Tanner had saidthat in the circumstances there was nothing for it but for Finland to negotiate terms with theU.S.S.R.     The French Minister had replied thatthe French Government would find it difficultto understand such an attitude on the part off inland.    To this M. Tanner had replied by pointing out that Finland could hope for verylittle assistance, having only been promised1,200 men some time in April (Sir alexander cadogan had pointed out to M. Corbin that theremust clearly be some misunderstanding somewheresince this figure was hopelessly wrong.)M. Corbin had said that it was, therefore, impossibleto form any very good estimate of what was thesituation in Helsinki.   After reflection, M. daladier had reached the conclusion that we should take theFinnish Prime Minister&apos;s message, through the Finnish minister in Paris, as a kind of appeal, if not theactual appeal which figured in our plan0   consequently it was, in M. Daladier&apos;s opinion, now for the Britishand French Governments to initiate the diplomatic action which had been contemplated.   M* Daladierthought that there were very strong reasons for taking this action.    If the Finnish Government had reallyreached the conclusion that they could hold out nolonger, and must embark on negotiations, they wouldhave to explain their attitude.   They might, of course,say that they found that they could not count on the degree of assistance they had hoped for, but the mainthing was that the responsibility for this failureshould fall not upon us, but on those who were reallyresponsible, namely, the Scandinavian Governments.It was therefore important that we should now makethe contemplated diplomatic demarche in Stockholmand Oslo.   M. Corbin had added that at his interview with Mo Daladier, the Finnish Minister in Paris -rather inconsistently, as it seemed to him (theSecretary of State) - had urged the need for theimmediate despatch to Finland of all material that could possibly be spared.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR thought that itwould be most unwise to treat that communication as the appeal for which we were waiting, since it might well bethat M. Tanner had agreed in Stockholm not to make anyappeal to us at all.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought we should at once instruct our Minister at Helsinki to see M. Tannerimmediately, and to ascertain from him what had transpiredduring his visit to Stockholm, and what was the likelihood of the Finnish Government making an appeal to us forassistance.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that this was desirable, hut said that he wished also to clear up the position with the FrenchGovernment.    Fortunately, our Minister in Helsinki was fully aware of the nature of our plan, having been givenparticulars of it by Brigadier Ling.   Our Minister in stockholm, however, was not in the same position, and he(the Secretary of State) had accordingly arranged to send a special messenger the following day to explain theposition to him.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that our ideahad been that the first approach should be madesecretly, through the diplomatic channel.    The finnish government would call upon the French and british governments to send armed forces to their aid, andwould at the same time appeal to the Swedish and norwegian Governments to allow these forces to cross&quot;their territory, as well as to furnish contingentsof their own.    This would give the Allied Governmentsan opportunity for asking the Swedish and Norwegian Governments to allow their forces to pass through.While  however, the first approach to Norway and sweden would not be made public, it would be made quite clear to the Swedish and Norwegian Governments that,if they did not co-operate, the appeal would be made public later.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed and added that,so far as he knew the finnish government had as yet made no approach of any kind to

the Norwegian Government.    As regards our future action he also agreed that it would he right forus to exert pressure on the Finnish Governmentto make the proposed public appeal.    It wouldhe necessary to consider very carefully what should he our next step if the Finnish Government,acting under Swedish pressure, refused to  makethe appeal.    There would then he force in theFrench argument that the Allies should make it plain that they would have been prepared to goto the aid of Finland.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that our minister in Helsinki should be instructed to make it clear to the Finnish Government that, if they did not make the appeal, we might have to make public the fact that in certain circumstances we shouldhave been willing to go to their aid,The War Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to telegraph to HisMajesty!s Minister at Helsinki,instructing him to see the Finnish minister for Foreign Affairs at once-and to put to him the followingpoints:-(i)   Did the appeal which the finnish government had made to theFrench Government constitute the appeal which had figured inour plan, as to be made on the5th March?(ii)   Did the Finnish Minister forForeign Affairs wish us to make an approach forthwith to theSwedish and Norwegian Governments?(iii)   Had the Finnish Government made an appeal to the Swedish and norwegian Governments to allowtroops to pass through their territories, or did they intend to do so?

(iv)   Mr. Vereker should also make itclear to the Finnish Governmentthat, if they did not make anappeal to us, we might have tomake public the fact that incertain circumstances we shouldhave been willing to go to theiraid.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF gave theTiTar Cabinet an oral report of the progress which had been made during the six days endingWednesday, 28th February, in the steps whichwere being taken to afford assistance to Finlandthe details of which are set out in the aide-memoire attached to this Annex.The War Cabinet took note ofthe statement by the chief of theAir Staff,THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF thenintroduced a Report by the Chiefs of Staff(W.P.(40) 78), which related to their previous report on the Employment of Allied Land Forcesin Scandinavia and Finland (W.P.(40) 51).He explained that the Chiefs of Staff felt that paragraph 10 of this earlier report was open tosome misunderstanding, since it stated that 3divisions and 1 brigade were proposed for employment in southern Sweden.    It wotild be wrong to assume that a force of this size couldbe maintained in southern Sweden, before we had held detailed Staff Conversations with the Swedesthough it was true that this force was being prepared for the operation.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGNAFFAIRS observed that if the matter was ever put to the Swedes in exactly these terms, the wholeproject would appear even less attractive to them than in the form in which it had been set out in w. P.(40) 51.    It would be unfortunate to give theimpression that we could only send 2 divisions totheir assistance.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF suggestedthat we should tell the Swedes what we were preparing, but should make it quite clear that wecould only send the full number if they would give us the facilities which we required.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR thought-v/e should be unwise to pledge ourselves at the outset to any definite figure.    A safer line to take with the Swedes would be that we would give all possiblehelp but that we must have full knowledge of their plans and what they could do to co-operate with us.The War Cabinet took note ofthe Report by the Chiefs ofStaff (W.P. (40) 78).Richmond Terrace,. S.W.I.

MOST SECRET. ANNEX.PROGRESS REPORT - WEEK ENDING WEDNESDAY. 28TE FEBRUARY, 1940cAIDE MEMOIRS.Movement Programme.All arrangements are progressing according to plan.The movement of stores to ports has begun, andloading of store ships will start on the 1st March.The two 42,000-ton liners have been withdrawn fromthe list of personnel ships, and the capacity of theremaining eleven liners is being increased accordingly.The Ministry of. Shipping is investigating the possibilityof making an additional small liner available as anemergency reserve.Force &quot;Stratford&quot;.Force &quot;Stratford&quot;(for Bergen, Trondhjem andStavanger) has been fully mobilised and ready to move sincemidnight, 25th/26th February.Commanders and Staffs.The Commanders of the forces for Narvik and finland and for the south Norwegian ports, with their principalStaff officers, and the principal Staff officers of thesouthern Swedish force, have visited the War Office, wherethey have received detailed information regarding theirrespective plans.

^Movement of Aircraft to Scandinavia.All arrangements have been made for the transportof the Gladiator squadron in an aircraft carrier.     Thecarrier would not sail until the aerodrome at Trondhjemvr&amp;s reported serviceable.Arrangements are being made to fit auxiliary tanksto the Lysanders, and it will probably be possible by thismeans for them to fly direct to Trondhjem.Army Co-operation Aircraft.If the aerodrome at Boden is found unserviceableduring the thaw it would be possible to provide 9 F.A.A.Swordfish for Army co-operation purposes.     12 Hoes wouldbe required for tbearprotection.   This provision could,however, only be uade at the expense of the first-line strength of the Fleet Air Arm, and a decision would have tobe taken in the light of the circumstances prevailing at thetime.     A portable runway, such as has been used at Wick,has been ordered for use at Boden during this period toenable some land aircraft to be operated from the aerodrome.These aircraft would therefore be either an addition to theFleet Air Arm aircraft, or an alternative should it not befound possible to operate Fleet Air Arm aircraft.Balloon Barrage at Trondhjem.A mobile hydrogen plant has been bought from theFrench with a view to possible use for the Trondhjemballoon barrage.     It would, however, be uneconomical to manufacture hydrogen there unless silicol and caustic sodaare available in sufficient quantities locally0     Thisquestion is being investigated.

Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.,February, 1940.Local Naval Defences of Bases. /Indicator nets and anti-torpedo baffles are being provided for Narvik.     At Trondhjem and Narasos the wateris too deep, and anti-submarine trawlers will be used,24 of which are being fitted out for this purpose.Delegation to Scandinavian Countries.On the 26th February the War Cabinet considered aReport by the Chiefs of Staff recommending the preparationof a delegation to Scandinavia.     The proposal was generally approved, but no decision was taken to prepare the delegation just yet.      The Service members, however,have been appointed and are already working in close co-operation.Security Arrangements.Action is being taken to develop the Middle East&quot;cover&quot;.     The French are co-operating very well.     As ameasure of deception, a telegram has-been despatched tothe British authorities in the Middle East warning them ofthe possibility of the arrival of reinforcements from theUnited Kingdom early in April and asking them for information regarding the adequacy of local shipping for subsequenttroop movements in this area.
