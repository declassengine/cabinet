(40) 14th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.COPY NO. /6klR STRENGTHSPF GREAT BRITAIN,BaNCE ANDfcERMANY.previous reference:M* (39) 74thonclusions,pinute 5.)abour.The War Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on the AirStrengths of Great Britain, France and Germany (W.P.(40)7).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR dealt with themain points in his Memorandum paragraph by paragraph.Labour problems would be the subject of aspecial discussion in the War Cabinet in a few days&apos;time, and he would therefore deal with this aspect verybriefly.    The aircraft industry already had more people in employment than at the peak of 1918, and ten times as many as in 1936.   At the same time, the War Cabinet should realise that if we were to achieve our air programme, wemust very greatly increase our man-hours.    The french were making proportionately greater use of women than wewere in the aircraft industry.   The achievement of theair programme would depend very largely on the extentto which women could be introduced into the industry.At present women could only be employed on one shift,and it was not practicable that a shift of women shouldbe succeeded by a shift of men.    It was also of greatimportance that key-men should be exempt from being called up for military service.

figures of The tables in paragraph 4 of his Memorandum hadonthlyOutput. been calculated on a numerical basis only, but numbersalone were not an adequate guide, since the increase in aircraft produced over the next six months would beeffected at a time when many factories would be turningover to new types,    Moreover, the figures did not show the gain which would result from the changeover to new types of aircraft of higher performance.    Nor did they include the aircraft which we would be receiving from theUnited States,The following types were all in full production at the present moment, and would continue in production over the period under review:-Fighters - Hurricane and Spitfire.Bombers   - Wellington, Hampden, Herefordand Blenheim.Army co-operation aircraft - Lysander.He hoped that by March, and certainly by June,deliveries would begin of the Stirling, Manchester andHalifax Bombers, and of the Beaufighter (two-seater fighter).Most of the Trainer aircraft for the EmpireTraining Scheme were being produced in this country - theremainder being made up from the U.S.A. and by localmanufacture.The Secretary of State, for Air drew attention tothe satisfactory figures of the monthly production of .Fighters, which were 122 (actual) in December, 1939,158 (estimated) for March 1940, and 237 (estimated) on june, 1940.

Analysis ofBomberProduction.Figures ofFrenchOutput.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explainedthat the estimated output   of 296 Bombers in March1940 (see paragraph 4 of W.P.(40) 7) would be made upasfollows:-Battle............. 90Blenheim........... 99Hampden ).........m 45Hereford;Whitley..........,. 22Wellington......... 37Manchester.........    1Stirling...........    2The estimated output of Battles in June 1940 was 87,and of Blenheims 126.In reply to criticisms of the high outputof the obsolescent Battle, he pointed out that therewere still 8 squadrons of Battles in the front line in France, for which replacements would continue tobe required until this type was superseded.     Further-more, the Battle would continue to be used for sometime to come as the basis for the operational trainingof Bomber pilots.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOE AIR gave an ,indication of the output of aircraft in France for october-December 1939.     These particulars had beengiven to him in the strictest confidence.     Frenchestimates of monthly output for the present quarterwere:--   January       -     500 all types.February     -     590   &quot;       &quot;March -     781   &quot;       &quot;but he was not sanguine that these figures wouldbe achieved.     At the same time the War cabinet would be encouraged to know that the French wereintroducing three new types of Bombers - two heavy and one Medium - and also a new type of Fighter.

The particulars of estimated German pro-duction given in paragraphs 7 and 8 of his Memorandumrepresented what was believed to be the upper limit of what Germany would be capable, and so, from our point of view, painted the worst picture.   There was,as yet, no satisfactory evidence on which to assess the effect on future German production of such difficulties as they might encounter from labour, orshortage of raw materials;   nor was it known whetherthe Germans would be changing over to the productionof more modern types of higher performance.     If so,the estimated output of 2,050 aircraft per month wouldcertainly not be attained.     The fact that this was anestimate on the high side was exemplified by thefollowing figures of estimated German productionduring last summer;-May 1939   -   1,000 all types.June - ) Production dropped owingJuly - ) to holidays and the diversion of labour to agriculture.August 1939   -       700 all types-September      -   1,000   &quot;       &quot;THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFNECEpointed out that the deduction to be drawn from thesefigures was that whilst last May we had approachedwithin 70 per cent, of German production, our pro-duction by next April (estimated at 869) would only he about 45 per cent, of German production (estimatedat 2,050).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR repeated thatthe estimate of 2,050 aircraft a month was based onthe prudent, if pessimistic, assumption that none of

uzPersonnel.Heavy-Bombers ofhighPerformance.the restrictions which applied to our own case wouldhinder German production, although obviously this would notbe the case.   Germany had, of course, developed a highlyorganised and very extensive aircraft industry.    It was ofinterest to note that the floor space devoted to German airfraneproduction in September 1939 was approximately 13^ million square feet, as compared with ll  million in this country.Paragraph 10 showed that, provided casualtiesremained at the present rate until the 1st March, 1940, the personnel position - both as regards flying personnel and skilled tradesmen - would be satisfactory.   No difficulty wasbeing experienced in obtaining recruits.   An integral feature of our personnel plans was the Empire Training Scheme.Paragraph 11 showed the percentage of aircraft production - calculated on the basis of airframe   man-hours -which would be devoted to the construction of Heavy bombers of the Halifax and Manchester classes.    The statement hadbeen made previously that 70 per cent, of aircraft production had been devoted to the production of Heavy Bombers.    Itwould be seen that the percentage to be devoted to the Halifaxand Manchester classes (which included the Stirling) wouldnot be more than some 25 per cent.   All three of these typeswere now about to go into production, and all three hadflown.    The reasons for the Air Ministry policy in regard to heavy Bombers had been set out in a paper which had been circulated some time ago.-&quot; The Air Staff had reviewed allthe factors which would go towards producing the most economicalstriking force within a given time, and had come to theconclusion that this could best be achieved by adopting thehigh performance type of Heavy Bomber represented by the halifax-Manchester-Stirling class.   Although this would admittedly result in reducing the actual numbers of aircraft,

this reduction would he more than cqmpenssted.fbr by Uie increase -4of striking power which this type of Bomber would provide,by virtue of its high bomb load, long range, great speed and powerful defence.    The true criterion lay not in thenumber of bombers which we could put in the air, but in the performance of the aircraft which went to make up ourstriking force.    The policy was based on building up a balanced Air Force comprising, on the one hand,an adequatedefensive screen of fighters and, on the other hand, a formidable Bomber Force which would be capable of inflictingdamage and death in retaliation for similar attempts on thiscountry by Germany.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had no criticismswith regard to the complementary r&amp;les of Bombers and Fightersin a balanced Air Force.   His doubts related to whether wewere right in &quot;plumping&quot; for the heavy Bomber.   Did we require these large aircraft for bombing the cities of eastern Germany?   Did not the experience of the War suggestthat we would be better advised to develop a smaller type of bomber, such as the Blenheim, which could be produced in greater   numbers?THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that,under modern conditions, the speed, bomb load, range anddefensive armament required of a Bomber necessitated alarger machine.   The heavy Bomber stood the best chance*f fulfilling the true function of the Bomber, namely to reach its objective, discharge its bomb load in the face of opposition, and fight its way back under its ownprotection.    Citing the example of the Wellington,0 he said that this aircraft, as originally designed, was

intended to have a speed of 250 m.p.h. but theaddition   of wireless equipment, improved navigationalaids, and power operated gun turrets, which had beennecessitated by the actual experience of war, had resulted in a material reduction of its speed.     by contrast, the Manchester and Halifax classes had been designed, with full defensive armament, to fly at a speed of 320 m.p.h., with a bomb load of 8,000 poundsand a crew of six.     The Blenheim with less speed would carry only 1,000 pounds of bombs, with a crew of three.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that hehad been much impressed by the arguments which had been advanced in favour of the Heavy Bomber, as set out inthe Air Ministry Paper on &quot;The ideal Bomber&quot;.     Thoughthe analogy of the battleship was not, in his opinion,in all respects a fair one, the fact remained that the battleship was still the controlling factor on the sea.The true function of the bomber should be viewed inrelation to its power to reach and discharge amaximum weight of bombs on its target and to return.In this respect the Manchester and Halifax classespromised to be incomparably more economical than the medium type of bomber such as the Blenheim.     Moreover,the former conception that bombing would be carriedout by large numbers of small types of bombers had notbeen realised by our actual experience of the war sofar.     The question would seem to turn, therefore, lesson the technical efficiency of the Heavy Bomber to fulfil its role than on the numbers of this type whichit would be possible to produce.

THE DEPUTY CHIEF OP THE AIR STAFF said that whilst it was quite impossible, at this stage, to givea firm forecast of what the output of Heavy Bombersmight be, a tentative estimate, given under allreserve, placed the number of Manchesters, Halifaxesand Stirlings which might be produced by the end of1940 at 250.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggestedthat one of the strongest arguments in favour of theHeavy Bomber was the probability of its being able toreturn after reaching its objective and so be availablefor further raids.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence pointed out that its ability to do this was basedprimarily on the assumption of its ability to overcome the Fighter.     But would these larger aircraft presenta more vulnerable and a more valuable target to anti-aircraft fire, and would they not lead to the develop-ment of larger Fighters to deal with them?THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF was of theopinion that their increased speed and ceiling over those of the medium Bomber would give them relativelymore protection.     The possibility that the enemy would endeavour to meet them with a bigger type of Fightercould not be denied, but there was no evidence for believing that the Germans would have these ready intime.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether the size of the aerodromes would not prove a limiting factor in the development of the Heasy Bomber.

Analysis ofthe Disposalof ProductiveOutput. April/October 1939.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF agreedthat this was the case.     Existing aerodromes, however,would permit the operation of the Halifax and manchester types;   and calculations pointed to thefact that this was the optimum size of Heavy Bomber,beyond which performance of bigger types would begin to fall off.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that allthe necessary machinery of manufacture, including jigsand tools,   was  ready for the production of theHalifaxes, Manchesters, and Stirlings, and that itwould be a disaster to cancel orders at this stage.It was, however, proposed, after a time, to concentrateproduction on two types.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR amplifiedthe figures for &quot;Reserves and Wastage&quot; at home forthe period April to October, 1939, shown in the table in paragraph 12.&quot;Reserve&quot;&quot;Wastage&quot;Bombers. Fighters. G.R. Army      Total.Co-op.764 67 44     80 95586743710207Total Reserve   850and Wastage&quot;&quot;14181     901,162THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY asked why, if764 bombers had been produced between April and october 1939, 480* only had been allocated to thefighting formations.     At a time when our bombers were only being sent occasionally on raids, he questionedthe wisdom of a policy which apparently placed two new*&quot;Rearming squadrons at home&quot; 388, and &quot;Formation ofnew squadrons and rearming of squadrons overseas&quot; 92.

and modern Bombers into reserve for every one which went into the First Line.    In the face of the Bomber inferiorityin which we stood vis-a-vis Germany, it seemed to himimperative that we should take all the steps we could to meetthe immediate situation by augmenting our First Line strength,He suggested that this could be done by devoting theaircraft which we were at present putting into reserve tothe formation of the new First Line Squadrons and alsoReserve Squadronso    The effect of the present policy wasto produce a force which had an enormous tail and only avery small fighting head, whereas our immediate and presentneed was for a larger fighting force.In the discussion which ensued, the First Lordelaborated, with further examples, his criticism that theincrease in the figures of our first-line strength aircraft,as given in the Secretary of State for ^ir&apos;s Memorandum,did not adequately reflect the corresponding figures of aircraft production.   For instance, against a declared totalMetropolitan Air Force strength of 1,700 odd aircraft inApril, 1939, the comparable figures on 30th September, aftermobilisation, was shown to have actually strunk to 1,456,despite a total production of 2,711 aircraft during the interval.    Similarly the estimated increase of 582 from1,456 to 2,038 between the 1st October, 1939, and the31st March, 1940, seemed a poor return for a total of2,886 aircraft produced during that period.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that the explanation was that our Reserves had been extremelyslender, and that we had been hard put to it to remedy the position and, at the same time, to rearm.   The numberof new squadrons already formed since the outbreak of war,or to be formed by the 1st April, 1940, was shown in

paragraph 15.     The increase in first-line strengthwas, however, a &quot;better indication of the increase inthe size of the Air Force since increases were beingmade in the establishment of certain existing Squadrons,and other Squadrons which were not included in the operational total at the beginning of the war wouldbe regarded-as fully operational by the end of thecurrent Quarter.THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF explainedthat it was the aim of the Air Staff to put as manynew aircraft as could be made available into First-line,    and, where possible, to form additionalSquadrons.     An explanation of the high number of aircraft in Reserve was to be found in the fact thatthe experience of the war had shown that it wasnecessary to train flying personnel to a much higherpitch of efficiency before they joined their Squadrons,than could be achieved at the Flying Training Schools.For the purposes of this higher training, Reaerveaircraft had been taken and formed into what were known as &quot;Group Pool Squadrons&quot;.     Although equipped with operational types, these were training and notoperational Units.     The Group Pool organisation hadthus been responsible for absorbing a very largeproportion of the Reserve aircraft of operationaltypes.     A further use to which Reserve aircraft hadbeen devoted was the equipping of 7 Reserve bomber squadrons, which had been placed behind the 33Operational Squadrons.

MSRelativeBritish,French andGerman First-Line Strengths.

He felt confident, however, that our policy had been right.If a comparison were made of the MetropolitanFirst-Line strengths of Great Britain and Germany inOctober last and next April, it would be found that theproportion between the two forces had altered in our favour from 1:3 to 1:2.4. If the Fleet Air Arm were included, the figures were 1:2.6 in October last and1:2.2 next April.Some discussion ensued on the question of theproportion of the Aircraft industry devoted to Fleet air arm needs, and it was agreed that this was a matter which should be considered in the light of our presentposition.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR gave the -following further particulars of the figures of reserves and wastage in the Table on page 9 of his Paper:-Bombers.

(40)  14th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 7.Confidential Annex.WESTERN FRONT.Possible german attack on holland and Belgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 13 th conclusions,Minute 1.)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR informed theWar Cabinet that the British Expeditionary force was at four hours&apos; notice, and that the 7 mechanisedregiments were ready to start at a moment&apos;s noticeif an invitation were received to enter Belgium.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat there was no fresh news of German troop move-ments on the Western Front.   There were 44 german divisions opposite Belgium and Luxembourg.   Hethought that the German Army was ready to advanceat any moment from their present positions, andthat we should receive little or no warning before an attack commenced.   He said that he had receiveda telegram from General Gamelin to the effect thathe had represented to M. Daladier that the concen-trated dispositions taken up the previous night onthe frontier would soon become known to the enemy,and could not be maintained indefinitely owing tothe weather.   He was evidently extremely disappointed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS drew the attention of the War Cabinet to Telegrams Nos.11 and 12 from Paris.   According to these telegrams-It-

M, Daladier had sent for the Belgian Ambassador andhad told him that the trench forces could not be left for more than another &apos;tA hours immediately on theFrench side of the frontier;    they must then eitherenter Belgium or be withdrawn.   An answer was requiredby 8 oT clock that evening.The Foreign Secretary added that the french ambassador had informed the Permanent Under Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs that, although theFrench had agreed with our communication to the king of the Belgians on the previous day, they had thoughtthat we might have taken up a somewhat less reservedattitude in connection with the discussion of possiblepeace terms.   Sir Alexander Gadogan had replied thatthe question whether or not.the Belgians invited us toenter their country was unlikely to depend on the precise form of words used in this connection.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that hehad had no further news from Sir Roger Keyes.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statements.e     o     eRi richmond Terra ce, S ,W .1,15th January, 1940,
