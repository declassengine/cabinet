THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may he taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY HQ.%0SCANDINAVIA.(previous reference:M.  (40) 9thConclusions,Minute 5).W.M.  (40) 10th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX.papers:-. (a)(*)The War Cabinet had before them the following a Memorandum prepared in the War Officerelating to the arrangements for thedespatch of forces to Norwegian ports(W.P. (40) 13).A Report by the Chiefs of Staff expressing the opinion that the chances of a successfulseizure of the mines in northern Sweden and/orthe port of Lulea by German parachute troops were so slight as to he negligible (W. P. (40) 15).THE PRIME MINISTER referred briefly to the twoPapers before the War Cabinet, and invited the foreign secretary to give an account of the talk which he had had with M, Wallenberg the previous day.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS gave an account of the discussion, at which Mr. Cross hadbeen present. He (the Foreign Secretary) had started byoutlining our case for action. He had asked M.Wallenbergif he could explain the reasons for the rather surprisingattitude adopted by the Swedish Government. It was clear from M. Wallenberg^ reply that his Government were concerned with the following points:-First, the Swedes thought that the prospects of German reaction against Sweden were likely to causethem extreme difficulty.   They thought that the germans would proceed further with the campaign against Swedishtrade, and would take action within Swedish territorial waters, and that this would lead to very dangerousconsequences,

The Foreign Secretary had replied that he didnot see how it would he in Germany1 s interest to picka quarrel with Sweden  and risk losing all the Swedishore.    This reply, however, had only partially reassuredM. Wallenberg.Secondly, M. Wallenberg thought that if thesedisturbing results followed British action in norwegian territorial waters, the effect on Swedish opinion wouldhe profound.    At the present moment Swedish opinion wasoverwhelmingly pro-Ally;   say 80; or.90 per cent.   Swedishpublic opinion was, however, quite ignorant as to theGerman violation of Norwegian territorial waters, and he did not think that the three cases which we had cited (twoof which were challenged by Norway), would be regarded as adequate justification for our proposed action.   Swedishpublic opinion would be more influenced by the Norwegianview than hy our view of the case, and would hlame us for all the consequences that ensued.    Such a result would he seriously damaging to the Allied cause - a consequence which he, who was strongly pro-British,would greatly deplore.The third point made by M. Wallenberg was that sweden had given, and was giving, a great deal of materialhelp to Finland - in some cases up to 20 or 30 per cent,of her own equipment.     From the point of view both of  -Sweden herself and of Finland, it was vital that Sweden&apos;sre-armament should not he interrupted.   At the present tineGermany was replacing in Sweden the arms which Sweden wassupplying to Finland.   He doubted whether this country would be in a position to do much in the immediate future in the way of supplying arms to Sweden.If the re-armament of Sweden hy Germany was madeimpossible hy outside action, Sweden&apos;s ahility to helpFinland might he gravely affected, if not destoyed, andpublic opinion in Sweden would feel that Sweden had beenstahhed in the back in their struggle against Russia.-2-

M. Wallenberg had emphasised that the effortnow being made by Finland (and Sweden) against russia was in the interests of the Allies,    if Russia could beheld back, there was always a possibility that seriousinternal trouble would start, which would be helpful to both countries.All that we should gain by the action was likely to result in all these unfortunate consequenceswas the stoppage of the import to Germany of f million or a million tons of ore.    The Swedish Government feltthat the disadvantages altogether outweighed theadvantages likely to be secured.M. Wallenberg had added that one element whichwould help to swing public opinion against us would bethe feeling that we were searching for a pretext forstopping the ore.    To this the Foreign Secretary saidthat he had replied that we certainly did want to stop the ore, but that in our view the pretext was asubstantial one.I Incidentally M. Wallenberg had explained whatthe Swedish Trade Delegates had meant when they said theyassumed that we should &quot;look after Narvik&quot;,    They had thought it impossible for ships to move the whole wayalong the coast without leaving territorial waters andthus giving us a chance to intercept them.   Unfortunatelythis was not the caseT]The Foreign Secretary had then asked M.Wallenberg whether he had any suggestion to make to dealwith the situation.    He had told M. Wallenberg that we had two objects:   first, to damage Germany as much as possible;and, secondly, to help Sweden and Finland against Russia.M. Wallenberg had argued that these two objectsconflicted.    The Foreign Secretary had asked whetherthis could be assumed to be so.    In this connection he

had emphasised the significance of the Germany military mission to Moscow, and he had reminded M. Wallenberg ofour diplomatic demarche, when we had offered help to sweden if she was involved in trouble as the result ofgiving help to Finland .     In the Spring the Russians mightagain be threatening to advance through Finland.     Forthat reason, or for some other reason, the Germans might feel that they must take action to make certain ofobtaining control over the northern ironfield.     this might happen irrespective of any action which we took atthe present time in regard to the Narvik traffic.     would it not be wise that Sweden should examine these ultimateissues in consultation with this country?M. Wallenberg had not expressed much surpriseat this statement, but had asked whether in fact we could do much to help Sweden in this event.     To this theForeign Secretary had replied that he thought we should beprepared to helpf but that obviously help, to be fully effective, must be concerted in advance,,M. Wallenberg had then said that he had no authority to speak on this subject, and he did not knowwhether his Government had considered it.     But his generalreaction to the suggestion was by no means bad.M. Wallenberg had then pressed for favourable consideration of various Swedish requests for the supplyof military equipment for the Swedish forces on which hehad been referred to the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence and the Service Ministers. He had made no offerin regard to the reduction of supplies of ore through theBaltic.Later in the evening, M. Wallenberg had returnedto the Foreign Office and had said that he doubted whether any record of his conversation with the Foreign Secretarycould show how depressed he and the Swedish Government feltat this turn of events.     Some time ago they had expectedsome such action on our part;   but the whole situation was now changed by the Finnish war, and he looked upon it witha very different eye0

Continuing, the Foreign Secretary expressed thehope that the War Cabinet would now be able to take adefinite decision on the whole question     Up till now he had felt that it was possible to deal with the Narvikproject in Isolation.     But the real question was thepossibility of carrying through the larger project.    Forthis the co-operation of the Scandinavian countries, andin particular of Sweden, was essentialo     The pros andcons of taking action against the Narvik traffic were very finely balanced, and although he himself had feltgrave doubts as to the wisdom of such action he had not felt the objections were sufficiently strong to set against the general opinion of the War Cabinet.     his conversation with M. Wallenberg, however, had definitelyweighted the balance of his judgment against the Narvikproject.     The new factors were, first, the probability ofan adverse effect on Swedish public opinion, second,thepossible effect on Sweden&apos;s capacity to give support to finland, and third, the appnront pjaobabili Lj^that we mightbe able to open negotiations with Sweden and bring herround to our side without taking forcible measures.Bearing these factors in mind he felt that the Narvikproject by itself was not worth the risk involved to thesuccess of the larger project.     The decision with whichwe were faced was a very difficult one, but the penalties for a mistake would be very much heavier if we had stoppedthe Narvik traffic than if we refrained, since in thelatter case we at least should not have prejudiced the chance of success in the larger project.

The source which we navu favoured was to send the Lord Privy Seal, or some other Minister, to sweden to explore the possihilities of bringing the Swedes round to our side.     We could keep the threat of action agtlnstthe Narvik traffic in reserve to strengthen our handsagainst the Swedes, hut our main objective of stoppingall the ore going to Germany was so important that in hisopinion we should be extremely careful before we took ahasty step which might prove a false one.At the request of the Prime Minister the CHIEFOF THE AIR STAFF gave the views of the Chiefs of Staff.He said that they wished to emphasise four points, andthey fully realised that to a large extent political considerations rather than military were at issue.   these four points were:-(i) If there was any chance that action againstthe Narvik traffic would prejudice thesuccess of the bigger project, they doubted the value of the Narvik project from themilitary point of view.     They were dis-posed to think that the action proposedmight militate against the chances, of the big project, though this was, of course,primarily a political question.(ii) The active co-operation of Norway and sweden was essential for the success of thelarger project.(iii) There was a possibility that action againstthe Narvik traffic would so alarm theGermans that they would sabotagestheNarvik-Galivare railway.     Sabotage of this railway would be possible for the Germansif they were really determined to carry it out.     The line ran through lonely country,and it was impossible -to guard it every-where.     Onoe the railway was cut we couldnot send a force to the Galivare fields.(iv) Action in Scandinavia might develop into avery large commitment, and would in any event involve the diversion of forces from france, which for us was the decisive front.Generally speaking, the Chiefs of Staff felt/some apprehension at the prospect of forcible actionagainst the Narvik traffic.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF saidthat he had discussed the matter with General Gamelinduring his recent visit.     General Gamelin had agreedthat the invasion of Scandinavia would represent a bigru      ^project for German; and would constitute a big  commitment for them.     He had also agreed that on general grounds a campaign in Scandinavia would be a better...divers ion from our point of view than in the Balkans.     On the otherhand General Gamelin had insisted that the western front must be secure, and had urged that we should notin any way reduce the number of the forces which wesent to France.     He had, however, accepted the argument that if we despatched forces to Scandinaviathis could only be done at the cost of delaying thedespatch of additional forces to France.General Gamelin had been in favour of putting a force into the northern ironfield, and was preparingAlpine troops for the purpose.     He also thought that,if we sent forces to Northern Sweden we should becalled upon to send help to meet the contingency of a German invasion of the southern part of thecountry.Continuing, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that his own personal opinion was that a diversion in Scandinavia would be sound strategically?and would probably rule out the possibility ofoffensives elsewhere on any scale by either theGermans or the Russians,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that discussion of this subject had now been proceeding for six weeks and every argument had been brought forward in favour of doing nothing toward the stoppage of- 7 -

the Narvik traffic ,     He saw no reason at all whythe Swedes should ever willingly allow us to go through with the big project.     If we held our handnow, they would realise that they had only to protestand we should draw back once again.     It was not right that we should bear the whole burden of fighting theGermans on behalf of the small neutral countrieswhile they did nothing to help us.     We should braceourselves to accept the hazards of action, otherwise germany would go on getting her ore indefintely without inteiruption,He was not impatient for action merely foraction1s sake, but ever since the beginning of the war we had let the initiative rest with Germany,     We waitedfor her to develop each form of attack against us, andcontented ourselves merely with devising means of meetingthese attacks as they arose.     If, however, we openedup a new theatre of operations in Scandinavia, we hada fine chance of forcing Germany into situations which she had not foreseen, and of seizing the initiativefor ourselves.,THE PRIME MINISTER read to the War Cabinet atelegram which he had just received from the PrimeMinister of Australia,Mr, Menzies earnestly requested, in view ofthe possible repercussions of any decision totake action in Norwegian territorial waters,that such a decision should not be taken until theDominions had had an opportunity to express theirviews.     He asked that he should be fully informed of the arguments in favour of and against the proposed action, and that he should be given a summary of theChiefs of Staff s appreciation of the assistance that

could be rendered to the Scandinavian countries, in theevent of the proposed action leading to an attack on them by Germany.    He concluded by expressing theopinion that the suggested action would have a bad effect in neutral countries and would present arguments. to Germany which she would not otherwise have.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that he had from the beginning been vory attracted by the prospect ofaction against the Narvik traffic, and he had not beenunduly disturbed by the probable reactions of Norway exceptin respect of two points.:-(i)   It had been suggested that one of the resultsmight be that the Norwegians would cut off theexport of ore to us.   This might well involvethe shutting down of some of our own blastfurnaces and a consequent reduction in ourmunitions production.   This was a new factor which had only recently come, to light,(ii)   There was a possibility that the Germans mightseize bases in southern Norway, and thereby be able to intensify their naval and air attacks on our shipping in the North Sea,   This had seemed a rather alarming prospect, but he hadbeen reassured by the Chiefs of Staffs ex&amp;rainationof the question from which it appeared that weshould be able to take action to forestall theGermans.The real test of the desirability of actionagainst the Narvik traffic, however, must be its probable effect on the success of the bigger project.    On thispoint he based his views on the opinion of the Chiefs ofStaff that at least the passive goodwill of Norway and sweden was essential, and in particular that of Sweden.It must be recognised that the case on which we should baseany action against the Narvik traffic was rather thin.It rested on t e sinking of three ships in Norwegiam

territorial waters, and two of these cases werecontested by Norway0    It would be hard, therefore, toshow that we were not using this action by Germany assa mere pretext for our own action0    But even this consideration   was not overwhelming, since it was highlyprobablo that the opinion of the neutral countries as awhole would be determined primarily by the attitude of sweden,    The Swedish attitude was therefore the key tothe problem,,He had hoped that M. Wallenberg would bringwith him suggestions for action of some sort to restrict the export of ore to Germany, but unfortunatelythis hope had not been fulfilled.    Mo Wallenberg had,on the other hand, made it perfectly clear that our proposed action at Narvik would be most distasteful to sweden for fear of the possible reactions of Germany,So far we had always thought that in the worst caseGermany would invade Sweden, but was it not perhapsmore likely that she would make an immediate approach to Sweden somewhat on the following lines :-&quot;You are faced with the prospect of military action by a powerful nation with no regard for neutral countries,,    Great Britain intends to use a very flimsy pretext to seize theorefields, which are of vital importance to us,and we shall have to take steps to preventthis0    We would far rather do this with yourpermission and consent.    Let us therefore send a German force to the minefields.    Thisprotection of your resources would be effective against Great Britain, but it would be equallyeffective against Russia, who must remain a danger to your security,&quot;Suppose the Swedes accepted such an offer.They might say, with some dust if publication, that we hadforced them to do so.    We should then have lost our whole chance of carrying through the big project

successfully.   He was much alarmed at this possibilityof our throwing Sweden into the arms of Germany by taking precipitate action now.It was certainly very trying to wait inapparent inaction, but we had to be sure that any risk that we took would bring us a corresponding return.With these considerations in mind he was not in favourof doing anything now about the Narvik traffic, but onthe other hand he was equally not in favour of doing nothing at all.    In view of what M. Wallenberg had said,it seemed that the present would be a very good moment to open negotiations with Sweden on a high level, say,through the Lord Privy Seal.   His conversations withthe Swedish Government might well open the way to securing their active co-operation.   With a friendlycountry on the shores of the Baltic, wide possibilitiesof offensive action against the enemy would be openedup.     In offering to send a Mission to Sweden weshould not give the impression that we had abandonedall idea of stopping the Narvik traffic, but weshould merely point out that in view of the vitalimportance of the iron ore questionse were proposing to send a member of the War Cabinet to discuss thewhole matter with them.   We could not, of course,be sure that this move would be Successful, but it seemed to offer a very good prospect of success.On the other hand one false step now would wreck our whole chance of success in the bigger project.   Inany case, in view of the telegram from Mr. Menziesit would be out of the question to take any immediate action against the Narvik traffic.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR suggested thatwhoever went to Sweden would have to be in a position totake a very stiff line with the Swedish Government.     Thematter was one of the greatest urgency to us since the bigproject seemed to be our only chance of ending the warquickly.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that it would be much easier to take a strong line in personal conversations thanin any exchange of diplomatic documents.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS warned the War Cabinet that M. Wallenberg was not a member of theSwedish Government, and it could not therefore be guaranteedthat his rather favourable reaction to the suggestion of possible collaboration between the Allies and Sweden wouldbe echoed by the Swedish Government.     It might, however,be an indication of the way their minds were working.     Wemust expect that when we proposed the despatch of a mission to Sweden they would express considerable alarm at thesuggestion, and we might have to use the threat of actionagainst the Narvik traffic as a lever to secure their consent.     Assistance to Finland could perhaps be used as acover for the despatch of the Mission.     Nevertheless, hewould not be at all surprised if von Ribbentrop arrived in stockholm on the heels of the Minister sent :?rom this country.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY urged that itwould be quite apparent to the Germans that the mission from this country was being sent to discuss the possibilityof stopping the export of ore.     It would surely be better to take naval action first and then to send our Mission,nominally on the pretext dealing with the protests which wouldcertainly follow^     To send a Mission before we did anythingat ail would be merely to advertise our interest in the iron ore and to direct German attention to it.     The Swedes wouldbe thereby emboldened to continue their protests.- 12 -

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he had kept the Dominion High commissioners in touch with the progress of the War Cabinet&apos;sdeliberations on the whole question.    They had not yet received definite instructions from their Governments-but their personal reactions might be summarisedas follows:-There is every justification for taking effective measures to deny ore to Germany if it is clearthat this can be effectively carried out andthat the stoppage will achieve an earlytermination of the war.    Germany would naturallydo her best to safeguard her ore supplies.    if she thought that our action would stop at the narvik traffic, she might not react strongly,but if she thought that this was only a preliminary to action against the Northernore fields she might invade Southern Sweden witha view to their protection.   Before therefore,weinvade Sweeten; we could take adequate counter^measures to prevent Sweden from being overrun.Apparently, hov/ever, we can do nothing till the spring, whereas Germany can at least obtain thefoothold in Southern Sweden immediately, whichwould give her a base for further operationslater in the year.It was clear that the co-operation of Swedenwas essential for our success and this could best be obtained by playing upon the naturaldesire of Sweden to help Finland.    It was of paramount importance to maintain finnish resistance to Russia and the only base through which assistance could be provided was; Sweden.If we forced Sweden prematurely into hostilities;with Germany, we should lose this base.A further consideration was the possibility of norway defending the neutrality of herTerritorial Waters against us by force. s  should we give way before Norwegian opposition or should we take extreme measures against herwarships?   If we did the latter we should haveto face great resentment in all neutral countries: throughout the world, and in particular in sweden

In short there was a grave risk of actionagainst the Narvik traffic alienating Sweden,which would be a major misfortune.     Theresult on Germany of stopping the Narviktraffic alone would not justify taking this risk.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat before deciding to give up the idea of stopping the narvik traffic he would like to be assured by the Chiefs*of Staff that we could in fact carry out successfullythe task of seizing the Northern mine fields.The co-operation of Norway and Sweden was essential to us if we were to lend support to Finland.If there was a continuous flow of assistance to Finlandthrough these countries they would be &quot;brought into the waratmosphere and there seemed every prospect that publicopinion of Scandinavia would be won over to co-operating with the Allies.     The threat of a German invasion of sweden would also help to turn opinion in Sweden in our favour.     The Swedes knew perfectly well that the germans were in fact making preparations for an oversea expedition.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that assistance to finland would be one of the best ways of bringing Swedea&apos;opinion over to our side.     He did not greatly fear theresult of the Germans sending Ribbentrop to Stockholmto bid against us.     It was clear that the weight ofpublic opinion in Sweden was already in favour of theAllies.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed outthat we should be asking the Swedes to fight for us,whereas the Germans would only be pressing them to remainneutral.     The Swedish Government was therefore more likely to listen to Germany than to us.     Moreover, itwas significant that Germany was supplying Sweden with   r^

Illmunitions to replace those which were being sent to finland.     Sweden would be very loth to have thissupply cut off.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had alwayshoped that it would be possible to stop the Narviktraffic, and he felt that the Scandinavian people wouldbe tremendously impressed by the effect of strong action he had been surprised to find that M. Wallenberg had made no proposals for co-operating with us in reducingsupplies to Germany.     Before any Minister was sent to sweden he thought we ought to make up   our   minds :-(a) not to withdraw the threat of actionagainst the Narvik traffic,(b) to be prepared, if necessary, to put this threat into effect,    and(c) how far we were prepared to go if Swedenrefused to co-operate at all.     Forexample, were we prepared in the last resort to go into Sweden and seize theNorthern mine fields by force?THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER expressed hisdisappointment that a project, which at first sight had seemed to provide such a promising opportunity forbreaking the chain of inaction, had been shown on examination to be fraught with such grave disadvantages.He had always felt sure that the Swedes would-react mostunfavourably when we told them that we proposed to carryour the Narvik project.     The real point, of course, wasto estimate the Swedish reactions after we had carriedout the project.     He asked the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs if he felt able to put forward any views

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that Swedish action would ultimately depend upon Russia&apos;s progress against Finland.     If the threatfrom Russia became intensified, no doubt Sweden would bevery ready to ask for our aid.     Public opinion would bebehind any such call.     But it would he a very different matter if we took action when public opinion was runningstrongly against us0       In his view on the larger projectsuocess would be., with.Swedish co-oTjeration..&quot;THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO thought that theWar Cabinet had always anticipated a severe reaction from Norway and Sweden when we informed them of our intentions.   He himself had discounted this beforehand.He had thought, however, that such reactions would be short-lived as, even after carrying out the Narvikproject, we should be co-operating with both countriesin the defence of Sweden, which would bring us together.The Swedish Memorandum was no stronger than he had anticipated.   He did not see the smallest prospectof Sweden being willing to discuss the larger projectat present.    They were much too apprehensive of Germany.As long as the Finnish front held, the Swedes would make no move in our direction.    If the Lord Privy Seal went to Sweden, he would have an extremely difficult task.He would have to be in a position to reassure the swedes that the Allies could give them sufficienthelp, in the event of a collapse of the Finnish front,to resist attack both by Russia and Germany.&quot;THE LORD PRIVY SEAL felt that a very greatstrain would be placed upon Finnish resistance in May.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY had no doubt in his mind how Sweden would rea^t   to the suggestion ofour sending a member of the War Cabinet to discuss matters.     The Scandinavian countries were dominated byfear, and when they saw that we had dropped our projectas a result of their protests, they would resist the suggested visit with redoubled vigour.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought thatwe should still hold out the threat of the narvik operation and should continue by all means in our power to urge the Swedes towards a moreaccommodating attitude,,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thathe had seen a great deal of   m* Wallenberg in thecourse of recent trade discussions,,       M* Wallenbergwas strongly pro-British and in favour of Sweden1seventual active intervention on the side of theAllies, but he was coneaioue of her great militaryweakness.      In his (the Secretary of State for War&apos;s)opinionP the best course would be to wait onthe development of the Russo-Finnish war and meanwhile to impress Sweden   with the help which theAllies could give her.     He doubted the advisability of sending a Mission to Sweden at the presentmomentP and suggested that a less obvious line ofcommunication should be used,THE PRIME MINSTER felt that our point ofview could be put to the Swedes with much moreforce by a Mission than through the diplomatic representation, and he thought that the possibilityof a Minister   going to Sweden should be fullyexplored.

THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY pointed outthat a flotilla could he sent in the teeth of a protest, hut not a Mission.    He was, however,prepared to accept the views which had been expressedby his colleagues.    He had, himself, been strongly infavour of carrying out the Narvik project, but in viewof the opinions which had been expressed by hiscolleagues and of the evident necessity to carry theDominions with us in any decision, he did not proposeto pursue the matter further,    He wished, however,to emphasise one point.     Up to the present he had felt that time was on our side, but he was not sure that this would continue to be so.    We had hoped thatour A-ir Force would gradually overhaul that ofGermanyj   but was it certain that after six months ofwar we should, in fact, have improved our positionin this respect?THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that theFrench air strength must be taken into account withour own.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that so many factors were involved that he would like time toconsider his reply,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY emphasised that Germany&apos;s central position enabled her to deliver threats in several directions,,   We mightwell have a much graver situation ahead of us andwe must redouble.our efforts to guard against it.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed with the /warning tone of the First Lord&apos;s remarks.     He suggested /that the Chiefs of Staff should examine the possibility   Iof capturing the ore fields in the face of Norwegian \and Swedish opposition.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSobserved that whatever the Chiefs of Staff might sayas to the practicability of such operations, on military grounds, he personally was unable to contemplate warwith Norway to capture Narvik.Continuing, he suggested that he and the lord privy Seal should discuss the question of sending a mission to Sweden and report to the War Cabinet.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY suggestedthat if we could impress on the Swedes our ability to capture the fields, they might be prepared to sabotagethe mines themselves, or to let us sabotage them.     Thiswould have the desired effect as far as we were concerned.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that as the first step we might suggest buying the mines.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought   thatthe Swedes would be too much afraid of Germany&apos;s reactions to agree to sell the mines.The War Cabinet -(i) Decided that no action should be taken for the time being to stop the traffic between Germany and Narvik by sending a Flotilla i$to Norwegian territorial waters:iIn reaching this deision the War cabinet were impressed by the risk that action at the present juncture in stopping the narvik traffic in Norwegian territorial waters might imperil the success of thelarger project, i.e., the complete stoppage of supplies to Germany from theNorthern orefields:

(ii) Agreed that no indication should be given to the Norwegian and swedish governments of the decision reachedunder (i) above, and that these governments should be left underthe impression that we still con-templated action to stop this traffic:(iii) Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Lord privy seal to consider the question of sending to Scandinavia a Mission headed by a member of the War Cabinet, andto report orally to the War Cabinet.(iv) Invited the Chiefs of Staff toconsider the possibility of capturingthe Galivare orefields in the face of norwegian and Swedish opposition.If it was thought a practicableoperation, what fores would it involve?Richmond Terrace, S.W.l.,lgth January, 1940.-SO-
