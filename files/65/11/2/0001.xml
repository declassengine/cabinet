THIS DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GO^ERNMeCt^^&quot;TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.27jjQST SECRET.COPY HQ. ^W.M. (40) 2nd CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.SCANDINAVIA.Paragraph S.(Importanceof Bergen tothe NorthernBarrage.)The War Cabinet again had before them thefollowing Papers:-Reports by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P.(39) 169,179 and 180):A Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (W.P. (40) 3)stogether witha further Report on the military consequences of aGerman occupation of southern Norway, and the steps which might be taken to obviate or at least mitigatethese consequences (W.P. (40) 5).    In the discussionof the latter paper, which was introduced by theChief of the Air Staff and examined paragraph by paragraph, the following were the principal points which emerged.( i) If the Norwegian coast at the eastern end of theNorthern Barrage was held by the Germans, they couldsweep a channel for their shipping close to the coast.If, on the other hand, Bergen, immediately to the southof which the barrage would end, was in our hands, weshould be able to make the barrage even more effective than if Norway was a neutral country.   It was, of course,possible that when the Germans learnt of our intention to lay the Northern Barrage, they would not hesitate to invade Norway in order to seize Bergen and thus preventthe barrage being fully effective.   A German invasionmight, therefore, be precipitated irrespective of any action we might take in connection with the iron ore

traffic.   This was a new aspect of the problem of the mine barrage which had not been considered at the timewhen the decision was taken to lay the barrage.paragraph 6.     (ii) It would be technically possible to mine theOslo. )approaches to Oslo, but there were obvious objections todoing so before the Germans made any move to invadeNorway.    It was open to question, however, whether theGermans would go so far as to land an expedition at Osloif they intended to seize bases in southern Norway.   Anattack on the capital would be the most serious affront to norway, and would be likely to rouse the whole populationagainst Germany.    Germany would, therefore, be more likely,if she decided to invade Norway as a result of our stopping the Narvik traffic, to seize some less important placeson the coast.    It was recognised, however, that if theGermans did move on Oslo, we could do little or nothing toprevent it.    In paragraph 82 of their previous Report-(W.P. (39) 179) the Chiefs of Staff had expressed theopinion that Oslo, being the capital, would be adequatelydefended by the Norwegians, but on more mature considera-tion, and taking into account the precedent of the Italianinvasion of Albania, they now thought that seriousresistance by the Norwegians was unlikely.Paragraphs (iii) While the Germans were establishing themselves at-9.(Ohristiansand) christians and, they would be most vulnerable to air attack,since they would not have had time to move in anti-aircraftartillery on any scale.    If, however, they invaded Denmarkat the same time, they would be able to operate fightersfrom Danish aerodromes to protect christians and.   On theother hand, it was doubtful whether it would be to thegeneral advantage of Germany to violate the neutrality of denmark.

Paragraph 11. (iv)   If we had previously occupied Bergen and Trondheim(Bergen andTrondheim)     it would &quot;be a difficult operation for the Germans to turnQ, us out, since they could only advance on a very narrowfront along the railways to those ports0Paragraph 13o (v)     If the Germans were to establish themselves in Oslo(Germanmaintenance   and Christiansand8 although their maintenance trafficproblem).would not be large?, they would be in a very uncomfortableposition, since we should be able to mine the approaches to these portsP   Maintenance by sea in face of thismenace and of cur surface vessels arid submarines would beprecariousoParagraph 14* THE PRIME MINISTER pointed cat that if we succeeded(Reductionof danger to   in confining the Germans to bases on the south coast a tour shippingconsequent on christians and and Oslo, it seemed that there must be somsdenying theWest Ooast      diminution of the unfavourable military consequences which of Norway tothe enemy).     would ensue to us from a German occupation of southern norway,     They would not be able to operate their aircraft from aerodromes on the west ooast, nor would they be ableto use harbours on this coast for submarine basesoMoreover, it appeared that the operation of aircraft fromthe Oslo aerodromes would present considerable difficultyowing to the intervening  mountains..THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that Oslo had twogood aerodromes from which modern types of bombers could be operated.     There was one similar aerodrome at christians and.Although the use of the Oslo aerodromes might be difficultat times during the winter, in summer there would be a veryserious threat to our shipping from bombers operating fromthese aerodromes in addition to the aerodrome at Christian-sands     By keeping the Germans out of the west coast theonly aerodrome which we could deny to them would be the onoat Stavangero     There was no aerodrome at Bergen,   He agreedthat the denial of the western coast to the enemy wouldcorrespondingly reduce the menace of enemy submarines.

Likelihood of Discussion ensued as to whether if the germany invadingNorway. seizure of ports in Southern Norway presented so great advantages to Germany, the latter was likelyto invade the country irrespective of our action as to the Narvik traffic.     THE CHIEF OF THEIMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF observed that the germans might well have a project for invading Norwaylater in the year.     At the present time the weatherwould make operations in the country very difficultindoed.It was agreed that the assessment of the likelihood of Germany invading Norway as a countermeasure to our stopping the Narvik traffic was apolitical matter, which was for the War Cabinet todeal with, and which did not lie within the province of the Chiefs of Staff.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that if germany invaded either Sweden or Norway, the mostintense feeling would be aroused in the peoples ofthese two countries, and their Governments would becorcp.elled to resist the invader, particularly inview of the gallant resistance of Finland to theRussian invasion.     In his opinion it was in everyway to our advantage to widen the front of the warand to reduce the number of neutrals, particularly those adjacent to Germany.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatany Norwegian invitation to us to come to her assis-tance involved a piece of very delicate timing.    Ifwe stopped the Narvik traffic, Norway would be boundto protest.     He did not think that the Germans had at the present moment a plan immediately ready forthe invasion of Norway and that they were merely

awaiting action by us against the Narvik traffic to give them a pretext for putting this intooperation.     They would no   doubt threaten Norway,but Norway would be taking a big risk in invitingour assistance, since this would almost inevitably lead to a German invasion of the country.     Norwaywould probably therefore wait as long as shepossibly could before calling for our assistance,and would only do so when she realised that she had to make the choice between two evils.     once the Germans had definitely invaded Norway, however,we should, of course, have the right to send inour own forces without any invitation, since the neutrality of Norway would already have beencompromised.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL doubted whether our action to stop the Narvik ore would precipitate aGerman invasion.     It would be very hard for germany to make a sudden swoop on Norway when shewas vigorously protesting against our action ininfringing Norwegian territorial waters.     On theother hand the possibility could not be ruled outthat Germany would take such action under theguise of &quot;giving protection&quot; to Norway.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY agreedthat, for Germany, it would not he at all anopportune moment, from the point of view of world opinion, to invade Norway at a time when she wasprotesting against our action.     There wouldprobably be a considerable period of protest andexplanation after we took action.     He thoughtopinion in the United States would be in our favour, but Germany would put herself completelyin the wrong in the eyes of the world if she chosesuch a   moment   to invade Norway.THE SEOREATY OR STATE FOR AIR drew attention to a Press report of a strong german note to Sweden warning that country of the dangerof lending aid to Finland against the Russians.This might conceivably be Germany&apos;s opening moveagainst the Scandinavian countries.The view was generally expressed thatthis action on the part of Germany, if it weretrue, was dictated primarily by the need for her to keep in with Russia.     It was quite possiblethat she was making a verbal protest to save facewith Stalin, but was all the time secretly allowingwar material to pass through to Finland.     In anycase, it was probable on general grounds thatGermany did not wish the war to spread to scandinavia.

Probableifl er cus s ionsof stopping the Narviktraffic.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he did not attach vory much importance to theprobable reactions of the Scandinavian countries tothe stoppage of the Narvik traffic, nor did he considerthat the possibility of the Germans seizing bases in southern Norway would be a vital factor. The considera-tion which weighed most with him was how the stoppingof the Narvik traffic would affect our chances ofCarrying through the bigger project of stopping allthe ore supplies to Germany.   The Narvik project by itself would not, in his opinion, be worth the risk.Whether or not it might prove a card of entry to the bigger project it was impossible to say.   From thepolitical point of view he did -not think it would prejudice the chances of the bigger project, but, on theother hand, he doubted whether it would improve them.There could be no doubt that, as the Chiefs of staff pointed out in the last paragraph of their latestReport, action against the Narvik traffic would attract German attention to the whole question of theSwedish ore.   On the other hand,  the Germans would notimprovelhetr position in regard to the ore by going towar with Sweden, nor by occupying bases in southern norway.   All that they could do apparently would be to try and wreck the railway from Narvik to the Galivaremines, in order to prevent our forces using it.   Theprospect of their taking any effective action to thisend seemed ^5 least doubtful.   They could not apparent-ly forestall us in the northern minefields .   It there-fore remained only to consider the possible reactions of Norway.   Norway would no doubt show considerableannoyance, but she would probably get over this. As hehad said at the previous Meeting, his view was that herattitude would be governed primarily by the Russiansituation.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY expressed his conviction that the Germans would not invade southern norway in retaliation for the stoppage of the iron ore from Narvik,   On the other hand, if they did invade Norway,he would he glad.   They would become involved in a seriouscommitment, and, if they tried to secure control of theSwedish iron ore by conquest, they would certainly ruintheir chances of obtaining a large quantity in 1940.   Inthe meanwhile, the immediate stoppage of the Narvik orewould prove embarrassing for them up till the melting of the ice, when a second chapter in the story would open.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Foreign secretary had drawn attention to the uncertainty of the results ofour proposed action.   The important point was not theimmediate results, but the question of whether we might beleft with permanent adverse consequences.    It was for thisreason that he had asked the Chiefs of Staff to examine further the possible consequences of our action, and what could be done to mitigate them.   They had carried out thisinvestigation, and the conclusion which he had drarn fromtheir Report was that we should be able to forestall germany in the occupation of the Western Ports of Norway, and that inthis event the results would not be seriously disadvantageous to us,He agreed with the First Lord that it was to theGerman interest to keep the war out of Scandinavia, and inconsequence he did not regard a German invasion of southern norway as likely.   Furthermore, the Chief of the LmperialGeneral Staff had told them that the weather at this time of year was all against an invasion of Norway by the Germans.Hewas inclined, therefore, to view the project far the stoppage

of the Narvik ore with mere favour than he had doneafter reading the earlier reports by the Chiefs of Staff.He agreed with the Foreign Secretary as tothe probable extent of the Norwegian reaction, and hethought re should go ahead and inform them of what we proposed to do.     We should, however, postpone a finaldecision to stop the Narvik traffic until we heard theNorwegian reaction.,     When a decision had been takento stop the Narvik traffic, we should make preparations for the forces which would be necessary if we had to occupy Stavanger and Bergen.He did not think the War Cabinet were in aposition to consider the separate project for stoppingore from Oxelosund, about which they had not yet received much information.Economic effects THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR enquired as to theof an invasion of        economic effect of the war spreading to southern Norway.Norway.THE MINISTER 01 ECONOMIC WARFARE said that thenegotiations between ourselves and the norwegian government which were now in progress for a War trade agreement would undoubtedly be -completely iipae L for thetimo be-ing.     We required from Norway the use of hertankers and the supplies of ferro-alloys and aluminiumwhich we drew from that country.     He felt reasonablyconfident that after some delay the negotiations for aWar Trade Agreement would be resumed and that we should get what we wanted in the end, since Norwegian trado wasvery dependent on this country.     Negertheloso if -mewere to lose vital supplies of ferro-alloys and aluminium

VitalImportance toGermany of theGalivare Ore.merely for the sake of the temporary advantage of stopping the supplies of ore from Narvik alone, thebalance would not he in our favour.     The game would only he worth the candle if we succeeded in stopping the wholeof the ore supplies from the North Swedish mines.   germany would gain nothing of vital importance to her economyfrom an occupation of South Norway.     The Norwegian outputof ferra-alloys and other commodities was dependent onsea-borne imports.     On the other hand the occupationof Norway would undoubtedly place some strain on german economy.     The Secretary of State for War observed that norway had to import considerable supplies of wheat, whichwe could cut off.     These might have to be made good fromGermany.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the germans might allow the Norwegians to starve.THE MINISTER OP ECONOMIC WARFARE explained thatthere was only one mine in the southern Swedish fieldswhich supplied iron ore with a high phosphoric content,whereas the whole output of the minefields was of highiron and phosphoric content.    If the supplies from theNorth Swedish fields were cut off, it would cause adisproportionately large reduction of German steel output,because German steel manufacture was dependent on anadmixture of ores of that type.       It was difficult toestimate the precise degree of embarrassment to germany which would result from the stoppage of the Narviksupplies, since we had no precise information of the size of her stocks of ore.    If she had two month&apos;s reserves inhand the embarrassment would be of &quot;brief duration,though he agreed that Germany would be very uncomfortable athaving to use up her reserves if there was no certainty of&quot;being able to replenish them as soon as Lulea was ice-free.

espatch of Discussion then turned, on the time-table foralitarys to     future action, and the period which must elapse beforeorts. the forces could be made ready to occupy Stavanger, Bergen,and Trondheim should this prove necessary.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said thatthe chief delay would be in obtaining the warm clothing forthe troops.   A force of only about 1,000 men would be requiredfor each port, initially at any rate, and these could soon be told off.He drew attention to the fact that the force atBergen would have to be increased before the snow melted,as it would then be necessary to occupy the surroundingmountains.    Be-cgen was a town with a population of 100,000,and was likely to assume great importance later on from a naval point of view.   We should have to be prepared,therefore, to hold it indefinitely.THE SECRETARY OF STaTE FOR WAR expressed hisopposition to the proposal to send military forces toany of these three Norwegian ports.   History provided manyexamples of campaigns which had begun by the despatch of minor detachments, and which had ended by swallowing uplarge armies.   He thought that a much more careful examination of the possible developments in Norway, andthe eventual size of the forces which might be required,should be undertaken before we launched these expeditions.Economically the Narvik project was most attractive.The Ministry of Economic Warfare had stated that the stoppage ofthe ore from that port, would oause the Germans acute embarrassmerij

and Herr Thyssen&quot; s Memorandum supported this view.The Norwegians and the Swedes both fully expected usto control the trade from Narvik.     This was clear fromthe   statements made in the enclosures to the Memorandumby the Minister of Economic Warfare (Paper No.W.P.(G)(39) 153, Part I, page 2, paragraph 4, and part II, page 6, paragraph 20).     He therefore favourednaval action to stop the trade, but if the Germansreacted by invading Norway, he would prefer to risk theconsequences, rather than to attempt to mitigate themby military expeditions.)If the Army were -to be used at all, he wouldrather see it operating in Finland, where it would bemuch better placed to intervene at a later stage to takecontrol of the Northern orefields.     The bigger operation for the control of the Northern ore might well decide the war, and we should keep cmr armies available totake part in it.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought thatif Germany invaded South-srn Norway we shorili be ready to sen-i*3ttalions at any :Tate to Stavanger and Bergen,     There wasno reason why this small diversion should develop into,a large commitment, unless we wished it to.     It shouldbe remembered, however, that the Chiefs of Staff, intheir earlier Report, had carefully examined thepossibility of having to support the Norwegians and the swedes against the Germans in the Spring, and wereprepared to send strong forces to do so if necessary.Such operations would be quite independent of thesmell detachment? holding the Norwegian ports, and would form part of the big project for controlling the Northern

ipcnfields, which might subsequently develop.     If theWar Office were unable to find the troops for thesedetachments, he would be prepared to use marines.Some discussion then took place as to whetherit would be sufficient to occupy Stavanger, and toleave Bergen and Trondheim till later.     Stavangerwas the most important of the places which the germans might wish to seize   in order to facilitate their aircperations over the Ncrth Sea,    whereas Bergen andTreadheim were probably too far afield to be occupiedby them at this time of year.     Furthermore, Stavangerwas an easy place f^r a small force to hold, and, iffound desirable, such a force oould be withdrawn at anytim/s after causing severe damage to the aerodrome.On the othor hand, the importance of Bergen tothe Admiralty&apos;s long term plans was emphasised, andTHE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that, if we did not oooupy Bergen at the outset, no c&amp;srOtel?&apos;)reliance could be placed upo3* the Norwegians preventing the Germans reaching it by the railway from Oslo indue course.     It would be extremely difficult to approachBergen, either by land cr sea, if it were held by a hostile foroe, and   very great advantages would accrue to the side which got there first.It was generally agreed that while the foreign secretary was making the necessary communications to theGovernments concernedr work should proceed on thepreparation of detailed plans for the forces requiredfor the occupation of the three ports concerned(Stavanger, Bergen and Trcndheim),   and that a study of the operative .nvolved should     also bo carried out.

G^nunicationto French,U.ScAcS andNorwegianGovernments;and to theDominions.Importanceof Secrecy.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it would be necessary  for him to communicate with the French Governmentand obtain their assent to the proposed communication tothe Norwegian Government.     He also proposed at the sametime to address a communication to the United StatesGovernment.     He then read out a draft of the proposedcommunication to the Norwegian Government, in which thefacts were given regarding the sinking of. three ships in territorial waters.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat he did not propose, for the present, to make any approach to the Canadian Government in regard to the suggested provision of Canadian troops for operations in scandinavia.     He would, however, keep the Dominion PrimeMinisters informed of the communications to be made by theForeign Secretary. w^c^U. U u*W&apos;tu. cv**u*&apos;*k.j&apos; LJvwuwV fafuxd  THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO suggested that theAdmiralty might examine whether any steps could be takento prevent German ships sinking themselves at the quays inNarvik, with the object of preventing iron ore reaching theBritish Isles.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theNaval Staff had made thorough investigations of the general problem of sabotaging the iron ore ports, and wouldcertainly bear this suggestion in mind.THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF drew the attention ofthe War Cabinet to the absolute necessity for secrecy inregard to this project approaching the stage for action.There had been considerable ventilation in the Press, and elsewhere, of the whole subject of Swedish iron ore, and theChiefs of Staff were concerned lest the enemy should getwind of our,intentions *

In the course of discussion the War cabinet were informed that a Minister had been approached by a representative of a Chicago newspaper, who said he had received certain information on this matterand had mentioned a particular Department as the source.The War Cabinet were informed that enquiries werebeing made to trace the leakage.     The discussions which were taking place in public, however, allemphasised the desirability of speed in the execution ofour plans.The War Cabinet:-(i)   Authorised the Secretary of State forForeign Affairss-(a) to inform the French Government thatwe proposed to make a communication tothe Norwegian Government on the lines indicated in (ii) below, and to obtain their concurrence to this action,(b) to inform the United StatesGovernment of the action proposed:(ii)   Authorised the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, subject to theconcurrence of the French Government,to inform the Norwegian Government that,having regard to the violation by german naval forces of Norwegian territorial waters, we were taking appropriatedispositions to prevent the shipment ofgoods down the Norwegian coast to Germany,and that for this purpose it would benecessary for H.M. Naval Forces at times to enter and operate in norwegian territorial waters:(iii)   Authorised the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to keep the dominion prime Minsters informed of the steps taken under (i) and (ii), but not forthe present to make any approachin regard to the suggested provisionof Canadian troops for operations in Scandinavia;

(iv) Agreed that orders should not heissued to enter Norwegian territorial waters until the reactions of theNorwegian Government to the communication referred to in (ii)had been reported to the War Cabinet:(v) Invited the Secretary of State forWar, in consultation with his service colleagues and the Ministerof Shipping, to arrange for thepreparation of detailed plans forthe occupation of Stavanger, Bergenand Trondheim and to submit a Reportto the War Cabinet as soon as possible,showing(a) What would be immediately involved;and(b) What might be involved at a subsequent date, in the aboveoperations.In particular sin early Report should bemade as to the earliest date onwhich the forces could be readyto saili(vi) Authorised the War Office to makepurchases of the special clothing,etc., required for the small forces which it was contemplated would benecessary for the initial occupationof the ports referred to in (v;s(vii) Emphasised the importance of main-taining the strictest secrecy inregard to this project.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,3rd January, 1940.
