THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this dooument.W.M.(40) 7TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 8.Confidential Annex.AHDINAVIA. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatraf&amp;QUB      his conversations during the last few days and the documentseference:,M.(40) 61h received on the subject of the action which we proposed toonelusions,minute 8.     take to prevent the use of Norwegian territorial waters byIGerman ships and trade might be summarised as follows:-(i) The reaction to our proposal by M. Colban, theNorwegian Minister, had been more severe than he (the Secretary of State) had anticipated.M. Colban had been deeply moved at the danger which would be caused to Norwegian interests andto the unpredictable consequences of our action.The same point of view had been reflected in theofficial note which he (the Secretary of State)had since received from the Norwegian Government,     \i,the terms of which were extremely sharp.     In &apos;jjaddition to this communication, the King of Norwayhad addressed a personal communication to HisMajesty   the King,    which M. Colban was to presentthat afternoon at 4.30 p.m.     In this communication  iKing Haakon spoke of having learnt with greatsurprise and consternation of the steps which wewere contemplating;(ii) In the case of Sweden no very severe reaction hadbeen anticipated in view of the conversation  -between Mr. Pollock and the Secretary-General ofthe Swedish Foreign Office about a week previously, jfWhen he (the Secretary of State) had communicatedour decision to M. Prytz, the Swedish Minister, theprevious Saturday (6th January, 1940) M. Prytzhad said that he was not surprised at the action we proposed to take.     He was, therefore, all the     !jmore surprised when the Note from the swedish government, which had now been received, contained* an emphatic protest at the action we proposed totake and offered no suggestion whatever as to iaction which might be taken by Sweden to meet our    jjchief requirement namely, the reduction of supplies iof iron ore  o Germany.     He (the Secretary of State);was still at.loss to account for the differences in attitude between the Swedish Minister and theSwedish Government.     It might be accounted forin part by the fact (regarding which however no       I]official information was available) that Swedenhad been exposed to sharp pressure by germany during the last few days, and in.part by the factthat apparently the Swedes had thought that it( would be possible for us to attain our ends in

this matter without sending our warships intoNorwegian territorial waters.   M. Prytz had expressed himself as greatly surprised that thiswas not possible;(ill) Since the interview recorded above he (theSecretary of State) had read an account of an interview between Mr. Hambro of the Ministry ofEconomic Warfare and the Swedish Minister.Mr. Hambro&apos;s interpretation of the Swedishposition threw the matter into a somewhat different light, since his general view wasthat the sharp reaotions on the part of boththe Swedish and Norwegian Governments shouldnot be taken &quot;au pied de la lettre&quot;.The whole question would no doubt need to be reviewed by theWar Cabinet in the light of the replies received from theNorwegian and Swedish Governments and of the effect which our action might be expected to have on neutral opinion.     It was relevant also to recall that hitherto we had regarded it asunlikely that the Germans were actually planning to take hostile action against Scandinavia, since we had thought that it wouldnot be in their interest to do so.     If, however, the germans were now to take such action, it would be the best thing whichcould happen from our point of view, since we should avoidincurring the odium of being the first to take drastic steps in scandinavia, and we should avoid also the risk of losingNorwegian good-will.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Note received from theSwediish Government was all the more surprising in view of thefact that at the interview on the 6th January, 1940, M. Prytzhad not only himself expressed no surprise at our contemplatedaction, but had made it clear that he thought that his government also would not react very unfavourably.     It was clear thatM. Prytz had been taken by surprise by the line adopted by hisGovernment, and this implied that the Swedish Government had altered their policy within the last few days, and had had no opportunity to acquaint M. Prytz of their latest attitude.    it seemed to him (the Prime Minister) that the Swedish Noteexpressed a sincere feeling of alarm and that this was most

likely due to threats made by Germany.     No doubt the swedish government were fully aware of the German preparations, includingthe training of parachute troops, the accumulation, and loadingof military stores in German Baltic ports and similar measures.THE MINISTER FOR 00-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE referredto Telegram (No. 10 dated 8th January, 1940) from His Majesty&apos;sGhargo d&apos;Affaires, Oslo, suggesting that if we continued to applypressure, the Norwegian Government might be brought to thepoint of forcing the ore ships from Narvik to pass out of territorial waters.     Was this line worth pursuing?     It shouldbe remembered also that the Germans were quite likely to seizeLulea in the spring when the ice melted, in order to preventthe ore fields from falling into Soviet hands.     The Swedeswould then want our help, and it would be too late for us to do anything, unless we had made the necessary preparations, whichthe chiefs of Staff had already said would take at least twomonths to mature.     For these reasons he was in favour of pressing on with&apos;such preparations.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that both from our own point ofview and from the Swedish he thought it advisable that we shouldbroaden the basis of our conversations with the Swedes, with aview to making them realise the dangers with which we should bothbe faced during the next six months and to bringing them overmore to our side,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreed generally , but thought it necessary to be careful to avoid giving ground to those in Sweden who already claimed that we were trying to bring Sweden into the War.     M. Prytz had been mostemphatic that^ Scandinavian opinion would be against us, ifany such idea were now allowed to take hold.     As regards the telegram which had been referred to by the Minister for Go-ordination of. Defence, he (the Secretary of State) did not thinkthat        Dormer&apos;s suggestion was practicable, since it wouldinvolve urging the Norwegians to take definitely unneutral actionagainst Germany.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that no doubt whatDormer had in mind was that if we had definitely made up our minds to stop the ore traffic from Narvik, it wouldbe worth putting his suggestion to the Norwegian Govern-ment;   that they would certainly reject it, but the factthat we had put it would assist us in the face of neutral opinion when we actually took action.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER enquired whether any further information had been received regarding thesuggestion thrown out to Mr. Pollock by the Secretary-General of the Swedish Foreign Office (as reported in telegram No. 7 dated 7th January, 1940) that Sweden mightbe willing to consider telling the German Government thatin view of certain threats received they could not supplyGermany any longer with iron ore from Narvik.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat no further information had been received on thispoint.     The latest document throwing light on the Swedishattitude was the report to which he had already referred byMr. Hambro of his interview with M. Prytz the previous evening, which was to the following effect:-M. Prytz had started the conversation by asking whether we realised that our present proposal forstopping ore ships from Narvik would result in scandinavia being brought into the war.      Mr. Hambrohad replied that he could not see why this should follow since if it did Germany would not only loseher Swedish ore supplies, but also her Danish foodproducts.     M. Prytz then said was it not possiblefor us to secure our object by some method which didnot involve the use of territorial waters.   Mr. Hambrohad replied that in our trade discussions it had always&quot;been understood between the Swedes and ourselvesthat the &quot;Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement&quot; on the subject of limiting ore supplies to Germany was not practicableunless &quot;we looked after Narvik&quot;.     He was, therefore,extremely surprised at the outburst by the Secretary-General of the Swedish Foreign Office unless this was done solely for the benefit of Germany.     M. Prytz had then asked whether we had any other reasons for theaction we proposed to take and to this Mr. Hambro had said that German submarines were already operating in norwegian territorial waters, that Norway had notprotested to Germany against this violation of her neutrality, and that we fpould not tolerate a one-sided neutrality of this kind.     In reply to a question by M. Prytz, Mr, Hambro had said that he did not know

whether we should pursue our proposal to interceptshipping in Norwegian territorial waters if allshipments of ore were stopped.     M. Prytz had thensaid that the Secretary-General&apos;s outburst was apiece of diplomatic play-acting;   he (M. Prytz) wasnot surprised at the action we proposed to take and thought that we should go on with it.     The Norwegiansno doubt would make loud complaint and would try topass the responsibility on to Sweden.     In answer tothe question whether he had any suggestion to offer,M. Prytz had said that according to his informationthere was a point just south of Narvik where, if ships were to remain in territorial waters, they had topass through a dangerous channel, the alternativebeing to steam for two hours outside territorial waters.      Ships would not be prepared to attempt thischannel without Norwegian pilots.     Would it not bepossible for us to buy off these pilots, and so forceships using this route to leave territorial waters?As regards the shipping which the Norwegians had undertaken to charter to us, the view expressed by Mr. Hambro was asfollows:-The Norwegians could not afford to lay up their ships and in war time they could only find employment by chartering them to us.     The Norwegian government regarded the Shipping Agreement which we had madewith the Norwegian ship owners as being highlyfavourable to Norway and as likely through taxationto provide the sum required to pay for the limited measure of rearmament now being undertaken by Norway,,Por these reasons it was thought that Norway relied upon the Shipping Agreement and would carry out its provisions even though for the moment owing to fearof Germany this was not the case.It was pointed out in discussion that if we \7ereto act, we should do best to act quickly and decisively.The quicker we acted the less would be the opposition in norway and also in Sweden.     It was the fact that woappeared tsp be hesitating which stimulated fresh fears ir.Scandinavia and consequently fresh opposition.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that prior to reading ,these reports by Mr. Hambro, he had been considerablyimpressed in the first place by the extent to whichthe Norwegian reaction coupled with the appeal of norway might have a damaging    effect    on    us     in

the judgment of the world, and in the second place by thefeeling that, if later we were to pursue the large projectwhich the War Cabinet had discussed at previous Meetings,it was essential to avoid creating a feeling of embitter-ment in Norway and Sweden, which would almost certainlyhappen if, through our action, they became involved in warwith Germany.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had always been agreedthat it would be impossible for us to contemplate sendingan expedition to the mines at G-alivare unless we succeeded in securing at least the acquiescence both of Norway and sweden.   He agreed that it was not possible for the WarCabinet to reach a final decision at that Meeting as tothe action now to be taken, and he proposed, therefore,that the matter should be further discussed at the meeting to be held the following day.   In the meanwhile it wouldbe useful if the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs would circulate the Memorandum by Mr Hambro to which he had referred.   There was also the subsidiary problem of the ore from Oxeloesund.    It would, he thought, be of convenienceto the War Cabinet if he were to examine this question inconsultation with the Ministers primarily interested.The War Cabinet agreed  (a) To consider further the proposal to prevent theuse of Norwegian territorial waters by german ships and trade at their Meeting to be held onWednesday, 10th January, 1940:(b) To take note that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs proposed to circulate theMemorandum prepared by Mr Hambro:(c) To take note that the Prime Minister proposedto examine the special problem of the exportof ore from&quot; Oxeloesund in conjunction with the-Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence, the Minister without portfolio and the First Lord of the Admiralty.Richmond Terra.ce, S.W.1, ...9th January, 1940.
