THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;8 GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.COPY NO.     S.0W.M.(40V 9TH CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.SCANDINAVIA.(previous reference:W.M.(40) 8thConclusions.Minute 7).THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that M. Wallenberg, who had led the SwedishDelegation during the War Trade negotiations had arrived in England the previous night, and he had arranged to see him at 3 o1clock that afternoon.     he proposed to ask him whether he brought any messagewith him from Stockholm^and generally to discuss thewhole situation.During the discussion at the meeting of theWar Cabinet noted in the margin, Ike had been concerned at the statement of the President of the Board ofTrade, regarding the position of our own steel industryin the event of the Norwegian Government deciding to stop all exports of ore from Narvik, thereby cutting off our supplies of Swedish ores.     He had accordinglyconsulted the steel control at the Ministry of Supply.The latter had reported that we had at the present timesix weeks stock in the country but that within thenext four weeks stocks were expected to rise owingto the opening up of the export of Spanish ore to thiscountry, and also to increased supplies expected from narvik.     If ores from the latter source were cut offit was anticipated that alternative sources of supplycould be arranged in a period of about six weeks.mm ^1 -

THE PRIME MINISTER said that, owing to theirchemical content, ores from different fields were notinterchangeable.       It might well happen that some blastfurnaces in this country which were specially equipped for dealing with Swedish ores might have to close down,for a time at least, if supplies from that source were cut off.     The information now available regarding stocks in this country introduced a new and disturbing factor,but not one which in his (the Prime Minister1s) opinion was sufficiently serious as to place an absolute bar uponthe action we had contemplated, since it was unlikelythat the Norwegians would actually go to the length of stopping all ore supplies without more ado.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had always contemplated that the Norwegians mightcut off all supplies;   but hitherto it had seemed thatthis would hurt the Germans more than us.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY did not believethat the Norwegian Government would act in this way.They had done nothing when Germany had sunk three ships in their territorial waters.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that it was likely that in any case we should have some breathing spaceduring which we could bring up new arguments and perhapsnew threats.     In any case, at the worst, we should notbe faced with more than a temporary stoppage of thoseblast furnaces in this country which depended uponSwedish ore.     If Norway were convinced that she couldextract herself from her present difficulties by denyingSwedish ore both to the Germany and ourselves, no doubtshe would adopt that course.     In fact, however, thiswould not bring an end to her troubles and she would almost certainly realise this.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said thatthe discussion showed the importance of our pressing on with the obtaining of ore from alternative sources of supplycTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSC thought it would be useful to consider whether it was worth pursuing the idea thrown out by M. Prytz, theSwedish Minister, during his interview with Mr, Hambro,namely, that we might secure our ends by an arrangement with the Norwegian Government under which Norwegianpilots would be refused for ore ships passing downNorwegian territorial waters.     If, in fact, it wouldbe necessary for ore ships to leave territorial watersif Norwegian pilots were not available, we should bejustified in saying to the Norwegian Government thatwe realised that they had not the power to preventthe violation of their neutrality by Germany;    butthat in our opinion the least which they could andshould do would be to refrain from assisting germany by providing pilots for their shipsoConsiderable discussion ensued on thissuggestion.     It was pointed out that, owing to thedifficulties of navigation, ore ships would find greatdifficulty in navigating   wholly within territorial waters, and they might well be compelled to leaveterritorial waters at a point not far south of Narvik.It was suggested that it was worth considering whether we should not tell the Norwegian Government that theycould preserve at least a semblance of neutrality by saying that no ore ship from Narvik would be given a norwegian pilot.

It was pointed out, however, that the germans would immediately see through a device of this kind, -and would continue to exert pressure on MorwayFurther,difficulties might arise owing to local port regulationscontaining a provision insisting on the employment of apilot &quot;by ships leaving port.   Generally, it was thoughtthat the pilot scheme would not prove water-tight:   forexample, if only ore ships were prohibited from usingpilots, and other ships were allowed to use them, itwould be possible for an ore ship to use territorial waters by following close upon a ship, not carrying ore,which had a Norwegian pilot on board.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO thought that the^pilot plan offered no advantage over that suggested byMf Dormer, namely, that the Norwegian Government shouldprohibit the use of territorial waters by ore ships ofall kinds.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought that itwould be far better for the Government to allow theAdmiralty to send destroyers to round up some of the oreships in Norwegian territorial waters and then see what happened.   Personally, he die&quot; not think that anythingwould happen, apart from protests.   Alternatively, theAdmiralty might be allowed to lay a minefield in norwegian territorial waters.. This had beenshis original proposal, and had only been abandoned in favour of the later plan&apos;in deference to Foreign Office wishes.Whatever course was decided upon, it was essential thatwe should now act decisively.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was not greatlyconcerned with the effect on Norway of any action we might take;    he did, however, attach great importanceto our not alienating Sweden, since their acquiescenceat least was essential if later ve were to proceed withthe larger project.   If he could be satisfied as to sweden&apos;s probable reaction,.he would be prepared to goon with the Narvik plan. .

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that it wasnot without significance that the Swedes themselves wereevacuating towns and taking other precautions against attack.They knew who was their real enemy,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat he had discussed the question with the Dominion high commissioners.    The conclusions which they had reachedpersonally, hut which did not necessarily represent theviews of their Governments,might he summarised as follows:-The first question was whether there is anystrategic ground for wishing Scandinavia to become a theatre of war other than the importance of the iron ore fields there.    If the answer was in the negative,the question then resolved itself into one of thebest methods of preventing Germany from obtaining supplies of iron ore from Sweden,    It seemed clearthat it was absolutely vital for Germany to obtainthis ore.As regards the methods of stopping the ore,the first question was whether we could do this by our own action.    It was understood that Sweden wouldnot agree to sell us all the ore since Germany would regard this as inconsistent with Sweden&apos;s neutrality.We could not urge the stoppage of all ore from sweden to belligerents, since it was essential to us toobtain our share of the supply available.   We couldnot stop the supply of ore to Germany by forcewithout Swedish help.    The only practicable method,therefore, of stopping the iron ore was to getSweden into the war on our side.    Before deciding to work for this, we must be satisfied that we werein a position to afford sufficient assistance to sweden to prevent Germany from over-running sweden and securing possession of the whole of the minefieldsfor herself, thereby depriving us of the importantsupplies we at present drew from that source.The proposed interference with German sea-bornesupplies from Narvik must be considered in the light .of the above.    Interference would appear unwise if it involved any grave risk of arousing deep resentmentin Sweden which would be prejudicial to the majorobject of securing Swedish belligerency on our side.The stoppage of the Narvik supplies alone wouldappear to be a doubtful gain, of limited magnitudeand short duration, unless it helped towards the stoppage of supplies from Lulea later in the year.The most hopeful approach towards thepossibility of securing Swedish belligerency on our side appeared to be by giving every encouragement to sweden to assist Finland in her defence against theU.S.S.R. - a path which she appeared to be notunwilling to take.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thaton this line of reasoning nothing in fact would hedone.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the &quot;best we could hope for was that the *Narvik project would not affect the Lulea plan...THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was&quot;possible that the putting into effect of the Narvikplan might actually assist the Lulea plan.    Itwould create a new situation in Scandinavia whichmight lead Sweden in the right direction.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that in thepresent circumstances neutrals were impressed only by a show of strength.THE PRIME MINISTER said that at theiismeeting on the following day the War Cabinet wouldlearn the upshot of the discussion that afternoonbetween the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and M. Wallenberg.    It should then, he hoped, bepossible for the War Cabinet to reach a finaldecision.The War Cabinet agreed:-To continue their discussion of thequestion of Scandinavia at their meeting to be held on Friday, 12thJanuary, 1940.
