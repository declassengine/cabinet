(40) 2ndConclusions,[limite l).W.M.  (40) 3RD CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE  9,Confidentia 1. Annex,.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the previous day he had handed to M. Corbin,the French Ambassador, for transmission to the FrenchGovernment, the draft of the communication which, as agreed at the meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin, we proposed to address to the norwegian government on the subject of the prevention of the shipment to Germany of goods down the Norwegian coastcM, Corbin had said that he anticipated that the FrenchGovernment would concur in the action which we proposedto take and had inquired whether we wished them to takecorresponding action.    To this he (the Secretary of State)had replied in the negative,,    He expected to receive theFrench Governments reply that day0He (the Secretary of State ) had also had along talk with M, Prytz:,  the Swedish Minister, who had given him the reply of the Swedish Government to the approach which we had made to them on the subject of thegrant of assistance to Finland and other Scandinavianproblems0     This might be summarised as follews:-- The Swedish Government had examined thecorfflmanication received from the British andFrench Governments, whose views they fullyshared as to the need for giving aid to... Finland, for the. fate of that country couldnot be a matter of indifference to Sweden,For that reason Sweden was herself doing everything possible to assist Finland, short of taking military action,    In addition she hadgranted financial aid to Finland, on a scaleconsiderably more extensive than had beenreported in the Press0    She regarded as even

more important the help which she had given bythe delivery to Finland of a quantity of rawmaterials which she had reason to know had provedof the greatest value.   She had also provided equipment for foreign,volunteers to proceed to Finland.    the help which she had rendered was so extensive thatit was necessary for her now to replace her ownreserves from abroad.    In addition she was doing everything possible to strengthen her power todefend herself.    It was only natural therefore that the Swedish Government should welcome assistancebeing given to Finland by other countries also.She would therefore facilitate the transit to finland of material sent by Great Britain and France.There were, however, certain special consider-ations to which she wished to draw the attentionof this Government.There was a danger that either Germany or theU. S.S.R. might intervene if it could be shown thathelp were being given directly by Sweden to Finlandagainst the Soviet Union,       if Sweden placedherself in the position of taking part in allied action against the U.S.S.R.     Such intervention by either Germany or the U. S. S.R. would certainly lead t o the speedy downfall of Finland.   accordingly the Swedish Government felt that it was important that nothing should be done which would suggest that sweden was cooperating officially with othercountries against the Soviet Union.    For example,people proceeding to Finland to fight should go as foreign volunteers.    Sweden, however, would do everything necessary in the way of organisingtransit facilities.It was particularly important in all thesematters that nothing should be published regardingthe nature of the assistance given.    The swedish government concluded their Note by stating their view that the best way Sweden could assist Finlandwould be to maintain the strict neutrality which she had declared at the outbreak of war.    TheSwedish Government greatly appreciated theunderstanding of her position shown by the Britishand French Governments.In the discussion with M, Prytse which had ensued,the following points had emerged:-No direct pressure other than newspaperattacks had as yet been exerted on Sweden   either by Germany or the U.S.S.R.     In these circumstances,the Swedish Government had felt that it would be premature to enter into discussions on the lines which we had suggested,    it was? for this reason thatthis matter had not been touched upon in the swedish government^ reply.    Sweden would, however,facilitate in every way the giving of help t*Finland on Spanish Non-intervention lines.   For thepresent at least the best course would be for Sweden

fto maintain her attitude of strict neutrality.    Tniswould not be possible if she entered upon discussions of the kind we had proposed.   M, Prytz had added that sweden was somewhat alarmed at the plan believed to be entertained by Prance for the desptach to Finland of. ,aid in an official form (e. g, Alpine regiments)-,    direct assistance to Finland by the Allies of this kind againstthe U. S. S.R. would not be helpful at the present stage.In reply to an observation that, if at some later stage we were to wish to give definite aid,the cooperation of Sweden was essential, M. Prytz had said that it would not be wise to pursue this subject at the present time.    In reply to a further question hehad agreed that if Germany were to invade Southern Sweden,she would be cutting off all her supplies of iron ore. he did not believe that Germany would act in this way sinceto do so, she would have to invade Denmark also and thiswould upset her food supplies and he felt sure that stepsmust have already been taken to prepare if necessaryfor the destruction of the railway between Narvik andthe ore mines.In the Swedish Press suggestions were appearingthat the Allies thought that it would be to their advantage if the war were extended to Sweden, and itwould be helpful if this could be contradicted in&quot;The Times&quot;.He (The Secretary of State) had then observedthat if Finland were defeated there was a danger thatGermany might offer to &quot;protect&quot; Sweden against theU.S.S.R.     To this, M. Prytz had replied that Sweden inthat case would fight.    He did not however think thatGermany was likely to act in this way or that this situation was likely to arise, since the U.S.S.R. wouldbe exhausted by the time they had defeated Finland.The conversation had then reverted to thequestion of iron ore, and he (The Secretary of State)had said that he regarded this as one of the most tenderspots in the whole of German economic life.   M.. Pryta had agreed amd had said that the Swedish mobilisation had ledto a 20 per cent reduction in the supply of ore to Narvikfor export.     He went on to say that there was a good dealof ore going to Germany through Narvik and that surely-there was a point along the Norwegian coast where theships carrying ore had to pass out of territorial waters.Would it not be possible for us to do something at sucha point?     He (The Secretary of State) had replied thatnaturally we were giving close consideration to thisquestion which, however, presented certain technical difficulties.     His Majesty&apos;s Government, however,were continuing to give careful consideration to thewhole question, and it might be that he should wish   ona future occasion to speak to him again upon it.

Tliiii caiiaF Off iiJV/iL ST.-i.ffff said that in fact therewas no point at which it v/as necessary f&quot;r the ore ships toleave territorial waters.that the Germans might not only sink ships alongside thequays at Narvik to prevent us from using the port, hut might also arrange for the sabotage of the^failway between-Narvik.....and the ore mines.   He wondered, therefore&apos;, if it would bepossible for the Secretary of State for fforeign affairs,when making the contemplated communication to the norwegian government, to drop a hint that they would be well advised tothat he would adopt this suggestion,.   As regards the methodto be adopted in making the communication to theNorwegian Government, he proposed to do this by sending forM. Colban, the Norwegian Minister.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that he fearedtake such steps to ensure the safety of the SECRETARY Off STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said the War Cabinet took note of the abovediscussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.4th January, 1939,

/mgTS POCmCENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,.)- MOST SECRET -W-M* (40. 3rd CON0T.TTSTONST MINUTE 12..Confidential Annex.GERMANY. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatpossible some time previously he had met, by accident, a Swede whodevelop-aent of was a friend of Field-Marshal Gpering&apos;s brother-in-law, and policy.who had on that occasion developed the familiar theme thatField-Marshal Goering would, in certain circumstances, beprepared to treat with the Allies.   On this occasion, he had stated that the Field-Marshal was perfectly loyal to herr hitler, but would be ready to look him up immediately theright moment arrived.   He had now been furnished with a personal letter to a friend in England, written by the sameSwede, who was now back in Sweden.   At the end of this letter, the remainder of which dealt entirely with personalquestions, the writer had said that a German, who was in contact IgBiEk with both Herr Hitler and Herr von Papen, andhad been touring Scandinavia doing German propaganda, had recently been to see his (the writer&apos;s) publisher, to whom he had given the following picture of conditions in Germanyt-&apos;.......-\Germany was tired of the war, and had neverexpected tha  we should go to war with her ifPoland were invaded.   Herr Hitler, on going toWarsaw, had been deeply shocked at the effect ofair bombardment, and had given orders that any german pilot who bombed an open town should beput to death.   In fact, no open towns had been bombed by Germany, and none would be bombed.Herr Hitler was now prepared to give guaranteesin the form of de-militarised territory along the Rhine and also perhaps in Hanover.   On theSwedish publisher asking what Herr Hitler expected in return, the German replied &quot;only peace&quot;.This was certainly a strange tale;   and it was perhapssignificant that such stories should be spread about byGermans in neutral countries.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.ehmondd Terrace, S.W.1,4th January, 1940.
