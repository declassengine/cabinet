COPY HO.      *****W.M.(40) 1ST CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 1.Confidential Annex.SCANDINAVIA. THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF, introducing the Report &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff Committee onthe military implications of a policy aimed atstopping the export of Swedish iron ore toGermany (W.P.(39) 179), emphasised the followingpoints(a) The Chiefs of Staff recommended thatthe project for the complete stoppage ofthe export of Swedish iron ore to germany should be carried out, in spite of the risks involved, on the assumption that its success would &quot;be decisive on the duration of the war.(d) If this recommendation were accepted,Scandinavia would have to he regarded, forthe time &quot;being, as the decisive theatre ofwar.     Subject to being secure at home andin France, all else would have to berelegated to second place.8

(c) Operations undertaken in Scandinaviamight make it hard for us to fulfil our commitments to   Turkey, if Germany decidedto march into the Balkans.(d) A result of our action, might he torouse Russian hostility.    In this event we might experience difficulty in finding the air forces required in India.(c) The crucial factor in the whole problem was time.     Germany might decide to attempt desperate measures, in orderto bring about our defeat before shesuccumbed as a result of being deprived of iron ore.     The crucial question,therefore, was whether the cutting off of swedish iron ore would bring about aGerman collapse in a sufficiently short time.(f) The operations which we might have toundertake in Southern Sweden, would not bemilitarily desirable but would be theprice we should have to pay for Swedishco-operation in the Northern project.(g) Finally, Norwegian and Swedish assentwas vital for the execution of the majorproject.Turning to the second Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee, on the balance of advantagebetween the major and minor projects (W.P.(39) 180),THE CHIEF OF THE AIR STAFF said that the Chiefs ofStaff had reached the conclusion that, if it weredesired to undertake the major operation, it wouldbe unsound to attempt the minor operation of

stopping the trade from Narvik in the meanwhile.If we did so, two unfortunate resultsmight ensue.     We might antagonise the Norwegians,and possibly the Swedes, and thus make it most unlikely that they would co-operate with us in thelarger project.     Secondly, we might give theGermans a pretext for immediate demands on norway and/or Sweden.     The Germans might require the norwegians to give them bases from which to operate against this country (which would be violatingNorwegian territorial waters), under threat of bombardment from the air, or invasion.If this happened, the Norwegians wouldprobably ask us for help, and we should have toinform them that we could do nothing effectiveuntil March.     In these circumstances, the Norwegiansand the Swedes might accept the German demands, inthe hopes that they would, at any rate, be protectedfrom Russia.The discussion then turned on the effecton Germany of cutting off supplies of Swedish iron ore.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that theChiefs of Staff repeatedly emphasised that theconclusions they had reached depended entirely on the accuracy of the premise that, by deprivingGermany of Swedish iron ore, the duration of thewar would be profoundly affected.     He enquire whether the Minister of Economic Warfare was satisfied on this point.

SIR FREDERICK LEITH-ROSS said that while it wasimpossible to be dogmatic on,the point, the expertswere agreed that a complete stoppage of Swedish iron orewould prove decisive in the long run, though it was notpossible to specify precisely the length of the period for which Germany could last out.    It was thought thatthe period might be in the neighbourhood of a year.    Thelength of this period depended on what alternative sources of supply were available to Germany.   For example, therewas a large quantity of scrap iron in Poland which couldbe utilised in the production of steel.    There was a production of 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 tons from the southSwedish orefields, which might still be available to theGermans, and there was a possibility of the supply ofsome ore from Russia..An estimate based on the best available information indicated that the^ German stocks of iron oremight be a&amp;ggfcdawo up- ywiueiblythpo^. million tons.    Itwas not possible to estimate their stocks of steel,THE PRIME MINISTER enquired on what hypothesisthe estimate that Germany might last a year withoutSwedish iron ore was based.   He suggested that much would depend upon whether the German armed forces were fully engaged on major operations or not. ^     -SIR FREDERICK&apos;LEITH-ROSS said that tibn .0 at iron fa--hml nuL Tflfeeh babcd uu umitiimuua uPPmsive ppayutioatKfOn the other hand, if no serious operations were undertaken, there was no doubt Germany would be

able to last longer.   Normally abfinfe 75 per cent, oftheir steel production was used for civil purposes.Much of this production had probably already been diverted to munitions, but no doubt a still largerdegree, of diversion would enable the supply of munitions to be maintained for a longer period.In further discussion the view was generallytaken that, although the effect of cutting offSwedish ore would be gradual, and the time taken tobring about a collapse might be long, nevertheless inthe end it would be decisive.THE PRIME MINISTER referred to the paper bythe Minister of Economic Warfare on the stoppage of iron ore from Narvik prepared on 18th December, 1959,(W.P.(G)(59) 155).    In paragraph 4 of Part I of thefirst enclosure to that paper, it was stated that:-&quot;the representatives of the swedish government have privately undertaken by various means to reduce iron ore shipments to Germany to the lowest point possible without provoking German reprisals uponSweden.    This secret undertaking, however,was only given on the understanding andin the expectation that shipments of orevia Narvik would be prevented by us.&quot;!It looked from this statement as if the swedes were depending on our stopping the Narvik trade.As this appeared to be at variance with the reportsrecently received from our Minister in Stockholm,he asked for further details.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had just received a Memorandum fromMr. Pollock, First Secretary at our Legation in Stockholm,from which he read the following extracts:-&quot;Before I left for London the Secretary Generalof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked me tocome and see him and in the course of our conversation he asked me to visit him again on myreturn.     This I did this morningcI reminded Monsieur Boheman that he had previously told me that the Germans were claiming that they could run ships down from Narvik withinterritorial waters and that this would make it very difficult for the Swedish Government to keepdown the total of exports of iron ore to Germanyunless we could &quot;do something about it&quot;.     I now asked him what he meant by the suggestion thatwe should &quot;do something about it&quot;, particularly ashe was doubtless aware that it was not necessaryfor merchant ships to leave territorial waters.He said that he had not meant anything definiteexcept that the Anglo-Swedish Trade Agreement hadbeen negotiated on the assumption that the germans would not be able to use Narvik.     I said that wehad just received definite information that a numberof British vessels had been sunk within norwegian territorial waters, and I wondered what the Swedishreaction would be to some drastic action on our part to stop the German trade from Narvik and Murmansk.He said:    &quot;None at all, as it was a purelyNorwegian affair&quot;o     At the same time he admitted that it was always a nuisance to neutral Stateswhen belligerents began operating within neutralterritorial waters and the Swedish governmenth oped that any action on our part would not resultin Germany retaliating by taking similar actionwithin Swedish waters.I then asked him about Lulea.     He said thatthe port had frozen up entirely about ten days ago and that the Germans had asised the Swedes to usean icebreaker to release the German ships which werefrozen up in the port.     The Swedes had refused todo this on the grounds that the icebreaker was required elsewhere for keeping Swedish territorial waters open.     Nevertheless the German ships hadbeen able to get away*     The Germans had alwaysassumed that Lulea would be closed completely afterDecember 15th and Monsieur Boheman did not thinkthat any attempt would be made to re-open it untilthe Spring.     I said that I had heard rumours thatthere was a Russian icebreaker available but

Monsieur Boheman said he thought this unlikelyand that it would in any case he difficult for the icebreaker to get past the minefieldsnear the Aland Islands.Monsieur Boheman mentioned that eighthundred employees of the Grangesburg company had been mobilised and that this was likelyfurther to slow down the Company&apos;s activities.,XX XI then said that, speaking entirelypersonally, it seemed to me that the important thing was that neither His Majesty&apos;s Governmentnor the Swedish Government should be taken bysurprise by some sudden.action on the part ofGermany or Russia or the two combined in scandinavia.     Neither His MajestyTs Governmentnor the Swedish Government wanted Scandinaviato be involved in the war and the only point onwhich they might possibly disagree, namely, thatof trade with Germany, was for the time being settled by the signature of the war trade Agreement.     But there was a danger that they might both be taken by surprise bysome sudden action and owing to the lack oftime fail to deal with it as they would havedone had they been fully prepared for eventualities.In these circumstances, I felt sure that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were constantly turningover in their mind what action, if any, theywould take in the event of some drastic stepby Russia or Germany.     We at this Legation could help them in two ways:    one, by reporting how the Swedish mind was working on the same problem and, two, by reporting any information inpossession of the Swedish Government as to how the minds of other Governments were working.     it seemed to me that if the Swedes could give us any information on these points it could not beotherwise than to our mutual advantage as itwould enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to bemore fully prepared without committing either government to any definite action.     MonsieurBoheman said that he entirely agreed and hepromised to take us into his confidence and let us know directly he had anything to sayoAt present he was honestly completely in thedark as regards both Russian and german intentions...........n

THE PRIME MINISTER said that this letteransweredhis question and &quot;confirmed his view that,in considering action to stop the trade from Narvikit was necessary to draw a distinction between there-actions of Sweden and Norway.     Sweden could hardly he implicated as, once the ore had reachedNarvik it was no^ longer her concern;   and there seemed no reason to suppose that Germany could findjustification for invading Sweden on account ofaction by our Naval Forces in Norwegian territorial waters.     A much more likely form of retaliation byGermany would be to seize bases in Norway as suggested in paragraphs 77 and 78 of the Chiefs ofStaff&apos;s Report (W.P.(39) 179).     Prom those para-graphs it appeared that there was little we could do to prevent Germany seizing these bases, fromwhich they could develop a most serious air threat.The Chiefs of Staff further gave their opinion inparagraph 81, that it would be difficult to dislodgethe Germans once they were established, and that itwas therefore essential to forestall them by sendingsmall forces to occupy these places.     Finally inparagraph 85 it was stated:-(a) Our intervention in NorthernScandinavia is very likely to provoke a German attack on Southern Norway *The object of that attack would beto obtain air and naval bases fromwhich to dispute our position inthe North Sea and Northern waters.XXX X X

(c) In our own interests we consider it essential that the Germans should,if possible, he denied &quot;bases on theNorwegian Coast.     The establish-ment of such German bases would notonly gravely compromise our navalcontrol, but also the security ofany bases we established at Trondheim.This was strong language, and showed thatthis was the most important factor governing the narvik operation.       The First Lord of the admiralty in his comments (W.P.(40) 3) had suggested stopping the Narvik ore as a means of provoking retaliationby Germany, and so getting Norway to ask for our assistance.     The crux of the matter appeared tobe whether Norway would act in that fashion.     she might adopt quite a different attitude.       she might place herself under German protection,especially when she found we could give her no effective aid.     If the Norwegians acted on those lines there would be an end to any hope of ourcarrying out the major project.Discussion then turned upon the probableNorwegian attitude, and the German re-action.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR argued that the stoppage of the Narvik trade was aperfectly legitimate operation in retaliation forthe sinking of British ships in Norwegian waters,and would be unlikely to antagonize Norway or to provoke Germany into invading her.     He hadreceived information before the war pointing tothe existence of a German plan for the invasion ofSouthern Norway.     He thought that if Germany decided

that it would he profitable to put this plan intooperation she would do so irrespective of whether we stopped the Narvik trade.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thoughtthat the sequence of events would probably be asfollows.     Norway would make a protest at our action.A German re-action might then follow, possibly inthe form of an invasion.   The effect of this wouldbe vexatious but would in no way be decisive.     Onthe other hand it would open the way to our nextaction, which would be the occupation of the NorthernOro   Fields,.     The Norwegians would undoubtedlyresist a German invasion., which would be a violationincomparably greater than the violation of territorial waters of which we should be guilty.Thus, by interrupting the trade from Narvik weshould be paving the way to the major project ifit appeared later, to be in our interests to carry it out.       He attached little importance to thesuggestion that the railway from Narvik   might be cut.     The Norwegians were hardly likely to destroytheir own livelihood.     The Germany were not in aposition to carry out sabotage in NorthernScandinavia, and it was well-known that the effects of air attack on a railway line were negligible.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was very-anxious to undertake the limited project of stopping the Narvik traffic.   He saw no serious difficulty fromthe point of view of international law or from there actions of Sweden.   He was, however, seriously concernedby the emphasis which the Chiefs of Staff laid upon thepossible action by Germany in Southern Norway.    Inparagraphs 77 to 85 of their Report (W.P. (39) 179) theydealt with operations in Southern Norway, but only as partof the major project.   Their conclusion was that it was essential that the Germans should, if possible, be deniedbases on the Norwegian coast, and that the establishment ofGerman bases in Southern Norway would gravely compromiseour naval control.   Assuming for a moment that Germany, asa result of our stopping the Narvik traffic, either hadinvaded, or showed themselves immediately about to invadeTNorway, was there anything which we could do to forestallthem or to offset the consequences of their seizingbases in this area?Some discussion then took place on the vulnerability of the German oversea communications to southern Norway.    It was pointed out that a voyage ofsome 200 miles would be involved in the shipment of forces from Germany to Southern Norway.    Something couldundoubtedly be done to interfere with the German sea communications by submarines, but it would not bepossible to cut their communications altogether.    Duringthe process of establishing air bases in Southern Norway,the Germans would undoubtedly be vulnerable to air attack-but there were very few air bases further north from

which our own air forces could operate against them.   AGerman invasion of Southern Norway would vitally affectSweden, since German transports would probably have tomove through their territorial waters.    It was possible,of course, that Sweden would &quot;be so alarmed &quot;by theimminence of the threat that she might be induced tocome over into the German camp.   On the other hand, itwas argued that Sweden would surely &quot;be unlikely to lendany active assistance to Germany.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY urged that ifSweden gave way to German threats, it would then be opento us to go in and seize the Northern Swedish orefieldsat once.   He thought that we should be able to developsufficient force to make sure of achieving this object,whatever attitude Sweden or Norway adopted.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF pointedout that an expedition to Scandinavia in face of opposition by the inhabitants of the country would be avery hazardous affair.   We had no ski-troops immediately available, and the Swedes might adopt the same tacticsagainst us as the Finns had so successfully pursuedagainst the Russians.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs referred to paragraph 27 of the Chiefs of Staff - Report(W.P. (39) 179), in which it was stated that a force offrom 5,000 to 7,000 Canadians could be organised for operations in Northern Scandinavia in March.&apos;   he understood from General McNaughton, commanding theCanadian Division now in England, that the Canadianshad no troops at present trained to work on skis.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF agreedthat the Canadians were not trained to work on skis, buta very large number of their troops were used to working on snowshoes.     Suoh troops could operate in deep snowjust as well as ski troops.     He had discussed thequestion with Brigadier Crerar in London, and there seemed no reason why the numbers mentioned in the Chiefsof Staff Report should not be made available in the spring.     A very considerable number of British personnelalready trained in the use of skis could also be madeavailable.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,referring to the limited project of stopping the Narviktraffic only, agreed that a good case could be made out for our action on the pretext of counter-measures for theGerman action in sinking vessels in Norwegian waters.No doubt there would be an outcry from Norway, but theconsequences of this, particularly in view of theprobable complacence of Sweden, were not likely to beformidable.     We had, however, to face the possibility that such action would lead to the occupation by germany of bases in southern Norway.     There were, therefore,two questions to be decided.     First, would such actionon our part be likely to prejudice our chances of achieving our objective of carrying out the biggerproject?     This was important, since he understood from the Chiefs of Staff that the co-operation of norway and Sweden was essential if this project was to becarried througho     From the political point of view, hethought that the attitude of Norway was likely to dependprimarily on the prospects of the Russians succeeding intheir invasion of Finland,rather than on any action which

we took in the immediate future to deal with the Narviktraffic.     The Scandinavian countries were dominated by their fear of Russia, and, if Finland seemed likelyto collapse in the Spring, Norway would in all probabilitywelcome our assistance in saving the ore fields from theRussians.The second question for decision was whetherthe advantage of stopping the Narvik traffic now wouldcounterbalance the potential disadvantages to us of theGerman occupation of bases in southern Norway.     In his view, it would be unsound to undertake the Narvik project,with no certainty that we could ultimately carry throughthe bigger project, unless the former project would on balance be to our general advantage.TEE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO pointed out that control of the coastwise shipping would be of great advantage to us in tightening up our northern contraband control as a wholes     Not only would the iron ore traffisbe stopped, but also^f&amp;ngjp 1 icffioil and other commoditieswhichy^now succeeded in reaching Germany through norwegian territorial waters.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that if the attitudeof Norway and Sweden was more likely to be determined bythe Russian situation than by any action on Germany^ part,theobjections to undertaking the Narvik project for fear ofprejudicing the chances of Scandinavian co-operation inthe bigger project (to which the Chiefs of Staff referred in Paper W.P. (39) 180, paragraph 9) fell to the ground.There remained, however, the consequences to us of thepossible German occupation of bases in southern Norway.If the Chiefs of Staff could re-assure the War Cabinet onthis point, he would be prepared to support the proposalto take immediate steps to stop the Narvik traffic.

THE FIRST LORD 03* THE ADMIRALTY said thatall preparations had been made to stop the Narviktraffie immediately.     The naval forces were standing by and prize crews were ready to take over thecaptured ships.     He urged that it was impossible in any operation of war to see a way clear throug hall the objections that could be raised to anyparticular course of action.     It was right thatall the difficulties should be fully examined, butwe should not be deterred from action simply because there were certain objections.     The war was costing us six millions a day, and it would be disastrous to reach a negative decision on thisproposal, which seemed to offer the best chance ofending the war quickly.     He suggested that the &apos;Chief8 of Staff should immediately reconsider thepossible effect on us of the German occupation of bases in Southern Norway, and should also reporton what could be done to mitigate or prevent thesedisadvantages to us, on the assumption that actionto stop the Narvik traffic was taken immediately.-15-

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs read the terms of the proposed communication to theNorwegian Government.It was generally agreed that ourcommunication should take the line of saying that,in view of the action taken by Germany in sinkingships in Norwegian territorial waters, we were compelled to take steps to prevent German vesselsusing Norwegian territorial waters, and that we proposed to take action accordingly.     This wouldprobably lead the Norwegian Government to ask when we proposed to take action, to which the reply would be that action would be taken on the ensuingday.     It was also generally agreed that it wouldbe desirable that Ministers should have anopportunity of considering the matter again afterthe reaction of the Norwegian Government to ourcommunication was known and before a final decision was taken.     The communication to the norwegian government would, however, be to the effect thata certain decision had been taken, and would not ask them any questions as to their attitude.Discussion ensued as to whether we should communicate our intentions to the French and tothe Dominions.       It was recalled that M. Daladier

had communicated to us the Memorandum hy HerrThyssen emphasing the importance of Swedish ore toGermany, and that we had, at one stage, informed the French that we proposed to make a communication to the Norwegian Government as to the Narviktraffic, at the same time as we had given them an assurance in regard to the possible consequences to them of giving help to Finland.     It could beanticipated, therefore, that the French would welcome the proposal.     It was agreed, however,that no further communication should be made to theFrench or to the Dominions on the matter until theWar Cabinet had reached a definite decision.SIR FREDERICK LEITH-ROSS referred to thepoint that had been made in earlier Papers, that ifwe stopped the Narvik traffic, Germany would almost certainly retaliate immediately by stopping allshipments of food to this country from Denmark.This would cause a shortage of bacon.     food supplies from Denmark would, no doubt, be diverted to Germany, and would temporarily relieve Germany&apos;sfood situation.     There was also the question of norwegian tankers chartered to us, and of suppliesof ferro-alloys from Scandinavia;     but it seemed,    that we had nothing to fear under theseheads, unless Norway was definitely antagonisticto us.The War Cabinet&apos; -(i) Invited the Chiefs of staff to give further considerationto paragraphs 77-85 of Paper No.W.P.(39) 179, in the light ofthe discussion which had takenplace, with a view to definingmore precisely

(a) The military consequences of a German occupation ofSouthern Norway:(b) The steps which might betaken to obviate theseconsequences (e.g. byforestalling the Germans)or at least to mitigate them:(ii) Agreed to resume considerationof the issues dealt with inthe papers before them, on thefollowing day.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.,2nd January, 1940.

&quot; M0ST SECRET -(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).W.M. (40) 1st CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 9.GERMANY.PossibleDevelopmentof policy.Confidential Annex.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat at a recent interview Mr. Attlee had informed him that the previous week he had seen Dr. Benes, who had given him certain infortnsfction regarding allegeddevelopments in Germany.^    According to Dr. Benes&apos;sinformation, which was dated about the 21st december last, the German Generals had submitted to Herr Hitlera memorandum which he compared with the famous Ludendorf-Hinderiburg Memorandum, in which they had said that intheir opinion no offensive in the West was practicableexcept at a prohibitive cost, and that no decisive resultcould, in their opinion, be secured by air or by sea.They concluded, therefore, that Herr Hitler should considerthe possibility of making peace, anil, they suggested thatfor this purpose it might be well for him to strengthenhis hands by obtaining additional bargaining counters inthe Balkans.   The report received by Dr. Benes correspondedfairly closely with one from British secret sources,except that, according to the latter, the German Generalshad said, as regards sea and air, that they were not ina position to estimate the chances of obtaining a militarydecision.In reply to a question by THE CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that, as reported in the week-end Press, it wasthe case that Mr. Dahlerus had paid a visit to London.He had done so, however, entirely on his own initiative

and had received no kind of invitation.   He had &quot;been to see Sir Alexander Cadogan at the Foreign Office,and had appeared entirely obsessed by the problemof the danger to Sweden.   He seemed to have abandonedall hope of peace efforts by Field Marshal Goering.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Directorof Military Intelligence, whom he had met recently,was convinced that Field Marshal Goering was one ofthe most Mltter enemies of this country.The War Cabinet took note of theabove statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.,2nd January, 1940.
