W.M. (40) 42ND CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE 9.

Confidential Annex.

(15th February, 1940).

ITALY. Internal situation. (Previous Reference: W.M. (40) 35th Conclusions, Minute 7).

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to a report which he had received of some observations made in a private conversation by an Italian Senator in Rome at the end of January. The Senator, whose identity was known to us, was a moderate and a realist, and would not have spoken as he did if he had known that his remarks would be reported. The main points made by the Senator were as follows:-

The Fighting Services and the majority of the civil population in Italy were now opposed to entering the war on the side of Germany; and a considerable proportion were actually anti-German. No reference was ever made in conversation now to the Axis, which was commonly regarded as dead. In so far as it still possessed any value, it was as a smoke screen only.

Recently a number of anti-German demonstration by students had taken place in various Italian towns, one notable example being the demonstration in front of the German Consulate in Milan, where a pair of cart wheels had been wheeled up and the axle tree sawn in two.

Count Ciano had lost his former pro-German bias and, in consequence, had recovered some of his popularity both with the Palace and with the Army. The Duce on the other hand had lost his former prestige, the people generally being critical both of the Duce and the Fascist Party.

His (the Secretary of State&apos;s) general feeling was that our proper course now was to go rather slowly in our relations with Italy and not to do anything having the appearance of running after the Duce with further offers.

The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
