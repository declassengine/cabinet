This article had been syndicated for publication not only in this  country, but also inFrance and the United States .   Without the knowledgeof Mr Hore-Belisha, the issue of this syndicatedversion had temporarily been stopped by the Censor.The article was of the most objectionable characterpossible, and dealt expressly with our Narvik project,with the problem of the Gaiivare ore fields and similar problems.   Nothing could be more unfortunatethan the publication of such an article at thepresent juncture, especially having regard to thefact that its author had, until quite recently, beena member of the War Cabinet.   He (the Secretary ofState) had tried the previous evening, without

Atthe sarie tine he had asked the Editor of the &quot;Hews ofthe World&quot; to return to the Foreign Office at 9,30that morning, and had undertaken in the meanwhile thatthe most objectionable passages should be re-written by the Foreign Office, in Mr Hore-Belisha&apos;&apos;s style,&apos; ina manner calculated to do the least amount of harmpossible.    In the course of the night, Mr Hore-Belishahad told the Editor that he would make the strongest possible public protest in the House of Commons if hisarticle did not appear in the form in which he had written it.    That morning he (the Secretary of State)had had a conversation with Mr Hore-Belisha on the telephone, as a result of which he hoped that thelatter would be prepared to accept the revised textprepared in the Foreign Office, which was now being sent down to him in the country by motor despatch rider.In discussion the War Cabinet agreed stronglywith the view that it would have been most unfortunate if the article had been published in its original form.It was also agreed that, having regard to the wideadvance publicity given to this article in the Press-,its complete suppression was out of the question.The &quot;/ar Cabinet accordingly endorsed the action taken by the Foreign Secretary, .
