THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET. COPY NO,-sLfi.bCAHDIMVTA,(previous reference:V.M. (40) 4thConclusions,Minute 6)0W*M,   (40) 5th CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE 5.Confidential Annex.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the previous evening M. Corbin, the french ambassador, had informed him that the French Governmentwere in complete agreement with the general lines ofthe Note which we proposed to address to the norwegian government on the subject of the abuse of norwegian territorial waters by German naval vessels.    they thought, however, that it would be preferable tobaso our argument in support of the action we proposedto take on general grounds, rather than to justifyit as a specific reprisal.    In this connexion, theydrew attention to the fact that the French Prize Courton the 29th November, 1917, had delivered a judgement in the case of enemy ships captured in Greek watersdeclaring that &quot;a series of hostile acts committed bythe enemy had transformed these into a theatre of war,and has in practice deprived them of the enjoyment of neutrality which enemy vessels would thus not bejustified in claiming today&quot;.     Both the legal adviser of the Foreign Office and the ProcuratorGeneral (who, in the absence of the Attorney General,had been consulted) favoured a modification of theterms of our Note on the lines suggested by theFrench Government.    He (the Secretary of State)had accordingly re-drafted the Note.    The first two paragraphs y in trhich the various enormities

committed by the German naval force were restated,were the same as in the earlier draft, but thethird and following paragraphs had now been re-draftedas follows:-3.     By these hostile acts German naval forces have turned Norwegian waters into a theatre of war and have in practice deprived them of the enjoyment of neutrality.40     His Majesty&apos;s Government find themselvesobliged to take account of this actualsituation and to extend the scope of theirnaval operations into waters which have become a theatre of operations for theenemy&apos;s naval forces,5,     His Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore takingappropriate dispositions to prevent the use of norwegian territorial waters by German trade.To achieve this purpose it would be necessaryfor His Majesty&apos;s naval forces aftimes toenter and operate in those waters.6.     His Majesty&apos;s Government are most reluctant to take this action, but they see no alternative in view of the action of theenemy&apos;s naval forces in disregard cf the recognised rules; of maritime warfare towhich they have referred,THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE NAVAL STAFF saidthat the modification suggested hy the French was aconsiderable improvement, in view especially of thefact that the Norwegian Government had themselves;suggested convoying vessels through Norwegian waters to protect them against German action, and that we hadinformally rejected this solution of the difficulty.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE home department suggested that in view of the more general character of the reasons which we now proposed togive for our action the terms of the concluding paper of the Note were perhaps unduly apologeticin tone.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he would like to consider this point, and would prefer therefore that the actual draft which he had readout should not he treated as final.     He had wished toavoid making the text too categorical, since in theearlier discussions it had been thought advisable toleave ourselves room for manoeuvre in case theNorwegian Government re-acted very violently against our proposal.   He had arranged to see the norweigen minister   at 6.30 p.m. that afternoon.     If M. Colhanwere to claim that the Norwegian Government were themselves taking adequate steps to prevent furtheroutrages in their waters by German Naval vessels, he(the Secretary of State) proposed to take the line thatit was impossible for us to attach any value toassurances given by Germany, and that we could not therefore continue to regard ourselves as bound by rules which the Germans, for their part, constantly disregarded.The War Cabinet(a) Agreed that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should hand to theNorwegian Minister that day a Note,stating that His Majesty1s Governmentwere taking appropriate dispositionsto prevent the use of norwegian territorial waters by German trade, the note to follow the lines indicated bythe Secretary of State in the discussionrecorded above, subject to any minordrafting amendments which he might consider necessary;(b) Took note that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs would report theresult of his conversation with thefl,Norwegian Minister to the War cabinet at their meeting to be held on Monday,8th January, 1940,Richmond Terrace, S.W,1,,6th January, 1940,
