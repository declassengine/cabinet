The-Ajr r^-i &apos; 1.   ZVig Secretary of State for Air said that five enemy aircraftSituation.,! - approached the coast the previous day and visited the Humber,.(Previous-&apos; r-i &apos; Dundee, the Yorkshire and Norfolk coasts, and the Thames Estuary.Reference: h:; One,, flying at 28,000 feet, penetrated as far as North Weald andW..M. (40) 10th Hornchurch, before turning out into the Thames Estuary and overConclusions,&apos;     the North Sea.Minute 3.) Nearly 300 fighter aircraft were despatched on patrols duringthe day, but no interception took place.These figures would give the War Cabinet some idea of thearduous nature of the work performed by the squadrons of Fighter- Command, and the difficulties with which they were confronted in attempting to find isolated enemy aircraft.An enemy aircraft had attacked the steamship Blythmoor nearFlamborough Head. The aerodromes in Yorkshire were fog-boundand fighters were unable to take off.The normal patrols were carried out during the previous nightover enemy seaplane bases at Borkum, Norderney and Sylt. No;.&quot;       activity was seen.Four Whitleys, taking off from an aerodrome in France,dropped leaflets over Vienna and Prague. They reported that the black-out over Germany was good, with the exception of Munichand Augsburg. In Austria the black-out was patchy, and Viennawas lit up.These remarkable flights had ended successfully, our aircraftreturning after having done 1,150 miles, mostly over enemy territory.Some reconnaissances were carried out by aircraft of the air component and the Advanced Air Striking Force, in the course ofwhich a large concentration of troops was observed near ViederZerf.   Steps were being taken to obtain confirmation of this report.The usual anti-submarine patrols, reconnaissances and escorts-;     were carried out by aircraft of the Coastal Command.- The War Cabinet expressed their admiration for the work carried out by the Royal Air Force in the previous twenty-four hours, often in very adverse weather conditions.\ &apos; The Minister without Portfolio enquired whether there was any truth in the report that the enemy were using incendiary bombs in attacks on our merchant vessels. If this were so, it would be worth considering whether we should not retaliate in a similarmanner against German barges now frozen up in the canals.Certain   investigations   which  he   and   the  Minister   forCo-ordination of Defence had recently been carrying out showed that anything which would tend to throw additional strain on the: German railways would lead to valuable results.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that they had as yet no direct evidence of the use of incendiary bombs against ships, butfirst-hand reports of the most recent attacks had not yet been.    received.The Secretary of State for Air said that the facts would be checked by the Air Staff, and the possibility of retaliation in themanner suggested would be investigated.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The NavaJSituation.(previous reference:W,M. (40) 10thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff gave the War cabinet certain details of the present dispositions of the Home Fleet.There were no Norwegian Convoys at sea at the moment.H.M.S. Trident had returned from Murmansk but her report had not yet been received at the Admiralty.No news had been received of the submarines Seahorse andUndine.[20644] b 2
The armed merchant cruiser Canton, which had run ashoreNorth-West of the Hebrides, was due to reach the Clyde that day.In the air attacks on our shipping which had been made onthe previous day, a merchant vessel had received a direct hit by a bomb, which had penetrated into the hold but had not exploded.S.S. Blythmoor had been attacked with bombs and machine-gunfire.Three trawlers had been attacked, of which one had been,,damaged but none sunk.A Light Vessel had been machine-gunned from the air. these vessels were unarmed, and were regarded as immune from attack.The Admiralty were arranging to give due publicity to this viola-tiori of International Law.The Secretary of State for War said that M. Wallenberg had told him that his brother, who had been negotiating the War trade agreement between. Sweden and Germany, reported that he had found naval circles in Germany very depressed by the losses whichthey had sustained, and which included at least two cruisers and half their submarines.The Minister for Co-drdinCttibn of Defence said that such losseswould undoubtedly have a profoundly discouraging effect on the personnel.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.Finland:(previous reference:W.M. (40) 10thConclusions,Minute 5.)3: The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat in the Karelian Isthmus no change had occurred in the general position. The Soviet troops had doubled the strength of their out-posts, and the Finns were expecting to be attacked in the EasternSector.In the Sector immediately North of Lake Ladoga, the Finnswere operating oil Soviet soil everywhere except round Syskyjarviand Subjarvi. The 18th Soviet Division near Syskyjarvi was practically cut off from its base, and was in danger of beingsurrriunded. This Division had already suffered considerable loss and its morale was very low.In the Centre Sector the Finns appeared to be consolidatingtheir position oh the frontier East of Suomussalmi.In the Northern Sector the Finns were making a counter-offen-sive towards Salla and had reached Saija and Kursu. They werehoping to outflank and surround all enemy forces West of Salla.There had been some reports that the Russians had been heavilyreinforced in this Sector.In the Petsamo area it appeared that a, Soviet.force of about one Infantry Regiment with some artillery and tanks had reachedHoyenjarvi, where it was being held up by two Finnish Companies.The nearest Finnish reinforcements were some 60 miles distant.It was reported that the following Soviet reinforcements were expected before the end of the month : For VII Army (Karelian Isthmus)-Five regular Infantry Divisions from the Urals.For VIII Army (Sector immediately North of Ladoga)-The XVIII Corps of two or three regular divisions fromthe Far East.The Russians were expected to renew their attacks in greatforce as soon as these reinforcements arrived.
Finland.Methods ofgivingassistance:Brigadier LingJsReport.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff- informed the WarCabinet that Brigadier Ling had returned the previous day fromhis visit to Finland, where he had seen Field-Marshal Mannerheim.Brigadier Ling reported that the Finnish morale was still high.Their success had been due partly to their very skilful and superiortactics on skis (an art of which the Russians knew nothing), whichhad enabled them to surround the Russian columns and to cut their communications in the rear; and partly to the deplorable standardof Russian administrative and staff work, aggravated by theinterference of Political Commissars.Field-Marshal Mannerheim was of the opinion that the Finnswould be attacked by the Russians in force in February or March,but that they would be able to hold out until May, when the snowswould melt. They would then lose the advantage which they atpresent enjoyed through the possession of ski-ing troops. Even so,the Finns were confident that they could stop any Russian advanceacross the Karelian Isthmus. Further north, however, they were likely to be overwhelmed by superior numbers unless they obtainedreinforcements of trained volunteers. The figure of 30,000 had been mentioned. It would be necessary that volunteers should not comeas units of the British Army, since this would inevitably provokethe Germans to occupy Finland and Sweden. They would have toarrive in small bodies, made up ostensibly of private individuals,though Field-Marshal Mannerheim&apos;s idea was that they would, infact, be trained members of our armed forces.Meanwhile, the Finns were suffering most from a mercilessand incessant bombing of their towns. Quite apart from thedestruction of buildings, great suffering and hardship was causedby the breaking of windows and consequent loss of cover and warmthin temperatures well below zero. The actual number of peoplekilled had been small. To meet these bombing attacks they had only a total of 30 Fighters, and very few anti-aircraft guns, almost all of which were with the Finnish army. Even with these limitednumbers the Finns had brought down a prodigious number ofRussian Bombers. Their immediate requirements, therefore, were for fighters and anti-aircraft guns. Generally speaking. BrigadierLing agreed with the views expressed by Field-marshal mannerheim.Field-Marshal Mannerheim&apos;s final observation had been that,if we could stop the supplies of oil from Baku reaching Russia, thiswould end the war against Finland.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that theMilitary Co-ordination Committee at their Meeting on the3rd January had agreed that the Imperial Chemical IndustriesLimited should be authorised to supply to Finland 200 tons of cart-ridge cups and 20 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, providedBrigadier Ling&apos;s report showed that the need was urgent and thatthe Secretary of State for War was satisfied that they could reachFinland to be of value iff the war against Russia. He suggestedthat Brigadier Ling&apos;s report. now justified the release of these supplies to Finland. . -The Secretary of State for War agreed and said that he wouldmake the necessary arrangements.The Finnish morale was said to be high, but the High Commandwas seriously worried by the lack of reserves of men, as well as bythe shortage of munitions.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
Western Front.possible german attackon.Holland andBelgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 7thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Secretary of State for War gave his colleagues certain information received from the Military Attache at Brussels,indicating the possibility of an attack by Germany, from the north sea to the Moselle, being launched during the next few days.Particulars of this information are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of this statement..       ^-v;Richmond Terrace, S.
