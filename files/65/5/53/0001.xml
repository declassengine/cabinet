British land forces inFrance.Position of theCommander-in-Chief in relationto the french high Command.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 49thConclusions,Minute 9.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 74) covering a Report bythe Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 67) on the Higher Command of theBritish Land Forces operating in France.The Secretary of State for War, introducing his Memorandum,said that it was clear from the Report of the Chiefs of Staff, whichset out the history and reproduced recent correspondence between general Gamelin and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, thatwe were mistaken in thinking that General Gamelin had delegatedhis command of the British Expeditionary Force to General Georges.General Gamelin clearly wished to treat Lord Gort as the equalof General Georges. This situation was most unfortunate, sincethe relations between Lord Gort and General Georges had been mosthappy and Lord Gort did not wish to make any change. Theposition was, indeed, worse than unfortunate and might becomeextremely dangerous. The Chief of the Imperial General staff and Lord Gort both agreed that there was a serious risk, if theBritish Expeditionary Force was in an indeterminate position withregard to the Commander of the French Armies on either side ofit, more particularly when our Army was comparatively small. Ifthe British Expeditionary Force was under the orders of general george, he would make certain that it received every support, since its defeat would be no less serious for him personally than that ofany of the other French Armies under his command. There was anominous reference to Marshal Petain in General Gamelin&apos;s letter.It would be recalled that in the spring of 1918, when the allied armies were in retreat on the Western Front, Marshal Petain hadnot wished to send reserves to the support of the British Army.It was just this sort of situation which the General Staff most fearedmight be repeated.General Gamelin, by exercising his right of direct commandover the British Expeditionary Force, was acting in accordancewith the arrangement to which we had agreed in the first instance,although we had understood that he had delegated his authority in this matter to General Georges. For this reason it seemed bestfirst to try to induce General Gamelin to revert to the arrangement which had hitherto existed between Lord Gort and General Georges,If this proved impracticable, General Gamelin might possiblyaccept a &quot;face saving&quot; compromise, such as was suggested inparagraph 7 of the Memorandum. As an example of how thisarrangement might work, the Secretary of State for War took thecase of an Allied advance into Belgium. The general directif forthis advance would be issued by General Gamelin to General Georgesand Lord Gort. Lord Gort would then obtain from General Georgesmore detailed instructions on the method of carrying out the advance.If General Gamelin would not accept either of these alterna-tives, there seemed nothing else to do but to deal with the matter on a higher plane, either personally between the Prime Ministerand M. Daladier, or at a meeting of the Supreme War Council.The Prime Minister thought that the personal relations between general Gamelin and General Georges had deteriorated, and thatthis was the root of all the trouble. It would be most undesirable to raise the matter in the Supreme War Council, but, if necessary,he would be quite prepared to approach M. Daladier direct.The First Lord of the A dmiraliy thought that General Gamelinhad adopted a petty attitude towards General Georges in notdisclosing to him the decisions of the last meeting of the supreme war Council, which intimately affected the forces under the latter&apos;command. We should only accept the second alternative proposedby the Secretary of State for War in paragraph 7 of his memorandum as a last resort. It would not be a satisfactorycompromise.
The Secretary of State for War agreed that the compromiseleft too much room for disagreement.The War Cabinet:- .(i) Authorised the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to visitGeneral Gamelin with a view to :- (a) explaining to him the importance which the WarCabinet attached to an immediate clarification ofthe position of the Commander-in-Chief of theBritish Expeditionary Force vis-a-vis the french high Command :(b) inducing him to agree to Lord Gort being placeddirectly under the orders of General Georges, solong as the British Expeditionary Force remained a comparatively small force; the question could,of course, be reconsidered when the strength ofthe British Expeditionary Force justified achange.(ii) Agreed that, should the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff not succeed in persuading General Gamelin toaccept this proposal, he should not propose any form of compromise; in this event the matter should at once be reported to the War Cabinet, with a view to further action being taken on a higher plane.lean.Attitude ofIranian Govern-ment to Staffdiscussions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 35thConclusions,Minute 9.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (40) 66).The Chief of the Air Staff, introducing the Report, said thatIran was low in priority for the supply of aircraft. If we had to operate against the Russian oilfields from bases in Iran, we should prefer to do it with our own aircraft and personnel. As regardsthe co-ordination of plans with Iran, we needed no prior arrange-ments to send a defensive force to secure the Anglo-Iranianoilfields. The considerations relating to air attack on the Bakuoilfields were summed up in paragraph 7. Briefly, we could not reach Baku with the bomber aircraft at present in the Middle East from any aerodromes except Tehran. The French air bases in Syriawere no closer than our own. Our squadrons in the Middle east would not be re-equipped until late in the year, and if, for some reason at present unforeseen, we had to operate at short noticeagainst Baku, the Tehran aerodrome would be very valuable to us.For this reason, although the Chiefs of Staff did not wish to paytoo high a price for Iranian goodwill, they would not like the iranian approaches to be turned down too flatly.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, somewhatcontrary to what had been expected, no further approach had beenmade by the Iranian authorities since the Iranian Minister forWar&apos;s conversation with our Military Attache on the 31st January.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 66).(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in con-sultation with the Chiefs of Staff, to consider what action should be taken to avoid the adoption by our representatives at Tehran of too discouraging an attitude to the Shah, without, however, entering into anyembarrassing commitments.

The Finns had now admitted the loss of the fortress of Koivisto,but they had been able to remove a certain number of guns withtheir ammunition across the ice. No further Russian advance hadtaken place in the last 24 hours, but Vipuri had suffered very heavybombardment.The Secretary of State for War suggested, and the War cabinet agreed, that as information from Finland was now received in timefor circulation to the members of the War Cabinet each evening,his statement should in future take the form of comment on the news which had been received rather than a recital of the facts.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.United States.Attitudetowards censor-ship of mailsand contraband control.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 44thConclusions,Minute 7.)Proposed base at St. John,New Brunswick.6. The First Lord of the Admiralty read out to the WarCabinet a personal letter, dated the 1st February, which he had just received from President Roosevelt in which a reference wasmade to the question of the search and detention of United Statesships, and to public criticism in the United States of the actionwhich we had taken.Some discussion followed in connection with the proposal toestablish a censorship base at St. John.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, from a recent talk which he had had with the Minister for economic warfare and Sir Walter Monckton, he understood that it wouldbe impossible to establish an effective censorship base at St. Johnin less than six months, owing to difficulties of accommodation andso forth. The only alternative appeared to be an arrangement withthe United States authorities to tranship mails into our ships. Hehad invited the Minister for Economic Warfare and the Director-General of the Press and Censorship Bureau to draft a telegramfor despatch to Lord Lothian, setting out the alternatives fordiscussion with the United States Authorities. He was advised bythe Minister for Economic Warfare that the present proposal onlycontemplated transhipment of mail at St. John, and not contraband control.The view was expressed that the possibility of using St. Johnas a contraband control base should be fully examined.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that theCanadian Authorities had been approached in regard to the estab-lishment of a censorship base only at St. John. Their reply hadnot been received.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister for Economic Warfare and

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet of the two Japanese ships, the Muroran Maru and theTajima Maru, which had been held up for some time at Genoa andRotterdam respectively on the question whether certain Germangoods, which they contained, and which the Japanese Governmentwere very anxious to receive, should be regarded as liable to seizure.The Minister for Economic Warfare had now decided to release the ships on condition that the Japanese Government would infuture conform to our full requirements as to the information tobe given in connection with shipments of this character, and thatthey would produce adequate evidence in regard to the shipmentswhich we were now agreeing to pass.Further, a general plan had been suggested to the JapaneseGovernment, through their Ambassador in London and through our ambassador in Tokyo, under which we would promise to treat theJapanese more leniently in regard to our control of their trade, ifthey would undertake to stop shipments to Vladivostok which mightbe of value to the Germans. It was too early to say whether this plan would meet with any success; but the Japanese Governmentwere, at the moment, in a fairly friendly mood.The War Cabinet took note of this information.United States oiAmerica.Mr. sumner welles &apos;s visit tcEurope.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 169, Dipp, dated the 26th February, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome. The United States ambassador in Rome had told Sir Percy Loraine that Mr. Sumner Welles had had a most satisfactory interview of \\ hours with the italian minister for Foreign Affairs. Sir Percy had been invited to meet mr. Welles at lunch. On asking whether he should give anymessage to him from the British Government, he had been instructedto tell him that we were looking forward to his visit to London, andto assure him that we should treat him with complete confidence.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Scandinavia.Stoppage oftraffic in norwegian terri-torial waters.Proposed State-ment by HisMajesty&apos;sGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Prime Minister said that he had discussed the proposed statement on the stoppage of traffic in Norwegian territorial waterswith Mr. Attlee, Mr. Greenwood, and Sir Archibald Sinclair. Thelatter had considered the proposed Statement as fully justified. Theother two had agreed that it was a good document and had admittedthe force of its arguments, but had made objections, not on anyprecise grounds, but from the feeling that it involved in some way a lowering of our moral stature. He (the Prime Minister) had invitation tedthem to think the matter over and they were seeing him again that afternoon to give him their final answer. In answer to a question from Sir Archibald Sinclair, he had asked them not to discuss thematter with anybody else.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that a reply had already been received from the Prime Minister for the Union
of South Africa, and that he expected to receive the Australianreply very shortly. Some delay might be expected in the reply fromMr. Mackenzie King, who was electioneering in the West ofCanada. A further telegram had been sent to him stressing the urgency of the matter and asking him to give his personal views ifhe were not able to consult his colleagues.The War Cabinet took note of this information.Assistance to 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theFinland. French Ambassador had been to see him on the previous day.

Finland jointly guaranteed by France and Great Britain.   Thesuggestion seemed to have been put forward without much detailedthought and primarily as a gesture, and he (the Foreign Secretary)did not think that there was much to commend it.Certain further points mentioned in discussion are recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Assistance to 11.   The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that theFinland.

He ha,d spoken as if this were his last request and as if the Finnish(Previous resistance must collapse if it were not granted.   He had asked for reference: 6-inch and 4-5-inch Howitzers, but he (the Minister for Co-ordina-W.M. (40) 48th tion of Defence) had suggested 60-pounder guns as more likely to conclusions, be useful for counter-battery work, and the request had finally takenMinute 4.) the form of asking for twelve 6-inch Howitzers and twelveRequest for 60-pounder guns. Fie reminded the War Cabinet that twenty-fiveheavy artillery.  4-5-inch Howitzers had already been sent and thirty 18-pounderguns were on the way, and that we had also promised twelve naval6-inch guns on mobile mountings, seven of which were on the way.The Finns were making a similar appeal to the French Government,which they wished us to support.The Secretary of State for War said that he had not heard ofthe request for 60-pounder guns, but that he had looked into theposition as regards 6-inch and 4-5-inch Howitzers. It was quite impossible to send any of the former, as there was an acute shortageof ammunition; any to be sent would actually have to be brought back from the Army in France. As regards 4-5-inch Howitzers,the regiments training in England were already equipped with lessthan half their requirements on the lower training scale, and thedespatch of any further of these Howitzers would therefore have very serious effects on training while probably being of no use to the finns, as they were not suitable for counter-battery work. Therewas some ammunition for these Howitzers in this country, but itwould have already been moved to France but for shipping delays.It was generally agreed that this was another example of thegreat difficulty of  dealing with unco-ordinated requests  from
Finland, not placed in any clear order of priority. The first step should, therefore, be to ascertain from the French what action theywere proposing to take, and from the Military Attache in Finland(Brigadier Ling was already on his way back to this country)whether these supplies would, in his opinion, enable the Finns tocontinue effective resistance, allowing for the time which must elapse before they could arrive.The War Cabinet-Invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and theSecretary of State for War to obtain further informationas at &quot; A &quot; above, and to report again to the War cabinet as soon as possible.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 27, 1940.
