The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 51stConclusions,Minute 1.)Leaflet raid,23rd/24thFebruary.1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that there had been noair operations of special importance in the previous 48 hours.It had been confirmed that the Wellington, missing from aleaflet raid over Germany on the night 23rd/24th February, had landed safely in Belgium, and that the crew had been interned.An aircraft from Coastal Command had sighted some men ona raft East of Fair Island. Destroyers had been directed to the spot and the men had been rescued.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 51stConclusions,Minute 2.)Attacks on shipping.Attacks onU-boats.Anti-submarinemeasures.Canadian air personnel.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the S.S. RoyalArcher (2,200 tons) had been sunk by a mine in the Firth of Forthclose to the position where H.M.S. Belfast had been mined inNovember, when the area was declared dangerous. - The reason forthe Royal Archer&apos;s presence in this area was being investigated.Further enemy attacks on shipping in the previous 48 hourswere as follows : S.S. Clan Morrison (5,900 tons) sunk by a mine North ofCromer.S.S. Jevington Court (4,500 tons) mined in vicinity ofposition in which S.S. Clan Morrison was sunk. Crew saved.Uncertain whether ship sank.Swedish S.S. Santos (3,840 tons) torpedoed 50 miles east of Duncansby Head. 12 survivors had been rescued from araft (see preceding Minute). Survivors included 2 of crew of Swedish S.S. Liana torpedoed on the 17th February.ton tanker damaged byentering the  ClydeThe S.S. Imperial Transport (8,000torpedo on the  11th  February)  was nowApproaches in tow.The First Lord invited the attention of the War Cabinet toa number of diagrams showing shipping losses from all causes sincethe outbreak of war. The diagrams showed clearly that, while atthe beginning of the War losses had been greatest from submarineaction, mines were now responsible for the majority of the sinkings.It was also shown clearly that neutral losses were mounting and now totalled about two-thirds of the Allied losses. Our shipping losses were serious, but the net loss from all causes did not amountto more than some 250,000 tons.On the 24th February a U-boat had been attacked in a position19 miles south of the Fastnet with hopeful results. A second U-boathad been attacked unsuccessfully by an aircraft 60 miles north-east of Scapa.   Destroyers were now hunting in the area.U. 63 bad been sunk by H.M.S. Ingle field on the 25th FebruaryEast of the Orkneys and a number of prisoners taken.The First Lord said that, starting in the following month,valuable new anti-submarine vessels would be added to the Fleetreaching a total of about 120 by the end of the year.The Chief of Naval,Staff added that owing to winter conditions and the lack of opportunities for training, asdic operation had.in some cases, not reached the high standard aimed at. With the better weather, however, efficiency in this respect would, no doubt,rapidly improve.The S.S. Duchess of Bedford, transporting Royal CanadianAir Force pilots, had arrived safely on the 25th February.[20904]b 2
The German S.S. Orizaba (4,354 tons), which had broken out from Vigo on the 10th February, had grounded in the far north of Norway and the crew had taken to the boats. It was reportedthat the German S.S. Wangoni (7,848 tons), also from Vigo, wasanchored at Haugessund. An aircraft from Coastal Command hadbeen sent out to endeavour to photograph the ship.All six German ships which had broken out from Vigo had now been accounted for, except the Arnicas which had probablyalready reached Germany.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The Military 3.   The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothingSituation. to report from the Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)Western Front.Finland. It appeared probable that the Russians had now captured the fortress of Koivisto; but there was likely to be an appreciableinterval before they could renew their pressure towards Vipuri.North of Lake Ladoga there was no activity of importance toreport.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Interception ofGermanmerchantvessels.Norway.Release ofBritish prisoners from theS.S. Altmark.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 45thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that theNorwegian Minister had called on him on the 24th February to convey his Government&apos;s comments on His Majesty&apos;s Government^communication with regard to the Altmark case.M. Colban&apos;s comments were directed in part to questions of fact and in part to questions of law. He had proposed, on behalfof his Government, that, if the two Governments failed to reach agreement on the matters at issue, their differences should be takento arbitration.The Foreign Secretary said that he had not replied at any length on any of the points raised by the Norwegian Minister. Ithad seemed better not to do so, pending the decision to be taken bythe War Cabinet regarding the proposed stoppage of traffic in norwegian territorial waters (W.P. (40) 69). He had, however,enquired, without expecting any definite answer, whether theNorwegian Government also proposed to take Germany to arbitra-tion in connection with the large number of Norwegian lives lost,and of Norwegian ships destroyed, by German action.The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired whether M. Colban&apos;communication had dealt with the passage in the British communica-tion, which enquired how the search had been conducted, and what action the Norwegian authorities would have taken if the prisoners had been found.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that M. Colbanhad been silent on this point. An account of the interview wouldbe circulated to the War Cabinet and it would be necessaryfor the War Cabinet to consider very carefully the reply tobe made to the Norwegian Government. There was no doubt thatthe Norwegian authorities had asked the Captain of the Altmarkif he had on board any prisoners belonging to another belligerentNavy, or seamen who were subjects of another belligerent, and hadreceived a negative answer.
Scandinavia.Stoppage oftraffic in norwegian terri-torial waters.Proposed state-ment by HisMajesty&apos;sGovernment.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 50thConclusions,Minute 1 (i).)5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the;Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 69) covering a revised draft of the proposed Statement by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on the stoppage of traffic in Norwegian territorial waters.In the course of discussion on the revised draft, the followingpoints were made :-(1) The first two pages of the revised draft were, in substancethe same as the opening part of the former draft(W.P. (40) 61), with the omission of the passage dealingwith the alleged transport of German war material to murmansk. Pages 3 and 4 of the new draft incorporatedsuggestions made by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence and the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff at themeeting referred to in the margin.(2) Page 1, paragraph 3.  Words to the following effect shouldbe incorporated in the last sentence of this paragraph :&quot;even although this did not amount to making it an actual base of operations.&quot;(3) Page 2, paragraph 1. This paragraph should begin asfollows : &quot; Such a position would appear to HisMajesty&apos;s Government to be intolerable, and in their view neither the provisions of international law nor any reasonable view,&quot; &amp;c.(4) Page 2, paragraph 3, line 9. The words &quot;of any sort&quot;should be inserted after &quot; interference.&quot;(5) Page 3, paragraph 3. The beginning of this paragraph should be redrafted to read somewhat as follows : Theinnocent character of fishing boats has been universallyrecognised, but this has not prevented Germany fromcommitting nearly 200 attacks,&quot; &amp;c. (i.e., omittingreference to The Hague Convention).(6) At the end of the same paragraph a new sentence should beadded to the following effect: &apos;: On the other hand, HisMajesty&apos;s Government are constantly saving the lives ofGerman airmen and of German- submarine crews, even when these are caught red-handed carrying out the acts of inhumanity to which reference has been made.&quot;(7) Page 4, paragraph 1, penultimate lines. The word&quot;rules&quot; should be substituted for &quot;incidents.&quot; a minor amendment was also proposed to the wording ofthe last line of this paragraph.(8) Page 4, paragraph 2, line 5. For &apos;&apos; although &apos;&apos; read&quot; even though.&quot;(9) Sam.e paragraph. The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs said that certain of the Dominion High Commis-sioners had pointed out to him that the penultimatesentence of this paragraph might give rise to apprehen-sions on the part of neutrals in -other quarters of theworld. It might with advantage be made more clear thatthe Northern European territorial waters were thosewhich we had in mind.It was therefore suggested that the followingwording might be considered, as a variant of the penultimate sentence of this paragraph : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom therefore hold themselves entitled to take such action as they may deem appropriate to thepresent circumstances, not excluding the preventionof the continued use by the enemy of stretches of territorial waters which are clearly of particular value to him.&quot;260
In reply to an enquiry by the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs said that the draft Statement had beensent to Dominion Prime Ministers on Saturday, and he hoped thatreplies would be received by the following day.The High Commissioners had not thought that the proposed action would be contrary to the wishes of their Governments, butconsidered that the case for it would be strongest if based on germany &apos;s general misdemeanours at sea, rather than on any specific misuse of territorial waters.Discussion then ensued on procedure. It was agreed that, ifthe War Cabinet decided to proceed with the project, the best coursewould be that the draft Statement should be published inParliament, and that this should be followed at once by a warning of the laying of the minefield. Pour days would then have to elapse before the first mines could be laid.The Prime Minister said that he would be seeing the Leadersof the Opposition that afternoon. In his view, considerable weightmust be attached to the views of the Dominion Prime Ministers. he proposed that the matter should again come before the War cabinet as soon as the views of the Dominion Prime Ministers had beenreceived. It would be desirable that this discussion should be attended by the Ministers responsible for the Departmentsprincipally affected in order that they might put forward their views as to the probable economic consequences of the proposed action.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Attorney-General, to arrange fora final revision of the draft Statement, incorporating the amendments made in discussion,(ii) Approved the procedure proposed by the Prime Ministerat &quot;A.&quot;Assistance to finland.Despatch of volunteers.(previous references:W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 6,and 43rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Supply of air-craft and air personnel.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 49thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report bythe Chiefs of Staff Committee on the Despatch of Volunteers to finland (W.P. (40) 68).The Chief of the Air Staff explained the circumstances in whichthe Report had been called for by the War Cabinet and went overthe main points. He stressed in particular, the fact that if Regularsoldiers went as &quot;volunteers&quot; to Finland, they would have to be properly commanded, clothed and fed, and that suitahle hospital and other arrangements would have to be made for them. Thiswould involve establishing lines of communication through Sweden,unless the despatch of other than very small bodies was contem-plated. Even if the existing authorised total of 50 volunteers aweek were increased to 200 the ultimate total would be negligible.With reference to the statement, in paragraph 7 of the Report,that Royal Air Force aircraft and personnel for Finland could onlybe withdrawn from our existing Metropolitan forces, including those already earmarked for Scandinavia, at considerable risk, theChief of the Air Staff said that the Secretary of State for Airwas opposed to the despatch of further aircraft to Finland.Steps were, however, being taken to meet Finnish requests forground staff.The War Cabinet took note of the Report by the Chiefsof Staff (W.P. (40) 68).
