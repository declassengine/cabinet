United Statesof America.Possibleco-operation inpreventingvital com-modities fromreachingGermany,Bussia and japan.1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for economic Warfare on the possibility of United States co-operation in preventing certain vital commodities from reaching Germany,Russia and Japan (W.P. (G.) (40) 14). This paper set out aproposal, which had been raised Confidentially by the United states administration, for preventing supplies of essential alloys and other raw materials from reaching the three countries named, andmentioned that the President saw in this proposal &quot; grounds for the conception of a future policy for the maintenance of peace bydepriving aggressor nations of essential raw materials.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he assumed that his colleagues would agree that it was very desirable to keepin step with the United States Administration in a matter of thiskind, while taking great care not to be led into political difficulties.The immediate suggestion was that the American proposal shouldbe discussed informally at Washington between United States repre-sentatives and representatives of the United Kingdom, France and canada. The question for decision was the instructions to be givenin this connection to the United Kingdom representatives. The linesuggested for them was set out in paragraph 14 of W.P. (G.) (40) 14and was designed to enable us to accept the United States offer ofco-operation while avoiding difficulties with Japan. He drewspecial attention to (&amp;), (c) and (d) of that paragraph, which made it clear that the intention as regards any restrictions of exportsto Japan was to rest our case on our own needs and not on anyquestion of action against her-as an aggressor; also to (/), which required our representatives to refer for further instructions, ifthe Americans asked us to impose a complete embargo on certainsupplies to Japan. Any such proposal would clearly be politicallyvery dangerous.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointed out that canada&apos;s position in this matter was very difficult, as she was known to have large supplies of copper, nickel and aluminium.While it was relatively easy to maintain that all her aluminium was required for our own war effort, it would be difficult for her to resistJapanese demands for copper and nickel. It was also unfortunate that the United States should wish to take a firm line with Japan,just when we were trying to improve our relations with that country.In reply to a question from the Prime Minister, he said that hethought that a paragraph in telegram No. 120, just received fromthe United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada, might be takento imply that opinion in Western Canada would be very shockedwhen the statistics about to be published showed what large amounts of copper and nickel had been exported to Japan in 1939.Australia and New Zealand had not yet been consulted aboutthe present proposals, but they would necessarily be very sensitiveabout anything which might upset British relations with Japan.The Minister for Economic Warfare said that, while there werevarious substitutes for molybdenum as a ferro-alloy, we hadrelatively good control over the whole field of alternative materials.He regarded the present proposal as of special importance, not only because of the vital need for control over Germany&apos;s supply offerro-alloys, but because it seemed to offer an opportunity forsecuring the co-operation of the United States in the control of other supplies to Germany, e.g., oil and cotton.Sir Arthur Robinson said that the representatives who were going to Washington had been-instructed not to commit themselvesin advance to British purchases in United States of molybdenum orother commodities in excess of our own requirements without prior consulation with the Minister of Supply.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that,if the discussions reached a stage where questions of policy had tobe decided, the matter would be brought before the War cabinet again for a decision.The War Cabinet :-(i) Approved the proposal to accept the invitation from theUnited States Administration to enter on informal discussions in Washington in regard to their offer toco-operate in preventing certain vital commodities from reaching Germany, Russia and Japan,(ii) Agreed that the instructions to the United kingdom representatives should follow the lines indicated inparagraph 14 of the Memorandum W.P. (G.) (40) 14.(iii) Took note that these representatives had no authority toenter into commitments for purchases in the UnitedStates in excess of our own requirements without priorreference to the Minister of Supply.Control of 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theImports and Chancellor of the Exchequer covering a report by the Inter-Consumption, departmental Committee on Economic Policy on the control of(Previous imports and consumption, together with a report of the discussionReferences: and conclusions of the Ministerial Committee on Economic PolicyW.M. (39) 122nd on this subject W.P. (G.) (40) 10.Conclusions, Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were two mainMmute 2, and questions raised in the papers which he had circulated, namely :  W.M. (40) 18th H                                    1   &quot;Conclusions, Control of Imports.At the present time our control of imports was not water-tight, and this fact reacted adversely upon our exchange resources, since, if importers did not have to obtain authorityfor the imports which they bought from abroad, it was possiblefor them under our present system to obtain freely the foreign exchange required for payment (paragraph 1). In addition,many goods, although otherwise controlled, could still be sentto this country on consignment; and, in the case of controlledfoodstuffs, this had the result that the Ministry of Food mighthave to requisition supplies on arrival and pay higher prices for them (paragraphs 5 and 6).The largest group of uncontrolled imports consisted of foodstuffs not regarded as essential; the proposal submittedwas that the control should now be extended to cover these goods (paragraph 8). This recommendation was based upona series of considerations connected with price, exchange and shipping. In so far as less essential foodstuffs were in future to be allowed to be imported at all, the profit on their saleshould accrue to the Ministry of Food (paragraph 11). Itwould not be possible to introduce all the new controlssimultaneously; this would need to be done gradually as thenecessary machinery was devised.Restriction of Consumption.The restriction of home consumption in time of war was essential, since otherwise the reduction of imports would leadto demand in the home market reacting unfavourably on theexport trade (paragraph 13). It followed that raw materialsmust be allocated through the priority machinery established atthe Ministry of Supply (paragraph 14). Subject to satisfying the needs of the Fighting services, our object was to develop the
export trade as much as possible; it followed therefore thatthe needs of the home market must rank lowest in timeof war.The success to be achieved in restricting home consumptiondepended on the state of mind of the public, who at presentdid not appreciate the position. It was, therefore, necessaryfor the Government to do everything possible to bring home tothe public the need for a general and rigorous reduction in theconsumption of goods of all kinds. This point was particularlystressed in recommendation (g) submitted by the Inter-departmental Committee on Economic Policy.The conclusions of the Interdepartmental Committee had beenslightly amended as the result of the discussion at the ministerial committee, and in their final form were embodied in paragraph 2of the Memorandum which he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)had circulated. Of the conclusions submitted to the War Cabinet,the one which called for immediate action was that which wouldcomplete our system for the control of imports.The Prime Minister said that he had some sympathy with thepublic, who, in general, he believed, were anxious to do what was right in the matter of spending, but, owing to the difficulty ofknowing what, in fact, was right, were somewhat confused andanxious for guidance. It was impossible for the Government to lay down schedules giving particulars of purchases which were justifiedand those which were not; the only course was to take such action as might be necessary to cut off supplies of those commodities whichit was desired the public should not purchase. This might beeffected, either through the control of imports or through thedistribution of raw materials required for manufacture for home consumption. If supplies were controlled in this way, the publiccould properly spend their money on such supplies as were madeavailable for the home market.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was necessary inthis connection to remember also the difficulties inherent in the savings plan. The public were constantly asking for guidance asto the directions in which they should curtail expenditure, but itwas quite impossible for the Government to lay down any hard-and-fast principles to be followed in this matter.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the machinery ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation should be used to explain and bring borne to the public the Government&apos;s policy in regard to thecontrol of home consumption.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was incomplete agreement with the conclusions reached by the ministerial committee on Economic Policy. The recommendation which con-cerned the Board of Trade most directly (recommendation (/) (ii))was that which urged that&apos; steps should be taken&apos; to secure as far aspracticable that materials allocated to the export trade.were, in fact,used for that purpose. He was at the present time in discussionwith the Raw Materials Department of the Ministry of Supply forthe purpose of devising the necessary machinery.The Minister tvithout Portfolio deprecated the fact that the interdepartmental Committee on Economic Policy apparentlyregarded fresh vegetables and fruit as unessential foods, whereas allleading experts in dietetics regarded these foods as of greatimportance.The Minister of Food said that, as regards fresh vegetables, itshould be realised that, apart from imports, there was likely to be
a glut during the coming season, owing to the increased supplies which it was anticipated would come forward as a, result of theMinistry of Agriculture&apos;s allotments campaign.Sir Horace Wilson said that, so far as foreign supplies of freshfruit and vegetables were concerned, the report of the Interdepart-mental Committee was not intended to do more than suggest that infuture such supplies, when imported, should be imported by theMinistry of Food, and no longer left to private enterprise.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hopedthat in the introduction of controls care would be taken not to do anything which would be in conflict with the provisions in ourvarious War Trade Agreements for the import of foodstuffs fromabroad, such as oranges from Spain, currants from Greece, and(perhaps in the future) horticultural produce from Italy. It was important that the political implications of imports to this country should be borne in mind. He hoped, therefore, that those responsiblefor elaborating the new controls would work in close touch withthe Foreign Office and the Ministry of Economic Warfare.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he hopedthat similar liaison would be maintained with the Dominions Office,who were much concerned as to the import of Empire foodstuffs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that it was essentialthat the liaison asked for by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should beestablished by those responsible for elaborating the new import controls.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs enquired whether there might not be a danger that, if we were to raise the price of controlled foodstuffs to avoid loss to the Treasury, we might therebyourselves be doing something to help to start the vicious spiral ofprices and wages.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this depended on whether the foodstuffs in question were essential foodstuffs. Atthe present time, very considerable expenditure was being incurredfrom the Exchequer in order to keep down the price of essential foodstuffs. The question whether this policy should be furtherextended had been discussed at a meeting of the ministerial committee on Economic Policy the previous evening, and a special report from the Committee on this subject was being circulated tothe War Cabinet that day.The War Cabinet (1) Approved the conclusions on the &quot;subject of the control ofimports and consumption reached by the ministerial committee on Economic Policy as set out in paragraph 2of the Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(W.P. (G.) (40) 10), namely-(a) Commodities, the imported supplies of which arepurchased by the Ministry of Food and theMinistry of Supply, should be placed on the listof goods, the import of which is prohibited except under licence, so that import may only be permitted when specifically approved by theDepartment concerned.(6) The sole purchase by the Ministry of Food of imports should be extended, as soon as administrativelypracticable, to cover those foodstuffs (in particu-lar, fresh and preserved fruits and vegetables),the import of which is at present left to privateenterprise.
(c) A careful examination should be made of the rawmaterials, the importation of which is at presentleft uncontrolled by the Ministry of Supply, witha view to extending some form of control in allcases where any financial or shipping savingcould be effected.(d) The import licensing system should be extended tocover other commodities, including manufacturedimports, which are not at present subject tosupervision.(e) The Ministry of Food should make such profits as are feasible on the imports of unessential food-stuffs through the use of the monopoly positionconferred on it through (a) and (b) above, toenable staple foodstuffs to be sold at a lower pricethan would otherwise be necessary to avoidincurring loss.(/) (i) As in the case of commodities already under control, steps should be taken to ensure to theexport trades a satisfactory allocation of rawmaterials;(ii) steps should also be taken to secure so far aspracticable that materials allocated to the exporttrade are, in fact, used for that purpose.(g) It is essential to bring home to the public that the magnitude of the effort required by the war, withthe accompanying strain which it throws on our financial and shipping resources, is such as to demand a general acceptance of sacrifices through a rigorous reduction in the consumption of goods of all kinds and the recognition of the inexorableneed for the utmost economy in private expen-diture.(2) Agreed that, in elaborating the new control of foodstuffsas set out in (1) (b) above, the Ministry of Food should work in close touch with the Foreign Office, theDominions Office and the Ministry of Economic Warfare.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposedshortly to submit a Report from the ministerial committee on Economic Policy on the possibility ofstabilising the prices of staple commodities as part ofthe Governments policy in relation to wages and prices.3. The Secretary of State for Air said that he had further considered with the Air Staff the question of the despatch of aircraft and personnel to Finland in the light of the discussion at the WarCabinet on the previous day, and that he had the following recom-mendations to make : (1) Release of Hurricane aircraft. He favoured informing theFinnish Minister that we were prepared to release 12 Hurricanesfor sale to his Government, of which 8 were available now and 4would follow probably in a month&apos;s time.Owing to the complications involved in organising demobilisedBritish volunteer pilots as part of the Finnish Air Force, theSecretary of State suggested - that the Finns should be asked tosend Finnish pilots to this country, where they could be giventraining. Eventually they could fly the Hurricanes to Finland,with intermediate stops in Norway and Sweden.A transaction of this kind could be carried out in continuation of the policy already approved by the War Cabinet, at the meeting referred to in the margin, that aircraft should ostensibly be supplied.
to Finland by the aircraft firms concerned, although the aircraft would, in fact, be taken from the R.A.F. Maintenance command and handed over to the firm concerned.If the release of these aircraft was approved, arrangements would at once be made for the collection, packing and transit ofthe necessary equipment and maintenance stores, which would include small arms ammunition. This would take about four or five weeks. The method of transit, however, required investigation.The training of Finnish pilots could be carried out while the equipment and maintenance stores were being transported to finland.The Air Staff favoured the above measures to help Finland, onthe ground that any damage which we could help the Finns to inflict on the Russians would be to our ultimate advantage.Further, they feared that the bombing of open towns in Finlandby the Russians might lead to a breakdown in Finnish morale.(2) Personnel. The Secretary of State recommended therelease of the five mechanics asked for by the Finnish Governmentto assist in the maintenance of the Gladiators and Gauntlets. he also suggested that a few experienced ground staff should be sent forthe maintenance of the Hurricane aircraft. No difficulty was anticipated in obtaining volunteers, subject to satisfactory arrange-ments being made as to terms of service, &amp;o, by the finnish government, and to the Treasury agreeing to adequate safeguardsin respect of non-effective benefits from the R.A.F. It was anticipated that some publicity would result, since the men whovolunteered, and probably some others, would have to be informed of the destination of the volunteers. Every endeavour would,however, be made to avoid publicity.(3) Crews to fly out Blenheims. The Finnish Government had asked for British crews to fly out the last 12 short-nosed Blenheims.These crews could be provided either by temporarily demobilisingcertain R.A.F. personnel, or by the use of civilians. The Secretaryof State favoured the latter alternative, if feasible.(4) Transit to Finland. It would be necessary for the ForeignOffice to make arrangements with the Swedish and Norwegian Governments for the transit of the personnel by air or on landthrough their territories.General agreement was expressed with the above proposals.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Finland&apos;&quot;sresistance had stiffened the attitude of a number of the neutral countries. For example, our Minister in Hungary reported that the hungarian Government were now satisfied that we could not be defeated.The War Cabinet:  (i) Approved the sale of 12 Hurricane aircraft to the finnish government, the aircraft being ostensibly supplied to finland by the aircraft firm concerned. These aircraft would have Finnish pilots who would be given trainingin this country.(ii) Approved the arrangements proposed for the despatch offive mechanics to assist in the maintenance of Gladiatorsand Gauntlets, and of a few experienced ground staff for the maintenance of the Hurricanes.(iii) Agreed that, if possible, the 12 short-nosed Blenheimsshould be flown to Finland by civilian personnel.(iv) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to makethe necessary arrangements with the Norwegian and swedish Governments for the transit of the personnelreferred to in (ii) and (iii) through their territories.
Assistance to finland.Recruitment of volunteers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 16thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The War Cabinet received an oral report by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence and had under consideration aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(W.P. (40) 29).The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence reminded the WarCabinet that at their meeting on the 17th January they had beeninclined to agree that a small unofficial Bureau should be set upin London for the recruitment of volunteers for Finland. He hadbeen asked to explore, this suggestion with the Finnish minister in London, after information had been obtained as to the french attitude in regard to the despatch of volunteers to Finland. TheFrench attitude was that, whilst the French were giving facilities to foreigners, no arrangements were being made to enable Frenchvolunteers to proceed to Finland, since every Frenchman of military age was automatically enlisted in the French Army (see W.P. (40)29). Continuing, the Minister said that he had seen M. Gripenbergon the previous day and had represented to him the views of theWar Cabinet as indicated in the discussion on the 17th January.He had mentioned Brigadier Ling&apos;s opinion that volunteers wouldbe of little value in Finland at this time of the year, owing to theclimatic conditions, and the preoccupation of the War Cabinet thatwe should at all costs avoid sending British volunteers who would bring discredit on this country.In reply, M. Gripenberg had repeated the argument which hehad used with Sir Orme Sargent about the moral value of a volunteerforce from this country, no matter how small, and even if it didnot go into the front line until later in the year. He contended,in particular, that it would act as a nucleus for rallying furthervolunteers; thus 50 Austrians resident in this country had alreadyvolunteered. 280 Hungarians had come forward, and a few applica-tions had been received from America. For these reasonsM. Gripenberg hoped that the War Cabinet would authorise the setting up of an unofficial recruiting office in this country. TheFinnish Legation in London would make all the necessary arrange-ments for this office and would provide the necessary finance, forwhich large subscriptions had already been promised.M. Gripenberg had received guarantees that the norwegian and Swedish Governments would permit the passage of recruitsfrom this country, provided they went as private individuals inparties which did not exceed about a hundred. Furthermore, hewas assured that Germany would make no objections.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that he had informed M. Gripenberg that these were matters on which the finaldecision would rest with the War Cabinet. The matter had becomeurgent, as there were some three or four private individuals whowere at work on raising volunteers and whose activities it was desirable to forestall. He had therefore arranged to seeM. Gripenberg that afternoon.In the discussion which ensued, the following points were urgedagainst the despatch of British volunteers to Finland : ,     (i) Volunteers would be ineffectual and might bring discrediton this country,(ii) There was much to be said for following the Frenchexample and only permitting foreigners to volunteer.American sympathy with the Finns might be exploited.(iii) Now that we had agreed to give substantial material help to Finland, there was a strong case for adhering to theFrench attitude.(iv) There was a danger that the despatch of any British force to Finland, however small, might result in our prestigebeing committed and in our having to send larger forcesat a later date.
The main arguments advanced in support of the opposite viewwere as follows :  (i) The first question which M. Gripenberg would ask wouldbe whether he would be allowed to set up his ownrecruiting depot, provided that the Finnish Governmentfurnished the necessary finance; it was almost impossibleto refuse this request,(ii) The next question which would arise was whether it waspossible to forbid an)&apos; British subject from volunteeringto go to Finland.It was generally felt that there would be grave difficulties in adopting this course. The War Cabinet were reminded of theprotests which had attended the steps to stop the recruitment ofBritish volunteers for Spain under the Foreign Enlistment Act-Further, assurances had been given to M. Gripenberg that thequestion of recruiting volunteers for Finland from this country was receiving the careful and sympathetic consideration of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.(iii) The French analogy was not valid for this country, since it could not be said that every British subject of military age was automatically enlisted in the armed forces.(iv) The Prime Minister said that he understood from, a conversation with our Ambassador in Paris that feeling in France was as strong as here in favour of helping the finns. M. Daladier had told our Ambassador that his main preoccupation and anxiety at the present moment was Finland.In the light of the above, the Prime Minister suggested thatthe reply to M. Gripenberg should be that His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment would raise no objection to the establishment of a recruitingoffice in this country, on the understanding that this office was wholly conducted and financed under the auspices of the FinnishLegation, and that volunteers were enlisted for an international force. We should be prepared to allow British volunteers to be recruited into this force, subject to their not being required formilitary or other service of national importance in this country.The War Cabinet agreed (1) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should offer no objectionto the establishment in London, under the auspices of theFinnish Minister, of a Recruiting Office for volunteers for Finland, subject to the following conditions : (a) that recruitment by thi s Office should be for an inter-national force :(b) that British subjects should be allowed to volunteerfor this force if their services were not requiredfor military service with the armed forces of theCrown or for other work of national importance :(c) that applications made by the Recruiting Office forthe enlistment of British personnel should bemade to the Ministry of Labour and NationalService, and that the Ministry should be asked toact as the co-ordinating channel for obtaining theconsent of the Departments concerned to such applications :(d) that the Finnish Minister should assume completeresponsibility for the management and finances ofthe Recruiting Office and of the force to be raisedthereby :(e) that no training of volunteers should be permitted totake place in this country.
The Aii-Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 20thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Secretary of State for Air said that, owing to bad weather conditions, there had been little air activity. Fighters hadbeen sent up to endeavour to intercept a German aircraft reportedoff the East coast on the 22nd January, but no attack had beenmade.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)Loss of H.M.S.Exmonth.6. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Naval Staffestimated that there were at present 8 U-boats on patrol. This was as great a number as had been out at any one time since thebeginning of the war. It was interesting to compare this figurewith the two occasions in 1917 when the Germans had 60 U-boatsout. At that time, the Germans had between 300 and 400submarines, as compared with the present 40 to 45 to which,according to an estimate, their strength had been reduced.No enemy attacks had been carried out on shipping in theprevious 24 hours.A number of IJ-boat hunts had taken place during the previous24 hours and strong anti-submarine units were operating in thearea in which H.M.S. Exmouth had been lost. Three hunts in theprevious 24 hours appeared promising; and one of these, by H.M.S.Vanquisher in the Bristol Channel, had probably been successful.The Danish S.S. Danmark (10,500 tons) had been damaged by an explosion when at anchor near Kirkwall on the .12th January.As a result of diving operations it had been established that theDanmark had been torpedoed.The German S.S. Claude Rickmers had sent out an S.O.S.stating that she had run aground in the Skager Rack off the coast of Sweden.In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, the First Lordof the Admiralty said that he was enquiring into the action takenby the Cyprian Prince in continuing on her course, after hearingvoices in the water. The Naval Staff were inclined to the viewthat the Captain of the Cyprian Prince had acted rightly in thecircumstances.Discussions ensued as to announcing the loss of H.M.S.Exmouth.It was pointed out that as the Germans did not seem to know that H.M.S. Exmouth was sunk, it was possible that we had been successful in sinking the U-boat which had torpedoed her. It might therefore be better to withhold the news from Germany for a littlelonger. On the other hand it was generally felt that it was essentialto maintain the feeling in the country that the Government could(2) That while the Recruiting Office would have no connectionwith His Majestj^s Government, it would be open toGovernment Departments to give help to the RecruitingOffice in such matters as, for example, ensuring that no^undesirable characters were recruited.(3) That the Home Secretary should be invited to consider thelegal aspects of the establishment of the proposedRecruiting Office, and to take the appropriate action togive effect to this conclusion.(4) To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence tocommunicate to M. Gripenberg the above decisions ofthe War Cabinet.

(40) 20thConclusions,Minute 6.)Netherlands.AI Leged viola-tion of neutralityby british aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 20thConclusions,Minute 11.)7. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.The Secretary of State for War said that two new Russianattacks had been launched, but so far they did not appear to have met with any success.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.8. The Secretary of State for Air referred to allegations inthe Dutch Press that British aircraft had been over Holland onthe 18th January and that the Dutch Government was making a protest. The Air Attache at The Hague had no official informationof a recent violation of Holland by any British aircraft. Apparentlyanti-Nazi pamphlets had been picked up in Holland and it waspossible that some of our aircraft had inadvertently been overDutch territory; propaganda raids had been carried out on the18th and 19th January.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadreceived a letter from the Dutch Minister which referred to the finding of anti-German pamphlets in Holland. )The Secretary of State for Air observed that the dutch government had lodged a protest with the German authorities asa result of an incident on the 20th January, when a Germanreconnaissance machine flew over Dutch territory.The Prime Minister said that there was a great differencebetween a deliberate reconnaissance of neutral territory carriedout by the Germans, and the accidental passage of our aircraft over neutral territory.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would draw the attention of the Dutch Minister to this importantdistinction.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Far East. 9.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs invited theRelations with attention of the War Cabinet to a number of telegrams dealingJapan: German with the Japanese Governments protest against the action we hadseamen removed taken in removing German seamen from the Japanese vessel Asamafrom the Maru.Asama Mam. The telegrams from Tokyo were Nos. 92, 93, 94, 97 and 98.(Previous According to these telegrams, a memorandum of protest had beenReferences: handed to the British Naval Attache in Tokyo, taking the viewWM.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew theattention of his colleagues to Lord Lothian&apos;s telegram No. 83, datedthe 21st January, in which it was reported that statements hadaj)appeared in the New York Times and a number of other newspapersto the effect that official quarters in Washington were intenselyirritated with this country over our stiffness in dealing with american mails, and our generally adamant attitude on a numberof disputed points, such as commercial restrictions on Americanexports, delays in examination of ships, &amp;c. It was understoodthat these statements had been prompted by the State department and that some of them were attributable to Mr. Hull himself.In the course of discussion, attention wasfollowing passage in Lord Lothian&apos;s telegram : drawn to the&apos;&apos; I think it is of the utmost importance that we should in the next few weeks do everything we can to meet the state department&apos;s view where we can, partly by transferring the examination of American ships from Kirkwall to St. John&apos;s,partly by speeding up the passage of American ships throughthe Contraband Control point, and especially by answering orremoving the charge that we are giving better facilities toItalians and others than to Americans.&quot;The view was expressed that the establishment of a number ofadditional Contraband Control stations would go a long wayhad acted in accordance with international law, and had spokenon the lines of telegram No. 41 to Tokyo. This telegram explainedthat where the enemy was a European conscriptionist State, therewas, in practice, no difference between removing members of the armed forces (including Reservists) and removing all males ofmilitary age. Sir Robert had explained that public sentiment in japan was probably due to ignorance of international law. this had led to a request for instances in which Germany had takensimilar action. In regard to the latter, suitable particulars hadbeen furnished to Sir Robert Craigie.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that when he had seen the Japanese Ambassador the previous evening, the latter had not mentioned the Asama Marti, incident. The Foreign Office were now engaged in preparing what should be, in view of the strength of our case, an effective answer to the Japanese protest.The following points were made in the course of discussion : (1) It if could be done without impairing our relations with italy and Portugal, it Avould be desirable to give theJapanese Vice-Minister the particulars for which hehad asked, regarding our seizure of German subjects from Italian and Portuguese vessels.(2) The statement that it was an affront to have detained a japanese vessel close to the Japanese coast read verystrangely, in view of the much more serious affronts towmich we had been subjected at the hands of theJapanese in China.(3) The German seamen removed from the Asama Maru hadall been technicians. They were men who, if they had reached Germany, might in all probability have been sent for service in submarines. Of 52 Germans on board,only about 20 had been arrested.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the master of the Rolls was now back in London and had submitted his report on the position of our trade negotiations with the ItalianGovernment. The Master of the Rolls had made it clear, in discussions with the Foreign Secretary and the Minister for economic Warfare, that, in his view, we ought to go some wayfurther towards meeting the Italian demands, if we were to avoid aconsiderable deterioration in our relations with Italy.In discussion, it was pointed out that this matter could be dealtwith in one of two ways : (1) The Report by the Master of the Rolls could be circulatedto the War cabinet, together with memoranda setting out the views of the Departments concerned. Underthis procedure the War Cabinet would be invited lodecide between the somewhat divergent views of thevarious Departments. The justification for this pro-cedure would be that this matter did not admit of delay.(2) A further attempt might be made, by means of inter-departmental discussions, to arrive at an agreed policy.There was no time to lose and the inter-departmentalmeeting ought, if possible, to take place that afternoon.The War Cabinet agreed That the procedure at (2) above should be adopted.Scandinavia.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs made statements on thesubject of Scandinavia. Particulars of the discussion are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.13. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had arranged to see the Leader of the Labour Opposition again that afternoon. In view of the French Governments attitude, a somewhat difficult problem would arise if Mr. Attlee, after:consulting some of the members of his Party, should maintain hisobjection to the proposal not to proceed with the publication of theproposed Blue Book.The Foreign Secretary suggested that, if Mr. Attlee pressed thepoint, the Prime Minister should say that the Government were fully conscious of the objections to not proceeding with publication,but that our real difficulty lay with the French, and that he (theForeign Secretary) would again discuss the matter with them.In the meantime, the Foreign Secretary favoured giving atemporising answer to a Parliamentary Question on the subject for answer on the ensuing day.The War Cabinet Concurred in this view, and invited the Prime Ministerto deal with the matter on these lines.
