Supreme WarCouncil: 5thMeeting.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 32ndConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the fact that themain item for discussion at the Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil had been the question of assistance to Finland, the three service Ministers had accompanied the Foreign Secretary and himself to the meeting of the Supreme War Council held in Parison Monday, the 5th February. The meeting had been a great success, and full agreement with the French had been reached bymidday. There had been time for the Chiefs of Staff to discusstechnical questions with the French High Command during the afternoon, before a final meeting between Ministers later in the evening to clear up certain points of detail.A record of the statement by the Prime Minister, of the subsequent discussion and of the conclusions reached by the WarCabinet is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.Supreme War 2.   The Prime Minister said that the Supreme War CouncilCouncil: Sth had also discussed the question of Anglo-French purchase of meeting (con- aircraft and aero-engines from the United States.   M. Daladier hadtinned). urged the Adtal necessity for making these purchases, and for takingAnglo-French a decision to do so immediately in view of certain options whichpurchase of would otherwise run out.  M. Reynaud, with whom he had had someUnited States conversation, had obviously felt considerable apprehension of theaircraft financial repercussions of any such purchases on a large scale.   Thematerial. conclusions which the Supreme War Council had recorded on thisquestion were as follows : (1) The fundamental reasons which made the French andBritish Governments decide to conduct an investigation into the question whether their national programmes should be reinforced by a further utilisation of theUnited States aircraft industry remain without change.(2) The Allied Governments should therefore decide now to utilise the productive facilities of the United states aircraft industry, and to invite their respective experts to examine the question with a view to actionaccordingly.The Secretary of State for Air explained that the Frenchwanted to buy 3,000 engines to balance their own output of air-frames. As regards the remainder of the proposed purchases by theAllies, they were anxious that we should go equal shares with them.He had stood out for the French and British shares being in theproportion of, say, 60 : 40. A meeting of officials and French repre-sentatives was being held in London that morning to discuss thematter, and it was possible that agreement would be reached.Otherwise it would be necessary to have further discussions with theFrench Minister for Air.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 34thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Secretary of State for Air said that flying operationshad been considerably restricted, not only by foggy weather, but also by the very bad state of all operational aerodromes, owing tothe thaw.There was nothing of importance to report.[20798]
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 34thConclusions,Minute 3.)Proposed seizure of Germansupplies toU.S.S.E.First canadian division: thirdconvoy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Shipping losses.4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that H.M.S!Southampton had been ordered to continue her search for the two ships believed to be carrying munitions from Germany to murmansk.It was believed that a number of German merchant ships would attempt to break through our Northern Patrol and return toGermany in the near future. Suitable support was being providedfor our patrols.Half of the third Canadian troop convoy had arrived safely atthe Clyde, and the remainder were expected to arrive in the courseof the day.Protection of east Coastshipping.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Protection oflightships.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (40) 29thConclusions,Minute 2.)There had been no losses due to enemy action during theprevious 24 hours, but, owing to the fog, there had been thefollowing British shipping casualties : S.s. Zitella (4,200 tons). Ashore near Buchan Ness. Crewtaken off.  A fair chance of salvage.S.s. Verbormelia (3,275 tons). Ashore near St. Abb&apos;sHead.   Pounding heavily.   Lifeboat standing by.S.s. Eldenpark (5,000 tons). Aground on shoal off Swansea.Breaking up.  Lifeboat standing by.The First Lord said that he did not propose to publish these losses, which were an ordinary marine risk and in no way the resultof enemy action. In reply to a question, he said that the light-houses in the vicinity of the three groundings had not beenextinguished.The Chancellor of the Exchequer saw no reason for announcingthese casualties, and there was general agreement with this view.Continuing, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that full advantage had been taken of the lull in air attacks on East Coastshipping, due to the fog, to organise shipping into groups. The AirMinistry were providing standing fighter patrols and a great dealhad been done to provide the ships with some form of A.A. defence.Twelve-pounders, Lewis guns and rocket guns had been provided in large numbers, and a force of naval ratings had been constituted toprovide anti-aircraft guards for the shipping while on passage.The question of merchant crews declining to go to sea had, hethought, been given undue emphasis at Monday&apos;s Meeting of theWar Cabinet. The attitude of merchant seainen gave no cause for anxiety.As a result of the attitude taken up by the Elder Brethren, noguns would be provided for lightships, and their protection,therefore, would, for the present, be confined to the provision ofbullet-proof plating to protect the crews. Wherever possible, light-ships were being replaced by light-buoys.In reply to a Parliamentary Question on the subject that afternoon, he (the First Lord) did not propose to mention the factthat guns would not be supplied to lightships, but would merelystate that protection was being provided.
The Military 5.   The Secretary of State for War said that there had been anSituation. increase of one Division in Poland, bringing the total number of(Previous German Divisions to 142-144.   There were indications that further reference: Divisions were likely to be formed in the near future.W.M. (40) 34thConclusions,Minute 4.)Distribution ofGermandivisions.Finland. The Russians had delivered a series of hammer blows on theKarelian Front. The attacks had been very costly and the russians had been unable to break through. The Finnish defenders had,however, been subjected to considerable strain.The Finnish General Staff had not yet claimed the completedefeat of the 18th Russian Division north of Lake Ladoga, but itwas reported that the Russian troops were in a pitiable condition.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Weekly Reports. 6. The War Cabinet took note of the following Weekly(Previous Reports :  w m (dc\\ 9Mh (1) Weekly Report (No. 22) by the Secretary of State for Airw.1v1. lau) (W.P. (40) 43).m^nt^T&apos; (2) Weekly Report (No. 22) by the Secretary of State for War&apos; (W.P. (40) 44).Italy.probable intentions.(previous references:W.M. (39) 95thConclusions,Minute 7, andW.M. (40) 30thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegrams Nos. 26 and 27, Saving, dated the 2nd February, 1940,from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, in which Sir Percy Lorainereported a long and intimate conversation which he had had withCount Ciano, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, as to signor mussolini&apos;s attitude. On the whole, the result of this conversationwas not discouraging. The Secretary of State gave the War cabinet also certain particulars bearing on the same subject, details of whichare recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The picture presented by these reports was consistent with theview held at the Quai d&apos;Orsay. M. Leger believed that at the start of the war Signor Mussolini was convinced that the Germans wouldwin; that he was now no longer convinced, but did not wish to seethe Germans too heavily defeated, and might in consequenceattempt manoeuvres to prevent this happening. These manoeuvresmight well include a partial mobilisation of the Italian Army, ashad been rumoured from various sources. He had invited Sir percy loraine (telegram No. 81, dated the 6th February, 1940) to report whether he thought that a mobilisation of this kind was likely.
U.S.S.R.Visit of sir stafford Cripps.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet particulars of a report which he had received from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Chungking, that Sir Stafford Cripps, whowas now in China, intended to pay a brief visit to Russia. further particulars are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Iran.Attitude ofIranian Govern-nient to staffdiscussions.Vulnerabilityof Soviet oilfields.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 29, dated the 1st February, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Tehran, which might be summarised asfollows : The British Military Attache called on the Minister forWar on the 31st January, 1940, at the request of the latter.The Minister unexpectedly gave the Military Attache&apos; completefigures of all types of aircraft possessed by Iran, and then asked for help in securing aircraft from the United Kingdom,which he urged were needed by the Spring for the defence of Iran, though even then it might be too late. When the military attache suggested that there was a greater need for fightersthan bombers, the Minister for War had insisted on thenecessity of carrying the war into the enemy&apos;s camp, and had referred to possible action to damage the Soviet oil wells atBaku. In conclusion, the Minister, speaking very personallyand in confidence, had said that he thought it was time for&apos;&apos; us &quot; to co-ordinate plans, since we had the same end in view.He had added that he could not say this to the Shah.In submitting this report, Sir Reader Bullard had expressed the opinion that, none the less, this suggestion could hardly have been made except on the instructions of the Shah.This report was of great interest, and he had given instructions inthe Foreign Office that, subject to the advice of the Chiefs of Staff,the suggestions made by the Iranian Minister for War should befollowed up.In discussion, it was stated that the French were also interestedin the possibilities of damaging the oil wells at Baku, and that suchaction, if successful, might well paralyse Soviet industry, includingagriculture. The threat to take such action might be used as a powerful deterrent to the Soviet Government.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee to review theirReport on the vulnerability of Russian oil supplies(C.O.S. (39) 142*) in the light of this information as toIran&apos;s attitude.(ii) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider what action shouldbe taken to follow up the suggestions made by the iranian Minister for War, and to report to the WarCabinet.Vote &quot; A &quot; 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theEstimates. Secretary of State for Air (W.P. (G.) (40) 29) asking for authorityto abandon, for the period of the war, the practice of presenting tothe House of Commons substantive Vote &apos;: A &quot; figures, since theirpublication would give the enemy valuable information as to thestrength and organisation at which the expansion of the Royal AirForce was being directed.* This report was not circulated to the War Cabinet.
The Secretary of State for A ir said that the Speaker had been consulted and raised no objection to the Vote &quot; A &quot; for the RoyalAir Force for the period of the war taking the form of &quot; Suchnumbers of officers and airmen as His Majesty may deem necessary.&quot;In discussion, it was suggested that an alternative course wouldbe to present a Vote &quot; A &quot; for a maximum figure considerably inexcess of the numbers which it was, in fact, intended should be borne on the establishment for the year in question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like toexamine this matter from the strictly constitutional point of view.If the War Cabinet agreed, he and the Secretary of State for Airwould consult and bring the matter again before the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet agreed to the suggestion made by theChancellor of the Exchequer.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 7, 1940.
