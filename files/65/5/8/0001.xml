Scandinavia.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 7thConclusions,Minute 8.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them the following Papers : (1) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, recording a conversation between Mr. CharlesHambro, of the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and theSwedish Minister in London (W.P. (40) 10) :(2) A Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare, onthe stoppage of iron ore to Germany (W.P. (40) 11).Particulars of the discussion and of the Conclusions reached by the War Cabinet are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.The Air 2.   The Secretary of State for Air reported that under coverSituation. of low cloud and fog enemy bombers had attacked shipping off the(Previous East Coast on the previous day.  Altogether there had been attacksReference:        on 15 ships in the vicinity of Aberdeen, Firth of Forth area,W.M. (40) 7th   Newcastle-Flamborough Head area, and off the Norfolk coast.  TheConclusions,      enemy aircraft had come in under 500 feet and were not thereforeMinute 1.)        detected by the R.D.F., which was not at present effective againstlow-flying aircraft.   Steps were, however, being taken to expedite the production of the particular form of R.D.F. which would be effective against this type of attack.  No warnings had been receivedfrom  the  line of trawlers  put out for observation purposes,presumably owing to the bad visibility. For the same reason fighterpatrols had failed to intercept any of the raiders.  Standing patrolsof fighter aircraft would be maintained in the area of these attacksduring the next 48 hours.The activities of Bomber Command had been restricted by bad weather. An important reconnaissance was carried out in.the Ruhrdistrict by night bombers, however, and the offensive patrols over theenemy seaplane bases in the Heligoland Bight were continued last night. A flare path had been observed at the seaplane base atHornum. This had been bombed, and the lights were promptlyextinguished. In this connection a report had just been received that the Danish Government had protested against the bombing ofthe Danish island of Romo by an unidentified aircraft during the night.   Fortunately no damage had been done by the bombs.The usual activities of Coastal Command had been continued,though some were curtailed on account of poor visibility. two enemy aircraft had been observed off Flamborough Head by aroutine patrol, which was unable to make contact.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 7thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that.M.S. Nelson bad arrived at Portsmouth.He gave to the War Cabinet further information of the successof the various devices which had been developed for dealing withmagnetic mines, and expressed the opinion that, although we might expect increased mine-laying activity on the part of the enemy, wehad now the measure of this particular danger.In the numerous air attacks on shipping the previous day offthe East Coast, to which the Secretary of State for Air had referred,the following ships had been lost: Steamship Oakgrove (1,985 tons), carrying iron-ore fromSantander, bombed off Cromer.Steamship Gotvrie (683 tons), bombed off Stonehaven.The following ships had been sunk by mines : The Dutch steamship Truida (176 tons), 20 miles east ofthe North Foreland.[20631]b 2
Steamship Dunbar Castle (10,000 tons), sunk off the NorthGoodwin light vessel. Eleven of the crew were reported missing. It appeared that this ship had been led into the mine-field by the Convoy Commodore&apos;s ship, which was moving ondirections which had been taken from a foreign wireless station.A searching enquiry would be made into the circumstances ofthis loss.H.M.S. Vesper had attacked a U-boat 60 miles south-west ofLand&apos;s End, most probably with success. An attack had also beenmade on a U-boat south-east of the Eddystone Lighthouse, but with no definite result.The German steamship Bahia Blanca, which had left an african port some time ago, had apparently struck an iceberg in theDenmark strait and sent out an S.O.S. H.M.S. Newcastle was on her way to the scene.The Chief of Naval Staff said that, as a result of the german air attacks on shipping off the East Coast, instructions had nowbeen issued to all ships to move by night only. The only other course would have been to put all ships into convoy, but, once thiswas done, merchantmen would have been reluctant to discontinueconvoy. To convoy all East Coast shipping, however, would place a very severe strain on our resources of escorting vessels.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference erence  :W.M. (40) 7thConclusions,Minute 3.)Weekly Reports.4. The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said therewas nothing of interest to report either on the Western Front or in finland.5.The War Cabinet took note of the following Reports :  The 18th Weekly Reports by the Secretaries of State forAir and War (W.P. (40) 9 and 12).The Balkans.Attitudeof Italy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 6thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams dated 8th January, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Bucharest: Telegram No. 17, in which Sir Reginald Hoare reportedhaving been informed by the Roumanian Minister for ForeignAffairs in t)he strictest confidence that M. Antonesco, recentlyMinister for Foreign Affairs, had just paid a visit to Romewhere he had seen Count Ciano. M. Antonesco had asked whatthe Italian attitude would be in the event of a Soviet attackon Bessarabia; to this Count Ciano had replied that he mustconsult Signor Mussolini. At a second interview Count Cianoadvised M. Antonesco to report to the Roumanian Governmentthat in the Italian Governments view they would be wise totake a firm line with regard to Bessarabia, and that, if theywere to be attacked by the U.S.S.R., tlhey could count on Italy&apos;ssupport on a far greater scale than that given by Italy toGeneral Franco. In reply to a question M. Antonesco had saidthat he could not believe in the possibility of an Anglo-Frenchdefeat in the war, having regard to their immense resources and their absolute determination to achieve victory. count ciano then observed that Roumania should be careful to avoidthrowing herself into the arms of Germany, a remark whichthe Roumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs took as an indirect
acceptance of M. Antonesco&apos;s opinion. The roumanian minister for Foreign Affairs had begged that we should treatthis as most confidential.Telegram No. 18, in which Sir Reginald Hoare reportedthat the Roumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs professed tobe entirely satisfied that Turkey would be prepared to move in conjunction with Great Britain and France in the event ofan attack on Bessarabia, notwithstanding the very guardednature of the statements on this subject made by M. Saracoglu,the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the British andFrench Ambassadors. He maintained that M. Saracoglu had sent him a despondent message to the effect that he could not propose a pact of mutual assistance (which, in fact, had notbeen asked for), because it would be contrary to the Soviet-Turkish Agreement, the terms of which the Turkish Govern-ment had invoked as a reason for deprecating the conclusionof a Soviet-Bulgarian political agreement.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Germany.Attitude to soviet-Finnishconflict.(previous references:W.M. (40) 6thConclusions,Minute 6, andW.M. (39) 116thConclusions,Minute Y.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprevious day M. Gripenberg, the Finnish Minister, had told him at luncheon that the Finnish forces had shot down two aircraftpiloted by German officers. He (the Secretary of State) had atonce informed Signor Bastianini, the Italian Ambassador, who wasalso present. The latter had been considerably moved on receivingthis information in view especially of the action of the GermanGovernment in refusing transit facilities for Italian war materialen route for Finland.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 10, 1940.
