The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 24thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff informed the WarCabinet that 9 Wellington bombers had carried out a sweep overthe west of the North Sea on the previous day, but no enemy hadbeen sighted.There had been no air activity off our coasts during the previoustwenty-four hours. Fighter Command, however, had carried out39 patrols in connection with routine escorts for convoys and forthe protection of the fishing fleet, trawlers, and other shipping.The Air Ministry had investigated the alleged presence ofGerman aircraft over Liverpool on the 25th January as reported by the First Lord on the previous day. The available evidencesuggested that these aircraft were probably coastal command aircraft, two of which were known to have been in the vicinity, butthis could not be definitely asserted.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 24thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff gave the War cabinet particulars of the dispositions and movements of the Home Fleet.A destroyer escort was being provided for the second half ofthe next homeward-bound Norwegian convoy. This convoy had increased considerably, probably due to the First Lord&apos;s broadcast on the 20th January.The steamship Durham Castle (8,240 tons), an old UnionCastle liner which had been converted for use as a block ship at scapa, had been mined and had sunk off Invergordon, but all the crew had been saved. It was thought that the mine was one of afield of magnetic mines. The misfortune was one of a series whichhad affected the block ships destined for Scapa.The outward-bound Norwegian convoy was now approaching the Norwegian coast.Traffic between the Tyne and Methil, which had been stoppedon the 25th January following the sinking of two ships, had nowbeen resumed after sweepings which had discovered no mines.At 11 a.m. on the previous day, a good D/F bearing had indicated a surface vessel of large size transmitting from a position60 miles north-west of Borkum. It was thought that the signalmight be from an enemy ship in difficulties, as we had laid mines in this part of the North Sea. The Admiralty had discussed withthe Air Ministry the possibility of sending some of our aircraft to investigate, but it was eventually decided to take no action during daylight owing to probable German fighter protection, and instead to send aircraft by moonlight. Bad weather, however, had prevented this.The British steamship Wing Sang (3,560 tons) had been stopped, searched, and detained for 15 hours on the 23rd/24th January by a Japanese mine-sweeper of Fbo Chow. It was thought that this action was probably a reply to the Asama Maruincident. The crew had not been maltreated and the boardingofficer had been described as unfriendly, but not objectionable.The British Captain had been pressed to sign a declaration thatthe search had been conducted with his permission, but had refusedto do more than sign a statement that the vessel had been searched.In reply to a question, the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said the newspaper report of a new German aerodrome in the frisian islands was based on a Royal Air Force photograph which had been released to the Press, and in which there was evidence of thepreparation of a new landing ground at nor deney.The War Cabinet : (i) Took note of the above statement.(ii) Agreed that the Admiralty should bring to the notice ofthe Foreign Office the particulars concerning the detention and search of the steamship Wing Sang.
The MilitarySituation.Western Front:Finland.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 24thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing;to report on the Western Front, or as regards Finland.Assistance to finland.Supply of anti-aircraft gunsand aircraft.(previous references:W.M. (40) 16thConclusions,Minute 6, andW.M. (40) 23rdConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that 20 of the 24 3-inch anti-aircraft guns, complete withammunition, which we were supplying to Finland, were leaving theUnited Kingdom for Bergen in the course of the day. It wouldtake about 10 days to transport the guns from Bergen to Finland.He (the Chief of the Imperial General Staff) paid a tribute tothe excellent work which had been done by Mr. Axel Munthe (son of Dr. Axel Munthe, the author) in expediting the passage of arms.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that the transportof the aircraft which we had promised to Finland was proceeding satisfactorily.   Some of them had already arrived.In reply to a question, he said that the interval between the arrival of the aircraft and the time when they would be ready to operate would only be a matter of days.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Germany. 5.   The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to a report in thePosition of        Press to the effect that Herr Thyssen, so far from being an opponentHeir Thyssen.    Q^ tne present regime in Germany, was, in fact, head of the GermanSecret Service in Switzerland.The Secretary was instructed to invite the Foreign Office tomake enquiries as to the source of this statement.Roumania.Supply of equipment andraw materials.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 24thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Minister without Portfolio referred to the decisionof the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the previous day, thatconsignments of supplies to Roumania should be held up pendingan interview between the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Roumanian Minister in London.It had now been necessary to put off the date for this interviewuntil Tuesday, the 30th January, and in the circumstances it wasnot altogether easy to continue to hold up the despatch of consign-ments. He reported, however, that he had consulted the ForeignOffice and the Board of Trade, and ascertained that no acutedifficulty was likely to arise in continuing the embargo until the30th or 31st January.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,January 27, 1940.
