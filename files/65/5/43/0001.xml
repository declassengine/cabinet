(40) 51 and 55).The First Sea Lord described the progress of certain plans and preparations. A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached by the War Cabinet is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat, apart from an enemy meteorological flight which had beencarried well out into the North Sea, only one unidentified aircraft had been observed.The usual patrols and escorts had been carried out, in which265 aircraft had taken the air for the protection of our shipping onthe East and South-East Coast. A section of 8-gun Fighters hadsighted a small motor boat off the Norfolk Coast, which hadaccelerated and zigzagged on an easterly course when challenged.The leader had fired a burst of machine-gun fire in front of the bowand had challenged again. The boat had replied by repeating the challenge. The Admiralty had been asked to investigate this incident.The Chief of the Naval Staff said that the Admiralty were making enquiries. The information had only reached them twelvehours after the incident had occurred.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air said that the heligoland reconnaissance had had to be abandoned on the previous day 30 miles short of that island owing to low cloud at sea level.The reconnaissance was, however, being repeated that day.Normal routine patrols had been carried out by coastal command.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 42ndConclusions,Minute 5.)H.M.S. Exeter.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 32ndConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet certain particulars of the movements and present operations of theHome Fleet.HALS. Exeter in the last stage of her return journey hadwitnessed the sinking of the Sultan Star off La,nd&apos;s End on the afternoon of the 14th February. Exeter had suffered considerableinternal damage in the action off the River Plate, three or four shellshaving penetrated the ship and burst inside. Nevertheless, therewas every prospect that she could be repaired within a fairly short time. The First Lord described the miraculous escape of the captain, when all those with, him on the bridge had been killed orwounded by a single shell.Enemy attacks on merchantshipping.The Danish S.S. Sleipner (1,066 tons) had sent out an S.O.S.signal from a position 50 miles north of Peterhead (Aberdeenshire),reporting that her crew was leaving the ship in. boats.The British tanker Imperial Transport (8,000 tons), previously reported as having had her bow blown off by a torpedo on the 11th,was proceeding home under escort, and two tugs were on their wa3rto help her.The Norwegian Convoys were proceeding satisfactorily.B7.M.S. Duncan, which had had a serious collision with a merchant ship on the 17th January, was now being towed into dockby two tugs.The German trawler taken as prize by H.M.S. Southamptonwas well on the way home.[20842]b 2
Magnetic mines. The magnetic minesweeper Borde had exploded her seventeenthmagnetic mine on the morning of the 15th. The mine had gone offvery close to the ship, causing a leak and strains, which made it necessary for her to return for repairs.The First Lord described the progress which was being madein the development of methods for the demagnetisation of ships.It was hoped that the existing method would shortly be superseded one which was much quicker and more economical, and whichwould make it possible to demagnetise a destroyer, for example, in three hours. This simplification would permit of the process being applied not only to the Fleet but also to the whole of the merchant navy. He intended to submit a paper to the War Cabinetproposing that this scheme which could not be kept secret, shouldalso be extended to neutral vessels.Attacks on H.M.S.   Venetia had carried out two attacks on  U-boatsU-boats. South-West of Queenstown.The First Lord mentioned that Admiral Nasmith took a moresanguine view of the total number of U-boats which had been sunkthan the Admiralty. His calculation of the number sunk in theWestern Approaches, for example, was 20.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 42ndConclusions,&quot;Minute 6.)The western front.Finland.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therewas nothing of importance to report from the Western Front.The latest report from Finland indicated that the Russianassault was continuing along the whole front, on the KarelianIsthmus. Despite the confidence expressed by the Finns in theircommuniques, it was now clear that they had been forced to abandona certain number of their front-line positions in the Summa area.Nevertheless, the Russians were a long way from breaking through.Mopping-up operations were being undertaken by the Finns inthe North.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.(previous reference reference ce:W.M. (40) 42ndConclusions,Minute 7.)Aircraft andpilots.5. The Secretary of State for Air said that he had given further consideration to the suggestion that Hurricanes, which werebeing got ready to go to Finland, should be flown to that country by volunteer RA.F. crews who would remain there to fight againstthe Russians. The Finnish pilots who had been sent to collect these aircraft, and who were completing their training, were very goodmaterial, and he had come to the conclusion that it would be preferable to allow the original arrangement to stand.As regards the bigger question of the despatch of R.A.F.volunteers, there were two alternatives : either to allow individualvolunteers to join the Finnish Air Force, or to send a completeR.A.F. Squadron. He would require further time in which toconsider the matter.In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that the Rocs for Finland were being got ready without delay.
if343W.M. 43 (40),215Internationalvolunteer force.Mr. KermitRoosevelt.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 37thConclusions,Minute 6.)Field guns andammunition.Approach toFrance.Supply of 75-mm. guns fromthe U.S.A.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thatMr. Gibson of the Finnish Aid Bureau had been to see him that morning about Mr. Kermit Roosevelt, who had been pressing tobe allowed to go to Finland. The Minister said that he thought the previous decision, that the Government did not favourMr. roosevelt&apos;s appointment to command the British unit of theinternational force, was based on a misunderstanding between theForeign Office and War Office as to their respective objections on political and military grounds.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, when mr- Gibson had first approached him about the possibility ofMr. Kermit Roosevelt being appointed to command a BritishVolunteer Unit for Finland, in consonance with the knownobjections of the War Office, he had replied that, as the recruiting of this volunteer force was in the hands of the Finnish Aid Bureau,the principal responsibility for the choice of the commanding officer must rest with Mr, Gibson. From the general political pointof view, he (the Foreign Secretary) had expressed the fear that theappointment of Mr. Roosevelt might be misinterpreted in the UnitedStates. For these reasons he had told Mr. Gibson that he was not disposed to favour the suggestion, but had added that he would consult the War Office. If, however, as he now understood to bethe case, the War Office were prepared to release Mr. Roosevelt,he&apos;would be ready to withdraw his objections on political grounds.The Prime Minister said that, subject to the concurrence ofthe Secretary of State for War (who was not present), the foreign secretary should be invited to inform Mr. Gibson that there was now no objection to the appointment of Mr. Roosevelt to command the British Volunteer Unit for Finland.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that it had previously been contemplated that the Volunteer Force should belimited to 500. Eligible volunteers of the right age and of a very good type were now coming forward in such numbers as wouldmake it possible to send them at the rate of 50 a week to Finland,if the necessary permission were given.. Thus, it would be possibleto raise by May an appreciably stronger force than had originally been planned.The Minister said that he had been asked whether, in presentcircumstances, there was any objection to rather more publicitybeing given to the activities of the Finnish Aid Bureau. It wasagreed that there was no harm, and some advantage, in this.In reply to the Prime Minister, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that the 30 field guns, and the 30,000 roundsof ammunition for them, would be ready on Sunday, the18th February, and could be loaded on Monday, the 19th, if thenecessary shipping was available.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, inaccordance with the decision reached on the previous day, he had written to M. Daladier begging him to look again into the possibilityof releasing field guns and ammunition for Finland from France.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadlooked into the possibility of obtaining French 75-mm. guns from america from unused stocks carried over from the last war. Hewas satisfied that any direct purchase of these for the Finns wasimpossible, on account of United States legislation. Perhaps,however, the United States authorities might be induced to releasethese guns ostensibly for the Canadians.The Minister without Portfolio undertook to mention thematter to the Canadian High Commissioner that afternoon.
Railway The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that transport difficulties.        facilities had been considerably improved in Sweden, but he had.as yet no information as to whether this improvement had been extended to the Finnish side of the frontier.The &quot;War Cabinet took note of the above statements, and agreed -(1) To authorise the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State forWar) to inform Mr. Gibson, of the Finnish Aid Bureau,that there was now no objection, in so far as HisMajesty&apos;s Government were concerned, to the appoint-ment by the Bureau of Mr. Roosevelt to command theBritish Volunteer Unit for Finland it being under-stood that Mr. Roosevelt would first resign hiscommission in the British Army.(2) To authorise the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence toinform Mr. Gibson that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould place no difficulties in the way of the despatch of volunteers to Finland up to 50 a week.Bulgaria. g    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionChange of to telegrams Nos. 68 (R) and 69 (R) from His Majesty&apos;s Minister,Government. Sofia, in which Mr. Rendel reported that M. KiosseivanoffsGovernment had resigned as a result of a quarrel between thePresident of the Council and the Minister of Agriculture, and thatM. Filoff had been summoned by the King with a view to hisassuming the Presidency of the Council.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.economic relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 42ndConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegrams Nos. 130&apos;and 131. both dated the 14th February, 1940,from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, from which it seemed clearthat there was no prospect of Signor Mussolini withdrawing hisveto on the sale to us by Italy of war material. Count Ciano hadadmitted to Sir Percy Loraine that, while we had approached the transaction on an economic basis, the Duce had made his decision on political grounds.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,February 16, 1940.
