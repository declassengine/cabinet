The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that the Royal AirForce had had a quiet day. No enemy aircraft had been reportedoff our coasts.A successful reconnaissance had been carried out over the siegfried Line by a Blenheim from the Air Component of the field force. A second Blenheim, which had been engaged in reconnais-sance in the same area, had been attacked by enemy fighters aridforced to land in Belgium.A U-boat had been sighted North-East of Cape Wrath, butit had dived before an attack could be made. The search was being continued by an aircraft and five destroyers.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Naval 2.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the SwedishSituation. vessel Sxarton (2,475 tons) with a cargo of iron ore had been sunk(Previous by torpedo or mine.   21 of a crew of 32 were missing.Reference: A second Swedish vessel S.S. Kiruna (5,484 tons) had reportedW.M. (40) 1st being shelled by a U-boat 900 miles W.S.W. of Lands End. IfConclusions, the position was correctly stated, on which there was some doubt,Minute 3.) &apos;      U-boats were operating much further out than hitherto.It had been reported a week previously that the Deutschlandhad been seen proceeding Northward through the Great Belt at highspeed, and it had been thought possible that she was attempting to break out into the Atlantic. The Admiralty had heard subse-quently that the Deutschland had returned to Kiel. It had since been reported that the Deutschland had been damaged on the21st December, probably by striking a mine. A damaged cruiserof the Koenigsberg Class had also been reported in the Kiel Canal.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The shipping situation.Coal Supplies.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (39) 122ndConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Prime Minister said that he had been somewhatdisturbed by the reported shortage of coal in London and the Southof England due to coastwise shipping difficulties.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had discussed this report with the Secretary for Mines. The closing of the Tyne, owing to enemy mines, had of course, seriously interfered with coastwise shipping. It was also relevant that, in connection with the measures for dealing with magnetic mines, the Admiralty had recently taken up a number of vessels engaged in the coastwise trade. As apalliative, arrangements had been made for special coal trains to run from the north-east. He was informed that the situation hadalready improved, and would probably become more satisfactory in the near future.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Weekly Reports.       4.   The War Cabinet took note of the following WeeklyReports : 16th and 17th Weekly Reports by the Secretaries of Statefor Air and War (W.P. (40) 1, 2 and 4).[20596]
FecampBroadcastingStation.(PreviousSef erence:W.M. (40) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)Finland.Invasion by .S.S.B,Possibility offurtherassistance.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat a telegram had been received from Paris (telegram No. 6,Saving) to the effect that M. Daladier had now signed the order for closing the Fecamp Broadcasting Station.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.6. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat the preceding twenty-four hours had produced no change inthe situation in Finland.Reports had been received of riots in Leningrad due to food shortage.The Lord Privy Seal said that the situation in Finlandprovided a great opportunity, but he doubted whether it was being-exploited to the full. Our assistance had hitherto taken the formof sending such equipment as we could spare, but not on any definiteplan. Italy and Germany had shown in Spain how the technique of non-intervention could be exploited as a serious military operation. He suggested that we should examine the possibility ofgiving assistance on the Spanish precedent, but with the differencethat personnel sent to Finland should be true volunteers and notrecruited from the serving ranks of the Regular Forces.The following were the main points made in the ensuingdiscussion :  (1) As regards the general situation, the Secretary of Statefor War said that Finnish resistance, if sufficientlysupported, might result in a defeat of Russia. he agreed that our help should be intensified, and askedwhether it could be extended into the Naval sphere.(2) On the other hand, the view was expressed that it mightsuit us better that Scandinavia should continue to bekept in a state of anxiety, rather than that russia should be defeated. It was felt, however, that the real danger was that the Finns would be beaten in the spring; and that we should use our best endeavours toprevent this happening.(3) In this connection the Chief of the Imperial General staff said that the weather would present two critical periods :first in February, when hard frosts were usual, and,second, in June, when the thaw was over and the groundhad been thoroughly dried by the sun. He consideredthat the Finns should be able to hold out throughFebruary.(4) A attitude of Sweden. The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the Swedish Minister had beenemphatic that our help should be unofficial. Mr. Prytzhad undertaken that Sweden would allow material to.pass through her country, and, if necessary, volunteers;but he was strongly opposed to the despatch of an expeditionary force.(5) As regards volunteers, the view was expressed that therewould be a strong feeling in favour of allowing theirdespatch. It was explained that the Foreign Enlist-ments Act could be suspended by Royal Licence, inwhich case there was nothing in law to preventvolunteers from serving in Finland. The Act had been applied to Spain because this country had been a partyto a non-intervention agreement.
The Prime Minister thought that it would be desirableto draw a clear distinction between allowing the general public to go to Finland as volunteers and allowingmembers of the Regular Forces to volunteer.The Secretary of State for War said that the WarOffice had permitted the despatch of individual womenvolunteers from the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry to goto Finland as ambulance drivers.(6) Material Assistance. The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence explained the steps which were being taken bythe War Office to supply the Finns with small armammunition. Brigadier Ling had left by air on Monday,and, subject to his confirmation that there was a serious shortage of ammunition, it had been agreed that theWar Office should release what would amount, in all,to a total of 38^ million rounds of small arm ammuni-tion. This figure was made up of 20 million rounds ofsmall arm ammunition which would be manufactured by imperial Chemical Industries, and 200 tons of cartridgecups, which would suffice to make 18-J- million rounds.The War Cabinet agreed That the Military Co-ordination Committee, in consulta-tion with the Lord Privy Seal and a representative ofthe Foreign Office, should undertake a comprehensiveexamination of all the methods, short of direct military intervention, by which assistance could be given to Finland,and should submit recommendations to the War cabinet as soon as possible.AdmiraltySupply and production:Third MonthlyReport.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 37thConclusions,Minute 7.)Industrial manpower, dilutionand training.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 119thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The War Cabinet had before them the Third MonthlyReport on Supply and Production submitted by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (W.P. (R.) (40) 1).The First Lord of the Admiralty, said that he wished to callspecial attention to the labour problem dealt with in Section IV.The Admiralty were receiving as much assistance as was possible from the Ministry of Labour, and he understood that a Ministryof Labour Committee was considering the problem of dilution witha view to the increase of the labour power available for war production, but he thought that the War Cabinet should lookfurther into this matter.The Lord Privy Seal said that he was very much concerned atthe slowness of production generally, not only for the defence services, but also in the case of merchant shipping. On present arrangements we were building not more than 800,000 to 1,000,000tons of merchant shipping a year, though much more was wanted.The deficiency was due primarily to labour shortage. The measures for securing dilution were very slow in taking effect, and thearrangements for training new skilled labour were on a veryrestricted basis. He thought that, when the War Cabinet had beforethem the results of Lord Stamp &apos;s survey of the demands of theSupply Departments, they would be appalled by the figuresthat would then be given for the labour power required:these figures would be far greater than had been contemplatedand would emphasise the need for more rapid progress with plans for training and dilution of skilled labour.The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Ministry were faced with similar problems to those of the Admiralty, possibly onan even greater scale.   They now calculated that, although the[20596] b 3
labour force employed on aircraft production was already greaterthan at the peak of the last war, it would need to be increased to something between one million and a million-and-a-half men andwomen if their programme was to be carried through. He thereforeintended to press the need for more vigorous steps for training anddilution. The experience of the Air Ministry was, however, thatthe latter problem was best tackled: locally.The Prime Minister said that the Minister of Labour had told him the previous evening that dilution was best attacked as a matterof local arrangement. Officers were being appointed, to be calledProduction Officers, to do the work carried out by Dilution Officersin the last war of following up on the spot steps taken to securedilution. He (the Minister of Labour) was very keen to make asmuch progi^ess as possible in this matter, so as to mobilise for usefulproduction the labour at present unemployed. The training estab-lishments of the Ministry were not at present being used to the full,owing to the shortage of volunteers, but the number of applicants for training was increasing rapidly and facilities would probablysoon be used to the full. The Minister of Labour thought that theycould be rapidly expanded, if and when this was necessary. Hehad also pointed out that the next month&apos;s figures would show areduction of some 40,000 in the figure of 1,400,000 unemployed. Inany case, some 500,000 of these were not really unemployed, but onlyin process of moving from one job to another, some 250,000 werenot really employable, leaving only some 600,000 actually availablefor increasing the labour force employed on war work. The Ministerof Labour had thought that the absorption of unemployed in industry was proceeding satisfactorily and had pointed out thedifficulties of securing quick results, e.g., the largest block of unem-ployment was in the building industry. The Prime minister thought that the whole question of the supply of labour for war production would need to be considered by the War Cabinet very shortly in connection with the supply programmes generally.In connection with unemployment in the building industry, theLord Privy Seal said that the possibility of a relaxation of restric-tions on private buildings where stocks of material were availableshould be re-examined. There was general agreement that some relaxation was required.The First Lord of the A drniralty drew attention to the greatimportance of securing the employment of as many women aspossible on war production. In answer to a question in regard tothe effects on industry of the loss of &apos;&apos; key men &apos;&apos; called up by theForces, he said that the worst effects of this were over, the places of men withdrawn being already filled. In any case, it would notbe fair to press the Army to give up technicians in the Army Reservewho were with the colours. It was important, hoAvever, that, whennew classes were called up, care should be taken not to take menwho were needed for productive work.The Secretary of State for War agreed that one of the chiefreasons for taking power to call up men up to the age of 28 was tosecure that the men taken for the Army were not employed on essential productive work. In fact, nearly 50 per cent, of the menin every class were now in reserved occupations. The Army hadbeen enlisting a considerable number of unemployed as volunteers,but this stream was slackening in view of the improved prospects for employment. From the point of view of the needs of the Army,he was very anxious to secure that the policy of dilution should becarried through as effectively as possible in all branches of pro-duction, including agriculture.There was then a short discussion on the remaining sectionsof the Report.
-411Admiraltyproductionprogramme.Use of ship-building resources.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 122ndConclusions,Minute 2.)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as a matter ofgeneral principle he wished to put on record the fact that, when aReport of this character was noted by the War Cabinet, this didnot in any way affect the need for the Department concerned toobtain Treasury authority for any proposals contained in it. Thegreat bulk of the programme mentioned in the present Report, forexample, had already been fully agreed between the Admiralty andthe Treasury, but there were some proposals which had not. TheFirst Lord of the Admiralty entirely agreed that it would benecessary for the Admiralty to establish their case on any items which had not been agreed with the Treasury.In answer to a question by the Minister without Portfolio asto the destroyer programme, the First Lord of the Admiraltyexplained that &quot;fast escort vessels,&quot; some 80 of which were to beprovided, were, in fact, medium-class destroyers. In addition,Patrol vessels of the whale-catcher type, though possessing lessspeed than destroyers, were invaluable for escort duties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired whether any furtherconsideration was being given to the question recently raised bythe Minister of Shipping as to the allocation of ship-building resources between the requirements of the Admiralty and thoseof merchant shipping. The Lord Privy Seal said that his enquirieswere dealing with this point, but he pointed out that it was notonly a question of allocation between the two demands but also ofmaking the best use of the whole of our productive resources, e.g.,a number of shipbuilding yards were not being fully used, owingto shortages of labour and steel. The First Lord of the Admiraltysaid that he very much hoped that this matter would be looked at on the basis of a two-years programme, as some of the Admiralty&apos;s requirements might be more or less fully met in the first year, thusreleasing shipyards for increased merchant shipping construction.The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the Third Monthly Report on Supply and production (W.P. (R.) (40) 1) submitted by the FirstLord of the Admiralty,(ii) Agreed that the consideration of the recommendation onpage 12 of that Report in regard to an investigation into the measures already in force for the dilution of skilled labour should be deferred pending the considera-tion by the War Cabinet of the labour problem inrelation to the supply programmes as a whole.Leakage ofInformation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 68thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The War Cabinet had before tlhem the Second InterimReport of the Committee on the Leakage of Information (W.P. (G.)(39) 167). The principal matter dealt with in the Report was thequestion of protected areas, in regard to which the position was as follows : (i) A protected area under the Defence Regulations covering the Orkneys and the Shetlands had come into operation on the 1st December, 1939.(ii) It was recommended by the War Cabinet Committee thatthe whole of the north of Scotland, i.e., the region north of the Caledonian Canal together with the islands ofMull and Skye, should also be declared a protected area under the Defence Regulations.(iii) It was further recommended that the following ports shouldbe declared protected areas under the Aliens Order : Firth of Forth.Harwich.Chatham.Portsmouth.Plymouth.
The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the Board ofAdmiralty were much indebted to the Minister without Portfolioand his colleagues for the thorough investigation which they had(Previous conducted into the various possibilities of leakage to Germany,reference: particularly through Ireland. He had been considerably reassuredW.M. (39) 75th by the fact that no information had apparently reached the enemyConclusions, on several matters which he instanced and which must have been minute 7.)       known to considerable numbers of persons.Turning to the proposal at (iii) above, the First Lord said thathe was about to write to the Minister without Portfolio proposingcertain modifications in the scheme. In particular, the Board ofAdmiralty would like the declaration under the Aliens Order toapply to. a somewhat longer list of ports, in the following order of priority : Firth of Forth.Harwich.The Humber.Dover.Plymouth.Portsmouth.The Medway.The Secretary of State for the Home Department and Ministerof Home Security said that he was prepared to declare these portsas protected areas under the Aliens Order, if that measure wasdeemed to be necessary. It fell within his existing powers. Hethought it right, however, to warn the War Cabinet that theproposal would inflict a good deal of hardship on aliens, including some who had resided for a long time in the ports in question, andmight give rise to considerable dissatisfaction.Attention was drawn to the statement in paragraph 4 that neither telephones, nor examination of cables, nor the interception of wireless in this country or in Eire, or of messages from neutral ships, had as yet disclosed any leakage from this country throughEire.The War Cabinet took note of the Second Interim Reportof the Leakage of Information Committee (W.P. (G.) (39)167). In particular, the War Cabinet approved the recom-mendations summarised at (ii) and (iii) above, and gavediscretion to the Committee to vary, in consultation withthe First Lord of the Admiralty, the list of ports at (iii).9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a state-ment on the subject of Scandinavia. Particulars of this statement and of the ensuing discussion are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foi&apos;eign Affairs.10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heAttitude proposed to communicate to the French Government an aide-memoireof Italy. bringing up to date our appreciation regarding the attitude of Italy(Previous towards the Balkans.   As he had reported at the meeting of the reference:        War Cabinet noted in the margin, M. Francois Poncet, the FrenchW.M. (39) 123rd Ambassador in Rome, had on the 24th December succeeded in conclusions,      securing a considerable measure of enlightenment on the subject.Minute 8.)        Since then a further hint had been received by our Military Attache&apos;that Italy hoped that we would take her into our confidence if wehad any plans in the Balkans.   If the French Government agreed,he proposed to take no action for a few days, in order to give Count.Scandinavia.(previous reference: -W.M. (40) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1.)
Ciano an opportunity himself to return to the subject withM. Francois Poncet, whose conversations he had promised to reportto Signor Mussolini. If, however, Count Ciano gave no signs ofmaking a move, he proposed that either M. Francois Poncet orSir Percy Loraine should take up the matter again with the italian foreign Minister.The &quot;War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Balkans. 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theBulgaro- previous evening M. Tilea, the Roumanian Minister, had informedRoumanian him that the Bulgarian Minister in London was submitting to therelations. Bulgarian Government a plan under which Roumania would give(Previous a promise to Bulgaria that she would return the Dobrudja to that reference:        country after the end of the war, and Bulgaria would in return joinW.M. (39) 118th a defensive alliance with Roumania and Turkey.  M. Tilea thoughtConclusions,      that King Carol would not be averse from considering such a project.Minute 11.)       On the general position in the Balkans, M. Tilea was disposed totake the view that the fact that the U.S.S.R. was deeply engagedin Finland made it unlikely at the moment that she would proceedagainst the Balkans.   He (the Secretary of State) had taken theopportunity of observing to M. Tilea that he thought that theRoumanian Government would be unwise to place too great areliance upon Turkey going to the aid of Roumania if the U.S.S.R.were to seize Bessarabia but were to proceed no further.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Germany.possible development ofpolicy.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet particulars of certain information received from a confidential source regarding the possible development of german policy. Particulars of this information are recorded in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement of secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.the13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad not yet himself seen the protest (reported in the Times of the3rd January, 1940) made by the United States Government againstinterference on our part with United States mails in American orother neutral ships on the high seas, but that it was his intention to look into the matter.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Vatican. 14.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thePossibility French Government had been definitely assured by their Ambassadorof Peace pro- at the Vatican that the Pope had no intention of putting forwardposals from the any peace proposal at the present time.. This coincided generallyPope or the with the view expressed by Sir Percy Loraine in his telegramItalian No. 390, Saving, dated the 27th December, 1939.  He (the SecretaryGovernment. of State) thought it likely that the Italian Government would seizeany favourable opportunity for making such proposals which might present itself, but he did not anticipate any such action in theimmediate future.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 4. 1940.
