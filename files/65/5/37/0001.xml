1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Supply (W.P. (G.) (40) 31).The Minister of Supply explained that he was already makinguse of capacity in India and in Australia. For any expansion of capacity in these countries the time factor would have to beconsidered, since development was likely to take considerably longer than in the United Kingdom. The destination of the stores producedalso affected his problem from the point of view of shipping space,but he was awaiting definite information as to the requirements ofour forces in the Middle East before discussing the matter in detail with the Minister of Shipping. Palestine was suitable for develop-ment as a base, but could not be regarded as a potential source of factory production.The Secretary of State for War said that any development of capacity east of the Mediterranean was important from both the strategical and the financial angles. The War Office had necessarilyto fix the scale of reserves in the Middle East on the assumption thatthe Mediterranean route would not be practicable. Hence the scale of reserves for articles produced in the United Kingdom amountedto 150 days&apos; war wastage. For articles produced in India this couldbe reduced to 90 days owing to the shorter and safer voyage, and forarticles produced in Egypt or Palestine to 30 days. The require-ments for the Forces in the Middle East had now been worked out and would be communicated to the Ministry of Supply very shortly.He agreed with the proposed use of Palestine as a Base Depot.The Secretary of State for Air asked that the Minister ofSupply would consider the requirements in common stores of our air Forces in the Middle East when developing his plans.&apos; The Chancellor of the Exchequer was in agreement with theproposal to develop capacity east of the Mediterranean, andwelcomed the possibility of thereby making a reduction in the scale;of reserves. He would like to be assured, however, that such capacitywould not be duplicated at home. He reminded the War Cabinetthat at their meeting on the 15th January, 1940, when the Report ofthe Chiefs of Staff on Military Policy in the Middle East (W.P. (39)148) was under consideration, they had invited* the defence ministers to prepare a short statement for communication to himselfdistinguishing between : (a) proposals (mainly in regard to minor items of expenditure)which, in their opinion, should be authorised forthwith;and(6) major projects.The Defence Departments had also been instructed to communicate to him the estimates of cost of the major projects as soon as theywere available. He suggested that the effect of the Minister ofSupply&apos;s proposals should be taken into account in preparing these statements and estimates.The Secretary of State for India and Burma said that ammuni-tion and explosives capacity in India was fully occupied, but could probably be increased. The Director of Ordnance Factories in india was coming home to discuss the matter. There was, moreover, somefree capacity for general stores and he was anxious to know whetheruse could be made of it.The Minister of Supply pointed out that, if this capacity was for textiles, it would be used at the expense of production in&apos;Lancashire. Lord Woolton had, however, arranged to discuss thismatter with the India Office.Middle East.Supply capacityoast of theMediterranean.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet-(i) Approved generally the Memorandum by the Minister ofSupply on Supply Capacity East of the Mediterranean(W.P.) (40) 31).(ii) Took note that particulars would be communicated to theMinister of Supply (a) by the Secretary of State for Air, in regard tocommon stores of our Air Forces in the middle east;(6) by the Secretary of State for War, in regard to therequirements of our Land Forces in the middle east.(iii) Invited the Minister of Supply, as soon as the require-ments in (ii) above had been received, to prepare a schemefor the utilisation and development of supply capacityEast of the Mediterranean, in consultation with theSecretary of State for India and Burma, the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs and the Minister ofShipping.(iv) Invited the Defence Departments to make allowance forthe effect of the Minister of Supply&apos;s proposals whenpreparing statements and financial estimates in respectof their major projects in the Middle East for sub-mission to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as directedin W.M. (40) 14th Conclusions, Minute 2 (I) (i).The Air 2.   The Secretary of State for Air said that bad weather hadSituation. again prevented activity, and there were no operations to report.(Previous East Coast patrols had had to be cancelled on account of fog.Reference: A number of aerodromes were still unserviceable, and were likelyW.M. (40) 36th to remain so, as the weather forecast was bad, with the likelihoodConclusions, of snow.Minute L) The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 36thConclusions,Minute 2.)Proposed seizure of Germansupplies toTJ.S.S.R.Shipping losses.Attacks on&quot;U -boats.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 34thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet certain details about the movement of H.M. ships.There was still no certain news of the German munition shipson the Norwegian coast.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a report had been received from Norwegian sources (telegram No. 50 fromOslo) to the effect that the German ships in question had been examined and found not to contain any munitions, but the report was probably quite untrustworthy.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the s.s. Chagres(5,400 tons) had been mined off Liverpool. She was homewardbound with a cargo of bananas, and had been taken in tow after the explosion, and might be saved.The trawler Coventry City had attacked a U-boat 6 miles north of St. Abb&apos;s Head on the previous afternoon. Two destroyers wereinvestigating.Full information had now been received of the attacks madeon a U-boat in the Western Approaches by H.M.S. Antelope, whichhad been reported to the War Cabinet at the meeting noted in the margin. Study of these reports showed that 2 U-boats had been sunk, one of which had previously sunk s.s. Beaverburn.
285W.M. 37 (4$.Announcementof U-boatsinkings.S.S. Minister.Convovs.Publication ofshipping losses.The Prime Minister thought that it would be advisable to publish the fact that two U-boats which had attacked a convoy hadbeen sunk. He appreciated the arguments in favour of non-disclosure, but he thought, that they were outweighed by thenecessity of reassuring the neutrals as to the safety of our convoys.The War Cabinet expressed agreement with this view.The Prime Minister also drew attention to the announcement which had been made about the sinking of s.s. Munster. He thoughtit would be advisable to make it clear that the ship had left hercourse and strayed into a minefield. Otherwise the confidence of passengers crossing the Irish Channel might be shaken.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to look into thematter and, if possible, to make a further announcement.Continuing, the First Lord said that the homeward-boundNorwegian convoy was now near the Shetlands. Three East Coastconvoys were held up owing to fog.At a later stage in the discussion the First Lord said that hewould have to make a statement in regard to our shipping losses, inreply to a statement issued by the German High Command. Therewas some risk of confusion, owing to figures being given (a) relatingto losses by enemy action only, and (&amp;) covering all our losses fromall sources. He favoured confining our statement to losses sustained by enemy action.General agreement was expressed with this view.The War Cabinet-(a) Took note of the above statements.(b) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consider theissue of statements about the sinking of U-boats byH.M.S. Antelope, the sinking of the s.s. Munster, and shipping losses generally, on the lines suggested.The MilitarySituation.Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)british expeditionary force:composition.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 18thConclusions,Minute 4.)Finland.(previous reference:- W.M. (40) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.The First Lord of the Admiralty referred to the statementsubmitted by the Secretary of State for War showing the detaileddistribution of the men in the British Expeditionary Force(W.P. (40) 27). Very large figures appeared under the heading of&quot; G.H.Q- and L. of C. troops,&quot; and he would like to see thesetotals broken up into their component parts, so that the numberof combatant troops, pioneer battalions, &amp;c, could be distinguished from non-combatants.The Secretary of State for War said that a statement had beenprepared on these lines in the War Office, and would be circulated.In Finland, although there was no doubt that the Finns were suffering casualties which they could ill afford, there was no confirmation of the press reports that the Mannerheim Line hadbeen broken, or even penetrated. The outcome of the fighting would depend upon the effects of fatigue on the Finns, as against theeffects on Russian morale of their continual defeats and heavy losses. Information tended to show that the Finns would last the longer of the two.
North of Lake Ladoga fighting was continuing, and in EasternFinland the Finns were still pressing the Russian 54th Division.7,500 Swedes were now in action, and, of the total of some400 aircraft promised to the Finns, 52 had arrived, and more werearriving at the rate of five to eight a day.The War&apos; Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 35thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. In connection with the previous Minute, discussion tookplace on certain aspects of assistance to Finland, a record of whichis contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Assistance to finland.InternationalVolunteerForce:Mr. HermitRooseveltsuggested as commander.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 36thConclusions,Minute 4.)Release of anti-aircraftpersonnel fromthe army.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that his advisers were strongly opposed to the proposal that Mr. KermitRoosevelt should be offered the command of the International force which was being organised to go to the help of Finland. Such an appointment might be regarded in the United States as an attempt by us to involve that country. He understood that the Secretaryof State for War also opposed the proposal. He (the Secretaryof State) had received a telephone call from Mr. Amery stronglyurging the merits of this proposal. He had told Mr. Amery thathe proposed that a letter should be sent to the Finnish Aid Bureau,stating that the Government held the exactly opposite view. Theletter would make it clear that, as the Bureau was an unofficial body,the Government did not express a final opinion on this subject;but in his (the Secretary of State&apos;s view) the Bureau would, nodoubt, decide not to proceed with this proposal.The Secretary of State for War said that he fully shared theview that the proposal to appoint Mr. Kermit Roosevelt to the command of the International Force was objectionable; it would,however, be possible for him to suggest the name of a competentofficer from the Reserve.The Government had decided not to release men from the army as volunteers for Finland, but it would be useless to send anti-aircraft guns and predictors unless we gave the Finns a few men-who understood how to operate them. He proposed, therefore,to release from the Army a small number of men (say, 8 to 10) forthis purpose.The Secretary of State for Air said that he was pursuing asimilar policy in regard to aircraft which we were supplying i.of inland.The War Cabinet-(a) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform mr. Amery that His Majesty&apos;s Government would hotfavour the appointment&apos; of Mr. Kermit Roosevelt to&apos;command the International Force of volunteers about toproceed to Finland, but that, if it was so desired, theywould suggest the name of a suitable officer from theReserve.(b) Authorised the temporary demobilisation of a small numberof men (say, 8 to 10) to proceed to Finland with the anti-aircraft guns and predictors which we had agreed t.o!supply.
The Far East: 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heRelations with bad now ascertained that the Foreign Office had sent a stiffjapan. communication to Sir Roderick Jones in regard to Reuter&apos;s action the case of the in issuing to New York an objectionable telegram regarding ourS.8. Asama decision to hand back to Japan nine of the Germans removed fromMaru. the S.S. Asama Maru.   He hoped that this would prevent the(Previous recurrence of such an incident in the future.Reference: The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.W.M. (40) 36thConclusions,Minute 6.)----------------------Roumania.Supply of equipment andraw materials.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 33rdConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad arranged to see M. Tilea, the Roumanian Minister in London,the following day, on his return from Bucharest. He hoped that atthis meeting M. Tilea would hand him the answer of the roumanian government to the questions raised in the aide-memoire on thesubject of the supply of equipment and raw materials which he had handed to him on the 30th January, 1940.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Germany.administration in German-occupiedPoland.9. The Prime Minister said that the previous day he had hadan interview with M. Zaleski, the Polish Minister for ForeignAffairs, who, in giving an account of the German administration in Poland, had laid stress upon the great corruption of the Germanofficials concerned. Thus, while the Poles were being persecuted,and many of them ruthlessly moved from one part of the country toanother, it was nevertheless possible for a Pole, who had enoughmoney, to obtain a passport and all necessary visas to leave thecountry. Similarly, whilst it was not possible to cash cheques atthe banks, this could be readily done if the Pole drawing the chequearranged in advance to hand over part of the proceeds to the gestapo. The Poles, like the German public, were.strictly forbidden to listen-in to foreign broadcasts, but there was no difficulty for aPole to listen to such broadcasts at the house of a member of the gestapo if he paid a small bribe for the purpose.If the Germans in Poland were as venal as M. Zaleski alleged,it was likely that they were venal also in Germany itself. Formerly,the German bureaucracy had been both efficient and honest, and, ifthis were no longer the case, it must be due to the general relaxation of moral standards under the Nazi regime.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement,Air Raids. 10.   The War Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumPublication of by the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of Home Securityresults. (W.P. (G.) (40) 41), reviewing the question how far it might bedesirable, in the national interest, to give publicity to the results of enemy air raids, with particular reference to civilian casualties..The Minister of Home Security said that it was necessary toestablish the principles as to publicity which the responsibleauthorities should follow, in the event of this country being sub-jected to heavy air attack. At the outbreak of war, when enemy air raids had been regarded as imminent, it had been held to be practicable and desirable to maintain a high degree of secrecy asto the results of such raids. The view of the Governments advisershad now been modified, and extreme secrecy was no longer regardedas either practicable or desirable.
It was not possible, in the absence of experience, to lay downhard and fast rules as to the extent of the information that might properly be distributed, whether centrally or locally; but para-graph 9 of the Memorandum outlined certain provisional principles,on which the Secretary of State for Air and he would like authorityto proceed.In reply to a question, the Minister said that the officialbulletins mentioned in paragraph 6 of the Memorandum would beprepared and issued on the authority of the Secretary of State forAir and the Minister of Home Security, and then distributed, in theordinary way, through the machinery of the Ministry ofInformation.The War Cabinet-Approved generally the procedure proposed in W.P. (G.)(40) 41.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 9, 1940.
