W.M.S5 (40).27.Scandinavia.Stoppage oftraffic in norwegian terri-torial waters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 9.)(a)(b)(?)The War Cabinet had before them the following Papers : Further revised draft of proposed statement (W.P. (40) 75).Views of Dominion Governments :   Memoranda by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (W.P. (40) 77and 79).Memorandum containing observations by the Minister ofFood, the President of the Board of Trade, the Ministerof Supply, the Minister of Shipping, and the Ministerfor Economic Warfare (W.P. (40) 76).(d) Memorandum bv the Chairman of the Oil Control Board(W.P. (40) 80&quot;).The Prime Minister said that, since the matter had last beendiscussed, he had taken soundings of the Leaders of the Opposition.Sir Archibald Sinclair had declared himself in favour of taking action in Norwegian territorial waters. In this he was influenced by the weight of the arguments on which our case would rest, andthe intolerable situation in which we were placed by having to obeyrules which Germany flagrantly disregarded. Mr. Attlee andMr. Greenwood took the view that, while we might be justified in considering ourselves released from the provisions of internationallaw by German methods of warfare, we would not be justified intaking action which would injure a third party. In their view, the laying of a minefield in Norwegian waters would expose that countryto attacks by Germany. Mr. Attlee also doubted whether we shouldgain any advantage sufficient to outweigh the moral disadvantagesthat we should incur.The Prime Minister then read to the War Cabinet a Note whichthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs had drawn up as aresult of a final meeting with Dominion High Commissioners (see annex to these Minutes). In forwarding the Note, the dominions secretary had said that the views expressed were not official, and,while somewhat negative in character, showed that the high commissioners had not objected to our action on principle, butdoubted the practical advantages that we should.secure. The PrimeMinister said that the views of the Dominion Prime Ministers(W.P. (40) 77 and 79) showed that, probably on account of theirgreat distance from the scene of operations, they did not perhapsaltogether appreciate the situation, and in particular the extent towhich our help to Finland was dependent on Norwegian and swedish co-operation. The Dominion Governments were not, on thewhole, in favour of the project, although they were probablyprepared to fall in with our wishes if we decided to proceed.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that he himself had arrived at a conclusion which accorded closely with that of theDominion Prime Ministers, though for somewhat different reasons.In principle, he was in favour of the project, and thought thatthere was no justification for criticism of it on moral or legalgrounds. He was also in favour of taking the initiative whenevera good opportunity occurred, tie was, however, not at all convincedthat the measure proposed would be opportune at the presentmoment. It was clear that the action proposed need not be linked up with the Altmark incident. German brutality at sea would nodoubt continue, and we should get other opportunities for puttingour scheme into operation. He had reached the conclusion that itwould be advisable to postpone taking this measure.The first consideration which weighed with him was the effectof the proposed action on the Finnish situation. He was very averseto doing anything which might prejudice the small chance thatremained that Norway and Sweden might allow us to go through tothe help of Finland. It could be argued that the minefield wouldnot really affect this question. Both Norway and Sweden, however,were entirely governed by their fear of Germany.   By laying the[20923] b 2
minefield, we should give them a pretext for saying that at themoment when they were ready to give Finland real assistance we hadupset matters by high-handed action to which Germany would bejustified in objecting. The Finns might also feel that the action proposed, by destroying the goodwill of Norway and Sweden, wouldfinally close the door to effective efforts to save them.The question which we had to ask ourselves, therefore, was whether the advantages of laying the minefield at this moment were so great as to justify us. in doing something which might injureFinland. He felt that the answer to this question must be in the negative.The Prime Minister next referred to the attitude of theUnited States of America. Many people in that country werelooking out for a stick to beat us with. They had accepted theA it mark incident mainly on humanitarian grounds, but they would regard the laying of a minefield in neutral territorial waters as anattack on neutral rights which might later prejudice their own interests. Another body of opinion would probably consider our action extremely inconsiderate to the President, if it were done at the time that Mr. Sumner Welles was travelling in Europe. Thisview might be unjustifiable, but it would have to be borne in mind.The Prime Minister did not regard the views expressed bythe Opposition or the Dominion Governments as sufficiently strongly against the project ect to be of great importance, though they couldnot be overlooked.The next point to be considered was possible retaliation byGermany and Norway. There was nothing very formidable to be feared from German retaliation; but we could not afford to passover the possibility of our supplies of iron-ore from Narvik beingcut off by Norway. Two months ago it had been thought that,provided a little time was given us to arrange the alternativesupply, we could afford to sacrifice our supplies of Swedish ore.Our stocks of ore had, however, fallen so low that six blast furnaceshal already had to be blown out, a situation which, if continued,would mean the loss of half a million tons of steel per annum. Tomake good this loss, we should either have to buy steel from abroador to reduce our output of munitions. The former course would bevery difficult as we could not afford the dollars, nor could we find the shipping space to transport the steel.The First Lord of the A dmiralty interposed that a re-arrange-ment of tonnage space could be effected if necessary to maintain ouroutput.The Prime Minister felt that, in view of the extremely seriousshipping situation recently disclosed, and of the possibility offurther disturbing factors in the future, any space saved should be devoted to building up our stocks of essential commodities. Wecould not afford, therefore, to cut ourselves off from Narvik ore.Perhaps the most dangerous form, however, which Norwegianretaliation might take, was refusal to complete the signature ofour War Trade Agreement. On this was dependent the executionof our Shipping Agreement with Norway and if the Norwegianswithdrew their tankers, the situation would indeed be serious.Once the War Trade Agreement had been signed and the ShippingAgreement was in full operation, there might be less chance of theirtaking such drastic action as to withdraw their ships; but at thepresent moment, when the Agreement was in process of being completed, there was a risk that they might draw back.Taking all these factors into account he had reluctantly cometo the conclusion that he could not advise the War Cabinet to take action in Norwegian territorial waters for the present. The projectcould be put, on. one .side, and its execution could be reconsideredas the situation developed.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired whether the PrimeMinister contemplated that the Statement which had been draftedshould still be published.The Prime Minister said that his personal view was that aStatement might still be issued; but that the present draft wouldrequire to be modified, if we decided not to follow it up withimmediate auction.The Opposition Leaders had all regarded the draft statement as an excellent presentation of the British case.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that this proposal hadbeen put forward as a contribution to our broad strategy, and not as a purely Naval operation. He was still persuaded that theoperation was justified and that it could do more to hasten the defeat of Germany than any other single measure within our power at thepresent time. The operation would indeed have been more effective if it had been carried out three months ago; it was still, however,a possible operation of war, in the special situation created bythe Altmark incident, as a result of which the attention of theworld had been directed to Germany&apos;s &quot; communication trench &quot;in Norwegian waters.He therefore greatly regretted the conclusion which the PrimeMinister had. reached, ft was obvious, however, that it would notbe right to press the Prime Minister unduly in this matter. ThePrime Minister had explained very fully the reasons which hadinfluenced him; and. there could be no question of embarking onpositive action of the first order of importance against the betterjudgment of the Prime Minister, on whose shoulders fell theprincipal burden of the conduct of the war. In essentials there wasno difference of opinion in the War Cabinet; all of them were equally anxious to strike a blow at Germany. It was better, however,not to act when one was in grave doubt as to the consequences ofone&apos;s act.His colleagues should, however, realise how the situation was developing. Our Northern European policy, which had been examined at such length both in the War Cabinet and at theSupreme War Council, was now petering out the &quot;majoroperation &quot; together with the &quot; minor operation.&quot; We were nowenjoying an interlude of quiescence, but that interlude would not.necessarily be prolonged by virtue of the decision which was beingtaken that morning. His belief was that it was dangerous to giveGermany an opportunity of quietly preparing and perfecting plans for large-scale operations. The carrying through of our Northernpolicy would not necessarily have compelled Germany to abandonany big offensive which she might be contemplating. On the otherhand, it was always possible that our action might have putGermany&apos;s preparations out of joint to such an extent as to upsether plans. Our Northern policy, however, would only have beenpossible on the assumption that the War Cabinet were completelyunited in support of it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his view of thematter followed generally that of the Prime Minister.Other members of the War Cabinet indicated that they were of the same opinion.The Prime Minister said, that he wished to thank the FirstLord of the Admiralty for the very generous reference which hehad made to his (the Prime Ministers) position in this matter.Knowing the strong views which the First Lord held as to the suggested Northern policy views with which he sympathised very strongly himself he appreciated his attitude all the more.[20923] b 3
The War Cabinet-Decided not to proceed, for the time being, with themeasures proposed for stopping traffic in Norwegian terri-torial waters, including the issue of the draft Statement(W.P. (40) 75).Norway.War trade agreement.(previous references:W.M. (39) 86thConclusions,Minute 1, andW.M. (40) 50thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister for Economic Warfare (W.P. (G.) (40) 85), asking for WarCabinet approval for his action in authorising the conclusion of aWar Trade Agreement with Norway.The Prime Minister observed that the French Government, whohad at first been inclined to be rather critical of the Agreement, had now accepted it fully, and had asked that its terms should beextended to France.As he saw the matter, one of the more important advantages which the Agreement would guarantee to us would be that norestrictions would be placed on our purchases of timber, pulp,aluminium, zinc, nickel and ferro-alloys.The Lord Privy Seal referred to the fact that the War trade agreement would come into force only ou condition that theShipping Agreement with Norway was fully implemented withoutdelay. Ffe thought that the Shipping Agreement was far moreimportant than the Trade Agreement. The signature of the lattercould not, however, be delayed until we had sufficient experience ofthe working of the former. It might be several months before wecould say whether Norway was honouring the terms of the ShippingAgreement.How did the Minister for Economic Warfare intend to get over this difficulty ? It was a very real one, as was shown by the fact that,at a very recent date, the Norwegian Government had beenencouraging their shipowners to charter their vessels elsewhererather than to this country. The Shipping Agreement had beenhanging fire since September. The situation was governed byNorway&apos;s weakness and her great fear of Germany.The Minister for Economic Warfare said that he was persuadedthat the Norwegians intended to honour both their Shipping and war Trade Agreements with us. They were, in fact, relieved tohave come to terms with us. Our two Agreements would give them the stiffening which they required in order to resist Germany&apos;scontinual economic demands.If Norway did not implement the Shipping Agreement, ourremedy was to denounce the War Trade Agreement. The latterAgreement, however, conferred considerable advantages upon us,as well as upon the Norwegians.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his judgment of the situation, in the light of his conversations with theNorwegian Minister, was similar to that of the Minister for economic Warfare. The Norwegians, in his view, having made thebest bargain in their power, fully intended to keep it.The Prime Minister said that he had been shown a very interesting note by Lord Glenconner and Mr. Charles Hambro, whohad considerable experience of Norway and had taken part in thenegotiations at Oslo.  He read out the following passage : &quot; There is a growing realisation in Norway that their veryfuture existence depends on our victory and that before long theymay have to play a more active role. Public opinion is, however,still a long way behind our own and they are not preparedto incur greater risks until preparations have been made tomeet them.  In this regard the Norwegian Minister of Supply
expressed the wish to initiate secret naval and military conversations with us when the War Trade Agreement has been signed, and it is rather by cultivating their goodwill andinspiring them with confidence in our ability to take jointmeasures for their defence that we can best hope to bring them more actively on our side. It is.not, for instance, impossible that we may persuade them to charter us the whole of theirmercantile fleet if we could provide them with some anti-aircraft guns, and it is hoped that the War Trade agreement can be also improved at the expiration of the first 3 months.&quot;Prima facie it would seem to be excellent business if we were,in fact, able to charter the whole of Norway&apos;s mercantile marineon the terms suggested.The War Cabinet :-Approved the action of the Minister for Economic Warfarein authorising the conclusion of the War Trade Agreementwith Norway.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 54thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that owing to bad weather over the North Sea the previous day, there had been no enemy air activity.Twenty-six patrols, involving 53 aircraft of Fighter Command,had been engaged on convoy and shipping protection and Channelescort. One aircraft on patrol had made a forced landing in thesea.  It was not yet known whether the aircraft could be recovered.A reconnaissance had been carried out over the heligoland bight, covering certain areas which had not been dealt with on previous reconnaissances, with the object of locating enemywarships. Bad visibility, however, had prevented observation; bothaircraft had safely returned to their base.The usual reconnaissances, anti-submarine controls and convoy escorts had been flown by the aircraft of Coastal Command, butthere was nothing of interest to report.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)Attacks on shipping.Protection ofcoastwiseshipping.4. The Chief of Naval Staff gave the the War Cabinet detailsabout the Norwegian convoys.At 1 p.m. on the 27th, the British fishing trawler Arora(192 tons) had been bombed and machine-gunned off Buchan Ness(Aberdeen) by two Heinkels. One incendiary bomb had landed onthe deck but had been extinguished. The trawler had replied withLewis guns and reported that tracer bullets had entered the forepartof one of the aircraft, which had then retired, apparently losingheight.   The trawler&apos;s cook had been wounded.There had been no attacks either by, or on, U-boats.S.S. Ulster Queen (3,700 tons) was still ashore off the Isle ofMan; and there was said to be little chance of salvage.The Secretary of State for War said that, as a result of discussions which had taken place between the War Office and AirMinistry on the subject of the protection of coastwise shipping, ithad been decided, as a temporary measure, to release from InfantryBegiments 400 to 500 Bren machine guns and their crews to manthese ships.
The MilitarySituation.(previous erence:W.M. (40) 54thConclusions,Minute 3.)The western front.Finland.Intentions ofFinnish GeneralStaff.5. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat there was nothing of importance to report from the western front. In reply to the Prime Minister, he said that the War office had received no information which would confirm the report whichhad appeared in The Times on the previous day that there had beenunusual activity in the Luxemburg area.After two days&apos; silence, which had been due to a breakdown ofthe telephone and the fact that no communique had been issuedby the Finnish Headquarters, a report had that morning beenreceived from our Military Attache. This confirmed the War Officeview that the latest line claimed by the Russians did not indicatemore than local advances, and that the Russians were not more thanin contact with the main Finnish defensive line in this area. Therehad been no signs of the Russians having made progress on theWestern flank, which was the important point at the moment.A Press Report from Helsinki stated that the total Russianlosses in tanks now amounted to not less than 1,288. There had beenindications from various sources that a good many new RussianDivisions had been brought up recently. A telegram from our minister in Finland said that, whilst the General Staff were notalarmed about the present situation in the Karelian Isthmus, theywould only stay on their present line until such time as the new line was ready for them to fall back upon.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 54thConclusions,Minute 4.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 50thConclusions,Minute 8.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1.)6.   The War Cabinet gave consideration to (1) An oral report by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs of a conversation which had taken place that morningbetween M. Corbin, the French Ambassador, andSir A. Cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.(2) An oral report by the Chief of the Air Staff on the progressof certain preparations.(3) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 78).A record of the discussions which took place and of theConclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.Assistance to finland.Supply ofmunitions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 11.)Small arms ammunition.7. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence informed theWar Cabinet that practically all the military stores promised to finland had already arrived in that country. The exceptionsincluded some of the aircraft, the 30 field guns and ammunition,and a few anti-tank rifles and mortars and their ammunition. all of these were on their way. A certain delay was being experienced in getting the Gauntlets ready.The War Cabinet would recollect that Imperial chemical industries had been authorised to convert plant for the productionof 20 million rounds of small arm ammunition for Finland. It hadbeen estimated that this supply would be completed one month after
the date of the conversion of the plant. Production had startedbut could not exceed one million rounds a week. Thus the full order would not be completed for A\ months. The possibility of accelerat-ing production was being taken up with the Ministry of Supply.Supply of The Chief of the Air Staff gave the War Cabinet detailsaircraft. regarding the supply of aircraft.   This had included the despatchof 6 Hurricanes, which had arrived at Stavanger, whither theyhad been flown by Finnish pilots; and 12 Blenheims which had beenferried to Finland by British pilots.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegrams Nos. 174 and 175 Dipp., elated the 27th February, 1940,from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome. Sir Percy Loraine reportedthat Mr. Sumner Welles hoped to arrive in London between the8th and 10th March. He had had a conversation with Mr. sumner welles in which the latter had said little of interest except that nothing in his talks with Signor Mussolini or Count Ciano led himto imagine that there was any prospect of a rapprochement betweenRome and Moscow.No arrangements had, as yet, been made for the programme tobe followed during Mr. Sumner Welles&apos;s stay in London, but theForeign Office had asked the United States Embassy for suggestions.The United States Ambassador was due back in London before mr. Sumner Welles&apos;s arrival.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 29, 1940.United Statesof America.Mr. sumner welles &apos;s visit tcEurope.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 8.)
ANNEX.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(See Minute 1.)WE should be guided not only by our sympathy for the Finns, but even moreby consideration of the effect on the course of the war which might result from finland&apos;s disappearance.2. The question of the effect of any action on our ability to assist Finlandis therefore the essential criterion.3. Whilst some doubts are felt as to the possible effect on neutral opinion, itis considered that we have sufficient justification for intervening in norwegian territorial waters.4. This question should, however, be treated in relation to its effect upon our ability to help Finland, and action should not be taken unless and until the UnitedKingdom Government are convinced that it will not interfere with our chances of helping Finland (a) by creating an unfavourable atmosphere in Scandinavia for the reception of Marshal Mannerheim&apos;s forthcoming appeal;(b) in the event of the failure of that appeal, by provoking Scandinavian orGerman reactions which would reduce the amount of assistance thatwe should still be able to continue to give to Finland.5. We should be careful not to take any action which might prejudice ourrelations with Sweden and hence tend to prevent the possibility that Sweden will eventually come in on our side and deny the iron-ore to Germany.6. The undoubted stimulation of morale which has resulted from theA it mark incident carried with it a temptation to us all to take other action in norwegian waters without a full appreciation of the effect of such action (1) onour ability to afford further assistance to Finland and (2) on the supply of swedish iron-ore to Germany and the Allies respectively.
