The air situation. /(previous reference:W:M. (40) 3rd.Conclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that, apart from thenormal patrols by aircraft of the Coastal Command, and some highaltitude patrols by the Fighter Command, designed to interceptany long-distance enemy reconnaissance aircraft which might be attempted, there had been no activity over the North Sea on theprevious day.Two patrols had watched the German seaplane bases in theearly part of the previous night, but later the patrols had been abandoned on account of bad weather.Two airci-aft had dropped leaflets over the Hamburg and bremen areas.The Secretary of State for Air passed round copies of the leaflets which had been dropped, and of another leaflet which wasin course of preparation. He said that study was being directed to the incorporation of novel ideas in the form and contents of futureleaflets.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Magnetic mines.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 116thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Sea Lord said that the Commander-in-Chief hadtransferred his flag to H.M.S. Rodney.H.M.S. Barham was in dock at Liverpool, and it was estimatedthat she would be fit for sea again in four months.H.M.S. Nelson had left the previous day for Portsmouth, where she would be docked. Since the arrival of H.M.S. Nelson at Ports-mouth could not be concealed, the Director of Naval Intelligencehad arranged to see representatives of the Press that afternoon.He would tell them what had occurred and ask them to refrain from mentioning it in their papers in order to prevent theinformation from reaching Germany.The Northern Patrol was again in full operation and themajority of old cruisers had been replaced by ships of a more modernclass.The Admiralty had made enquiries about the report, of whichthe War Cabinet had been informed the previous day, that theS.S. Kiruna, a Swedish ship, had been torpedoed 900 miles out inthe Atlantic. The owners gave the position of the ship at the time as 100 miles from Newfoundland, so that it was probable that thereport was erroneous.The First Sea Lord gave the War Cabinet details of progress which had been made with devices to combat the magnetic mines.One device, which had been in preparation since the beginning ofthe war, had been tried out in the Thames Estuary the previous day with satisfactory results.Examination of the big mine which had been recovered nearFaversham showed that the explosive it contained was 15 per cent,more powerful than T.N.T., but rather less powerful than theexplosive we were now developing.There had been no attacks on trade. The S.S. Rothesay Castlehad gone ashore in fog off Islay. Tugs were proceeding to refloather.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 1stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report on the Western Front.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[20597]is 2
Finland.Invasion by .S.S.R.(Previous;Reference:W.M. (40) 3rdConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Secretary of State for War said that there were no reports of further fighting in Finland, but it was believed that the murmansk railway had been cut by the Finns in five places.The first supplies from Great Britain, consisting of an assort-ment of military stores, such as small arms, gas masks, &amp;c., had arrived the previous Sunday at Haparanda, on the Swedish-Finnishfrontier.In reply to an enquiry by the Prime Minister, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff said that it was not possible to usegas in very low temperatures, and reports from Finland that theRussians were using gas probably originated from the fumes thrownoff by all types of high explosive shells.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.contraband control.United Statesprotest.at inter -ference with united Statesmails.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 3rdConclusions,Minute 13.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad now examined the Note addressed to us by the United StatesGovernment protesting against interference on our part with UnitedStates mails in American or other neutral ships on the high seas.The Note was not as stiff in its terms as the press report had suggested. The Foreign Office took the view that the United StatesGovernment had felt bound on formal grounds to make this protest,the terms of which were less stiff than that adopted in similarcommunications addressed to us by the United States government during the last war. A reply to the United States Government wasbeing prepared in the Foreign Office; and would be sent to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, for his comments before itwas delivered to the United States Government.The Prime Minister said that he was not surprised that a protest had been made, but that he would be vexed if the termsof that protest, coming as it did from a friendly country, were suchas to provide ammunition for German propaganda.The Secretary of Slate for Foreign A ffairs said that the UnitedStates Government were concerned to protect their position andtherefore felt bound to raise the legal argument whether our action was one of contraband examination or censorship. In the latter case it would be unjustified while in the former it would not.Their contention was that we were imposing an unjustified censor-ship on their mails, while we contended that any action was designedto secure that the mails were not being used for the carriage of contraband to the enemy. It was true that the Note concluded by stating that the United States Government felt bound to enter a&apos;&apos; vigorous protest&apos;&apos; against our action, but nevertheless he did not feel that the Note was really unfriendly.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Scandinavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 3rdConclusions,Minute 9.)6. Further statements were made on the subject of scandinavia by the First Sea Lord and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs. Particulars of these statements are recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of these statements.
Italy.Relations withGermany. ,(previous references:W.M. (39) 70thConclusions,Minute 8.)and 116thConclusions,Minute 9.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to atelegram which he had received reporting that Field-marshal goering was proceeding to Venice to meet Signor Mussolini for thepurpose of invoking Italian assistance to secure the adoption byRoumania of a policy more friendly to Germany. A telegram(No. 11) had now been received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Rome, reporting that Count Ciano had said that this rumour wasunfounded, and that no special contacts with Germany had beenarranged; he (Count Ciano) was himself going to Venice in orderto see the Hungarian Minister, and this might be the origin of therumour in question.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Eire. 8.   The   Secretary   of   State   for   Dominion  Affairs   saidInternal that   a   communication   from   Sir   John   Maffey,   and   con-political versa tions  with  Mr.  Dulanty,  made  it  clear  that  a  serious situation. internal situation was developing in Eire.   The success to beachieved by this challenge to Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government would depend on the vigour with which Mr. de Valera reacted to the threat of the I.R.A. If, for any reason, Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government wereto fall, the likelihood was that any new Government formed wouldbe more sympathetic to the I.R.A. outlook and therefore still lessamenable to our influence. The Secretary of State thought thatat some stage it would be necessary for the War Cabinet to giveconsideration to the fate of the Coventry murderers, since, if theywere hanged, they would certainly be proclaimed as martyrs by theI.R.A., and the position of Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government would bestill further weakened.The Secretary of State for the Home Department said that this last point was not one of immediate urgency, since the appeal bythe condemned men was not due to be heard until the 15th January.He (the Secretary of State) did not wish to discuss this matter atthe present stage, beyond recalling that the murders at Coventrywere of a peculiarly brutal and callous nature.The Prime Minister said that no doubt the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs would continue to keep a close watch on thedevelopment of the situation in Eire, and would raise the matter again at the War Cabinet when he thought necessary.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.War Cabinet 9.   The Prime Minister reminded the War Cabinet  that,Arrangements, in accordance with the arrangements which he had proposed for/T1 meetings of the War Cabinet during the Christmas Recess, the reference- meetings of the War Cabinet on Saturday, 6th, Monday, 8th, andWM (391122nd Tuesday, 9th January, would not be full meetings. The threeConclusions Ministers in attendance for these meetings would be the Lord PrivyMinute 4 ) &apos;      Seal, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for War.If circumstances should render it necessary, a meeting of theWar Cabinet with a full attendance of Ministers could, of course,be arranged at short notice. The present intention, however, wasthat meetings of the War Cabinet with a full attendance ofMinisters would be held on three days only in the following week,namely, on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.The War Cabinet took note of the above arrangement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 5, 1940.
