The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.)Air attacks onmerchantshipping.Action against aGermansubmarine.1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat German bombers had repeated their attacks against our shipping on the East Coast during the previous day. In all, some19 enemy aircraft had been plotted between the Firth of Tay andthe Kentish Coast. Attacks had developed by aircraft operatingeither singly or in pairs at 11-20 a.m. and had continued for about two hours, being resumed again in the afternoon when raidersapproached the Thames Estuary and the Tyne. Our fighter action had again been restricted by weather conditions and six of our fighter aerodromes had again been unserviceable on account ofsnow.  Nevertheless, 100 Fighters had taken off.One Ffeinkel 111 had been shot down in the sea by Hurricanesoff the coast of Northumberland. Others had been sighted, but had escaped into the clouds, one of these, near May Island, having been engaged and damaged.Air Raid warnings had been sounded in York, Middlesbroughand Newcastle.There had been no operations by Bomber Command or british air Forces in France.A Sunderland of 228 Squadron, in conjunction with.H.M.S. Fowey and other warships, had successfully attacked aGerman submarine, which had sunk approximately 120 miles south-west of Land&apos;s End at 2-50 p.m. on the previous afternoon. Thissubmarine had been first attacked and depth-charged byH.M.S. Fowey, but contact with it had then been lost. TheSunderland, which had been summoned to take part in the search,had sighted the submarine through a break in the clouds, which hadbeen down to sea-level. The submarine had been on the surface,proceeding at 10 knots. The aircraft had dropped one 250-lb. anti-submarine bomb about 20 feet on the starboard side of thesubmarine, the clouds having been too low to allow of a series of bombs being dropped. As it was then clear that the submarine was unable to submerge, the aircraft proceeded to and summoned thenaval vessels. On returning to the submarined position, which hadbeen marked by a smoke-float, the aircraft found that the submarine had disappeared and that only survivors and a rubber dinghy werevisible. Forty-one survivors in all had been picked up byH.M.S. Fowey and other vessels.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 27thConclusions,Minute 6.)Action against aGermansubmarine.Air attacks onmerchantshipping.2. The First Lord of the A dmiralty informed the WarCabinet that the U-boat which had been sunk (see Minute 1) hadbeen responsible for the sinking of the Greek steamer Keramial(5,085 tons) south-west of the Lizard, and also of the British tankerVaclite (5,026 tons). H.M.S. Fowey, escorting the tail-end of the convoy of which the Keramial formed a part, had attacked withdepth-charges. Subsequently, the Sunderland aircraft had seen tbesubmarine on the surface, apparently unable to dive, and had dropped a bomb. The Sunderland had been engaged with anti-aircraft fire and had returned fire. The Sunderland had theninformed destroyers in the vicinity of the position of the enemy. Ontheir arrival, however, the destroyers had found that the submarine had sunk, and 41 survivors had been picked up. H.M.S. Fowey had reported that, from a number marked on salved escape apparatus,the U-boat was thought to be U-55, but survivors had volunteeredthat she was the U-54 and had come north of Skaw and Scotland.A. most satisfactory feature of this engagement was the factthat good co-operation between the Navy and the Air Force had been successful in disposing of a U-boat which had attacked a convoy.Enemy air attacks on our trade had been renewed on theprevious day with great severity and had been carried out with bombs and machine guns. A brutal feature of these attacks was[20756] b 2
that they were directed almost entirely against small unarmedvessels, and that the assailants invariably withdrew on the fewoccasions when they met anti-aircraft fire, however slight.The list of sinkings included The Royal Crown (4.364 tons), sunk off the Thames.The collier Giralda (2,178 tons), sunk off the Orkneys.The Cory ton (4,554 tons), reported by French W/T as having been sunk off Yarmouth.The Stancourt (965 tons), ashore off the Orkneys.The Bank-rest (4,440 tons), on fire and abandoned off Wick.The Highwave (11,078 tons), possibly off Kentish KnockLight Vessel.The Voseda (7,216 tons), ashore on Winterton Ridge off the norfolk Coast, The weather had been too bad for salvage, buther crew had been taken off by H.M.S. Vivien.A number of casualties had been caused by machine-gun fire and comparatively few survivors had been saved from the shipssunk.The enemy attacks on the previous day had thus accounted fora considerable loss of British shipping. The weather conditionshad, however, been very unfavourable to the defence. Meanwhile,counter-measures had been decided upon, in concert with the AirMinistiy. Coastwise shipping was being formed into groups, whosepositions would be known at any given moment. Their passagealong the coast would be watched and Fighter Squadrons inprescribed sectors would be standing by to come to their rescue, ifnecessary. One armed trawler would be allotted to each group. all available anti-aircraft guns wdiich could be spared from ships inrepair would be used for the arming of merchant vessels. steps were being taken to accelerate the provision of low-ceiling R.D.F,of which the development was going well.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that, when developed,these measures should go far to reduce sinkings. When the attacks by magnetic mines had started, the policy had been adopted of shipssailing independently and avoiding the Thames. It was now considered that attacks by aircraft had outstripped the danger frommines, and the policy of grouping ships had therefore been adopted.As f possible, there would be no independent sailings by clay.This wTould probably result in a slowing down of deliveries to theextent of about 15 per cent.The essence of the problem was a shortage of anti-aircraft guns.The Admiralty were investigating the means of improving thesupply of anti-aircraft equipment for merchant vessels, apart fromthe steps which were being taken to provide guns from ships under repair.The Secretary of State for Air quoted the attack on the trawlerRigoloska as an example of the brutality of the enemy. This vesselhad been attacked at 10-50 on the 29th January five times by aDornier 17 carrying two machine guns in each wing. Twenty ormore incendiary bombs had been dropped. The skipper had been shot and killed at the wheel, whilst the mate had been shot andkilled when trying to throw an incendiary bomb over the side. Theremainder of the crew had been sent below, and the ship hadeventually been brought in by the third mate after all its fishing-gearhad been shot away.The Prime Minister said that he would include a reference tothese attacks in a speech which he would be making that afternoon,and would emphasise the brutal aspect of them.In further discussion, it was agreed that the Prime minister should also make reference to the sinking of the U-boat, and in so doing stress the point that it was an example of the protectionprovided for our convoys.
Enemy attacks The British ship Eston (1,487 tons), which had dropped out of on merchant convoy, had been mined at about midnight on the 28th. off Blyth in shipping other    a dangerous area.than by aircraft. The Dutch steamer Nora (298 tons) had been damaged by a minewhen at anchor 1 mile east of Deal, and was now beached. Therehad been one serious casualty, which was expected to recover.The sinking of the British tanker Vaolite (5,026 tons) and the-Greek steamer Keramial had already been mentioned.Coal supplies. The Minister without Portfolio drew attention to the drastic measures which had been adopted, including requisitioning, to dealwith the serious shortage of coal, as reported in the Second Supple-ment to the Ninth Fortnightly Report submitted by the Secretaryfor Mines (W.P. (R.) (40) 41). &apos;The Home Secretary said the matter had been the subject ofa report at the Civil Defence Committee that morning. The drastic measures which had been taken with goodwill on all sides had greatly eased the situation. It was not now thought that any important work would be held up by shortage of coal.The First Lord of the Admiralty, in reply to a question by theMinister without Portfolio, said that he had been giving active consideration to what might be done in retaliation for the attacks on shipping.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.Western front and Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 27thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.From Finland also, apart from some artillery fire on theIsthmus Front and some attacks by the Russians north of lake ladoga, there was nothing of importance to report. Russian air attacks had been heavy, but the Finns claimed to have brought downtwenty-one Russian aircraft.The War Cabinet, took note of the above statement.Weekly 4. The War Cabinet took note of the following WeeklyReports.           Reports : (Previous (1) Weekly Report (No. 21) by the Secretary of State for WarReference: (W.P. (40) 38).W.M. (40) 22nd (2) Weekly Report (No. 21) by the Secretary of State for AirConclusions, (W.P. (40) 37).Minute 6.)Germany.Herr Hitler&apos;sspeech on 30thJanuary, 1940.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hethought that Herr Hitler&apos;s broadcast speech the previous eveningwas a weak one, and was entirely that of a man on the defensive.The best course, he thought, would be to ignore it.The Prime Minister agreed, and added that he had no intentionof making any reference to the matter in his speech that day.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.U.S.S.R.Observations byM. Maisky onthe Soviet-Finnish conflict.6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatMr. R. A. Butler, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, had had an interview the previous afternoon withM. Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador; a record of what had passedwould be circulated. M. Maisky had spoken appreciatively of theattitude taken by the present Secretary of State for DominionAffairs when during the Spanish conflict he had suggested that it[20756] b 3
might be possible to isolate the conflict within the frontiers of Spain.Would it not be possible, he now suggested, for us to adopt asimilar attitude in regard to Finland ? To this Mr. Butler had replied that no doubt the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs would be the first to recognise the profound difference between theformer position in Spain and that which now existed in Finland.The War&apos; Cabinet took note of the above statement.U.S.S.R.Issue of warning to Sovietmerchant ships.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 27thConclusions,Minute 10.)7. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that since themeeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin he had receiveda number of further reports from confidential sources indicating that the Soviet Government had issued orders to all merchant shipsflying the Soviet flag to return home or to take refuge in neutral ports by a certain date.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Scandinavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 26thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatM. Prytz, the Swedish Minister, had now returned to London from Stockholm, and he proposed that afternoon to have an interview with him, and probably also with M. Cobban, the norweigen minister, in order to ascertain whether either had any fresh infor-mation to give on the questions which we had put to their respective governments. *The War Cabinet took note of the above statement,Roumania.Supply andequipment ofwar materials.(previous references:W.M. (40) 25thConclusions,Minute 6, andW.M. (40) 22ndConclusions,Minute 11.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprevious day he had handed to M. Tilea, the Roumanian Minister,an aide-memoire, which agreed in substance with the document which the War Cabinet had had before them at the meeting noted in the margin, subject to certain modifications of detail agreed in discussion with M. Berthoud. M. Tilea had thought that theRoumanian Government would give us the information we wanted,and seemed relieved that the aide-memoire was not even moreunfavourable from the Roumanian point of view. He had evenasked whether, in view of the probably favourable reply of hisGovernment, we should be prepared to consider treating Roumaniawith greater and more early generosity in the matter of credits. Tothis he (the Secretary of State) had replied that he thought it better to await the answer of the Roumanian Government, M. Tilea hadbeen emphatic that the Roumanian Government had taken no actioninconsistent with the German-Roumanian Agreement of March1939, which had provided that Roumania should export to Germany25 per cent, of her output of various commodities. To this he (theSecretary of State) had replied that our chief complaint was thatin recent times the Roumanian Government had taken various stepsvis-a-vis Germany without first consulting us.The Minister without Portfolio said that it might be the case that technically the Roumanian Government had not gone outsidethe terms of their Agreement of March 1939, but the transactionswere difficult to follow owing to the two Governments having agreedupon an alteration in the exchange value of the Lei.M. Berthoud had suggested that, as the Germans wereobtaining very little oil from Roumania at the present time, thepresent was a good moment for us to withhold orders for thepurchase of oil from those Companies which were not under either
The Balkans.Attitude ofItaly.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 9thConclusions,Minute 4.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he proposed that afternoon to have a general discussion with SignorBastianini, the Italian Ambassador. As possibly throwing somelight on the Italian standpoint, telegram No. 106 Dipp, dated the29th January, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, wasnot without interest. In this telegram Sir Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen reported that, at an interview that day, M. Sarajoglu, theTurkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, had read to him a telegramfrom the Turkish Ambassador in Bucharest, reporting upon therecent visit to Rome of M. Angelescu, the former roumanian minister for Foreign Affairs. According to this report, count ciano had given an undertaking to M. Angelescu that, in the eventof a Soviet attack on Roumania, Italy would prevent Hungary and bulgaria from attacking her, and would supply war material,particularly aircraft: M. Angelescu had received the impression that Italy was veering more and more towards the side of the Allies.In the same telegram Sir Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen reported thatM. Sarajoglu had added that the Roumanian Ambassador atAnkara had informed him that Count Ciano had expressed toM. Angelescu the view that Germany was already beaten.The Prime Minister said that the latter observation was in line with remarks made by the Italian Ambassador in Paris, as shownin a report received a few weeks previously from Sir RonaldCampbell.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that, according to reports received from a highly secret source, the Italians were at present engaged in refortifying their frontier on the Brenner Pass.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The Far Bast: 11.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heRelations with had received information from a highly secret source that theJapan. Japanese steamship Heyio Maru was due to leave the port of CallaoThe case of the in Peru on the 3rd February, having on board - a man who wasS.S. Heyio described as the arch-German spy in Brazil and a number of officersMaru. 01 the Graf Spee.   He was taking steps to verify this report.   Assoon as the facts were established, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Tokyo, should be instructed to take up the matter with the JapaneseGovernment, and he proposed to send him a preliminary warning.He hoped that there would be time for the War Cabinet to considerthe matter before the Ileyio Maru was intercepted by any of HisMajesty&apos;s ships, and that this ship could be intercepted at aconsiderable distance from the Japanese coast. Fie was informedthat she was due to call at Hawaii on her way to Japan.The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that steamshipHeyio Maru could probably only be intercepted either off Callao orour own or friendly control, as was actually being done at themoment. Such action would place the Roumanian Government ingreat difficulties and should tend to make them more amenable to our point of view. It should also have the effect for the time being oflowering the price which we had to pay for Roumanian oil.As regards the torpedo boats which had already been handedover to Roumanian personnel in this country, and which the WarCabinet had therefore agreed could not be held up, he had beeninformed that these boats were still in this country. The delay was said to be because the Roumanians on board had no money&apos; withwhich, to make the journey.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
off the Japanese coast, if she went direct, or off any ports at which she called. He would at once make enquiries and inform theForeign Office.The case of the j^he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegramS.S. Asama ;N[a 74 to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, which carried out theMaru. instructions agreed upon at the previous meeting of the War(Previous Cabinet.    He drew attention also to telegram No. 175 of theBeference: 30th. January, in which Sir Robert Craigie submitted a report of aW.M. (40) 27th long discussion he had had with M. Arita, the Japanese MinisterConclusions,      for Foreign Affairs : Minute 9.)M. Arita had strongly maintained that the return of the twenty-one Germans was an indispensable preliminary to any settlement of the Asama Maru case, and to any agreement forthe prevention of further incidents in future. Sir robert craigie had used every argument at his command to, show howimpossible it would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept such a demand; and eventually M. Arita had agreed to listen to Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s explanation as to what he consideredwould be the practical effect of a solution on the basis indicatedin paragraph 7 of his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) telegramNo. 54. Sir Robert Craigie had then said that he could not yetindicate how ma.ny Germans might be returnable on the basisof the investigation then in progress, but that he would askagain urgently that the proceedings might be expedited inorder that he might be furnished with the necessary material.M. Arita had emphasised that, without consulting hiscolleagues, it was impossible for him to commit himself in anyway; he had, however, promised to inform Sir Robert Craigiethe following day whether the Japanese Government would beprepared to give serious consideration to a solution on the lines indicated. He had added that, of course, everything must depend on the number of men whom the investigation showedto be returnable. He was inclined at one time to argue that thereturn of the men must be kept quite separate from the questionof preventing the embarkation of further German tech-nicians, &amp;c.; but he (Sir Robert Craigie) thought that he hadargued him out of this idea.Sir Robert Craigie had added that, though it was guess-work, he did not consider that the Japanese Government would look at a solution on the lines suggested, unless at least sevenor eight of the Germans in question were found on investiga-tion to be returnable.The Secretary of State suggested that the War Cabinet should agree to the dispatch of instructions to Sir Robert Craigie,authorising him to secure the best settlement possible, on the basis that we should be prepared to return up to one half of the germans in question. :       &apos;!Sir Robert should, of course, make it clear to the JapaneseGovernment that whatever number we agreed to return was thenumber which the investigation showed was returnable. He (theSecretary of State) had previously been rather averse from hagglingwith the Japanese Government on the question of numbers, but his advisers were unanimous in considering that, in dealing with apeople like the Japanese, this was the best course to follow; and he accepted their view.The Secretary of State recalled that, in the first telegram hehad sent to Sir Robert Craigie, he had indicated that as a second alternative we might be prepared to hand over all the twenty-oneGermans to the Japanese Government, on condition either that theJapanese Government agreed to intern them in Japan or that theyshould be sent back to the United States. It now seemed that thesuggestion contained in the second proviso was not practicable-owing to United States opposition.
The War Cabinet agreed : (a) As regards the s.s. Heyio Maru: (i) to invite the First Lord of the Admiralty to reportto the Foreign Secretary as to the possibilitiesopen to us for intercepting the vessel;(ii) to defer consideration of the issues involved untilthe investigations instituted by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, as to whether officersof the Graf Spec were to sail on this vessel, hadbeen completed.(b) As regards the s.s. Asama Maru:that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should address a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Tokyo, authorising him to secure the best settlementpossible on the basis that we should be prepared toreturn up to one half of the Germans in question, subjectto a satisfactory general agreement being reached forthe future.It would be made clear to the Japanese Governmentthat whatever number of Germans we agreed to returnwas the number which our investigations showed to bereturnable, and was not an arbitrary figure.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,January 31, 1940.
