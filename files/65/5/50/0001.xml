Scandinavia.Stoppage oftraffic in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W:M. (40) 49thConclusions,Minute 5.)proposed statement byHis Majesty&apos;sGovernment.Probablereactions ofUnited States ofAmerica andItaly.1. The War Cabinet had before them a draft of a statement to be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the event of a decisionbeing reached to take belligerent action in Norwegian territorial waters (W.P. (40) 61).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the draftbefore the War Cabinet had been prepared with the help of the attorney-General and the experts of the Foreign Office and theAdmiralty. It had been felt that it was difficult to rest the argument for our proposed action on improper use of Norwegian territorial waters by Germany. We had already exploited the Altmark case with considerable success. Of the three cases of German sinkingsin these waters, two were contested by the Norwegians. The other possible examples of improper action by Germany were mainlyhypothetical, and unfortunately the Admiralty were unable toproduce evidence in support of them.For this reason, at the end of page 2 in the draft, the argumentswitched from legal grounds to the general case of Germany&apos;sbrutality in the conduct of tlhe war. The line taken on this subject was, briefly, that Germany was doing her utmost to strangle british trade and, more than that, to stop all sea-borne trade of any sortwhich might in any way be of advantage to us. Consequently, wecould not feel ourselves bound to keep all the rules of war, and thereby allow the enemy to have the double advantage of disregard-ing those rules which suited him, while sheltering behind the strictobservance of the rules by us.It would be for the Wax Cabinet to decide whether they considered this argument provided us with sufficient support forthe action which it was proposed to take.The Foreign Secretary said he had sent telegrams to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Rome (No. 100) and Washington (No. 271)asking for an expression of their opinion as to the probable reactions of Italy and the United States to belligerent action on our partin Norwegian waters. He read to the War Cabinet the replieswhich had been received to these telegrams, which might besummarised as follows : Rome telegram No. 147, Dipp, dated February 22, 1940.Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s view was that there might be con-siderable sympathy with us on the part of the Italian naval authorities and some members of the Government who were well disposed towards us. As to the arguments to be used insupport of our action, that of the passage of German warmaterial to Murmansk, if it could be established, would havethe strongest appeal; that of the torpedoing by german submarines of ships in Norwegian waters would commandrespect, especially if accompanied by publication of any formalprotests made at the time by the Norwegian Government. the argument of Norwegian inability to preserve her neutralitymight be regarded as controversial. It was difficult to predictSignor Mussolini&apos;s reactions, but in general Sir Percy Lorainethought that, if the justification for our action was not alegalistic one, Signor Mussolini would hold the scales fairly-evenly.Washington telegram No. 257, dated February 23, 1940.Lord Lothian reported that the Altmark incident hadreceived a good press in the United States, but this might bedue largely to special humanitarian considerations. Actionsuch as was now proposed might be less well received. anything which could be regarded as bullying a small neutral would be resented and strengthen the growing sentiment for maintainingAmerican neutral rights against us. The reactions of the[20878] B 2
important Scandinavian minority would have to be taken intoaccount. The movement to enforce respect for the PanamaZone by imposing sanctions might be stimulated, particularlyin South America. On the other hand, if we could prove thatGermany was violating Norwegian waters, and gaining,advantages therefrom, and that the Norwegian Governmentcould not prevent this, American opinion might be favourable,particularly if it was clear that our action would be animportant contribution towards winning the war and givingassistance to Finland. Much would depend on the justificationwhich could be made out under international law. the argument that Norwegian waters were used for the carriage of German iron ore or war material would have little weight,since American ports were constantly used by Allied merchant ships for the same purpose.Neutral The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then gave anreactions to the appreciation of the effects on neutral opinion of the A ItmarkAltmark incident.   The general reactions of the neutral press and publicincident. opinion had been favourable, and the humanitarian motives of our action had been appreciated. It was felt that the action of Norwaywas distinctly suspicious, but that she had nevertheless a tenablelegal case. Most neutrals seemed to think that our action, thoughhigh-handed, had been justifiable in this particular case, but thatit was not an action which should be repeated. If we took furtherbelligerent action in Norwegian waters, on grounds which were inno way based on humanitarian motives, it was probable that neutral opinion would swing against us.As regards Scandinavia, the drift of opinion before theA it mark incident had definitely been moving in our favour, but this incident had, at least temporarily, turned it away from us. If itwere possible to isolate the Altmark incident, this drift might once more set towards us. If, on the other hand, the Altmark affair wasonly to be the first step in further infringements of Norwegianneutrality, feeling was likely to set strongly against us. In fact, theA it mark incident was more of a liability than an asset to us.The Foreign Secretary summed up his conclusions broadly asfollows : We could not make much of a case for our proposed actionon purely legal grounds, since we had not sufficient proof ofGermany&apos;s transgressions in Norwegian waters; but we could makea broad case, on grounds of rough justice, for taking the gloves off and dealing in a rather high-handed manner with Norway in orderto protect ourselves against Germany&apos;s methods of warfare at sea.Hence any doubts which he bad about the action proposed were notbased on legal grounds, but turned on whether, on balance, our action would prove advantageous to us. There were many factors whichhad to be considered by the War Cabinet.  For example : (i) The effect on public opinion in the larger neutral countries,such as the United States of America and Italy, and among the smaller neutrals.(ii) The psychological value of taking some offensive action atthe present a point to which the French appeared to attach considerable importance.(iii) The possibility of the Germans seizing the southernNorwegian ports not, in his opinion, a very likelycontingency.(iv) The possible loss of all our imports from Norway and sweden and the Baltic countries,(v) The loss of the Norwegian shipping which we were anxiousto obtain.(vi) The probability that the Swedes would turn against us andno longer feel bound by their &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement &apos;&quot;&apos;to reduce the export of iron-ore through the Baltic ports to Germany.
399W.M. SO (W$,.All these factors must -be weighed and a balance struck. he feared that, if we stopped the traffic in Norwegian waters, we might find, after a few months, that we had lost the good opinion of theneutral countries and all our trade from Scandinavia, but that theimports of Swedish ore to Germany had not been stopped and hadeven been increased, owing to a greater output from the Baltic portsduring the summer months.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that everything inthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s draft statement was just, right and true.No one could make an accurate balance beforehand of all the prosand cons; it might be more a question of following an instinct. Hepleaded earnestly for action to be taken immediately. Such action would be more than a naval foray; it might well prove to be one ofthe main fulcra on which the whole course of the war would turn.He believed that it was an essential step to operations on a larger scale. He did not think that the Scandinavian countries could possibly join the enemy against us, and it was therefore to our advantage to force them into a position where they would have tocome into the war on our side. The only alternative was completeinaction. Every aspect of the whole problem had been carefully examined. He urged that our statement should be published thenext day and that we should proclaim our intention of laying aminefield in Norwegian waters two days later.The Attorney-General agreed with the Foreign Secretary thatour case must be based on the broad grounds that Germany wasbreaking all the rules, while seeking to take advantage of them toshield her own interests. The direct evidence of the misuse of norwegian territorial waters by the Germans was difficult toestablish. Even if positive proof existed, however, it would be hard to base upon that proof an attack on German trade in those waters.Whereas we should be justified in stopping warships, merchantvessels were entitled to travel through territorial waters. Inter-national law clearly recognised the right of reprisal, but whether we should act in this particular way must depend upon the balanceof advantage.The Prime Minister said that, although his instincts were infavour of taking action, he could not take the proposed step light-heartedly. We had entered the war on moral grounds, and we mustbe careful not to undermine our position, else we might lose thesupport of the world. In any case, it would be necessary to makequite certain that the Dominions were with us, and it would be advisable to consult the Leaders of the Opposition.In previous discussions, it had been argued that the Altmarkhad given us an opening for taking this action, and the War cabinet had been urged to strike while the iron was hot. The Attorney-General had now made it clear that the Altmark incident did not give us any legal basis for laying a minefield, and interrupting tradethrough Norwegian waters. The time factor was therefore not ofsuch importance as had previously been supposed. The followingpoints should therefore receive due consideration : (i) Only two months remained of the Narvik ore^ traffic, sothat cutting it off would impose comparatively little loss on the Germans,(ii) If there were any chance left of carrying out the mainoperation, this action would effectually kill it.(iii) The effect of German retaliation by stopping all trafficleaving the Baltic in Swedish territorial waters mightbe damaging to our trade.(iv) The minefield could be laid later in conjunction with theNorthern Barrage.
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, although the action could not be linked in law with the Altmark incident, it would be advantageous to take advantage of the atmosphere which had been created by it.The Secretary, of State for Dominion Affairs emphasised theimportance of having the Dominions with us, especially as it mightbe difficult to convince neutral opinion of the justice of our action.He had sent a full telegram to them explaining what we proposedto do, but they had not yet had the draft announcement. He couldnot say what their reactions would be, but he thought that theirviews should be considered before any decision was taken. the argument which would influence them most powerfully in favourof the step was the use by Germany of Norwegian waters for sendingmunitions to Russia. Unfortunately we had no proof of this, and could only use this argument hypothetically. In the event, hethought that it would be better to lea.ve out the passage in the draft statement in which this argument was developed.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence suggested that, evenif it were undesirable to take the action proposed, it would be worthwhile stating our case clearly to the world and saying that we intended to retaliate in due course in the manner we thought right.International law gave us the right of retaliation for illegality. Sofar we had taken no such action; we had not sunk the Bremen; wehad not left German seamen and airmen to drown; and yet we gotno credit for our conduct in the eyes of the world, because we hadnot put the matter publicly in its true light. It was intolerable thatGermany should be allowed to get the best of both worlds. TheGerman methods were totally without precedent and it was hightime that we solemnly drew the attention of the world to what was going on, and freed our hands for action in retaliation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with this suggestion,but enquired whether retaliation of the kind proposed, which wouldimpinge on the rights of neutrals, would be the best kind to adopt.The A attorney-General thought that, if it were only ourselvesthat had been hurt, it would be hard to justify retaliatory actionwhich hurt the neutrals; but if German methods of sea warfarewere directed as much against the neutrals as against ourselves,there would be no harm in allowing our retaliation to affect neutralinterests.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that we should announce that for every neutral merchant ship sunk we intendedto capture a German ship, even if it involved seizing it in territorial waters such as those of Norway. This would have the effect, fromthe point of view of neutrals, of providing a strong deterrent toGermany from sinking neutral ships. If our announcement proved a deterrent, we should obtain the advantage that Scandinavian ships would trade freely with our ports. If it did not, we should raidNorwegian territorial waters and capture ships voyaging to andfrom Narvik.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff suggested that we should base our case on the argument that, since the Germans had announced publicly that they would not allow us to benefit fromthe ancient and well-established neutral right to sail the high seas,we should be justified in preventing them from enjoying the rightof belligerent merchant vessels to sail through neutral territorial waters. We could also point out that, whereas the German methodof warfare was not only illegal, but also inhumane, ours would onlybe a technical breach of law.There was general agreement with the suggestions made by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Deputy Chief of
Naval Staff, and it was felt that the declaration should be redrafted 2 5 1to give effect to them.The Attorney-General agreed that the proposition stated bythe Deputy Chief of Naval Staff expressed very neatly the ideawhich it had been intended to convey in the second paragraph onpage 4 of the Draft. He thought the line of argument might wellappeal to American legal and political opinion. There was noprecedent, nor, indeed, had anyone in the past so completely andutterly disregarded international law as the Germans, and this factcould be taken to justify our action.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that the redraftshould make it clear that international law gave us the right, whenfaced by such complete and wanton violation, to take appropriateretaliatory measures. We were, in effect, released from the law as there was no Court before which we could bring the wrongdoer.He thought that we should not admit that we were doing anythingillegal, nor should we make any excuses. We should leave our hands as free as possible to take the action we thought fit.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that the Dominionsand the Leaders of the Opposition should be consulted before action was taken, but he besought the War Cabinet to consider the conse-quences before they withheld their consent to the plan. He was convinced that, in the present situation of the war as a whole, ifwe did not make a move, we should regret it.The Admiralty would not be ready to act until Monday, andthen would have to give three or four days&apos; notice before laying the mines. There would, therefore, be time to get replies from theDominions, and to make the public declaration on Monday orTuesday.The Minister for Economic Warfare said that a certain numberof incoming vessels contrived to evade our contraband control. such vessels made for a northerly part of the Norwegian coast and thenfollowed that coast southwards, keeping inside territorial waters.One advantage of the action now proposed was that this source of German imports would be stopped. In January at least 18 inward-bound ships evaded the Northern patrols, if those ships be countedwhich are passing within the present patrol area from Bergen and norwegian ports north thereof to the continent. Perhaps as many as 40 or 50 incoming vessels a month were evading our control inthe way he had described. This did not imply a blockade leakage of such dimensions, but some of these cargoes, which included ironand other ores from Norway and Sweden, were reaching Germany.The Prime Minister suggested that it was necessary to bearin mind the counter-measures in the economic field which germany might take in retaliation for our action in Norwegian territorial(Previous waters.   For example, she might succeed in cutting off all our reference: exports from the Baltic countries. It would be recalled that theseW.M. (39) 122nd matters had been examined at an earlier stage when the WarConclusions, Cabinet had had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of minute 1.) &apos;      Economic Warfare (W.P. (G.) (39) 153).Mr. Morton thought that further examination would show thatthe position had changed materially in the two months since this paper had been prepared. In particular, Germany had intensifiedher action against our shipping. If the Supply Departments were consulted, it would probably be found that there had been asubstantial reduction in certain categories of British imports fromthe Baltic. The reduction was probably so substantial that thecomplete cessation of our Baltic imports would now have a much less marked effect than was previously supposed. To some extent,moreover, we might be able to mitigate the effects of Germany&apos;economic retaliation by routeing our Baltic imports overland acrossSweden, though this route could not carry our requirements intimber.
Another important consideration was the effect of the war in finland on our Baltic imports. Any part of our trade from theBaltic States which it was desired to route via Helsinki-Gulf ofBothnia-the Swedish ports, would presumably come to an end ifthe Russians occupied Helsinki.The Prime Minister said that it would obviously be necessaryto take these economic factors into account in reaching a decision.The Secretary of State for War thought that it might benecessary also to take into account the possibility of Norway and sweden becoming so incensed against us that they forbade theirvessels to sail to our ports.The Lord Privy Seal thought that Scandinavian public opinion was more favourable to the Allied cause than ScandinavianGovernmental opinion, and would be unlikely to tolerate theapplication of economic sanctions against us.The Minister for Economic Warfare thought the War cabinet ought also to be aware of the present position of the negotiationswith the Norwegian Government for a Shipping Agreement. the implementation of this Agreement hinged on our War trade agreement with Norway. The War Trade Agreement had nowbeen initialled but not actually signed, and its signature was subjectto revision of text and the conclusion of a Payments Agreement.If we took action calculated to affront the Norwegian Government,we were taking the risk either of a further delay in obtaining orof our forfeiting the use of Norway&apos;s large and important tankerfleet.The Lord Privy Seal doubted whether the Norwegians wouldbe likely to punish themselves in this way. They probably had noother employment for their tankers in war-time.The Minister for Economic Warfare thought it probable that norway would be able to find other uses for part, at any rate, ofher tanker tonnage. This, however, was primarily a question forthe Minister of Shipping.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that before taking a decision the War Cabinet ought to have the benefit of theadvice of the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister ofSupply and the Minister of Shipping, as to the economic conse-quences of the action under discussion.Further discussion ensued on the text of the proposed draft.The following views were expressed : Unless the paragraph at the top of page 2 could be materially strengthened, it should be left out altogether.Page 4. It would be desirable to omit the passage :&quot; Faced with an enemy .... protection and enforcement.&quot;That the last paragraph would require to be substantiallymodified, and that the statement should take the form of sayingthat, in view of Germany&apos;s action, we could not be bound byregard for neutral rights, but that we would not specify what action we proposed to take.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to redraft the Statement on the lines suggested in discussion.(ii) Invited the Prime Minister to inform the Leaders of theOpposition, in confidence, of the Statement it was proposed to issue, and of the action which we had inmind, and to ascertain whether such action would have their general support.
(iii) Took note that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs^had already communicated to the Dominion PrimeMinisters a summary of the action proposed and that astatement of their views was expected; and authorised him to communicate to the Dominion Prime ministers the text of the proposed Statement as soon as it had beenredrafted.(iv) Agreed that the attention of The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Supply,The Minister for Economic Warfare, andThe Minister of shipping should be drawn to the action proposed, and that theyshould be invited to express their views as to the probableeconomic consequences of the proposed action,(v) Agreed to defer a decision on the proposed action in norwegian territorial waters until early in the following week.U.S.S.R. 2.

In this telegram the Charge d&apos;Affaires expressedthe view that the Trade Agreement had been a serious disappoint-ment to the Germans. He had excellent reason to believe that at thepresent time the German Embassy in Moscow was a house dividedagainst itself.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Conclusions,Minute 5.)Italy.economic relations.(previous reference:W.M.

February, in which HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome reported that he was now fairlypersuaded that there was going to be no drama over the stoppage of German coal shipments. Sir Percy Loraine reported a number ofindications in support of this view.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.[20878]c
The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 49thConclusions,Minute 1.)Air attacks&quot; on shipping.Leaflet raidover Vienna.Patrols.5. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat weather conditions had improved on the previous day.Visibility had been good with a high cloud ceiling and a low cloudlayer stretching out towards the coast of Holland.There had been considerable enemy air activity directed against our shipping on the East Coast at varying times throughout theday between the Forth and the Humber. In all, ten raids of some12 enemy aircraft had been reported.Fighters had brought two of the enemy to action, and, as aresult, both enemy aircraft had been destroyed; one Heinkel hadbeen shot down into the sea some 20 miles off South Shields, andanother had been shot down on land close to St. Abb&apos;s Head. the crew of the latter had succeeded in burning their aircraft. the attack on the latter had been carried out by two Spitfires, one ofwhich was armed with 20 mm. cannons, and la preliminary reportshowed that damage had been done by the cannon as well as bythe S-machine-gun Fighter.For the first time, three of the converted long-range BlenheimFighters, which had been allotted to Coastal Command, had engagedan enemy Heinkel 80 miles out to sea East of Flamborough Head.The enemy aircraft had immediately dived to within a few feet of the sea. Although the Fighters had closed to short range, duringwhich hits had been observed, the Heinkel had been able to escapeinto low cloud.Starting soon after dark, and until about. 2 a.m., approximately19 enemy aircraft had carried out operations off the coast betweenthe Firth of Forth and Deal. Some of these aircraft were knownto have been landplane Bombers operating from inland aerodromes,and it would appear that their object had been the attack ofshipping by machine-gun or bomb. One ship (the Gothic) had, infact, been machine-gunned. It was possible that some of these aircraft might also have been laying mines in the Thames Estuaryand in the Humber, but this remained to be confirmed from the examination of the aircraft tracks. Fighters had taken off but hadnot made contact. The Bombers had stayed out to sea and hadnot come within range of searchlights.For the second time, leaflets had been dropped over Viennaat night by two Whitleys, starting from a base in France. Bothaircraft had returned.In all, 63 patrols had been carried out by Fighter Commandduring the previous twenty-four hours, involving 163 Fighters. Theusual patrols had been carried out by Coastal Command.Five Fighter patrols had been sent up by the Advanced Air-Striking Force in France. One enemy aircraft had been engagedbut had escaped over neutral territory.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M.

The First Lord of the A dmiralty informed the War Cabinetthat the Homeward-bound Norwegian Convoy had left with 43 ships,of which the majority were neutral.Three destroyers were escorting the German ship Wahehehomewards. Weather conditions had been too rough to put a prizecrew on board.At 10-55 a.m. the drifter Overfall had been bombed and machine-gunned off Yarmouth but had not been.hit.At 12-24 p.m., two trawlers had been machine-gunned at the entrance to the Tyne, but no information had been received as to

Our fishing vessels, which Were nowarmed, had been firing back, and reports indicated that the enemy aircraft had been knocked about as a result.S.S. Gothic (British tanker of 2,462 tons) had been gunned offMiddlesbrough at 1 a.m. on the 23rd.   This ship was not in convoy.No information as to the damage had as yet been received.Mines were reported to have been dropped by moonlight by enemy aircraft off the Humber, which had been closed to shipping.Fifteen ships in convoy had, in consequence, been delayed until thechannel had been swept.Attacks on S.S. Cafe St. Andrew (5,094 tons) had reported a violentshipping. explosion off her port quarter in position 15 miles North-West ofKinnaird Head at 12-30 p.m. on the 22nd, but bad suffered no damage.S.S. Brita (Finnish 2,621 tons), bound for Dublin from st. Vincent. Cape Verde Island, had been missed by two torpedoeswhich had apparently exploded in the sea 55 miles south of CaneClear at 8 - 30 p.m.The Tanker British Endeavour (4,580 tons), which had droppedastern of an outward-bound Gibraltar Convoy, had been torpedoedon the morning of the 22nd when about 100 miles west of Vigo.The ship had broken in two, one-half remaining afloat. Her sistership, the Bodnant, had 33 survivors, but five of the crew weremissing.S.S. Imperial Transport, in tow of two tugs and escorted byH.M.S. Mohawk, was approaching these coasts.The Swedish S.S. Rex (203 tons) had collided with H.M.S.Glowworm off the Outer Dowsing in dense fog. Glowworm was nowin dock.The tug St. Mellons had left on an attempt to tow S.S. LochMaddy (5,000 tons), which, as previously reported, had been torpedoed east of Scapa. IjOch Maddy was last reported to be intwo halves.Forty-seven survivors of the British S.S. Pyrrhus, previously reported as having been torpedoed on the 22nd February, had been landed at Gibraltar by the British S.S. Sinnington Court.Twenty-five more survivors were believed to have been picked up, buttwelve of the crew were still missing. So far as was known, theforepart of the ship was still floating.Steps were being taken with a view to intercepting the Germanship Antonio Delfi.no (13,589 tons), which had left Bahia at8 -15 p.m. on the 21st February.The balloon barrage had been in position at Scapa on theprevious day, the 22nd, for the first time.The flying-boat magnetic minesweeper had touched off twomines.The First Lord read out a report received during the meeting-regarding a U-boat which was reported to have been bombed and sunk by the Royal Air Force.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
