The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 4thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that routine patrols hadbeen carried out the previous day by Fighter Command, but no enemy had been encountered. Fighters sent up to intercept anunidentified aircraft reported near Dover had made no contact.A strong force of Wellingtons had carried out a sweep in theeastern area of the North Sea. No unusual enemy activity was reported.Offensive patrols over the enemy seaplane bases in the Heligo-land Bight were carried out the previous night, but later abandonedon account of bad weather.Leaflets were dropped over the Hamburg and Bremen areas.Coastal Command activity was normal. A few floating mines were seen in the Channel.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff gave the War cabinet particulars of the present dispositions of the Home Fleet.There had been no enemy attacks on trade, nor had we carriedout any attacks on enemy submarines. The indications were thatthere were probably very few U-boats at sea at the present time.The British S.S. Rothesay Castle (7,000 tons) had run agroundNorth-West of the Northern Channel (between Ireland and Scot-land) and was likely to be a total loss.The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, was now readyto take immediate action to send the hospital ship H.M.S. Maineand an armed merchant cruiser with blankets and other stores to therelief of the victims of the earthquakes in Turkey, as soon as wordwas received from our Ambassador in that country.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 4thConclusions,Minute 3.)Finland.Invasion by theTJ.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 4thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that there was nothing of importance to reportfrom the Western Front.In Finland the Russians had been repulsed in the KarelianIsthmus, and the Finns were said to be digging hard North of lake Ladoga. There had been definite confirmation that the Finnshad cut the Murmansk railway at a point in the Kandalaksha area,some 50 miles inside Russian territory. With Archangel frozen,this 1&apos;railway was the only means which the Russians had of main-taining their forces based on Murmansk, which now amounted to three Divisions. There had already been reports of food shortage,and if the Russians continued to be denied the use of the railway,it was estimated that their present supplies would not last morethan two months.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Finland. 4.   In the course of a discussion on the question of assistancePossibilities of to Finland, the Chief of the A ir Staff said that M. Gripenberg had further asked him to check the credentials of a number of persons in this assistance. country who wished to volunteer for service in the Finnish Air(Previous Force. On looking into the list of names he had -found that oneReference: individual had been in the closest contact with the Russian AirW.M.

The discussion then turned oh the possibilities of organisingbodies of volunteers from this country. It was realised that mostof the personnel who would be likely to be of value to the Firingwould be required by our own armed forces, and that many ofthem indeed might have Reserve obligations of some nature. Ifvolunteers with such obligations to His Majesty&apos;s Government were sent, it would be dangerously close to direct intervention on our part. There would, however, be no difficulty in waiving, the.provisions of the Foreign Enlistment Act in the case of individualswithout any reserve obligations. It was suggested that Sir George ^Macdonogh, who was being asked to co-ordinate all activities inconnection with assistance to Finland, might be able to pick out from the lists of volunteers a certain number who would be of value to Finland for their technical qualifications.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that it would be of assistanceto the Finns to receive obsolete British aircraft, since it appearedfrom the reports of operations that even old machines of thesetypes had given a very good account of themselves.The Chief of the Air Staff explained that without reserves of spares, which were not now available, such aircraft would be of very little use. The best way to help the Finns would be to send them aircraft of a similar type to those which they already hadin their possession, such as Blenheims.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that theFrench Ambassador had suggested to him that the possibility ofthe Polish naval forces co-operating with the Finns off Petsamoshould be reconsidered. In view of the fact that the Polish naval forces were now acting under the orders of the Admiralty, and using British bases, their despatch to Petsamo, if it became known,might well be construed as direct intervention on our part.The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff said that a British submarine was now off Murmansk. She would return home in a week or so and would report whether anything could be done by naval forces against Russian shipping in that area. He added that there were only three hours of twilight, and it was therefore doubtful whether anything could be done.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a state-ment on the subject of Scandinavia. Particulars of this statementare recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Scandinavia.(previous kef erence:W.M.
