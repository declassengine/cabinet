The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1.)Attacks on east coast shipping.1. The Director of Operations, Air Ministry, said that, on saturday, attacks had been carried out on shipping off the east coast by 16 German aircraft. All except four of these had takenplace off the coasts of Scotland and Northern England, as Southof the Wash the visibility had been extremely low. 117 fighter aircraft had been sent up, and five of the enemy aircraft had beenintercepted. Of these three had been shot down, and one was believed to have fallen into the sea on its way home. Our aircraft had sustained no loss.There had been no operations on Sunday, nor had any enemy aircraft been reported.Examination of German aircraft which had been shot down by our fighters showed that the modern all-metal aeroplane would standvery heavy punishment. Each one had more than 250 bullet holesin it. The Heinkel was difficult to shoot down from the stern, as,although the rear gunner was probably nearly always killed atonce, the pilot was well protected by the metal struts of the fuselage,and by the bomb stowage compartments. In most cases, the aircraft had been brought down through damage to both its engines. Thepetrol tanks were self-sealing, and several aircraft had reached homeon one engine. In reply to the Minister without Portfolio he saidthat the latest Heinkel would be much more vulnerable to cannonthan to machine gun fire.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that a visit by an Officer fromHeadquarters, Fighter Command, to the various lifeboat crews onthe East coast, who bad had such a very hard time recently, wouldbe greatly appreciated, and would show that Fighter Commandrecognised the need for co-operation between the lifeboats and thedefending aircraft. The crews of these lifeboats ran the risk ofbeing affected by the air attacks on neighbouring lightships, and ifit were possible to arrange that lifeboats on their way out to shipping in distress were protected by fighter aircraft, the morale of the crews would be sustained.The Director of Operations undertook to investigate thissuggestion, and to carry it out if it were. practicable.The Assistant Chief of Naval Staff said that the admiralty had prepared a letter to the National Lifeboat Institution recog-recognising the work of the lifeboats, and they were arranging for theletter to be handed to the Institution by the Duke of Kent.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.The Naval 2.

Attacks on East Details of the enemy air attacks on East coast shipping on theCoast shipping. 3rd February were given. 17 attacks in all had been made, in which(Previous the Norwegian  ship  Tempo had been sunk and  three othersReference: considerably damaged. Minor damage and casualties to personnelW.M. (40) 32nd had also occurred on other ships. A disturbing feature of these conclusions, attacks was the report that four merchant ships had been unableMinute 2.) to sail from the Humber recently owing to the difficulty in obtainingcrews. There was some unwillingness to sign on in ships plyingalong the East Coast. The urgent necessity was to find some formof counter to the German air attacks. Practically all &quot;ships were now sailing either in convoys or in groups. This would be of great assistance to Fighter Command in providing air escorts. Threeescort ships accompanied each convoy, and experience showed thatthe German aircraft were unwilling to attack ships which couldretaliate against them. The small coasting vessels had suffered most seriously, and less progress had been made in fitting them withanti-aircraft weapons than in the case of the ocean-going ships.This was partly due to the short time which coasting ships spent in harbour. Plenty of 12-pdr. guns were available, and theAdmiralty had now taken powers to detain coasting ships in harbourlong enough to fit the guns on to them.In discussion, it was agreed that the difficulty in obtainingcrews might be the beginning of serious trouble. It was essentialthat no reference to it should be made in the Press, and theAdmiralty would take the necessary steps to this end. TheAdmiralty was already in close touch with the Ministry of Shipping; on the whole question of obtaining crews.Continuing, the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff said  that officers and 44 ratings had been saved from H.M.S. Sphinx, whichhad been lost while being towed to harbour after having been bombedVr on the 3rd February.   The tow had parted three times, and theship had been abandoned during the night.   The total casualties,which included the commanding officer, who was killed in the first.. attack, would amount to about 40.  H.M.S. Boreas, which had takenoff the crew of H.M.S. Sphinx, had damaged her stem when goingalongside.Enemy attacks on trade on the 3rd February were as follows : S.s. Armanistan (6,S00 tons), torpedoed and sunk &quot;120 miles west of Lisbon when in convoy, escorted by 2 French vessels.The crew had been picked up by a Spanish ship.Dutch s.s. Laertes (5,800 tons), bound to Amsterdam, hadstruck what was probably a floating mine in the Channel6 miles south of Hastings, but was proceeding under her ownpower.There had been no enemy attacks on trade on the 4th February,but the French ship Marie Dawn (2,166 tons), which had lost touchwith the convoy, had anchored in what proved to be one of our mine-fields off Harwich. When weighing anchor a mine had exploded,damaging the ship. The master had ordered the ship to be scuttled,as he thought she would be a danger to navigation.The attack reported by H.M.S. Viscount on an enemy submarine40 miles south-west of LancLs End was thought to have been successful.There were believed to be about 4 enemy submarines off Lisbon.Recently considerable activity had been reported among the german merchant ships in Spanish and Portuguese ports, and there wererumours that the Germans intended to form a convoy of these ships,together with others from South American ports, which would beescorted home by their submarines. It would have been possible forsome of the German ships which had left South America to reach/an area off the Portuguese coast about this time. The area in question was within the French zone.
An explosion had occurred in the minesweeping trawler Fireflyon the 3rd February, as a result of the detonation of a. mine whichwas being recovered. This had resulted in several casualties topersonnel and some damage to the superstructure of the vessel,which was being towed to Leith. An enquiry into the incident wasbeing made.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above statement.(ii) Invited the Minister of Shipping to submit a report shortlyon the present position in the manning of merchantvessels on the East Coast trade.The MilitarySituation.Western front and Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 32ndConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthere was nothing to report from the Western Front.In Finland there had been no change in the situation. The bigattack made by the Russians on the 1st February had penetratedthe Finnish line, but the Russians had been subsequently driven out.They had renewed their attacks on the 3rd, but with less vigour, andhad been repulsed.In reply to the Lord Privy Seal, the -Deputy Chief of theImperial General Staff said that Brigadier Ling bad returned from finland, as had the two men who had gone there with british equipment for the Finns. Apart from our Military Attache, we now had three Officers in Finland on a special mission, and twoIntelligence Officers interrogating Russian prisoners.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.weekly resume.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet took note of Weekly Resume No. 22 by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 42).5. Sir Orme Sargent referred to telegram No. 238 (R.), datedthe 4th February, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo,reporting a further communication from the Japanese Vice-Ministerfor Foreign Affairs. The Japanese Government had agreed to statethat they had instructed Japanese shipping companies to refusepassage to any individual of a belligerent country who was embodied in the armed forces of that country, or was suspected of being soembodied. But they were now asking for the return of at leasteleven of the Germans instead of nine as previously agreed. TheSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had agreed to the increaseof the number of Germans to be returned from nine to ten, or, ifnecessary, to eleven.The Chancellor of the Exchequer welcomed the settlementeffected, but thought the actual formula not very satisfactory. Infact we proposed to rely upon a &quot; gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; withthe Japanese Government which we could not refer to in public.The fact that a settlement had been reached would be announced on Tuesday, the 6th February, 1940, and the Notes would bepublished on the ensuing day. Our announcement would be madein the House of Commons, and he thought it much better that itshould not only deal with the future, but should also state that
we bad agreed to the return of some of the Germans in question-Owing to the difference in time between Tokyo and London, therewas a risk that telegraphic reports of the Japanese announcement on Tuesday might reach London before our statement in the Houseof Commons. It seemed desirable to arrange that any such reports,if received, should not be published in Tuesday&apos;s evening papers,before the statement had been made in the House of Commons.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the above discussion.(ii) Invited Sir Orme Sargent to confer with the Ministry ofInformation with a view to ensuring that particulars of the settlement with the Japanese Government, ifreported by telegram from Japan, should not appear inBritish newspapers until after the statement to be madein the House of Commons, on Tuesday, the 6th February,1940.Roumania. 6.   In reply to a question by the Minister without Portfolio,.Supply of Sir Orme Sargent said that he thought that M. Gafencu&apos;s absenceequipment and from Bucharest at the meeting of the Balkan Entente accounted forraw materials. the Roumanian Government&apos;s delay in replying to the aide-memoire(Previous which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had handed h*Reference: M. Tilea, the Roumanian Minister in London, on the 30th January,W.M. (40) 28th 1940.   When the reply was available, it would, he thought, be conclusions, preferable for it to be communicated to Sir Reginald Hoare in minute 9.) Bucharest, rather than by M. Tilea to the Foreign Office in London.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Meat Rationing.Date of intro-duction and amount ofration.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 106thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Lord Privy Seal said that on the 2nd February the ministerial Sub-Committee on Food Policy had considered the dateof introduction of meat rationing and the amount of the ration, andhad recommended the War Cabinet to approve the following proposals, put forward by the Minister of Food : (a) That the weekly individual ration should be of the valueof Is. 10d., equivalent to weight of If lb. of meat withaverage bone.(b) That provision of meat outside the ration should be made:for meals in restaurants, industrial and other canteens,and at other forms of catering establishments, includingschools, clubs, &amp;c, by allocating a limited quantity ofbutchers&apos; meat, possibly amounting to 60 per cent, oftheir normal requirements, to such establishments, to be served &quot; free of the coupon.&quot; The amount of meat soearmarked to be controlled upwards and downwardsaccording to the supply situation.(c) That the Minister of Food should announce these proposals in the House of Commons on Tuesday, the 6th February,and should at the same time announce that the actual&apos;rationing of meat would begin on Monday, the11th March, 1940.The meat supply position was better than it had been early inDecember last, when the question had been considered by the WarCabinet. This enabled the meat ration to be generous andpermitted the exclusion from the ration of meat consumed inrestaurants, canteens and other similar communal institutions.Meat meals at such places would be &apos;&apos;&apos; free of the coupon.&quot; Thisavoided the minor inconveniences incidental to the rendering of
Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 5, 1940.fractions of a coupon when meat meals were consumed away from home. The Sub-Committee favoured acceptance of the Minister ofFood&apos;s proposals.In reply to questions, the Minister of Food informed the WarCabinet that it would be possible to vary the amount of the ration,and also the amount of meat earmarked for communal institutionsaccording to the supply position. Rationing could not begin until26 days after the amount of the ration was announced. Owing to recent abnormal weather conditions, there had been a substantialfalling off in the amount of home supplies offered to the Ministry,but the latest figures showed an upward tendency.Meals for necessitous and other school children would be covered in the general communal food arrangements.Mr. Ernest Bevin, the Secretary of the Trades Union Congress,had strongly favoured these communal arrangements on the groundthat, the Trade Unions having agreed in the national interestto reduce the normal dinner hour interval in works, it was desirablethat the workers should not have to devote any of this reduced timeto questions arising on their coupons. It. was recognised that there might be difficulties, e.g., in the mining districts, where some pitshad canteens and others had not. This might cause some trouble asbetween adjoining pits.In conclusion, the Minister of Food pointed out that theamount of the ration now proposed compared very favourably withany meat ration authorised during the Great War.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the arrange-ments now proposed did not include a supplementary ration to workers employed on heavy manual labour. He found it difficult tojustify the grant to members of the Fighting Services on service inthis country of a much larger ration than was allowed to workers engaged on heavy manual labour.The Lord Privy Seal informed the War Cabinet that thequestion of Service rations was to be considered by the ministerial sub-Committee on Food Policy later that week.As regards the proposal for a meatless day, the Cateringindustry much preferred the arrangements now proposed, whichwould, in effect, attain the same objective, namely, reduced consump-tion of meat.The Minister of Food agreed with the Lord Privy Seal and thought that a meatless day would, from the propaganda point ofview, have a depressing effect.The War Cabinet Approved the recommendations of the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Food Policy set out above.
