(4.0) 5)prepared in accordance with the Conclusions of the previous meeting of the War Cabinet.A record of the discussion which took place, and of theConclusions reached, is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.Proposed 2.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumAssurance to by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (39) 176). ItIceland. was explained that, arising out of the War Trade Agreement withIceland, the Icelandic Government had asked for assurances of support against possible reprisals by Germany.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs togive a confidential assurance to the Government of Icelandthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would take measures forthe protection of Icelandic shipping and would afford allthe assistance in their power in the event of a german attack upon Iceland.FecampBroadcastingStation.(previous references.W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 8,and 120thConclusions,Minute 9.)3. The Secretary of State for Air reported that the wireless station at Fecamp was still broadcasting. At the Fourth Meetingof the Supreme War Council held in Paris on the 19th December,1939, it had been agreed : &quot;That the question of the continued operation of theFecamp Broadcasting Station should be referred to the military experts of both countries, and that their decision whether thisStation should be allowed to continue, and, if so, under what conditions, should be accepted by both Governments.&quot;This Anglo-French Technical Committee had recommendedthat the station should be closed immediately for reasons of military security. These recommendations had been endorsed by general gamelin and passed on to M. Daladier. He understood thatM. Daladier hesitated to take action to close the station becauseof influential commercial interests. The move of the secondcontingent was due to begin on the 4th January, and the station was so placed as to act as an enemy radio beacon for air actionagainst the move.The First Lord of the Admiralty considered that the stations should be closed forthwith.The Prime Minister said that both Governments had agreedto abide by the report of the Technical Committee. This suggestion,had, in fact, emanated from M. Daladier. He would write toM. Daladier on the matter immediately.The War Cabinet took note the action proposed by thePrime Minister.[20595]b 2
TurkishEarthquake.Financial aid for relief of distress.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 1stConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that sincethe last meeting of the War Cabinet he had sent a telegram (No. 9,dated the 2nd January, 1940) to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara,asking whether, as the disaster was now seen to have been muchgreater than originally thought, he considered that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should give a further contribution in addition to thegift of  25,000 already announced. No reply had yet been received and he did not therefore ask for a final decision at their present meeting. He would like however to be able to authorise our ambassador to tell the Turkish Government that, in view of the fuller information now received and also of the additional distresscaused by the floods near Smyrna, His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to increase their contribution, and to add that we should welcome any suggestion which the Turkish Government might wishto make as to the best method of providing the proposed assistance.As regards corresponding action to be taken by the French Govern-ment, he (the Secretary of State) had seen the French Ambassadorthe previous day and had told him that the Chancellor of theExchequer would probably approach M. Reynaud. The ambassador had thought that the French Government might be reluctant toincrease their cash contribution, but might be willing to give further assistance in kind.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in view of the recentfinancial agreement it was very desirable that we should act withthe French Government in this matter. As regards help in kind,he regarded the despatch of ambulances or Red-Cross units as avery valuable form of help.The Prime Minister agreed that help in this form would belikely to be much more effective in dispelling superstitious fearsamong the Turkish peasantry, to which reference had been made when this matter had been previously discussed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wishedto telegraph to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen at once. It wasvery important not to delay the matter until agreement had beenreached with the French Government, though it must be recognisedthat the despatch of the proposed telegram might commit us todoing more than the French.The War Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara,authorising him to inform the Turkish Government that,in view of the fuller information now received and also ofthe additional distress caused by flood near Smyrna, HisMajesty&apos;s Government had decided to increase their contribution for relief work beyond the gift of  25,000,which had already been announced, and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would welcome any suggestion which theTurkish Government might wish to make as to the bestform such further assistance might take.Finland.Supply ofmunitions and aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 1stConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprevious day he had seen M. Gripenburg, the Finnish Minister, whohad been most urgent in his demands for the supply of ammunitioncups and small arms ammunition. He had also asked for twelveshort-nosed Blenheims.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the possibility of supplying the Blenheims was being examined, but the difficulties were verygreat.
The Secretary of State for War said that M. Gripenburg had informed him that the shortage of small arms ammunition was such that ammunition was now being rationed on the Finnish front.He agreed that everything possible should be done to give the Finnsassistance, and he was, in fact, doing all that he could. He had,for example, been able to meet M. Gripenburg&apos;s request for armygreatcoats in spite of our own difficulties of supply. M. Gripenburghad also raised the question of certain ambulances which theFinnish Government had ordered, but for which they were unableat present to pay.   The amount involved was only  15,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that it was necessaryto assist the Finns in regard to the delivery of these ambulances.The Secretary of State for War said that arrangements hadbeen made to supply the Finns with the ammunition cups for whichthey had had a contract before the war, but it had not been found possible to give the full number now asked for.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, if theFinnish request on this subject were met in full, it would be equivalent to giving up two months supply of small arms ammunition for the British Army.The War Cabinet-(1) Authorised the supply to Finland of certain ambulancescosting  15,000 as a free gift.(2) Agreed that the question of the extent to which it waspossible to meet the further requests for small arms ammunition submitted by the Finnish Governmentshould be considered by the Military Co-co-ordination committee at their meeting to be held that afternoon.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 3, 1940.
