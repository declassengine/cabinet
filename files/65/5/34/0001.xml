itsIndia. 1.   The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumProposed by the Secretary of State for India (W.P. (G.) (40) 23) and a Reportoperations on by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (G.) (40) 39) dealing with the situation the North-West on the North-West Frontier.The Secretary of State for India referred to the deterioration of the situation in the Bannu district of the North-West frontier of India, and recounted the succession of incidents which had takenplace. The last of these had been on the 3rd February, whenColonel Hasted, with a party of officers and other ranks, had beenambushed on the main Bannu-Tochi road. Two had been killed and others had been wounded.In the opinion of the Government of India, the situation called for drastic action, and they proposed the occupation of theAhmadzai Salient by a force of two brigades, and the construction!of roads and posts therein.This salient was a sparsely inhabited area jutting out betweenthe Bannu and Kohat districts, and provided a sanctuary for badcharacters. Its occupation might produce repercussions fromWaziristan proper. But both the Government of India and he (theSecretary of State for India) considered this risk to be less thanthe risk of inaction, since, if raids and ambushes went unpunished,the trouble might spread, and the Government of India would, inthat event, be faced with having to carry out a much larger andmore difficult operation during the dry weather when conditions would be very unfavourable.For these reasons he strongly urged that the War cabinet should confirm the authority which he had given to the Governmentof India to proceed with the occupation of the Ahmadzai Salienton the lines which they had proposed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether recent frontierpolicy provided a precedent for the permanent occupation of an area which formed no part of British India.The Secretary of State for India quoted the occupation of theKajuri Plain in 1930-31 as a recent example.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence explained thecircumstances in which the Chiefs of Staff had been asked toreport on. this subject. He was in agreement with their view thatthe right course was to allow the Government of India to proceedwith their plans. At the same time he felt that it was desirablethat the attention of the Viceroy should be drawn to the anxietyof the War Cabinet that this initial operation should not lead,to serious additional commitments. He reminded his colleagues that until the modernisation of the Army in India, recommendedby the Chatfield Report, had been carried out, India was not ina position to withstand the brunt of large-scale operations, if these should coincide with internal unrest.The Lord Privy Seal said that it was evident that theGovernment of India had taken full measure of the risks involved.This and the fact that the Chiefs of Staff were in favour of allowing the operation to take place convinced him that the War cabinet should confirm the authority which had already been given by theSecretary of State for India.The War Cabinet-(i) Approved the action taken by the Secretary of State forIndia in authorising the Government of India to proceedwith the military occupation of the Ahmadzai Salientwith two Brigades (as described in his Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (40) 23)).[20789] b 2
(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for India, when conveyingthis approval to the Government of India, to express the anxiety of the War Cabinet that this operation should not result in any major military commitment.The Air 2.   The  Director  of  Operations,  Air  Ministry,  said  that situation. activity had been reduced by fog, and by the fact that a large(Previousnumber of fighter and bomber aerodromes were still unserviceable.Reference: Five fishery protection patrols had been sent out, but thereW.M. (40) 33rd had been no enemy activity.Conclusions, The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Minute 1.)The NayalSituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Proposed seizure of Germansupplies toTJ.S.S.R.3. The Assistant Chief of Naval Staff said that H.M.S.Southampton bad continued her search off the Norwegian Coast forthe two enemy ships carrying munitions to Murmansk. She hadbeen told to start her return journey to Scapa via the norwegian coast at daybreak that day. No news whatever bad been heard ofthe two ships, and the Naval Staff were inclined to doubt the accuracy of the information received in regard to them.The view was expressed that it would be desirable to make further efforts to ascertain the basis for the original reports, and, inparticular, whether it was true that these ships had asked forNorwegian pilots. The importance of the matter made it undesirable that our effort to intercept these ships should be given up lightly.The Assistant Chief of Naval Staff undertook to look further into the matter.Continuing, he said that the Swedish vessels Flandria(1,157 tons) and Patria (1,188 tons) were reported as having been mined 70 miles North-West of Texel. The position was to the westward of our declared minefield, and the Admiralty werenotifying it as a dangerous area.The Beaverburn (9.800 tons), a Canadian Pacific vessel,outward bound in convoy to St. John&apos;s, had been torpedoed.Seventy-six survivors were returning in another ship. One wasmissing.This ship was one of seven in a group detached from the mainconvoy and escorted by one destroyer. The latter had carried outfour attacks on the submarine, and there was evidence to show thatthe U-boat had been destroyed.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs enquired whetherit was intended to publish the fact that the U-boat had been sunk.The moral effect of the news would be good.The Assistant Chief of Naval Staff recognised that, from thepoint of view of the public, it might be desirable to make known thissuccess. On the other hand, it was not in our interests to discourageGerman submarines from attacking British convoys, since our defensive measures were designed to deal with attacks on convoys.We should have every reason to be satisfied if every time an attack was made on ships in convoy a U-boat was sunk. The germans would not know definitely that their U-boat had been sunk unless we published it.It was agreed that the question of publication should be left tothe discretion of the First Lord of the Admiralty.
4. The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthere were no operations to report from the Western Front.An additional German Division had been identified in CentralGermany, and their total was now between 140 and 142.Western Front.Press reports from Finland said that the I8th Russian division hand now been rounded up at Kitela. It was known that this division had been cut off for some time, so that the report was probably true.The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired whether the service departments had made adequate arrangements to obtain military information from Finland. Our own war material was now cominginto use in the hands of the Finns, and it would be of great value tobe fully infotmied of its performance. The morale of the Finns, andthe state of the Russian prisoners, were other matters on which itwould be desirable to receive reports.The War Cabinet were informed that daily telegrams were received from the Military Attache in Finland, and also from, theAir Attache, who served, the whole of Scandinavia, and. was usuallystationed at Stockholm.The view was expressed that some strengthening of the British.Service representation in Finland would be desirable, particularlyin view of possible developments in the next two or three months.The War. Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for Air to consider whether the Service represen-tation in Finland should be strengthened so as to ensurethe receipt of full and accurate information on the progressof the operations, and on the performance of british aircraft and other equipment in the hands of the Finns;and to bring to the notice of the War Cabinet from time totime any specific information received on these subjects.The Military^g.      Situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Finland.Supply ofmilitaryinformationfrom Finland.Assistance to finland.(previous references:W.M. (40) 24thConclusions,Minute 4,and 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)Proposedrecruitment oftechnicians.5. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that theFinnish Assistance Bureau had written to him on the subject ofobtaining, for service in Finland, foreign technicians now in theUnited Kingdom. He believed that a similar letter had been addressed to the Foreign Office.Sir Orme Sargent said that the letter was on the way but hadnot yet been received. The Finnish Minister had also been, asking whether there would be any objection to recruiting Britishtechnicians who could be spared.There was no doubt the Finns Avere getting short of technicians,as they had been obliged to call up more of their man-power for thearmy/ He thought that the question could be disposed of satisfac-satisfactorily by the Foreign Office under existing War Cabinet authorities.The Assistant. Chief of Naval Staff said that the wreck ofH.M.S. Sphinx was reported ashore 1 mile north of Lybster.East Coast convoys had anchored on account of fog, butconditions were reported to be improving.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
The Far East:Relations with japan.Case of theS.S. AsamaMaru.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5.)6. Sir Orme Sargent said that, according to publishedtelegraphic reports. M.&apos;. Arita, the Japanese Minister for ForeignAffairs, had made a statement in the Diet on the settlement of theAsama Maru case. The report was very brief, but it appeared thatM. Arita had followed the line agreed upon. He had mentioned that we had agreed to return nine of the Germans, but he had apparently stated also that the Japanese Government reserved their right to ask for the return of all twenty-one men. Provided thatthe Japanese Government, in fact, accepted the return of the ninemen as a final settlement, M. Arita was entitled to make this reservation, since it bad been agreed in the discussions with sir Robert Craigie that formally both the Japanese and ourselvesshould be free to reserve all our rights.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Balkans. 7.   In reply to a question by the Minister without Portfolio,Meeting of the Sir Orme Sargent said that, according to the telegrams receivedBalkan Entente from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Belgrade (No. 42, DIPP, dated the at Belgrade. 4th February, 1940, and No. 45, DIPP, dated the 5th February,1940), the results achieved at the meeting of the Balkan Entente atBelgrade were very satisfactory from our point of view, since it seemed that M. Saracoglu, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs,had persuaded the other members of the Entente at least to discussthe possibility of guaranteeing one another against external aggression.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 6, 1940.
