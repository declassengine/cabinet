Scandinavia.(previous references:W.M. (40) 26thConclusions,Minute 7, andW.M. (40) 28thConclusions,Minute 8.)1.   The War Cabinet had before them (a) A report by the Chiefs of Staff on the Scandinavianposition (W.P. (40) 35).(b) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff on French proposals for allied assistance to Finland (W.P. (40) 41).The discussion on this item and the Conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary1 s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Soviet-FinnishConflict.Proposedseizure ofGermansupplies toU.S.S.R.2. In connection with the discussion on the previous item,The First Lord of the Admiralty said that information had just been received that two large German merchant vessels loaded withmunitions for the Russians were trying to work their way round to Murmansk through Norwegian territorial waters. They weresaid to be having difficulty in securing Norwegian pilots. Both ofthem were still south of the point on the Norwegian Coast where aninterception could conveniently be made. The Admiralty haddespatched a cruiser to investigate.The First Lord pointed out that a very good case could be madefor seizing these ships even in Norwegian territorial waters. Theywere engaged in helping Russia against Finland, whom bothNorway and ourselves were bound by the recent resolution of theLeague of Nations to assist.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that if the seizure of these ships could be carried out in not too blatanta manner he would be inclined to agree to it. He would like,however, further time to study the matter.The War Cabinet agreed Subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Secretary, toauthorise the Admiralty to take steps to intercept andseize the German ships reported to be travelling throughNorwegian territorial waters to Murmansk, provided that,on investigation, it was found that they were carryingmunitions, and that the interception could be made in anunobtrusive manner.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 2, 1940.
