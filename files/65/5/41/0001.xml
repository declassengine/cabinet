323The air situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 40thConclusions,Minute 2.)W.M.41 (40).2031. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat there had been much low cloud with occasional snow during theprevious day. Visibility had generally been poor except in North-East Scotland and over the northern part of the North Sea.Only one enemy raid had been identified on the previous day.An enemy aircraft had arrived off the coast opposite Ramsgate at - 40 p.m. A section of Spitfires on Channel escort had made contactat long range and at height, about 36 miles East of Southend.Three Spitfires had been able to engage the enemy in a fleetingcombat before he made good his escape into cloud, and serious damage must have been done. There was reason to doubt if theenemy had succeeded in returning to Germany.Convoy, shipping protection, Channel escort and sector patrolshad been flown by Fighter Command, and Fighters had been sent up to investigate doubtful raids.Twelve Wellingtons of Bomber Command had carried out as weep over the North Sea-No operations had been reported by the British Air Forces inFrance.The usual patrols and searches had been undertaken by coastal command.An aircraft had observed three lifeboats some 40 miles north of the Shetlands and had directed the merchant vessel Hilda tothem. Admiralty had confirmed that the Hilda had picked up the survivors.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40)Conclusions,Minute 3.)Shipping losses2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Southamptoncaptured a German trawler, which was being brought home withhada prize crew on board the Norwegian Convoys were on the move the homeward40th  bound, comprising 29 ships, and the outward bound, 23 ships.being at 5 a.m. on the 11th, the steam trawler Togemio (290 tons British) had been sunk without warning by gunfire from a U-boat70 miles off Fastnet. The skipper and 10 men had been landed atQueenstown after being in the trawler&apos;s boat for 30 hours. one man had been killed, three seriously wounded, and some othersslightly injured.On the afternon of the 12th the Swedish s.s. Delaro (3,927 tons)had been torpedoed. The crew had been saved by a Belgian trawlerand would be landed in Ireland.  The captain was dead.In the early hours of the 14th the British tanker Gretafield(10,191 tons), bound from Curacoa to Invergordon, had been minedor torpedoed and set on fire 20 miles East of Wick. Forty-one ofthe crew were believed to be in boats, 17 or more men having alreadybeen picked up by trawlers. An anti-submarine search wascarried out to eastward of the wreck.At 6-30 a.m. on the 14th H.M.S. Egret had reported the wreckof an Italian ship mined or torpedoed 6^ miles West of the CromerKnoll Light Vessel. This was believed to be the Italian shipGeorgio Ohlsen (5,694 tons). The survivors were being rescued bythe East Coast Convoy.The British Triumph (tanker 8,500 tons), reported theprevious day as being in tow after having been mined or torpedoednorth-east of Cromer, had now sunk. Twenty of the crew had been saved.The First Lord of the Admiralty remarked that these sinkingsdenoted a considerable rise in our loss of tonnage, and made it themore important that we should press forward with our shipbuilding programme.[20839] b 2
Search forGermanmerchant ships.General.The German s.s. Wakama (3,771 tons) which had left Rio deJaneiro on the 11th February, had been found by H.M.S. Dorset-shire&apos;s aircraft on the 12th and had been ordered to stop. The crewhad then scuttled the shi]). Dorsetshire had picked up 10 officersand 36 men, 140 miles North-East of Rio de Janeiro.There was a Press report that the German ship Wolf berg had also scuttled herself.The hunt for the remaining four German merchant ships whichhad left Vigo was continuing. The Northern Patrol had been specially strengthened.The French Naval Attache at The Hague had received informa-tion that between the 2nd and 11th February the Germans had beenusing anchorages between Borkum, Juist and Norderney forsubmarines, destroyers and flying-boats. This suggested that icehad prevented the use of the normal anchorages. This information would be tested by air reconnaissance.The Skager Rak was now frozen over.The First Lord said that H.M.S. Exeter was due to arrive at plymouth the following day. The Chancellor of the Exchequer andhe proposed to greet the ship.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 3.   The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that situation. there was nothing to report from the Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 40thConclusions,Minute 4.)Western Front.Finland. In Finland, there had been fresh attacks of great intensity bythe Russians on the Karelian Isthmus. These attacks must have met with some success, otherwise it would not have been necessaryfor the Finns to launch the counter-attacks of which reports havebeen received. Though the Finnish General Staff were undoubtedlyanxious, they knew that the Russian losses had been very severe, andthe pace of the Russian offensive now appeared to be slackening.The Russians would, however, be likely to try to gain a decisionbefore the thaw by further offensives.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Weekly Reports.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 35thConclusions,Minute 6.)Assistance to finland.Supply of aircraft.&apos;(previous reference:W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The War Cabinet took note of the Weekly Reports (No. 23)by the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State forAir (W.P. (40) 50 and 49).5. The Secretary of State for Air gave the War Cabinet thefollowing details regarding the despatch of aircraft to Finland : Gauntlets. Four were en route; the remainder would all be ready for packing within ten days. All should have left thiscountry by the end of february/iy.Gladiators. Either 24 or 26 were now in Finland. TheFinnish Legation were making enquiries as to whether 4 or 6were outstanding, but it was certain that they had left thiscountry some time ago.
Long-N osed Blenheims. Ten had reached Finland. one aircraft had been slightly delayed.Lysanders. Nine were being packed that week; and eightshould be ready for packing the following week.Hurricanes. The training of the Finnish pilots had been somewhat delayed by exceptional weather conditions. Theywould be ready to take over the aircraft by the beginning of thefollowing week, and, after final training, two Flights of 6 air-craft each were expected to leave the United Kingdom by the24th February.Rocs. Arrangements had been made for 33 to beprepared. Deliveries were expected to start early in March,when it would be possible to begin flying.them to Finland.Short-Nosed Blenheims. In reply to a suggestion from theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of Statefor Air undertook to examine the possibility of the immediaterelease of short-nosed Blenheims, which were in service at that moment with the Royal Air Force, on the understanding thatthey would be replaced by the equivalent number of new air-craft which were not yet ready to leave the factories.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether we hadreceived reports about the performance of our aircraft in Finland.The Chief of the Air Staff said that Press reports had givenglowing accounts of the behaviour of the Gladiators. Reports from our Senior Air Attache had been disappointing. He was unwelland was being replaced.Military The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that thematerial. following material had arrived and was in action :  100 Vickers Machine Guns out of 500 supplied.100 Anti-tank Rifles out of 200 supplied.200 Signal Pistols out of 500 supplied.65.000 Grenades.The reason for the delay in the arrival of material in Finlandwas that the Swedish railway North of Stockholm was now hope-lessly congested. All the traffic for Finland had to pass up therailway to Tornea, and the congestion was increased as a result ofthe Swedes having mobilised a Corps which was concentrating inthe North. Thus, although the material which had arrived in norway had passed rapidly across that country, and had been seenthrough beyond Stockholm, it had been held up on its journeybeyond that point.There was no traffic by boat to Finland, which was the normalmethod of going there from Sweden. The railway round the headof the Gulf of Bothnia was a single-line track, not designed fordealing with heavy traffic. Moreover, there was a change of gaugeat the frontier.Much good work had been done by Mr. Munthe, who had gone to Sweden, and had seen the material well on its way. The hold-uphad occurred since he had returned to this country. He was shortlyreturning to Sweden to do what he could to help the material along.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that a rather stronger impetuswas required than could be supplied by one or two men, howeverenergetic and persuasive. An expert in railway matters, with asmall staff at various points along the line, was needed. Hesuggested that a party of this kind should be sent to Sweden.- Agreement with this idea was expressed, and it was thoughtthat a&quot; suitable railway expert could be obtained through theMinistry of Transport! His staff might include two or threemilitary officers who would be acquainted with the material in transit.
In order not to offend the susceptibilities of the Swedes, thewhole party could go in the guise of agents of Messrs. Vickers, orof other firms supplying goods. When they had seen the situation,and from their specialised knowledge had been able to see how the delays were arising and what measures would be required to keepthe material on the move, it might be possible to approach theSwedish Government with their suggestions.Field guns and The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff then referredammunition. to the recent urgent request which had been received from the Finns(Previous for more field guns and ammunition, of which mention had been reference:        made at the meeting of the War Cabinet on the previous day.W.M. (40) 40th He pointed out that 25 4-5-inch howitzers, and a considerableConclusions,      number of French field guns, were already on the way to Finland asMinute 5.)        part of our original gift, but had not yet arrived on account of the congestion referred to.He had investigated the possibility of sending more field guns.The only way this could be done was by taking them from the136 18-pounders which were held for the reserve for the british expeditionary Force. Even if it were decided to release these, therewould be a difficulty over ammunition. Present stocks would onlypermit of a rate of expenditure equal to two-thirds of that in 1918.The production forecast for the next three months was 140,000rounds, but this might not be fulfilled.The view was generally expressed that, great as was our need,the risk of allowing Finland&apos;s resistance to crack was greater. Onefactor which would make it easier for us to spare ammunition wasthat our calculations up to the present had been based on bigoperations beginning on the 1st March. The severe frost, and thethaw which must follow, would probably make this impossible. Itwas therefore felt that 30 field guns, with 1,000 rounds per gun,might be spared.The War Cabinet (a) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to look further intothe rate of despatch of aircraft to Finland, and to take all possible steps to accelerate it.(b) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to despatch to finland forthwith a further thirty 18-pounder field guns, together with 30,000 rounds of ammunition.(c) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to makestrong representations to the Swedish Government aboutthe delays to Allied war material in transit to Finlandoccurring on the Swedish railways; the Swedish Govern-ment should be informed that, in response to urgentappeals from the Finns, we were about to despatchfurther guns and ammunition, and that we relied on them to take all possible steps to expedite their passage.(d) Invited the Secretary of State for War, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister ofTransport, to arrange for the despatch to Sweden of a railway expert with a small staff, which should includetwo or three military officers in plain clothes. Thisparty would proceed in the guise of representatives ofthe firms shipping the goods, and. on arrival in Sweden,would take steps to expedite the despatch of Alliedmaterial, and would report, through the Embassy in stockholm, on the transport situation and on measures required to improve it.
Italy.economic relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 11.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 32, Saving, dated the 10th February, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, about the possibility of an early trialmobilisation of the Italian Army. It was likely that we shouldreceive further information as regards Signor Mussolini&apos;s decision not to consider, for six months, the sale to us of any arms, when the master of the Rolls arrived back in London on the 16th or17th February.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that there might beweight in the suggestion (contained in Rome telegram No. 34,Saving) that, whereas Signor Mussolini was not himself preparedto agree to any arrangement with us which would expose him to the accusation that he was taking sides against Germany, he might notbe unwilling that his hand should be forced by our adoptingmeasures which our belligerent rights entitled us to take. In that case he could plead force majeure. The present might, therefore,be the right time to inform the Italian Government that, while we hoped that the negotiations might be resumed at some later date,we were in the meanwhile giving orders for seaborne exports ofGerman coal to Italy to be intercepted.The Secretary of State for Air said that it was clear from thereport of the Military Attache (contained in telegram No. 33,Saving, dated the 10th February, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Rome) that Comendatore Manzolini, with whom wehad been negotiating about the purchase of his &quot; Thermos Bomb,&quot;had been taken by surprise by the Duce&apos;s decision. This suggestedthat the decision had been taken very hurriedly.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that, as soonas it became clear that the negotiations had been definitely termination-nated by Signor Mussolini, we might without further delay giveorders to stop German seaborne coal exports to Italy. He thought,however, that it would be wise to wait until he had received theviews of Sir Percy Loraine and until the Master Of the Rolls had returned to London. On this basis it would be possible for the WarCabinet to take a decision early the following week. Further, it wassuggested in telegram No. 34, Saving, that an attempt might bemade on the Italian side to explain to the Duce the damaging effecton Italian economy which his negative decision was calculated toproduce. Although this might prove to be too optimistic, theSecretary of State thought that it was worth while waiting for afew days, to,allow the position to develop.The War Cabinet agreed To defer a decision to intercept ships carrying coal exports from Germany to Italy, until the beginning of thefollowing week, when the report of the Master of the Rollswould be available.France. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionInternal to telegram No. 118, Saving, dated the 12th February, 1940, andsituation. telegram No. 25, dated the 13th February, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Paris, in which Sir Ronald Campbell discussed thepossibility that changes might be expected in the personnel ofM. Daladier&apos;s Government.A short discussion ensued, of which the War Cabinet took note.
The middle east and India.Soviet threat toBritishinterests.(previous reference:w.m. (39) 108thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 47) submitting proposals for the organisation of an intelligence system in certain countries in the Middle East, These proposals had been preparedby the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Chiefs of staff committee in consequence of the decision of the War Cabinet atthe meeting referred to in the margin.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded the WarCabinet that it had been agreed at the Meeting in question thatit was necessary to establish an effective intelligence system incertain regions of the Middle East, if we were to be prepared totake action against the Soviet Government in these parts as occasionmight arise. His present Memorandum set out the machinery whichit was proposed to set up. His general proposals including, thelimitation of spheres of responsibility as between the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief, the Middle East, and the Governmentof India had been approved by the Departments concerned.In connection with the last paragraph of his Memorandum, he explained that Sir Campbell Stuart had been made responsible forthe work of propaganda in Soviet territory on the grounds thatthis work was more closely akin to propaganda in enemy countriesthan to propaganda in other neutral territories, and also that itwas closely related to other work for which the Foreign office was responsible. He had, however, recently discussed with theMinister of Information a number of questions connected with thegeneral organisation of propaganda work as between the ForeignOffice and the Ministry of Information, and he might perhapsfind it necessary to re-examine this matter and to suggest somemodifications in the present organisation.The Secretary of State for India said that he was in full agreement with the proposals set out in the Memorandum. Hesuggested that it would be useful to hold a representativeIntelligence Conference to deal with the matter in some convenientcentre.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he understood that it was proposed to hold such a Conference in Cairo.The War Cabinet Approved the proposals for the organisation of anintelligence system in certain countries of the Middle Eastas set out in the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 47).Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 14, 1940.
