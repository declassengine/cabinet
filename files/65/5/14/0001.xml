Air Strengths ofGreat Britain,France andGermany.(previous reference:   .W.M. (39) 74thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Air on the Air Strengths of GreatBritain, France and Germany (W.P. (40) 7).A record of the discussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air (W.P. (40) 7).(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Lord privy seal to communicate to the Secretary of State for Airany further point arising out of the Paper on which they desired further information.(3) Agreed that discussion of the&quot; points so raised should takeplace on the Military Co-ordination  Committee,  inconsultation with the Lord Privy Seal.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence (W.P. (40) 18) resulting from an examination by the Standing Ministerial Committee on military co-operation-ordination of the Chiefs of Staff Review of Military Policy inthe Middle East (W.P. (39) 148) which was remitted to them by theWar Cabinet at the meeting given in the margin.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence drew attention tothe following important matters touched on in the Report:  .Administrative (&amp;) The Chiefs of Staffs proposals covered the requirementspreparations. of our long-term, policy in the Middle FJast, which couldbe broadly summarised as &apos;&apos; to be administrativelyprepared to operate a force amounting to some12 Divisions and 39 Squadrons of aircraft.&quot;(b) The   Chiefs   of   Staff   considered and   the   military co-operation-ordination Committee agreed with them that,unless this policy were approved and effect given to itrapidly, we should be unable to intervene effectively and rapidly in the event of (i) German aggression in the Balkans,(ii) Russian aggression in the Balkans and/or Iraq,Persia and Afghanistan,(iii) Italy coming down on the other side of the fence.(c) The forces for which administrative preparations were tobe made were all included in existing authorised pro-grammes,   although,   of   course,   the   administrativepreparations   themselves   would   involve   considerable&quot;i fresh expenditure.(d) It had not yet been possible to furnish any estimate of thetotal sum which would be involved. It was thought,however, that Treasury control would be secured by thefact that each proposal, as it emerged from the planningstage, would be subjected in the normal course to financial scrutiny.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Chiefs of Staffproposals would undoubtedly involve a very large outlay. He didnot, of course, wish to hinder the preparation of essential plans, orthe provision of facilities which might be urgently required for operations of war. Nevertheless, he did not think it would be wise to embark blindly on a project without forming some idea of ther . expenditure which would result.   Service Departments would have.. -,?.... to carry out reconnaissances and make plans; otherwise they them-.[t selves would not know what had to be done.   It should be possible[20657] b 2Military Policyin the middle east.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 107thConclusions,Minute .8.)
Development ofsupply capacityEast of theMediterranean.(Paragraph 6.)Formation of anAfricanDivision.(Paragraph 11.)Expansion ofAir Forces inthe Middle Eastand India.(Paragraphs 17and 21.)to form some estimate of the cost of the various measures in thecourse of this planning, and in this way a picture of the wholeproject would emerge. He would like to be given this picture assoon as it emerged, so that he would have an opportunity of con-sidering whether the expenditure was within our powers, and, ifnecessary, of drawing the attention of the War Cabinet to thefinancial implications of the project.In the discussion which ensued, it was pointed out that whatwas urgently required was approval for the policy. This would befollowed by detailed planning, in the course of which it would soon be found that there were certain big items which would require futher consideration, and a great number of smaller items whichcould be dealt With without delay.It was agreed that Service Departments would be able tofurnish the Chancellor fairly quickly with information on the majoritems, and thus enable him to gain some idea of the approximatetotal. At the same time, it was thought that there should be nodelay in approving the policy proposed, particularly in view of the conversations which were to open with the French, on our jointpolicy in the Middle East, and the assistance which we would beable to give in the Balkans.The War Cabinet then discussed various paragraphs of theReport.The War Cabinet were informed of consultations which hadtaken place between the Ministry of Supply and the Colonial Office,in the course of which the original proposal that munitions, andparticularly explosives, should be manufactured in Palestine, had had to be modified, and attention had been directed to the possibilityof organising the supply of consumable stores required by the Army,such as clothing, &amp;c.Sir Arthur Robinson explained that to manufacture munitionsin Palestine would mean the transference to that country of quantities of raw materials and machine tools, the organisationof a steel industry on the spot, and the importation of skilled labour.These demands would conflict with urgent requirements in thiscountry. The conclusion had been reached that it would be better to try and expand production of munitions, and of explosives, inIndia, rather than in the Middle East. The Ministry of Supplywere exploring the full possibilities of Indian and Australianoutput, most of which could, with advantage, be earmarked for theMiddle East. They were also getting reports on the possibilityof establishing factories for consumable stores or repair depots inPalestine, but would probably have to send a representative out to investigate the question on the spot.The Secretary of State for War said that the War Office werein favour of postponing the move of the West African troops to kenya, partly on account of the Italian situation, and partly onaccount of the unsuitability of West African troops for operations in many of the theatres covered by the Report.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreed that the move should be postponed, particularly in view of General Smuts&apos;recent offer of a Brigade for Kenya, and of South African viewson native questions.The Secretary of State for the Colonies also agreed with the postponement.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that the proposals inthese paragraphs aimed at preparing the whole ground organisa-tion, so that the number of squadrons referred to could, if the need arose, be moved out to the Middle East and India, and could operate on arrival. Without this organisation, we should be unableto oppose our potential enemies in that area with forces comparable to their o&quot;wn.
Overland routesin the middle east.(Paragraphs 24and 25.)The Secretary of State for India said that, if the proposalsinvolved the construction of new aerodromes and other groundfacilities in India, the question of payment would arise. Theadditional squadrons would be beyond anything covered by theCh.atfi.eld Report, and the expenditure could not be met by theGovernment of India.It was agreed that this was a question which would require futher consideration, and the Secretary of State for Air undertook to produce an estimate of the expenditure which would be incurred in India, so that the incidence of cost could be settled.There was a discussion on the completion of the Baghdad-Haifa route.The War Cabinet were informed that the portion in palestine and Trans Jordan had been completed, whereas the portion in Iraqwas fit for use only in fine weather. There was no agreement with iraq that the road should be finished by them, though it had been understood that they would carry out the work. It now appearedextremely unlikely that they would be prepared, or, indeed, wouldbe able to pay the large sum involved (about  600,000), and itmight be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to find the money.It was suggested that the Foreign Secretary might try to getat any rate some contribution from Iraq towards the constructionof the road, and that, subject to this, the matter should be further discussed between the Secretary of State for War and the Chancellorof the Exchequer.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the route was of great importance, and should be finished as soon as possible.The War Cabinet :-I. Approved, in principle, the recommendations* of the Chiefsof Staff in their Report on the Military Policy in theMiddle East (W.P. (39) 148), and instructed the Depart-ments concerned to proceed immediately with detailed plans and preparations, subject to the followingqualifications : (i) Financial. As planning of the main projects in thisscheme had not previously been authorised, it hadnot hitherto been possible to frame any estimates of the expenditure involved. The defence ministers were invited to prepare a short state-ment, which should be communicated to theChancellor of the Exchequer, distinguishing between (a) Proposals (mainly in regard to minor items ofexpenditure) which, in their opinion,should be authorised forthwith; and(&amp;) Major projects.In regard to these major projects, the defence departments were instructed, as soon as estimates of cost were available, to communicate with theChancellor of the Exchequer in order to enable him to deal with the financial issues involved.(ii) Formation of an A african Division in Kenya. this project was postponed for the time being.(iii) Provision of shore-based storage and depot facilitiesfor the Fleet Air Arm complement of 2 aircraft carriers. No decision could be taken on thismatter pending further consideration by theChief of Naval Staff and Chief of the Air Staff.* For convenience of reference, these recommendations are summarised inthe Annex to these Minutes.[20657] b 3
(iv) Overland routes to Egypt.(a) No   considerable   expenditure   should   be involved on the Mombasa-Khartoum-Cairo route.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for War were invitedto confer further as to expenditure on theHaifa-Baghdad route.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to see whether the Iraqi Govern-ment could not be induced to bear a portionof the cost.(v) The gradual increase of our forces in India and thecreation of corresponding base organisations upto a total of 14 Squadrons.The Secretary of State for Air was invitedto communicate the precise implications of theabove base organisations to the Secretary of Statefor India, in order that the latter might take upthe question of the incidence of cost with theGovernment of India.II. Invited the Minister of Supply to investigate the possibilityof developing supply capacity East of the mediterranean-nean, and to report to the War Cabinet; the Ministerof Shipping being consulted on the transportationaspect-.The Air 3.   The Secretary of State for Air said that the Royal air situation. Force had had a quiet day and there was nothing of interest to(Previous report.Reference: The War Cabinet took note of this statement.W.M. (40) 11thConclusions,Minute 1.)The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 11thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that a sweep by light forces had been carried out on the previous day to the Maas lightvessel. Two Danish vessels had been brought in, but their examina-tion had revealed nothing suspicious.The Admiralty feared that H.M. submarine Seahorse must now be considered lost. The submarine Undine was considerablyoverdue and H.M. submarine Starfish was a. day late. Thesesubmarines had been operating in the Heligoland Bight, and it waspossible that the)^ had been trapped by a deep mine-field.It was not thought desirable to make any announcement on thematter for the moment.The German steamship Trautenfels, with, a cargo of ore, haddamaged her rudder and drifted outside the limit of norwegian territorial waters. A cruiser had been sent to endeavour to capture her.The German steamship Santos (5,000 tons) had broken out fromRio de Janeiro.   Warships were searching for her.The destroyer Wessew had been badly holed as a result of acollision, but was safely in port.The Minister without Portfolio referred to the report thatincendiary bombs had been dropped on our fishing vessels. He feltthat, if the facts were substantiated, this opened the way to effectivereprisals by us on the Rhine barges.
5. The Secretary of State for War said that the lull continued.One Press report suggested a new Russian thrust towardsIlomantsi, north of Lake Ladoga. The situation in the Salla-Kemijarvi area was still far from clear.Russian air raids had been taking place over a wide area,apparently including a Swedish island.The MilitarySituation.Finland.(previous reference:W.M.

The War Cabinet were given further information regarding possible future events in Belgium. Particulars of this information are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.8. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that hehad been consulted on the previous evening by the Minister ofEconomic Warfare as to whether, in view of the possibility ofGerman attack, neutral shipping proceeding to Holland andBelgium should be held up for the present. In anticipation ofthe War Cabinet&apos;s approval, he (the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence) had advised the Minister of Economic Warfare to holdup the shipping as far as possible up to a delay of 48 hours.The Minister without Portfolio said that he had been advised that no steps had yet been taken to delay shipments of oil to theNetherlands.The War Cabinet :-(a) Endorsed the instructions given by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and confirmed that the export orshipment of war materials, particularly oil. should beheld up for the time being.(b) Agreed to review the position at their meeting on thefollowing day.Finland.Attitude ofItaly towardspossibility ofsendingAssistance.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 57 dated the 14th January, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, reporting a conversation in whichCount Ciano had asked him whether he considered that the Finnswere in need of man-power; he (Sir Percy Loraine) had replied thathe was not exactly informed on this subject, but he was under theimpression that what the Finns needed most was war material ofvarious kinds, together possibly with certain classes of technicians.Count Ciano then said that Italy was not in a position to assistThe Prime Minister asked the Chief of Naval Staff to investigate the report of incendiary attack on our shipping.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
Finland financially, but he indicated that they had in mind thedespatch to Finland of Italian pilots who had war experience. He(Count Ciano) assumed that we should not ourselves be sending any military formations to Finland. He (the Secretary of State)thought it unfortunate that Sir Percy Loraine should havediscouraged Count Ciano from the idea of despatching Italianvolunteers to Finland, and he accordingly proposed to telegraph to the Ambassador explaining our attitude on this question.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Turkey.Proposed TradeAgreementswith Germany.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 118thConclusions,Minute 13.)10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to telegram No. 41, dated the 12th January, 1940, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Ankara, reporting that the Commercial Secretary had learned from a reliable but unofficial source that two agreements were being negotiated between Germany and Turkey regardingcommercial exchanges, and that under the first of these Turkeyproposed to purchase German goods to the value of  T. 7 million,and Germany in return to make large purchases of Turkish products,including Turkish tobacco ( T. 4,100,000), sultanas, figs, hazel-nuts,olive oil ( T. 250,000), sesame seed, oil cake and cotton ( T. 70,000).Mr. Numan Menemencioglu, the Secretary-General of the TurkishMinistry of Foreign Affairs, had refused to enter into any discussions on the subject of olive oil and cotton during his visit to London, on the ground that he was not authorised to do so. Wehad, however, given him a draft agreement dealing with these products, both of which were very much required by Germany. it did seem most unreasonable that, as soon as the Turks had secured the best possible bargain with us in regard to some of their products,they should at once turn to Germany and sell to her others whichwe also wished to purchase. The Turkish Government should surelyhave given us an opportunity of concluding a deal in regard to these products before committing themselves to Germany.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to look into the matter, and report further.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 15, 1940.
ANNEX.Recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff as to Military Policy in the Middle East.(Paragraphs 23-25 of W.P. (39) 148.)WE therefore recommend that the following measures for building up our land and air forces in the Middle East should be approved : Land Forces.(i) The development of a base organisation in Egypt and Palestine and the gradual accumulation of material reserves for a force of 9 divisions(including the present garrison) should be put in hand at once.(ii) Reserves should be accumulated in India for 3 divisions and mobile&quot; troops for employment in Iraq and Iran.   Basra should be developedciS  L base port for a force of this size.(iii) One division should be concentrated early in India and earmarked forthe defence of the Anglo-Iranian oilfields.(iv) An African division should be formed in Kenya from units alreadythere combined with one, and later a second, brigade of theR.W.A.F.F. from West Africa *(v) An additional battalion of the Sudan Defence Force should be raised.(vi) Until the strategic situation as between the West and the Middle Eastbecomes clearer, we do not recommend the concentration in the middle east of additional formations other than the above, and those whichhave been already ordered there, viz., the first Australian and NewZealand divisions and the 1st Cavalry Divisions.Air Forces.As a policy to be aimed at, we consider that we should build up our airresources in the Middle East on the following programme : (i) The institution of such measures as can be undertaken to improve the mobility of our existing squadrons in the Middle East to enable themto operate from Turkey or Greece and also to handle such limited air reinforcements as we might conceivably be forced to find, possiblyas early as the Spring of 1940.&apos; (ii) The gradual increase of our air forces in the Middle East and Indiaand the corresponding base organisation up to the following totals : (a) Mediterranean and Middle East Area (excluding Egyptian and iraq Air Forces) Bomber Squadrons, Heavyt     ............. 4Bomber Squadrons, Medium.......      --- 8Fighter Squadrons        ............ 10A.C. Squadrons ... .(5) India Bomber Squadrons, Heavy       ........- 2Bomber Squadrons, Medium    ....     ...... 4Fighter Squadrons        ...      ...... 4A.C. Squadrons......... H(The provision of fighter squadrons is the most importantrequirements for India.)* This recommendation is at present under discussion between the War Office and ColonialOffice and is therefore provisional.f Also available for troop transport.$ Or according to strength of army in the area.g Including Indian Air Force.
(iii) The provision, as soon as resources will permit, of shore base, storage and depot facilities for the following :  (a) To co-operate with the Navy in the Mediterranean or Red Sea G.R.F./Bt, Squadrons............        3G.R. Landplane  ...       ...      ...       ...      ...        4T.B./G.R. Squadrons.........      ...        1(b) The E.A.A. complement of 2 aircraft carriers, amounting to atotal of 6 squadrons with the necessary reserves.(Note. The above requirements are subject to further examination by the Chiefs of Staff.)(iv) An administrative examination should be undertaken, and planning should be begun to meet the above requirements and, in addition, thenecessary provision of base facilities for a reinforcing group of12 heavy bomber squadrons from the United Kingdom. authority should be afforded for the immediate inception of such measures as can be undertaken without reducing our resources in the west,(v) The measures which would be required to maintain the Red Sea routeshould be more thoroughly examined by the Commanders-in-Chief andthe possibility of obtaining the co-operation of South African AirForces should be explored.All Services.(i) 90 days&apos; war reserves should be authorised for all additional forces which may be added to the strength of the Middle East garrisons,(ii) The overland routes to Egypt should be developed as alternative routes\        for maintenance.,liii) The Turks should be induced to develop their air facilities and\\       communications in Thrace and Western Anatolia, and, if necessary,technical advice and assistance should be afforded.
