367W.M. 47 (40)31Man Power.(previous references:W.M. (40) 17thConclusions,Minute 1,and 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)Labourstatistics.1.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers :  (1) Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  covering aMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService (W,P. (G.) (40) 46).(2) Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  covering aMemorandum by the War Office and the Ministry ofSupply (W.P. (G.) (40) 49).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these paperstogether constituted the first of the series of reports which he hadbeen invited to prepare on the measures in operation, and those proposed, to promote an increase in man-power in the war industries.The Chancellor drew attention to the main points in the papers. It would be seen that the Minister of Labour had discussed the problems of securing the required influx of labour into the war industries with representatives of employers and employed in theEngineering industry. Both had shown a helpful attitude, which led the Minister to conclude that there should be for the momentas little public reference to the question as possible. Nevertheless,employers might not at present be doing as much as possible in thedirection of dilution for fear of causing friction with their workpeople.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the only comment he wished to make on these memoranda was that it was disappointingthat there was no statistical material available to indicate whatmeasure of progress had been achieved by these means in expandingengineering employment. It must be remembered that the programmes required an expansion in the engineering industriesalone of 816,000 persons by July-September 1940 that is to say,from 1,300.000 persons to 2,116,000. They had no measure of what had been achieved. It might be that the War Cabinet would wishhim to see what could be done to fill this gap in their statisticalknowledge.The Minister of Labour said that an exact picture of numbers employed, in the groups into which the insured population was divided, was provided by the exchange of books which took placeevery July. In other months they could only estimate changes inemployment by having regard to known changes in the number ofunemployed registered monthly and to the changes anticipated inthe total insured population over the year. These estimates hadoften been belied by the event, even in peace time. To-day thedifficulties in the way of estimating changes in employment were very much greater. A large number of insured men had been called up; unknown numbers of persons either not previously insured, or who had left insured employment, were entering insured employ-ment; and there had been an unknown amount of transference fromone industry to another within the field of insured employment.For these reasons, it was quite impossible to prepare a monthlyestimate of the changes in employment in particular industries onthe basis of the material at present available. At the outset of thelast war the Board of Trade Labour Division had called for a return of employment from a number of employers. This return, knownas the &quot; Z 8 &quot; return, had been made at quarterly intervals,beginning in 1914; it was discontinued in 1920. It had covered all government establishments; but in the case of other establishments,only a sample of employers, of varying completeness in different industries, had made returns. The nature of the return had been somewhat simplified in the course of the war. Even at the beginningof 1917, however, it had called for replies to 23 questions groupedunder 9 different headings.[20864] &quot; b 2
The Prime Minister said that what the Minister of Labour had said disclosed a serious deficiency in our information. It was essential that we should have exact knowledge of what washappening. We ought to know by how much the engineering labour had expanded; from which industries this additional labour hadbeen drawn; and in which industries pools of labour, which could bedrawn upon, remained. ,.The Lord Privy Seal said that the need for such returns had become plain when the Ministerial Committee on Economic policy had been discussing Lord Stamp&apos;s Memorandum on our national resources in relation to our War Effort. Another point on which information was sadly deficient was the level of labour earnings, as opposed to wage rates.The Minister of Labour said that he believed that the Ministerof Supply had the necessary powers to collect this information, andit might be desirable for the Ministry of Labour to act as the agents of the Minister of Supply in this matter. His advisers took theview, however, that the statistics would only be of value if they werecompiled on an occupational basis, so that they would be able to locate, for example, the skilled fitters employed in works notengaged in engineering production up and down the country. Onthe other hand, he believed that, apart from enabling Ministers to answer Parliamentary Questions, the Z 8 return in the last war hadnot proved of much value. In any event, a simpler return thanZ 8 would be more suitable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that only a simplereturn, which would give comparable results from month to month,would be required; but the scope of the return was a practicalquestion which would be better discussed at a meeting called forthat purpose.Training. In a general discussion on training of labour for skilledemployment in the engineering industries, the following were theprincipal points made : (a) Raising semi-skilled men to the ranks of fully skilled.Attention was drawn to the importance of providingtraining for this purpose, and for raising the fully skilled toeven higher levels, as constituting the most economical means for providing the men required and as providing a flow of promotion which would make for smooth working.The Minister of Labour explained that this form oftraining would require different instructors and differentmachinery from that available in the Government trainingcentres and that it could only be undertaken inside the worksthemselves. He had already drawn the attention of the trades union and the Employers to the matter, and was going todiscuss it with the Employers&apos; Federation in the coming week.There was general agreement with the view that this formof training was primarily a matter for the employers, but thatit also required to be encouraged and organized, and that therewas therefore scope for Government action in the matter.(b) Provision of training in Government centres for personsalready in employment.The Minister of Labour said that the great bulk of thosewho could be brought into these centres by present methods hadalready been secured, but that there were plenty of men employed in non-essential trades who could be trained for workof national importance. This, however, would immediatelyraise difficulties of the scale of allowances to be paid- to them.
369W.M. 47 (40)Recruitment ofwomen.Schedule ofReservedOccupations.Experience ofthe Ministry ofSupply.&amp;c, and his Department was engaged on considering possible ways of overcoming these difficulties.There was general agreement with the view that it was essential to make progress with this matter.(c) The use of the facilities available in Technical Schools,Approved Schools and Universities.The Minister of Labour said that this was being discussed with the Board of Education.The Lord, Privy Seal stressed the importance of makingthe greatest possible use of Universities in this connection.The Secretary of State for War said that his Departmentalso was making plans to use Technical School facilities for thetraining of skilled men required by the Army, and asked forthis to be borne in mind in connection with any further proposals which might be put forward.(d) Training generally.The Minister of Labour said that, as a result of recent discussions, the Trades Unions had adopted a better attitude in the matter and that it would now be far easier to secureprogress.Attention was drawn to the statement, in paragraph 6 of theMemorandum by the Minister of Labour attached to W.P. (G.) (40)46, to the effect that it seemed that there was &quot; for the moment no great demand for women in engineering, except in occupations forwhich they are ordinarily employed.&quot;The Minister of Labour said that this meant that firms were,in fact, able to find the women they needed without any assistancefrom the Government. Tactful managers were securing the employ-ment of very large numbers of women, but it was better not toadvertise the fact too widely. Some delay had been caused by thefact that wage rates for women had not yet been settled.The Prime Minister asked whether there was a risk that, as more men were taken for the Armed Forces, the supply of semi-skilled men or of men available for training would be depleted.The Minister of Labour said that this risk existed. TheSchedule, however, covered the lesser skilled men as well as the highly skilled men. The present arrangements were flexible, andpermitted of adjustments being made by administrative action as required, through the machinery of the Man-Power Committee. Hethought that the balance was being held evenly between the needs ofindustry and of the Armed Forces.The Minister of Supply expressed the same opinion.The Minister, continuing, said that there was general shortageof skilled engineering labour in the sense that probably every bigmunition factory could use its machinery more fully and secureincreased production if more men were available. For example, ashortage of 2,000 men had been reported at Barrow, and of 400 menat Woolwich, while at Coventry it was difficult to get men to workon the night shift, when there was day work available for everybodyand when the night pay was at the rate of time and one-fifthinstead of time and one-third. The problem, as he saw it, was first to ascertain the labour available, and then to get it into the industrywhere it was wanted. This had to be tackled locally, and it was forthis purpose that Production Officers were being appointed for thevarious areas, their task being, in effect, that of securing the adop-tion of measures of dilution. Two Production Officers had alreadybeen appointed in the machine tool industry, and as a result twelvefirms which had not pi&apos;eviously been working a full night shift were[20864] b 3222
doing so. The general opinion of the Ministry&apos;s production staff was that there were no insuperable obstacles to dilution, but that itwould be very difficult to quicken the pace of the progress. the progressive shortage of raw materials for producing civilianrequirements would, he hoped, encourage men to transfer to thework of war production.The employ- The Secretary of State for War said that he had nothing toment of skilled add to his Memorandum (Appendix &quot;A&quot; to W.P. (G.) (40) 49),tradesmen in which he had prepared only in order to show the efforts which werethe army. being made by the Army to remove any cause for criticism in thematter of its employment of skilled tradesmen.The War Cabinet : (1) Took note of the two Memoranda on Man Power by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G.) (40) 46 and 49).(2) Agreed that periodic returns of employment should beobtained, showing, if possible : (a) how fast the labour requirements of the industriesaffected by the Service programmes were being-met;(b) from what industries this labour was being drawn;(c) in what industries pools of labour still remained onwhich further drafts might be made.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Labour and National Service, theMinister of Supply, and other Ministers concerned, to devise suitable arrangements for achieving these objects.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Departments concerned, to investigate thepossibilities of a further development of facilities fortraining the skilled labour required for war purposes,and to report to the War Cabinet on the measures already adopted for this purpose, and on any further measures proposed.The Air 2.   The Secretary of State for A ir said that the weather duringSituation. the  previous  24  hours  had  been  most  unfavourable  for  air(Previous operations.  On the previous evening, however, two Whitley aircraftEeferenee:        had flown to Heligoland, one of which had reported three unlitW.M.

The other Whitley, which had experienced con-Minute 1.)        siderable A.A. fire, had located four heavy ships in a position halfa mile to the north-west of Heligoland.  Twelve vessels had also been sighted 60 miles north-west of Terschelling, with a number of other vessels in the vicinity which were showing lights.  Ice extended fromBorkum to a point a few miles west of Heligoland and thence north-eastwards.   This report had not come through until 10 - 30 p.m.   Itindicated very difficult conditions;  and, as by that time weather conditions in this country had considerably deteriorated, it had beendecided not to send out further aircraft.Some enemy air activity had been reported over the North sea in the Shetland-Bergen area.
The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 46thConclusions,Minute 2.)Shipping losses.3. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that H.M. submarineSalmon at 8-10 that morning had reported German capital shipssteering south from Heligoland.The Secretary of State for Air said that the question of sending out a bomber force to attack the German battle fleet was underdiscussion at that moment between the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Bomber Command, and the Air Staff.Continuing, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that the outward-bound Norwegian convoy, which had been diverted toKirkwall on the 18th February, would proceed later in the day.Suitable warship cover had been provided.One ship and four trawlers had reported being attacked by aircraft off the Scottish coast on the previous day, but these reports had not been confirmed.The following shipping losses had been reported during theprevious twenty-four hours :  S.S. Odysseus, Greek (4,577 tons), sunk without warningoff Cape Finisterre.   Crew saved.S.S. Banderas, Spanish (2,140 tons), sunk off CapeVillano, following an explosion on the 18th February. Sevensaved, 22 missing.The week has seen serious shipping losses. Five British vessels,totalling 40,000 tons, and 15 neutral vessels, totalling 50,000 tons,had been sunk. This compared with peak weekly losses in April1917 averaging 200,000 tons.An intensive sweep against U-boats was being carried out by submarine-hunting units in the Moray Firth area and east of the orkneys.The damaged tanker Imperial Transport, escorted by a destroyer, was in tow west of the Hebrides.The British ship Hartismere (5,498 tons), disabled since the15th February, had been taken in tow by the armed merchant cruiser H.M.S. Jervis Bay in the Southern Atlantic. She would beescorted to Freetown by a number of French warships and submarines.A mine had been exploded by a coil towing ship near the SunkLight Vessel on the previous day.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M.

Thediscussion which took place is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.Scandinavia.Stoppage oftraffic in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 46thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. In connection with the discussion on the preceding Minute,the First Lord of the Admiralty said that it was no use takingseriously the neutrality of so-called neutral Powers which were acting under duress. Very many Norwegian ships had been sunk,and the lives of many Norwegian sailors had been lost. germany had, however, entirely ignored the Norwegian Governments pro-tests. The action of the Norwegian Government in escortingthrough their territorial waters a ship containing 300 british prisoners was not the act of a free agent.The Secretary of State for Air thought that the reply made bythe Norwegian Government, as reported in the Press, was signi-significant, namely, that they regarded the Altmark as a warship andthat they saw nothing wrong in a warship with prisoners passing through territorial waters. If that was their attitude, it was onewhich we could not tolerate, and we should say so openly.The Prime Minister entirely agreed with this view. TheNorwegian Government apparently thought that, if any particularaction was not expressly forbidden by international law, it waslawful.  This, again, was a point of view which we could not accept.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he didnot dissent from the view expressed by his colleagues, but he thoughtthat it was important not to ignore the fact that, while UnitedStates opinion had accepted the action which we had taken so farvis-a-vis neutrals, that opinion was very reserved in regard to any future action which we might take. He had asked our Ambassadorsat Washington and Rome to telegraph their judgment of opinion in the countries to which they were accredited.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Italy.economic relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 46thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome to informCount Ciano of the answer which it was intended to give to that day&apos;s Parliamentary Question, asking whether German sea-borneexports of coal to Italy were liable to examination. He had added,for the Ambassador&apos;s private information, that the date which wehad in mind for the stoppage of the German coal exports was the1st March, unless the Ambassador felt that convincing reasonsexisted for giving the Italian Government longer notice (ForeignOffice telegram No. 97 to Rome).Sir Percy Loraine had replied that, in his opinion, the1st March was a reasonable date. He regarded the consequences for italy, both economic and political, as exceedingly grave. As regardsthe economic consequences, Sir Percy Loraine submitted that itwould be very undesirable for British coal exports to Italy to be stopped (owing to that country&apos;s inability to provide the necessaryforeign exchange) at the same date as the stoppage of German sea-borne coal. Means ought to be found of continuing our coal exportsto Italy for, say, a month after the stoppage of German coal exportsto Italy.
373W.M. 47 (40)As regards the political consequences, Sir Percy said that hecould not now venture to prophesy whether the consequences wouldbe a change of attitude, in an anti-British direction, on the partof the Italian regime, or a mutiny against that regime (Rometelegrams Nos. 136 and 137).The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to Rometelegram No. 139, reporting a conversation between the british military Attache and Signor Caproni regarding the latter&apos;s aircraftcontract with us. Signor Caproni had said that the Duce hadcompletely changed his attitude towards this contract between the2nd February and the 8th February. On the 2nd February signor mussolini had read the contract, and had expressed warm satisfac-tion; but on the 8th February he had refused to allow the aircraft to be sold to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Signor Caproni hadattributed the Duce&apos;s change of attitude to German threats.The Secretary of State for Air said that an Air Force officer who had just returned from Rome, whom he had just seen, expectedsome modification of Signor Mussolini&apos;s attitude. interested parties in Italy might be expected to bring great pressure to bear onthe Duce to allow some of the British contracts to go through.This officer had reported a rumour to the effect that the german ambassador in Rome had been to see Signor Mussolini with a copyof our  20 million programme of expenditure in his hand.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Roumania.Oil policy:supply of equip-ment and rawmaterials.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 46thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad now seen M. Tilea, who had handed him the answer of theRoumanian Government to our aide-memoire of the 30th January.The Roumanian answer disclosed that the Roumanian Governmenthad now undertaken to furnish Germany with 130,000 tons of oil amonth (or 1,560,000 tons a year). These figures were inclusive ofthe oil supplies promised to Germany under the German-RoumanianAgreement of March 1939, which had provided that 25 per cent, of roumania&apos;s total exports to Germany should take the form of oil.They were also inclusive of the oil which Roumania had promised to supply to Germany in payment for munitions of war. The newGerman-Roumanian arrangement provided that arrears of monthlydeliveries might be made up afterwards, but that monthly deliveriescould not be anticipated.Should we, in the light of this information, lift the ban on thedespatch of consignments of equipment and raw materials to roumania ? The Roumanian view was that they had done well inlimiting exports to Germany to the figures of which we had nowbeen informed. On the whole, he (the Foreign Secretary) was inclined to consider that our ban might now be removed.The Minister without Portfolio informed the War Cabinetthat a meeting of his Committee had been called for that afternoon to consider this information. His provisional view was that wecould hardly avoid recognising as a fact Roumania&apos;s new arrange-ment with Germany, which we could not alter, but we must notacquiesce in it. In actual fact, Germany was not likely to importas much as 1,560,000 tons of oil a year from Roumania. Ifdeliveries fell behind the schedule, Germany would certainly have great difficulty in making up arrears. We must continue to employopportunist tactics to prevent Germany from obtaining the amountof oil provided for in the agreement.
The War Cabinet: Took note of the above statements, and authorised theCommittee under the chairmanship of the Minister without portfolio to reach a decision as to the continuance orremoval of the present temporary ban on exports to roumania.War Cabinet 9.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that aArrangements. Memorial Service for the late Lord Tweedsmuir was being held at12 noon on Thursday, the 22nd February. It would accordingly benecessary to hold the Meeting of the War Cabinet on that daysomewhat earlier than the usual time.The War Cabinet were also informed of the arrangements madefor the parade by the officers and men of H.M. Ships Ajax andExeter on Friday, the 23rd February, on the Horse Guards Parade,where they would be inspected by His Majesty The King, prior totheir march to the Guildhall. On this morning also it would benecessary to hold the Meeting of the War Cabinet at an earlierhour than usual.The Prime Minister said that a notice would be circulated asto the hour of the Meetings on these two mornings.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 20, 1940.
