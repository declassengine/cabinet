The Air 1.   &apos; he Secretary of State for Air said that the previousSituation. 24 hours had been uneventful, chiefly on account of the bad(Previous .      weather.Reference: One enemy aircraft had approached Shoreham,  from theW.M. (40) 5th direction of France, along the corridor reserved for civil aircraft,Conclusions,      and had turned away over the North Sea.Minute 1.) Enquiries were proceeding to try and establish the object ofthis flight.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 5thConclusions,Minute 2.)Magnetic Mines.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Sea Lord said that the first New Zealand troopconvoy had sailed on the 6th January, with a strong escort.H.M.S. Nelson had docked safely at Portsmouth.S.S. Codrington Court, 5,160 tons, cargo of wheat, had been mined and sunk three miles N.E. of N. Goodwin lightship.S.S. Towneley, 2,888 tons, had been mined five miles S.S.E. ofthe Tongue lightship, and abandoned by crew, but was still afloat.S.S. British Liberty, 8,455 tons, a tanker bound for Dunkirk,had been mined and sunk off Calais.The First Sea Lord said that there had been several recentcases of ships being abandoned by their crews without justification,and the Admiralty were taking this matter up.The case of the British Liberty was unfortunate, as she had runinto a British minefield through disobeying her routeing orders.There had been no attacks on shipping by submarines.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence enquired whetheradvantage could be taken of the present lull in enemy submarineoperations to permit outward bound shipping to sail without having to wait for convoy.The First Sea Lord said that, although there had been nosubmarine attacks, there were submarines about, and it was not thought advisable to interfere with the present organisation forthe sailing of shipping. Attacks b)^ torpedo were bound to be fewerin winter, on account of the long nights, and bad weather. It waspossible that the Germans were taking advantage of the presentweather conditions to refit a number of their submarines.In reply to an enquiry by the Secretary of State for Air, theFirst Sea Lord said that, although there had been recent reports which appeared to indicate the presence of fast surface craft, orof aircraft taxi-ing on the water, near the coast, sometimes inperiods of very bad visibility, it had not been possible to confirm that mine-laying by these means had taken place. Such mine-layingas had taken place recently had probably been done by submarines.The development of devices for sweeping magnetic mines was proceeding, and experiments confirmed the theoretic basis on whichwe were working. In another month&apos;s time the Admiralty hoped to be in as good a position to deal with the magnetic mine as theywere to deal with the moored mine.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Military 3.   The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that situation. there was nothing to report on the Western Front, or in Finland.(Previous -p^e ^ar Cabinet took note of the above statement.Reference:W.M.

Poncet) had made on the 24th December, 1939.M. Poncet had added that he felt it unwise to press Count Cianoon the matter, since by so doing he might give an official character to a talk which had been on a strictly personal basis.
