387W.M.49 (40).The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 48thConclusions,Minute 1.)Attacks onU-boats.Raid onHeligoland,20th/21stFebruary.1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat the cloud conditions over the North Sea on the previous day had prevented air activity on any scale.An unidentified aircraft had approached within 40 miles ofthe coast, off Sunderland. A section of Spitfires had failed to confirm this report.Twenty-nine patrols, involving 64 Fighters, had been engaged on convoy, shipping protection and patrol duties. The Leader of a section of Spitfires sent to protect the Southbound convoy in thevicinity of Spurn Head had attempted to penetrate the fog layeron the sea and had been lost. Presumably the pilot had dived intothe sea.Two reconnaissances had been carried out within the Heligo-land Bight and off the North German Coast, with the object oflocating enemy warships and observing ice conditions the first bya Hudson and the second by two Blenheims. Thick fog, extendingfrom 500 feet to sea-level, had prevented observation. This fogwas probably the result of rapidly melting ice, which was reportedto have practically disappeared in the neighbourhood of Heligoland.A number of Fighter patrols had been carried out by the british air Forces in France. A reconnaissance over Western germany had revealed no unusual movement: and the undisturbed snow on german aerodromes indicated lack of air activity.The majority of the normal patrols, searches and convoy escortsby aircraft of Coastal Command bad been flown, but a few had hadto be cancelled or curtailed by bad weather conditions.A Hudson had sighted a U-boat submerging 124 miles east of Wick at 10-46 a.m. and had attacked with two 250-lb. bombs,which had been well placed on the estimated track of the submarine!A big brown patch had appeared after the bombs had exploded,but low cloud had prevented further observation. Another Hudsonhad sighted a U-boat with conning-tower awash 116 miles East ofWick at 2-28 p.m. Three 250-lb. bombs had been dropped, but ithad been impossible to estimate the result, owing to the bad visitors-bility.   A destroyer had been called to the position.Referring to the raid on Heligoland on the night of the20th/21st, of which the War Cabinet had been informed on theprevious day, the Secretary of State said that one WellingtonBomber had been lost. It had reported its position about 100 miles off the East Coast on its return, but after that no more had beenheard of it. Searches had been carried out, and it could only beassumed that it had flown into the sea in thick weather. Theresults were as follows : One aircraft had sighted and attackedone warship; a direct hit was not claimed, but the warship had probably sustained some superficial damage from the closeness ofthe explosion. A destroyer had also been seen and attacked by another aircraft in the neighbourhood of Heligoland, but again no direct hits had been scored. Some of our aircraft had encounteredconsiderable anti-aircraft fire.Another reconnaissance of the Bight was being carried out that morning, and, if a suitable target were found, another raid mightbe made that night.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 48thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet particulars of the present dispositions of the Home Fleet.The convoys to and from Norway were proceeding satisfactorily.[20877]b 2
Scuttling ofGermanmerchantvessels.(previous references:W.M. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 2,and 107thConclusions,Minute 3.)S.S. Wahehe.Attacks on shipping.Attacks onU-boats.S.S. Altmark.H.M.S. Daring.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 46thConclusions,Minute 2.)The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 48thConclusions,Minute 3.)Western Front.Finland.At 4-30 p.m. H.M.S. Manchester had intercepted the Germanship Wahehe (4,700 tons). The Wahehe had attempted to scuttleherself, but, after a few rounds of pompom fire, had hauled downher colours and picked up her boats&apos; crews. She was now beingescorted to a Home port by H.M.S. Kipling. As soon as the weather was suitable, a prize crew would be placed on board.The First Lord remarked that this was the first instance ofthe success of our procedure to prevent scuttling, the procedurebeing that the enemy ship, on being sighted, was immediatelyinstructed by signal to cast away her boats without embarking her crew. If this signal was not at once obeyed, fire was opened on herwith the object of coercing her.The British S.S. Loch Maddy (5,000 tons), bound for Leithwith wheat and lumber from Halifax, had been torpedoed 20 miles east of Scapa at 4-15 p.m. on the 21st February. Thirty-twosurvivors had been landed by H.M.S. Diana, which had also attacked a good contact in this position.Destroyers were hunting the U-boats mentioned earlier by theSecretary of State for Air as having been found and attacked by aircraft 120 miles East of Wick.At 7-6 p.m. on the 21st, the trawler Northern Isle had reported the presence of a submarine off the North-West coast of the orkneys, and had attacked with depth charges. Three destroyers were now hunting in this area.The War Channel North of the Tyne had been found infestedwith mines.   Sweeping operations were in progress.The press reported that the German steamer Wiegand(5,900 tons) had arrived at Josing Fjord to tow off the Altmark.Our submarines had been instructed to sink the Altmark (as awarship) if met outside Territorial Waters. If possible, theWiegand would be taken prize, but this might be a very difficultoperation.Imperial Transport was now in tow South of the Hebridesunder protection of escort.H.M. Submarine L. 23, which had been depth-charged by theGermans on the 20th, had been due to arrive home that morning.No further reports had been received from H.M. SubmarineSalmon, but her silence gave the Admiralty no cause for anxiety.The one surviving officer from H.M.S. Daring had reported thatthe vessel, which had been torpedoed on a moonlight night, had turned over and sunk in 30 seconds.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.3. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat there was nothing of importance to report from the western front.A blizzard was reported to be blowing in Finland, and this might prove a factor of extreme importance in helping the Finns.The Finns had denied the capture of Koivisto by the Russians.The Russians had continued their attack against Taipale, butthere were signs that the pressure was relaxing.The Finns were carrying out mopping-up operations in thewaist-line.
389W.M.49 (40). :Assistance to finland.Employment ofservice crewsfor ferryingaircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)Press reports on british aid to finland.4. The Secretary of State for Air said that it would probably not be possible to obtain reliable civil pilots to ferry over the Rocaircraft which we had undertaken to supply to Finland. he therefore suggested that it would be best to demobilise temporarilysome Fleet Air Arm crews in the same way that Royal Air Forcepilots were being temporarily demobilised to ferry over theBlenheims.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he did not thinkit likely that there vrould be any objection to this from the Admiraltypoint of view, and that he would make enquiries.The Prime Minister drew attention to the reports which had appeared in the press giving exact details of the material whichwe had supplied to Finland. He asked on what authority this statement had been published.The statement had not been authorised by any of the service departments or by the Foreign Office.The view generally expressed was that the publication of thestatement had probably not done any harm. At the same time, thepublication of such statements without authority was to bedeprecated.The War Cabinet :-(i) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to look into thepossibility of temporarily demobilising serving membersof the Fleet Air Arm in order to provide crews to flythe Roc aircraft to Finland.(ii) Invited the Foreign Secretary to enquire into the circum-stances in which the press had reported details of thematerial help which we had supplied to Finland.Scandinavia.Stoppage oftraffic in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 48thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The War Cabinet again considered the arguments to beemployed in their forthcoming communication to the norwegian government as a result of the A it mark incident.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the WarCabinet a Memorandum prepared by Sir William Malkin, legal adviser to the Foreign Office, examining the effect of Articles 10and 12 of Plague Convention No. 13 of 1907 (see Annexes I and IIto these Conclusions).The Prime Minister said that our communication to theNorwegian Government would not rest entirely on a legal basis, but,in so far as it did rest on international law, it must be soundlybased.In this connection he drew attention to the following commentswhich Professor Koht, the Norwegian Foreign Minister, had madeon the 20th February on his (the Prime Minister&apos;s) statement toParliament: Professor Koht contended that the Norwegian Governmenthad believed itself to be in full agreement with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarding the passage of warships through neutralterritorial waters. In 1938 the Norwegian Government hadrevised Norway&apos;s regulations on the duties and rights of neutrality. The new regulations had included one dealing withthe right of a belligerent warship to remain in norwegian waters. In the summer of 1939 the British Government had asked the Norwegian Government how this regulation was tobe understood, emphasising that warships must have the right[20877] b 3
to sail in Norwegian territorial waters as long as they desired,and without regard to the 24 hours&apos; limit. The British Govern-ment had added that such a regulation was in force in all othercountries. The Norwegian Government had replied that theyinterpreted the regulation in question in the same way as theBritish Government, and that they had formulated its text inconformity with the International Convention of 1907, whichhad also been signed by Britain.It therefore looked as if our case in international law was not of the strongest. In any event, it was essential that the WarCabinet, before taking its decision, should be fully aware of bothsides of the argument.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he proposed to deal with these matters in a Memorandum which he wascirculating later that day. His provisional views were on thefollowing lines :  (i) It still seemed to him that our case, if we limited it toNorwegian territorial waters, might not be so strong asif we related it to territorial waters in the North Seagenerally. The argument against resting our case on the wider grounds was that this would involve us with other neutral countries. None of the other neutral countriesbordering on the North Sea, however, had territorial waters which were capable of facilities for the movementof shipping, such as were provided by the norwegian coast.(ii) We had only the scantiest evidence as to the transitthrough Norwegian territorial waters of supplies of warmaterial for Germany to the Russian forces in NorthFinland. We might, however, make the point thatNorwegian territorial waters would be capable of being-used for a regular traffic of the kind suggested.(iii) We should be on much stronger ground in that part of ourcommunication to Norway which would deal withGermany&apos;s gross behaviour in her conduct of navalwarfare.(iv) He agreed with the Prime Minister that, in view of professor Koht&apos;s arguments, our position in inter-national law wras not particularly strong. Its strongestfeature was probably that to which Sir William Malkinhad drawn attention, namely, that the right of innocentpassage conferred by Article 10 of the international convention could not properly be construed as covering&quot; the use of the whole length of a country&apos;s territorial waters, which would not be the ordinary route, for thepurpose of avoiding the enemy.&apos;&apos;(v) It seemed wiser, therefore, that the case which we might decide to put to the Norwegian Government should reston a double basis : (a) Germany&apos;s ill-treatment of shipping.   On this our case was overwhelming.(b) Our case in international law.Founding ourselves principally on (a), we might, as itwere, particularise by declaring our intention of puttinga stop to Germany&apos;s transgressions in norwegian territorial waters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer inclined to the view that a genuine distinction could be established between the rights conferred by Articles 10 and 12 of the International Convention and the wayGermany was, in fact, using Norway&apos;s territorial waters. It could hardly be contemplated that a belligerent Power should claim, onthe strength of these two Articles, to establish a sort of permanent
&quot;A&quot;Alsatia in a, long stretch of territorial waters. Naval warfare might then become a game of prisoners&apos; base. Again, what was to prevent a Power from using territorial waters for the purpose of lining up its ships in their fighting formations, and then sending them out asa fleet to give battle ? This illustration, he thought, might be useful in conveying to the lay mind the absurdity of the Norwegianinterpretation of Articles 10 and 12.The Foreign Secretary also referred to a communication whichhad been received from the French Ambassador, suggesting thatwe should now take certain steps, on the strength of the Altmarkincident. Particulars in regard to this communication, and theviews expressed thereon, are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that the actionof the A it mark in attempting to return to Germany with prisonerson board was itself a military operation.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that a far-fetchedinterpretation of Article 12 would permit a warship to remain in neutral territorial waters for ever. It had only to move on a short distance at the end of every period of 24 hours.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that he had seen the Dominion High Commissioners on the previous evening and had informed them of the general lines of the action which wehad in mind to take. In principle, the High Commissioners had offered no objection. They had, however, other anxieties. they asked, for instance, what opinion we had formed of the probablerepercussions of our action (a) on Finland, (b) on Norway and sweden. The High Commissioners had imagined that, asbetween the two operations which we contemplated, we attached the greater importance to the operation in aid of Finland.They had asked if they were correct in this supposition.Had we considered the possibility of our new plan furnishingNorway and Sweden with a pretext for taking up a stand in opposition to our plan for furnishing direct assistance to Finland ?The Prime Minister said that he thought that the reply shouldbe that we did not think that the action which we had in mindin regard to stopping the abuse of Norwegian Territorial Waterswas likely to have any appreciable effect on the larger operation(direct assistance to Finland); but that in any case the chances ofthe latter operation being carried out must now be regarded asfaint.The War Cabinet: (i) Took note that the Foreign Secretary&apos;s draft communication to the Norwegian Government would be circulated that afternoon, for consideration on the following day.(ii) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs should reply to the enquiry from the Dominion high commissioners as at &quot;A.&quot;Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 48thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to telegram No. 112 from our former Minister at Helsinki, recordinghis farewell audience with the President of the Finnish Republic.A record of the preliminary discussion on this telegram is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.
Western Front. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a shortEvents of 14th/ statement in regard to the events of  the week-end 14th/15th15th January, January, and said that he would shortly be circulating a Paper1940. to his colleagues.(Previous The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Reference:W.M. (40) 30thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 145, dated the 20th February, from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Rome, in which it was stated that Signor Capronithought that Mussolini might still be persuaded to ratify the contract for the sale of Italian aircraft. He (the Foreign Secretary)thought that it was probably the inclusion of guns in the proposedgeneral agreement which had upset Mussolini and that he had always felt less strongly about the sale of aircraft.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that we mightpersuade the Italians to supply guns for the use of Finland.The Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs said that he thoughtthat Italian policy was very likely to be governed in the immediatefuture by the economic situation. He had received a further message from Sir Percy Loraine to the effect that the economic position was now likely to be extremely critical. This was likelyto react on the political situation. Sir Percy would not care toprophesy whether the result would be for the regime, in the anti-British sense, or mutiny against the regime (telegrams No. 137Dipp from Rome).The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Italy.economic relations andsituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions,Minute 7.)British land forces inFrance.Position of theCommander-in-Chief in relationto the french high Command.9. The Secretary of State for War said that a difficult situation had arisen in connection with the Command of the Armyin France. It had been understood that the Commander-in-Chiefwas under the orders of General Georges, and the relations betweenthem were entirely happy. It had, however, come to our knowledge that General Georges had not been informed by General Gamelinof the recent decision to retain two Divisions in England. Whenthe point was taken up with General Gamelin, the latter had repliedthat the British Commander-in-Chief was directly under his orders.In discussion it was generally agreed that it was of the utmost importance to maintain the principle of Unity of Command. Forthis reason it seemed desirable that the B.E.F., as at present constituted and disposed, should be under the command of general george. A different situation would arise when the strength ofthe B.E.F. had been materially increased.The Secretary of State for War said that the Chief of theImperial General Staff was flying over to see Lord Gort on thefollowing day, in order to ascertain his views as to the presentposition. On his return the matter would have to come before theWar Cabinet.
ANNEX I.International Convention (The Hague) No. 13 of 1907.Article 10.The neutrality of a Power is not affected by the mere passage through itsterritorial waters of warships or prizes belonging to belligerents.Article 12.In default of special provisions to the contrary in the legislation of a neutralPower, belligerent warships are not permitted to remain in the ports, roadsteads,or territorial waters of the said Power for more than twenty-four hours, exceptin the cases covered by the present Convention.ANNEX II.Memorandum by Sir William Malkin, Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office.Article 12 of Hague Convention No. 13 provides that belligerent warshipsare forbidden to remain (demeurer) in the ports, roadsteads or territorial waters&quot; of a neutral Power for more than 24 hours. It has beensuggested that this means that, if a warship is passing through neutral territorial waters, she must not take more than 24 hours doing so, but I do notthink that this results from the Article in question. The word &quot; demeurer &quot;must imply, in the case of ports and roadsteads, that the ship is remaining inthe same place, and I think that the same must apply to territorial waters (wherea warship might well want to remain for a short time to effect minor repairs, &amp;c),which were obviously added to place those waters in the same position as ports and roadsteads. The case of passage through territorial waters is governed by Article 10, which says that the neutrality of a Power is not affected by suchpassage, and I doubt whether the framers of the Convention had the question of passage in mind at all in connexion with Article 12. That this is the correctreading of the two Articles is supported by the consideration that if it was sought to apply the 24 hours&apos; limitation to &quot; passage,&quot; its purpose could always be defeated by breaking the period in territorial waters by going out on to the high seas for a short time, when it was safe to do so, and then returning.At the same time it is quite possible that the framers of the Conventionnever contemplated the possibility of a passage through territorial waters takingmore than 24 hours. It may well be, and this is the line which I think we shallnow have to take, that the &quot;innocent passage&quot; contemplated by Article 10was a comparatively short passage through territorial waters in the ordinary course of the ship&apos;s voyage, and that it certainly was not intended to cover the use of the whole length of a country&apos;s territorial waters, which would not bethe ordinary route, for the purpose of avoiding the enemy. If so, we couldargue that a passage of 24 hours, or even less, is not consistent with the Convention,not on account of the 24-hour rule in Article 12, but because it goes far beyond what was contemplated by &quot; innocent passage.&quot;(Initialled) H. W. M.Foreign Office, February 21, 1940.
