The Aii-Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 18thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Deputy Chief of the Air: Staff reported that Spitfireswhich had recently been sent to Aberdeen for the protection ofcoastwise shipping had engaged a Heinkel on the previous day. Theenemy aircraft had not been shot down, but had apparently beenbadly damaged, and would probably not succeed in reaching home.An offensive patrol against, seaplane bases in the heligoland bight had been carried out the previous night, but the operationhad been abandoned early on account of bad weather.Leaflets had been dropped over Hanover, Hamburg andBrunswick on the previous night.1 Weather conditions had curtailed air activity in France, buta number of fighter patrols had been carried out.The normal reconnaissances and patrols by Fighter command had been continued on the previous day, though coastal patrolsnormally operating from Wick had not been able to get off the aerodrome, which was snowbound.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that two destroyers were operating off the Norwegian coast to interceptGerman ore ships passing outside territorial waters, and also adamaged U-boat reported in this area.The homeward-bound Norwegian convoy of 39 ships was noweast of the Shetlancls. Only two ships in the convoy were British,the remainder being neutral. The number of neutral ships taking advantage of this convoy had recently increased very greatly.The third sweep off the Dutch coast had been carried out on the night of the 18th-19th, and had resulted in two Dutch, oneNorwegian and one Swedish ship being sent into the Downs for examination.H.M.S. Grenville, a flotilla leader returning from this sweep,had been sunk east of the Kentish Knock light vessel. She was believed to have been mined, but had possibly been torpedoed. Sofar as could be estimated, casualties amounted to three officers and seventy-six ratings, the majority of whom were missing. Anannouncement of the loss would be made to-day.The fourth sweep off the Dutch coast had been carried out onthe previous night, but the results were not yet known. No moresweeps would be carried out in the immediate future.It was reported from Antwerp that no German shipping had entered or left the port since the 1st January.The Danish ship Canadian Reefer (1,800 tons), not in convoy,was sunk by a submarine off Cape Finisterre on the 18th January.The crew were landed in Spain by a Spanish trawler.Other casualties to shipping were as follows : Steamship Mile End (860 tons), sunk in collision off the tyne.Norwegian steamship Notos (2,700 tons) had sent out anS.O.S. west of the Hebrides. H.M.S. Kvrnberley had been ordered to investigate, but no report had yet been received.Estonian steamship Nautic (2,050 tons) had sent out anS.O.S. 120 miles east-north-east of the Shetlands, reporting that the ship was slowly filling.About 90 ships had safely passed from Methil to the Tyne, andthe East Coast convoy situation should now return to normal. an analysis of sailings, however, disclosed that there was a delay of4-^ days on this route, which could only be accounted for by slownessin loading and turning ships round. The position was being furtherinvestigated.[20693] b 2The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 18thConclusions,Minute B.)
The shipping situation.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 122ndConclusions,Minute 2.)Reports ofshipping losses.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 118thConclusions,Minute 5.)The attack on a U-boat by the armed trawler Northern Duke,reported the previous day, seemed very likely to have been successful, at least in causing severe damage to the enemy submarine.The First Lord gave further details of the experimental work being carried on against the magnetic mine, and explained thatmine-sweeping operations on a large scale had not yet begun.He gave comparative figures of the numbers and tonnage ofBritish tankers and other ships at the outbreak of war and at thepresent time, which showed that the tanker tonnage available hadslightly increased, while that of other ships had decreased from15,300,000 to 15,200,000, a comparatively small loss.Some discussion took place on the form in which shipping lossesshould be published. It was generally agreed that only losses by enemy action should be published. There was also some discussion on the question of the publication of figures for entrances to andclearances from British ports.The First Lord said that he was personally in favour of this idea, but that the Ministry of Shipping were against it, on thegrounds that the comparison between present figures and pre-warfigures would be unfavourable. It was suggested that a solution ofthe difficulty might be to give figures from time to time for individual ports only.The War Cabinet took note : (i) of the above statement by the First Lord of the Admiralty;(ii) that, in the light of the discussion which had taken place,the First Lord of the Admiralty would, in consultationwith the Minister of Shipping, consider whether thefigures for entrances to and clearances from british ports should be published.The MilitarySituation.Western front and Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 18thConclusions,Minute 4.)Assistance to finland.Aircraft and air personnel.(Previous. Reference:W.M. (40) 16thConclusions,minute 6.)3. The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said therewas nothing to report on the Western Front.The Finns claimed that the two Russian divisions operatingnorth of Lake Ladoga had been without food for a considerable period and were now breaking up completely.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.4. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff reported that the Finnshad asked us to fly the last 12 Blenheims over with British crews.They did not ask that the pilots or crews should remain. Therewas, however, a second request for about 6 mechanics to assist inthe maintenance of the Gladiator and Gauntlet fighters which wehad already supplied.In addition, there was a suggestion from the Air Staff whichhad been already mentioned by the Secretary of State for Air to theForeign Secretary, namely, that a small unit of Hurricane fightersshould be supplied to Finland manned with British pilots and a nucleus of maintenance personnel. The British personnel to bevolunteers from the Air Force, but proceeding as civilians.The size of the unit suggested was a Flight of 6 Hurricaneswith 2 Immediate Reserve aircraft and 4 more Reserve aircraft tofollow later.The Prime Minister said that he would not object to sendingover a few mechanics to look after the Gladiators and Gauntlets,or to the idea of letting the Finns have a few Hurricanes, if the
Air Ministry could spare them. He was doubtful, however, whetherit would be wise to lend them pilots, who would have to resign theircommissions in the Royal Air Force. The proposition would requirevery careful consideration in all its aspects. The alternative wasto turn the aircraft over to Finnish pilots in this country.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff remarked that the alter -native was quite feasible, but that the Air Staff favoured the BritishUnit as likely to be a more efficient method of gaining resultsagainst the Russian bombers. Little time, however, was likely to be lost if the alternative of bringing Finnish pilots to this country wasadopted because the time factor was really conditioned by the time taken to collect and transport the ground equipment of the Unit,which might be as much as four weeks.The First Lord of the Admiralty emphasised the great moralvalue of successful operations against the Russian Air Force by aBritish flight of volunteers; and the Deputy Chief of the Air Staffexpressed the view that the Royal Air Force could spare a few pilotsof high quality.The War Cabinet agreed : To invite the Secretary of State for Air to examine theseproposals further and submit recommendations to theWar Cabinet.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 20, 1940.
