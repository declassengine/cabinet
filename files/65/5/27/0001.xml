Shipbuilding.Transfer fromthe Ministry ofShipping to theAdmiralty ofthe responsi-bility for merchant ship-building and repairs.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 18thConclusions,Minute 15.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (W.P. (G.) (40) 28).The First Lord of the Admiralty said that his arrangementsfor taking over the responsibility for merchant shipbuilding and repairs had been made in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned and might be regarded as agreed measures. He had beenfortunate in securing the assistance of Sir James Lithgow asController of Merchant Shipbuilding, and of Sir Amos Ayre as director of Merchant Shipbuilding and Repairs.In discussion, it was explained that the only point at issue wasthe wording of the fourth paragraph of the draft announcement.This paragraph read as follows : &quot; The Minister of Shipping will continue to be responsiblefor advising, after consultation with representatives of Ship-owners, upon the types of merchant vessels to be built, while theAdmiralty will assume the responsibility for ensuring thenecessary production of Mercantile Shipping, as well as thatof meeting the requirements of the Navy.&quot;Neither the First Lord nor the Minister of Shippinganticipated any difficulty in regard to the point of substancementioned. But the latter feared that the shipping world, whowould read the announcement closely, might resent the implication that the decisions as to the types of vessels to be built would be takenby the Admiralty.The Prime Minister thought that this difficulty could be met ifthe paragraph were reworded as follows, to follow more closely theCabinet decision of the 19th January : &quot; The Admiralty will assume the responsibility for ensuring the necessary production of Mercantile Shipping, aswell as that of meeting the requirements of the Navy, it being understood that, as regards the types of merchant ship to be built, the Admiralty will meet the requirements of the Ministryof Snipping, after consultation with representatives of ship-owners.&quot;The War Cabinet (1) Gave a general approval to the arrangements proposed in w.P. (G.) (40) 28.(2) Approved the draft announcement, subject to the substitu-tion for paragraph 4 of the new paragraph proposed bythe Prime Minister.West Indies. 2.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he wishedPublication of to consult the War Cabinet as to whether the Report of the Royalreport of Eoyal Commission on the West Indies should be published. The investi-Commission. gations of that Commission had revealed deplorable standards ofhealth and housing, and in social conditions generally, among theworking population in the West Indies. The working populationthemselves were now very conscious of this. Serious disturbanceswould probably have taken place in the Islands if the RoyalCommission had not been appointed, and were liable to break outif the Report Avere now withheld. The Report contained some very strong passages on this subject. The Report was unanimous, butthere would have been a minority report if the Chairman (LordMoyne) had attempted to secure the deletion of the paragraphscondemning present conditions.The Secretary of State handed round copies of two samplepassages.*&quot; [20747] b 2
In peace there would have been no question of withholdingpublication of the Report, however severe its criticisms of british administration. But it was obvious that publication of such aReport in war time would be fastened on by our enemies, who wouldmake the fullest use of the strong criticisms, while ignoring passageswhich dealt with the favourable side of the question. Notwith-standing these developments, he had reached the conclusion that publication was better than suppression.The chief arguments which weighed with him were asfollows :  (1) The advice he had received from the West IndianGovernors. Opinion in the islands, where much of theevidence before the Commission had already been published, was in a state of ferment and would becomeintensely suspicious if the report were suppressed. Riotsmight ensue.(2) The pressure on behalf of publication which might beexpected from some members of the Royal Commissionitself, and particularly from Sir Walter Citrine. Anadded difficulty was the fact that Sir Walter was now ona, visit to Finland.(3) The probable attitude of the Opposition Parties and of thePress.The Secretary of State apologised for having brought thisquestion before the War Cabinet at such short notice. He had been engaged in preparing a paper, when his hands had been forced bya leakage in the Press. The newspapers in question had insinuatedthat the Government were considering the norr-publication of theReport.  Would the War Cabinet authorise a dementi being issued ?The Prime Minister pointed out that the consequences of thepublication of the Report might be much more serious than theconsequences of publishing the evidence. The Report would beregarded as quasi-judicial.The Secretary of State for the Colonies explained that he hadin mind the publication, simultaneously with the Report, of a white paper containing a statement of policy by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment. The White Paper, indeed, might cover a wider field than theWest Indian Colonies, and might lay down a programme ofdevelopment covering the Colonial Empire as a whole. It wouldhave to be made clear, however, that, in general, the recommenda-tions of the West Indian Commission would be accepted by theGovernment and would be implemented.The Report and the White Paper might be published, say, onthe 20th February.   This would give time : (a) for his proposals for remedial action to be put into finalshape; he was already in consultation with the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer :(b) for the Ministry of Information to create in the UnitedStates and other neutral countries an atmosphere favour-able to the reception of the two documents. every endeavour would be made to place the main emphasis on the White Paper, rather than on the Report.The Minister of Information said that he and his Dejjart-mental advisers had seen advance copies of the Report. The general view of his advisers favoured publication, subject to the announce-ment of definite and immediate remedial action, and subject alsoto time being allowed for the preparation of opinion in neutral countries. The assessment of the possible dangers resulting frompublication was a matter which was more for the Foreign Secretary
and the Colonial Secretary than for himself. Subject to their views,he was prepared to support publication.In discussion, it became clear that the general view of theCabinet was strongly opposed to publication during the war.The Prime Minister said that, when he had discussed thematter previously with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, hehad not seen the extracts which were now before the War Cabinet.These convinced him that it would inflict serious damage on our war effort to publish such a Report at a time when the GermanMinistry of Propaganda was ready to take advantage of any material made available for it. In neutral countries publicationof the Report might well have the effect of leading to a generalrevision of opinion among those who had hitherto thought of GreatBritain as a leading Colonial Power that paid due regard to its responsibilities as trustee for the welfare of the natives. opinion in the United States was at the present time very much on thelook-out for items of information that were damaging to the Britishcase, and publication of the Report would have a very bad effect inthat country.Discussion then turned on the various points which must bedealt with if publication of the Report were withheld.(1) The Members of the Royal Commission.It was natural that they should wish for publication, but no great difficulty was anticipated in persuading them to agree to the opposite course, if it were put to them clearly that this was thedecision reached by the War Cabinet after considering the probable effects of publication on the course of the War. The Prime minister suggested that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should convey the view of the War Cabinet at once to Lord Moyne, but shouldstave off the answers to any questions in regard to publication until he had been able to see Sir Walter Citrine on his return from finland.(2) The Ovposition in the House of Commons.It should be possible to persuade members of Parliament notto make trouble by representing to them the disastrous consequences of publication from the point of view of the war. This was no party matter.(3) Opinion in the West Indies.The position here was particularly difficult, but the real anxiety about the publication of the Report arose from the fear that non-publication would mean the postponement of remedial action. Ifwe could make it clear that such action would be taken quickly,the agitation about publication of the Report would probably diedown. In his communications with the Governors, the Secretary ofState would make it clear that the Government intended to makea statement in about three weeks&apos; time of their intentions to seton foot remedial measures.The War Cabinet :-(i) Decided to withhold approval to the publication of theReport of the Royal Commission on the West Indies.As at present advised, it was not contemplated thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to sanctionpublication until after the end of the war.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to com-municate this decision to Lord Moyne and to the&apos;Governors of the West Indian Colonies.
Every endeavour should be made to secure theadhesion of Lord Moyne and his colleagues on the RoyalCommission and of the Governors to this decision, but no hope was to be held out that it could be reversed.(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in con-sultation with the Prime Minister, to make a similarcommunication to the Leaders of the Opposition Parties.(iv) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to circulate to the War Cabinet the text of the recommendationsof the Royal Commission, with a view to considerationbeing given to the question whether these recommenda-tions should be published,(v) Recorded the view that the real solution to the present difficulties lay in taking remedial measures at theearliest opportunity, and invited the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to circulate to the War Cabinet a draftof the proposed White Paper on the measures to betaken.(vi) Suggested that the Secretary of State for the colonies should give a non-committal answer to any Paiiia-mentary Questions until steps had been taken to com-municate the War Cabinet&apos;s decision, and the reasonstherefor, to the members of the Royal Commission andto the Leaders of the Opposition Parties.Propaganda.Principles and objectives ofBritish wartimepropaganda.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 15thConclusions,Minute 2.)(previous reference:W.M. (39) 45thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Information covering a draft statement on thePrinciples and Objectives of British wartime propaganda, for use as a guide within&apos;the Ministry (W.P. (G.) (40) 20).The Minister of Information explained that this outline didnot differ in substance from the Memorandum drawn up by his predecessor (W.P. (G.) (39) 162), but that it had been drafted ina different style, so that it could more easily be translated into action. If the outline were approved in general by the WarCabinet, it would be a help for him to know with what vigour theywould like the objective, or particular parts thereof, prosecuted.The view generally expressed was that the outline represented in general a sound and useful statement for Departmental guidance,but that it should not receive publicity. It was of the essence of propaganda that it should not be recognised as such. Authoritativestatements of British policy had already been published, as, forexample, in the statement made by His Majesty&apos;s Government inreply to Hitler&apos;s speech in the Reichstag on the 6th October, 1939.Discussion took place on the following points in the Draftoutline :  &quot; A compromise peace with an unbeaten Germany tvould be defeatin the long run.&quot;   (Section B (5).)The view was expressed that while this was a true statementit was somewhat &apos;&apos; telescoped &apos;&apos; and was liable to misinterpretation.It was therefore agreed that this sentence should be omitted andthat the following sentence should be inserted between (6) and (7),Section B: &quot;No peace could be justified Avhich does not secure these things.&quot;&quot; This is your war, the peopled ivar.&quot;   (Section A (1).)The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence suggested that this might be interpreted as drawing a distinction between &quot; thepeople &apos;&apos; as representing the mass of the population as distinct from the governing classes, whereas the important, point was to
emphasise the responsibility of the whole people for the war. TheMinister of Information was invited to amend the statement soas to avoid any risk of this misinterpretation.The reference to &quot; sacrifice &quot; in Section A (6).The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the savingscampaign being conducted under Sir Robert Kindersley. It wasvery important to secure a wider understanding among the intelli-gent wage-earners as to the relation between wages and prices and &apos;1 the vicious spiral&apos;&apos; and so on, and he welcomed the co-opera-tion of the Ministry of Information to this end. Some of this ground was indirectly covered by the Savings Campaign, thoughit was not its direct concern. It was very important to avoid any impression of over-lapping or interference in this matter, and he therefore suggested that the Minister of Information should discussthe matter with Sir Robert Kindersley with this end in view.The War Cabinet agreed : To approve the statement of the principles and objectives of British wartime propaganda set out in the Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (40) 20), for circulation as a working guidewithin the Ministry of Information but not for publica-tion, subject to amendment as indicated in discussion.Contraband 4.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theControl. Minister for Economic Warfare on the case of the Soviet shipThe case of the  Selenga (W.P. (G.) (40) 24).Soviet ship The Minister for Economic Warfare said that the alternativeSelenga. courses of action open to us in regard to this ship, which had beentaken into Hong Kong for contraband examination and had beenfound to be carrying, among other things, 1,190 metric tons of wolfram ore, were set out in paragraph 8 of his memorandum. Wecould detain the cargo indefinitely, but such action could not bejustified as a measure of contraband control. Alternatively, if we decided to release the cargo, we could do so either after some delay,on receiving further public assurances from Russia that the goods were intended for internal consumption, or we could do so at onceas a friendly act to the Chinese Government. His own suggestion was that the ship should be released at once, but that we should approach the Chinese Government with a view to securing from them, in return for this release, an arrangement under which (a) they disclosed to us the terms of the barter agreementbetween themselves and Russia, under which they received military supplies in return for certain rawmaterials (including the present consignment); and(&amp;) they undertook to ration supplies of wolfram to Russia ata level of, say, 350 to 400 tons a month.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he agreed with the line of action proposed by the Minister for economic warfare. Pie was influenced by the position of China in thismatter. He was, however, reluctant to base any action on assurancesreceived from Russia. He agreed that the cargo should be released especially as in all probability it was intended for consumption in Russia as a favour to China. For the future, the Minister for economic Warfare and himself should examine the principles onwhich our policy with regard to Chinese exports to Russia shouldbe based. He agreed that we should attempt to secure an agreementwith China, based on information supplied by her as to her barteragreement with Russia, to ration her exports of certain raw
materials to Russia. Such an agreement would have to be a unilateral agreement between ourselves and China, to which russia would not be party.The War Cabinet agreed (a) To authorise the release of the Soviet ship Selenga as an act of favour to the Chinese Government.(b) That the Chinese Government should be informed that, in agreeing to the release of this cargo, we had in mind thatthey should come to an arrangement with us to regulateChinese exports of certain raw materials to Russia.(c) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theMinister for Economic Warfare to examine theprinciples on which the arrangement referred to in (b)should be based.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 26thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Secretary of State for Air said that a considerablenumber of attacks had been carried out on East Coast shipping onthe previous day, in which a total of possibly 15 enemy aircraft hadbeen engaged. Enemy aircraft had also operated in the Shetlandsarea. Twelve enemy aircraft had attacked a convoy without result;and a total of 15 other merchant vessels had been engaged by theenemy, by bombs or machine guns.The steamship Manela, the R.A.F. flying-boat depot ship in the shetlands, had been attacked by 4 aircraft. Only slight damage byconcussion had been caused.Despite the bad aerodrome conditions, a total of 99 fighter-aircraft had been sent up. Three of the enemy aircraft had been engaged, but with inconclusive results. Conditions for our fighters had been extremely bad.   All our aircraft had returned safely.Anti-aircraft guns had been in action in the Newcastle andBlyth areas.There was an interesting report of a duel between one of ourHudson aircraft and a Messerschmitt 110 of the latest type. TheHudson appeared to have had the better of the engagement and had obtained some hits on the Messerschmitt.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 26thConclusions,Minute 3.)Air attacks on shipping.6. The First Lord of the A dmiralty gave the War Cabinetdetails of the attacks on merchant shipping referred to in the fore-going Minute.A summary of the attacks is as follows : -(ft) Two attacks on a convoy.  No damage.(b) Two light vessels attacked.    One badly damaged -crew(c) H.M.S. Coventry attacked at Sollum Voe.(a) Fourteen British merchant vessels attacked.(/)Futher attacks on trade were as follows :-January 27.Danish s.s. Fredensborg (2,094 tons),the Orkneys.   Crew probably 20.January 28.S.S. FjSton (1,487 tons). Missing, presumed sunk as oneof her boats and a body had been washed ashore.No damage.One slightly damaged, two badly damaged.One Latvian ship set on fire and abandoned.One French ship attacked.   No particulars of damaged.Sunk south-east ofNo news of survivors.
The MilitarySituation.Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 26thConclusions,Minute 4.)Finland.7. The Secretary of State for War said that one Germandivision was reported to have arrived in the West from Poland.One division was believed to have moved from the Aachen area to the Eifel area. As a result of these changes, the number of divisions in the West was increased by one to 100, and the number in the East reduced by one to 38.The Russians had continued their attacks North of lake ladoga, but without success. Attempts on the 26th January to cross the ice South of Kitela had met with heavy loss.Elsewhere there was nothing to report.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Finland.Intercessionservice inSt. Paul&apos; cathedral.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad received a letter from Lord Phillimore, written on behalf ofLord Plymouth as Chairman of the Finnish Fund, inquiringwhether the War Cabinet would be represented at the special Inter-cession Service to be held in St. Pauks Cathedral on Thursday,the 1st February, 1940, at 2 p.m. The Archbishop of Canterburywould take part in the service.The War Cabinet :-(a) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should inform Lord Phillimore that the War cabinet would be represented at the Intercession Service for Finland at St. Pauks Cathedral.[20747] cJanuary 29.Dutch sis. Nora (298 tons). Damaged by mine while atanchor off Deal.   Beached.Convoys on the East Coast had been delayed owing to the weather.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that air attacks of the type which the Germans had carried out on the previous day would,if continued, affect the morale of our merchant crews. While, there-fore, the weather made conditions so difficult for our fighters, itmight be advisable to return to the convoy system on the East Coastin spite of the delays which this would inevitably cause.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence emphasised thefeeling of security which convoy gave to merchant shipping.The Lord Privy Seal emphasised the desirability of consulting the Minister of Shipping in connection with any decision tore-establish convoy.Coal supplies. There was some discussion as to whether the reintroduction of convoys would have a serious effect on the already unsatisfactoryposition as regards coal supplies in the South of England. It waspointed out that the shortage of coal was due fundamentally to theshortage of and delays to shipping, accentuated by the long spellof bad weather.The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the above statement.(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for Air, in consultation with the Minister ofShipping, to examine whether convoys should be re-intro-duced for East Coast shipping while conditions con-tinued favourable to enemy air attack.
(b) Took note that the Foreign Secretary proposed himself toattend the service.(c) Invited any other member of the War Cabinet who proposedto be present to inform the Secretary of the War Cabinetaccordingly.The Far Bast.Relations with japan: case ofthe s.s.Asama Maru.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 26thConclusions,Minute 8.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following further developments in regard to the case of thesteamship Asama Maru: (i) The Japanese Ambassador in London (who did not speakEnglish very well) had apparently given the JapaneseGovernment the impression that we might be preparedto hand back all the twenty-one men whom we hadremoved from the steamship A sama Maru. This seemedto be clue to a, genuine misunderstanding on the part ofthe Japanese Ambassador as to what he (the foreign secretary) had said at their first interview on the subject.He (the Secretary of State) proposed, therefore, tosee the Japanese Ambassador that afternoon and to correct any misunderstanding. He proposed also to takethe line that any suggestion from the Japanese side thatwe should now return all the twenty-one men in question would create a position of extreme difficulty. He wouldtelegraph to Sir Robert Craigie in the same sense.(ii) In telegram Mo. .159,  dated  the 29th January,  1940,Sir Robert Craigie argued the question whether in thelast resort we should be prepared to return all the twenty-one men. Consideration of this question couldbe deferred, since Sir Robert Craigie could for thepresent hold the position on the basis of his presentinstructions. In the same telegram Sir Robert Craigiehad expressed the view that the Japanese government might be able to obtain from the German government an undertaking that, if these men were allowed to returnto Germany, they would not be used for any purposeconnected with the prosecution of the war; and, whileadmitting that little reliance could be placed on any undertaking by the German Government, Sir Robertasked what answer he should make if such a proposal were put to him by the Japanese Government. TheSecretary of State thought that Sir Robert Craigieshould be told that, if he found it impossible to securethe agreement of the Japanese Government to either ofthe alternatives set out in the instructions alreadyconveyed to him, we should be prepared, as a third best,to return all the twenty-one men to the Japanese Govern-ment on receiving from the latter an undertaking thatthey would be held in Japan, or that, if they were permitted to return to Germany, the German Govern-ment should first give an undertaking that they shouldnot be permitted to take any part in the war.The Prime Minister thought that, if consideration was to begiven to such a proposal, we should try to make the JapaneseGovernment accept responsibility for the due discharge by theGerman Government of any undertaking so given. This was thesuggestion which had been made by Sir Robert Craigie in his telegram No. 163 of the 29th January, 1940. Personally, he doubted whether, in dealing with an oriental people like theJapanese, it was necessary, or even wise, at this stage to give our ambassador particulars of this third alternative until the first twohad been fully explored.3)
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theJapanese Diet reassembled on the 1st February, and that it was desirable to make some progress before the Diet met. What he hadin mind was merely to give Sir Robert Craigie a general indication of the possible courses of action which in certain circumstances theWar Cabinet might be prepared to consider.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the meeting of theJapanese Diet, he agreed that a communication should be sent toSir Robert Craigie on the lines suggested.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention tothe suggestion contained in the latter part of telegram No. 159 that,as part of an eventual settlement. Sir Robert Craigie might beauthorised to convey a general message of goodwill from the PrimeMinister to Admiral Yonai, the Japanese Prime Minister.Alternatively, perhaps the First Lord of the Admiralty might send a similar message to the Japanese Minister of Marine.The Prime Minister thought that the question of sending sucha message did not arise at this juncture. He enquired whether,having regard to the Secretary of State&apos;s intention to inform theJapanese Ambassador that he had been unduly optimistic in thereport which he had made to the Japanese Government, it was stilldesired that he (the Prime Minister) should include in the speech which he was to make on the following day a conciliatory referenceto Japan on. the lines of the draft which the Secretary of State had communicated to him.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that therewas no need to consider further the suggestion of the despatch to japan of a conciliatory message, but he hoped that the PrimeMinister&apos; would include in his speech a friendly reference to japan on the lines which he had suggested. It would be very valuable if,as soon as the Prime Minister had decided on the terms of this reference, the exact text could be communicated to him (theSecretary of State) for transmission to Sir Robert Craigie for his information.The War Cabinet agreed -(a) that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should address a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Tokyo-(i) informing him of the communication which he (theSecretary of State) proposed to make to theJapanese Ambassador to correct the undulyoptimistic report which he (the Ambassador) had sent to the Japanese Government regarding the eventual possibility of our handing back to the mall the twenty-one Germans - taken from thesteamship Asama Maru;(ii) indicating in general terms the possibility that, asa last resort, and in order not to lose a generalagreement with the Japanese Government con-cerning the future treatment of Germansapplying for passages in Japanese ships, the WarCabinet might be prepared to consider handingback the Germans in question in return for anundertaking from the Japanese Governmenteither (i) to intern the men in question in Japan,or (ii) that, if the men were allowed to return toGermany, the Japanese Government would firstobtain from the German Government an under-taking that they would not be used for any purpose connected with the prosecution of the
war, and, secondly, that the Japanese Governmentwould make themselves responsible for ensuring the due observance by the German Government ofthe undertaking so given;(b) that the Prime Minister should include in a speech on the31st January, 1940, a conciliatory reference to Japan as previously proposed; and that, as soon as the PrimeMinister had settled the text of the statement which he proposed to make in this connection, the text should be telegraphed to Sir Robert Craigie for his information and guidance.U.S.S.R. 10.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, according toIssue of warning a report received from a confidential source, the Soviet Governmentto Soviet had issued orders to all merchant ships flying the Soviet flag to merchant ships, return home or to take refuge in neutral ports by a certain date.   Ifconfirmed, this report might not be without significance.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,January 30, 1940.
