The Air 1; : The Secretary of State for Air said that a Hudson aircraftSituation.&apos;- 0n patrol over the North Sea had been in action with a German(Previous bomber.  Hits had been observed on the bomber and it was thoughtReference: to have been damaged. Our aircraft had returned safely. StandingW.M. (40) .8th patrols of fighters had been maintained oft&apos; the East Coast for theConclusions, protection of our unconvoyed shipping, which had not yet been&quot;Minute 2.)        diverted to night movement.Bomber Command had carried out a sweep towards theSkagger Rak. A total, of 25 bombers had been employed. Oneformation comprising 12 Blenheims had been attacked by5 Messerschmitt longe-range fighters while on its outward journey.A combat, lasting 25.minutes, had ensued, during which one of our aircraft had been shot down. One Messerschmitt had been shot down and two others were thought to have been hit and damaged.A report from Denmark indicated the probability that one of thesedamaged aircraft had been forced to land in neutral territory, the crew being interned. After the German aircraft had broken off theaction, the bomber formation continued its sweep a further 130 miles to the north-eastwards.In reply to a question, the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said-    that the Messerschmitt 110 was a long-range fighter comparable inendurance to our Blenheim fighters, but with considerably greaterrange than our eight-gun fighters.   The Messerschmitt 110 was heavily armed, carrying six -5 machine guns and two cannons.The Prime Minister said that our aircraft appeared to havedone very well against such powerful opponents and to have foughta most skilful action.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air said that night-flying operations against the German seaplane bases had been commenced, but had been cancelled later on account of bad weather.Two Blenheim aircraft of the Air Component of the field force had carried out a successful reconnaissance of the SiegfriedLine on the previous day. No resistance had been encountered andno enemy activity of particular note had been observed.Reference was made to accounts which had appeared in the morning&apos;s Press of an air attack on Sylt. The Secretary of Statefor Air said that no attacks, such as was referred to in the Press,had in fact been carried out. These accounts might be a con-sidefably exaggerated version of the offensive patrol carried out theprevious night. He would consider the issue of a denial of thereports which had appeared in the Press.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40)Conclusion.minute 3.)8th2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the&apos; armed merchant cruiser Canton (15,000 tons) had been seriously damagedas a result of grounding. The ship had been refloated, but was onlyable to make 4 knots proceeding stern first. Her present position was to the westward of the Hebrides. Vessels had been sent to stand by her.The submarine Seahorse was 48 hours overdue from her patrolof Horns&apos; Reef.Further details had been received of the two attacks on U-boatsreported at the previous meeting of the War Cabinet. One of these was now thought to be a certain success and the other might very well be successful. The S.S. Sequacity (870 tons) had been bombed and machine gunned by German aircraft on the previous daywithout result.The S.S. Upminster (1,000 tons) had also been attacked by aircraft and had been sunk.[20832]b 2
(previous reference:W.M. (40) 7thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Chief of Naval Staff recalled that he had undertaken (atthe meeting referred to in the margin) to investigate a report from lord Riverdale, from which it had appeared some of our own mineswhich had broken adrift from the Dover Barrage had not been rendered safe. The mines in question were probably British. Ourmines, after breaking adrift, could not be detonated by contact witha ship; but they were likely to detonate on being hit by rifle ormachine-gun bullets fired with the object of sinking them.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 8tbConclusions,Minute 4.)The Balkans,Italo-Hungari andiscussions.3. The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatthere was nothing to report on the Western Front, or in Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 8thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto the following telegrams dated 9th January, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, as to the recent discussions betweenCount Ciano and Count Csaky, the Hungarian Minister for ForeignAffairs : Telegram No. 30, reporting that Count Ciano had givenin the strictest personal confidence information regarding his conversations in Venice with the Hungarian Minister forForeign Affairs. The main point in this conversation was asfollows : Count Ciano had obtained from Count Csaky anundertaking that, if Roumania was attacked by theU.S.S.R. and resisted, Hungary would maintain an attitude towards Roumania of benevolent neutrality.Count Ciano had admitted to Count Csaky that, havingregard to the present state of public opinion in Hungary,no Hungarian Government could formally renounceHungarian claims on Transylvania. He had, however,asked the Hungarian Government to view this question from a broad European point of view to which Hungaryhad duties. Count Csaky had g iven Count Ciano theundertaking asked for, it being understood, however, that,if Roumania were to surrender Bessarabia to the TJ.S.S.R.without fighting, or if she were to surrender the Dobrudjato Bulgaria without fighting, or if she started killingHungarians in Transylvania, Hungary Would be entitledto resume her freedom of action.Telegram No. 31, in which Sir Percy Loraine reported that count Csaky had explained to Count Ciano that it wasnecessary for him now and then to shout loudly aboutHungarian ambitions otherwise he would lose the leadership ofHungarian national opinion.Sir Percy Loraine had asked Count Ciano whether CountCsaky was fully supported by Count Teleki. Count Ciano hadanswered &quot; Yes,&quot; but that both Count Teleki and the Regentwere more moderate than Count Csaky.Sir Percy Loraine had reported also that &quot;in the course of a conversation with Count Ciano he had inquired whether the latter had in mind to pursue the suggestions thrown out in the letter which he (the Secretary of State) had sent him last November.Count Ciano had replied that he had not thought that a reply tothat letter had been expected.   Sir Percy Loraine then said that
he intended no reproaches on this subject, but that, while count ciano had been telling him of his conversation with Count Csaky,he (Sir Percy Loraine) had been struck by the similarity of interestsof Italy and Great Britain in desiring to prevent the extensionof the war to south-eastern Europe. Was the time ripe for an exchange of views on this subject ? Count Ciano had repliedthat he realised the community of interest between the two countriesin this matter, but that Signor Mussolini was not ready to enterinto discussion on this subject. Count Ciano had added &quot; Not yet,but perhaps little by little he had left the sentenceunfinished. All this showed, in Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s opinion, howexceedingly delicate the subject still was. Signor Mussolini&apos;s axispolicy might be dragging at its anchor, but it was not yet adrift.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a state-ment on the subject of Scandinavia. Particulars of this statement and of the ensuing discussion are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had beenQuestion of approached the previous evening by the Governor of the Bank offinancial aid. England, who was much stirred by the plight of Finland. He had explained that until recently Finland had had substantial standingcredits in London in connection with her export trade to thiscountry, but that the finance houses had now called in these credits,thereby adding to the great strain imposed on the Central Bank off inland by the war. If the Government offered no objection, theGovernor was confident that the Bank of England would be readyto make advances to the Central Bank of Finland of between  ^ and&amp;\ million without security. This transaction could not be justified on commercial grounds, and the Governor had asked whether HisMajesty&apos;s Government (1) would approve such action on the partof the Bank, and (2) would use their best offices later in assisting the Bank to recover the loan. He did not ask for any writtenassurance on the latter point, but merely wished to know the general attitude of the Government. He (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)had given provisionally affirmative answers to both questions posedby the Governor.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, for his part, he would welcome action to help Finland such as that suggestedby the Governor of the Bank of England.The Prime Minister said that assistance of this kind would be popular, and certainly went no farther than the terms of the speech which he had made at the Mansion House when he had stressed thatour acceptance of the resolution adopted at Geneva was no mereformality.  He was entirely in favour of the action proposed.The War Cabinet: Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform theGovernor of the Bank of England that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would welcome a decision by the Bank ofEngland to give a credit of between  ^ and  ^ million tothe Central Bank of Finland, and that in due course theywould be prepared to use their best offices in assisting theBank to recover the loan.Scandinavia.(previous reference:W.M, (40) 8thConclusions,Minute 1.)Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 11, 1940.
