377W.M. 48 (40)r.The Aii-Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that air activity in theprevious 24 hours had been curtailed by bad weather. During theprevious night, however, 20 Wellington bombers had carried out as weep to locate and attack the German Naval units reported offHeligoland. While the Wellingtons were still in the air, weather conditions in England had deteriorated, and the aerodromes fromwhich the aircraft had started had become fog-bound. The aircraft were therefore recalled soon after 1 a.m. Nineteen aircraft had landed, but one was still unaccounted for. Two of the Wellingtonshad crashed on landing, one man being slightly injured. Frompreliminary reports from the aircraft, it had been ascertained that two enemy warships, one thought to be a destroyer, had been attacked. It was reported that bombs had fallen close to one ofthese ships, but no hits had been claimed. One of the Wellingtonshad been attacked by three German fighters, one of which was believed to have been damaged.Enemy aircraft had attacked six vessels off the East coast onthe previous day. From North Yorkshire, southward, all our fighteraerodromes had been fog-bound, but a fighter patrol had been main-tained over the North and Southbound convoys between Berwickand Newcastle.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions,Minute 3.)Attacks on shipping.2. The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that H.M. SubmarineL. 23 had sighted a German cruiser and two destroyers at 1-5 a.m.on the previous day in a position 80 miles North of Heligoland.L. 23 had been attacked with depth charges and her fuel tanks hadbeen damaged. The attack had prevented her from reporting until5 p.m, and she was now returning to her base on the surface. it seemed probable that these German ships were part of the forcereported by H.M. Submarine Salmon at 8-10 a.m. on the previous day.In the air attacks on our shipping to which the Secretary ofState for Air had referred, the anti-submarine trawler Fifeshirehad been sunk, only one survivor of a crew of about 15 had beenpicked up. The mine-sweeping trawler .Solon had been hit by twoincendiary bombs and machine-gunned. Three of the crew hadbeen wounded, but the trawler had r-eturned safely to harbour.Three other trawlers had been attacked, with unknown results.The Dutch S.S. Tara (4,760 tons) had been torpedoed 60 miles south-west of Finisterre.The tug towing the S.S. Imperial Transport had parted herlast remaining tow and her towing gear was out of action. A fleettug was being despatched to assist.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions,Minute 4.)Western Front.Finland.3. The Secretary of Slate for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.The fighting in the Karelian Isthmus was dying down andconfirmation had been received from French sources that the Finnshad effected a withdrawal from certain positions without Russianinterference. North of Lake Ladoga the Finns had surrounded a soviet Division, thought to be the 168th, but reported in the Press
as the 164th. Both these Divisions were located in the same area.The Finns also had a firm grip on the 54th Soviet Division.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Imperial General Staffthought that it was unlikely that any substantial quantities ofammunition would have fallen into Finnish hands with thecaptured guns. With regard to the general situation, he felt thatthe Finns were in no immediate danger of collapse. It would takethe Russians a considerable time to mount a new attack.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that this view was also held by the Finnish Minister, whom he had seen theprevious day and who had informed him that the Finns had merelyretired to stronger positions and were in no danger of collapse fora number of weeks at least, although the urgent need for help still remained.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.Assistance to finland.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 46thConclusions,Minute 5.)Procedure fordealing withrequests fromFinnishGovernment.Governingprinciples.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, inconnection with his conversation with the Finnish Minister (see minute 3), it had occurred to him that some action might be takento co-ordinate the requests for assistance which were received fromthe Finnish Government, and our information in regard to theposition as to material already sent, &amp;c, with a view to the avoidance of delay in reaching decisions on such requests. It had occurred to  him that time might be saved if the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence were asked to take day-to-day charge of this matter,referring to the War Cabinet as he might find it necessary.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Finnish minister had himself probably been responsible for delays in certain casesby making requests to relatively junior officers in the Air Ministry,for example, instead of direct to the Secretary of State. A stagehad, however, now been reached where it was necessary that everyfurther important demand for help should be considered by theWar Cabinet.It was hoped that we should now be receiving fuller informationas to the actual position in Finland; and it was felt that it wouldbe very useful if the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence wouldcollect and collate this information, together with information asto Finnish demands and the extent to which they were being met from time to time, so that the War Cabinet might have a clearpicture of the whole position before them when decisions had tobe taken. The Service Ministers expressed their willingness tofurnish the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence with informationdaily.The Prime Minister suggested that it would also be very valuable to arrange for closer contact Avith the French, so that we might know more precisely what action they were taking, in thematter.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that thegeneral principles which should govern our assistance to Finlandought to be more precisely defined. Were we, for example, to give them only such equipment as we ourselves could spare without much difficulty? Or were we going to proceed on the assumption thatthey were in fact fighting our battle, and give them a degree ofassistance which involved our taking appreciable risks elsewhere ?Perhaps the first step might be for the Chiefs of Staff to be askedto express a view as to the importance which, from the military point of view, should be attached to a continuance of finnish resistance.
379 W.M.48(40).The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chiefs of Staff hid     23given some preliminary consideration to this problem.   The broadquestion at issue was whether assistance to Finland was, or wasnot, a profitable detachment.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that whenthe ice melted in the Gulf of Bothnia (i.e., about the end of April),the Germans could, if they so desired, step in and finish off thebusiness. In that event all equipment that we had sent to the finns would be irretrievably cut off.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that the considera-tions involved in determining the degree of assistance which shouldbe given to Finland were of a general, and not a tedhnical character ;although the War Cabinet might, of course, desire to ask the Chiefsof Staff for advice from time to time on particular matters, suchas that which had been mentioned by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.There was general agreement with this view.The Minister without Portfolio said that, according to his information, the Germans already were so short of oil that it was doubtful whether they could carry out sustained offensive operations on the Western Front (i.e., on Great Britain and France) throughoutthe summer, and that they were bound to rely on getting oil supplies from Russia. In these circumstances, the continuance of finnish resistance was clearly of the greatest advantage to us, since it involved considerable disorganisation in Russia, and would prevent them from supplying oil to Germany. He added that, although we and the French might be unable to spare the Finns much moreequipment, it was quite possible that the Italians, who were extremely anti-Soviet, might be willing to do so, if we paid for it.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the principles which governed the extent of our assistance to Finland must be determined from time totime by the War Cabinet.(2) Invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence to keep a watch on the whole question of Allied assistance to finland, and to arrange for the collation of informationshowing the position at any given moment, reporting tothe Military Co-ordination Committee or to the WarCabinet, as necessary.(3) Invited the Service Ministers to arrange for information to be furnished daily to the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence as to the position in Finland and as to thevarious items which were being supplied or had beenasked for from their Departments. arrangements should also be made for information as to supplies whichthe French Government had sent, or were proposing tosend, to be furnished to the Minister through the allied military Committee.Scandinavia.Stoppage oftraffic in norwegian territorial waters.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theFrench Ambassador had told him that the French Governmentthoroughly approved of our action in the matter of the Altmark, butthat they hoped we should be able to use this incident in order togo further and to find reasons for taking the line that Norway wasno longer entitled to claim that her territorial waters wereinviolable. He (the Foreign Secretary) thought that, as soon as we knew the attitude of the United States and Italy, we should decide on our future action. Two questions were involved. The first was as follows : should we say to the Norwegian Government that,having regard to their attitude in the Altmark case, to the manner
in which they had taken our protest in January, and to our knowledge of the flow of German munitions to Murmansk, we must ask them to take effective measures to stop the abuse of theirterritorial waters on the understanding that otherwise we shouldtake the necessary measures ourselves; or should we, after pointing out how unsatisfactory the Norwegian attitude had been, proceed totake action ourselves straight away %The second question was whether we should take the line that,in view of the consistent German abuse of territorial waters, wecould no longer regard any of the territorial waters in the north sea as inviolable.On the first question, the view was generally expressed that, ifwe invited the Norwegian Government to take steps to stop theabuse of their territorial waters, we should probably land ourselves in an unsatisfactory argument with them. The Norwegian Govern-ment were not in a position to take effective steps to protect their neutrality. It was felt that, subject to any further information which might be obtained as to neutral opinion, the right coursewould be that our communication to the Norwegian Governmentshould end with a statement that we were not prepared to acceptthe present position. This would clearly be a prelude to action onour part.As regards the second question, it was felt better to confineaction to Norwegian territorial waters.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadbeen informed on the previous day by the Finnish Minister that itwas believed that considerable supplies of war material were being.sent from Germany, through Norwegian waters, to the russian forces in North Finland. They were apprehensive that the russian forces in this region might become more active and have a. seriousinfluence on the situation in Finland. M. Gripenberg had promised to obtain fuller information on the subject.It was agreed that this matter was one which the finnish government should be asked to follow up. It would clearlystrengthen our case in the Scandinavian countries if the finnish government made representations on this subject to the norwegian government.Discussion then turned on the legal aspect of the case, and inparticular on the doctrine of &quot;Innocent Passage&quot; of warshipsthrough territorial waters.The Prime Minister alluded to a passage which had appeared in The Times of that morning quoting the International law governing the conduct of belligerents with regard to neutral terri-torial waters, set out as follows in Article 12 of The hague convention No. XIII of 1907 --&quot; In the absence of special provisions to the contrary inthe legislation of a neutral Power, belligerent warships are not permitted to remain in the ports, roadsteads or territorial waters of the said Power for more than 24 hours.&quot;The Norwegian case was based on their recognition of the status of the A it mark as a warship an admission, moreover, towardswhich the Germans were also inclining and they were insistingthat the fullest rights should be preserved for the passage of war-ships through Norwegian territorial waters. On this basis the norwegians were, as The Times pointed out, on very weak ground in arguing that our warships should have immediately retii-ed fromtheir territorial waters at a time when they were aware that theAltmark had been in those waters for at least forty-eight hours.Had he been aware of this legal point when he had made his speech in the House of Commons the previous day, it would have enabledhim considerably to strengthen the protest contained in the con-cluding passage of his speech.  He suggested that his speech should
now be followed up by a broad statement of our position to theNorwegian Government, setting out our grievances about the mannerin which they had allowed their territorial waters to be abused.This would serve to place our case before the world, and to educatepublic opinion, not only in this country but also in the Dominionsand in neutral countries, and so prepare them for such future action as we might think fit to take.General agreement was expressed with this course of action.The following were the main points which were made in thediscussion which ensued : (i) The communication to the Norwegian Government shouldbe a State Document which would be given wide publicity.(ii) The statement should be on broad lines and avoid dealingin detail with the doctrine of Innocent P Themain argument on this aspect of the case should be a clear contrast between a recognition of the right of abelligerent to complain if a Neutral should deny himInnocent Passage in circumstances in which that passagewas necessary and obviously innocent; and the abuse ofthat doctrine to which the Norwegians had been partiesby allowing their long stretch of territorial waters tobe used  is  1 shield by the Germans.(iii) The main body of the statement should be a historicalrecital of the manner in which the Norwegians hadpermitted this abuse, drawing attention to the fact that german munition ships had used Norwegian territorial waters to carry arms to the Russians at Petsamo foruse against the Finns.(iv) The statement should conclude by showing that, whilstwe had done everything possible to refrain from theviolation of Norwegian territorial waters, their con-tinued violation and abuse had created a situation whichwas intolerable and which we were not prepared toaccept. The Statement should not invite suggestionsfrom the Norwegian Government as to how they mightrectify matters, but should so conclude as to leave itopen to us to take, within a few days, whatever action we might wish.(v) It was desirable that the Statement should be connectedwith the Alt-mark incident in point of time, and itshould therefore be produced with the least possible delay.The War Cabinet :-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, to prepare a draft statement on the lines discussed above for circulation,if possible, on the following day, for consideration bythe War Cabinet on Friday, the 23rd February.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs tosend a telegram forthwith to Dominion Governmentsinforming them of the general lines of the action whichwe had it in mind to take, and that we were preparing afull statement setting out our position, which would becommunicated to them as soon as possible.i(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take such steps as he might consider possible to persuade the Finnish Government to protest to the norwegian government regarding the abuse which had been madeof Norwegian Territorial Waters for the passage ofGerman ships carrying arms and munitions to theRussians.
Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions,Minute 5.)Middle East.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)Role ofAustralianforces.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 94thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The War Cabinet took note of a Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Committee (W.P. (40) 63).A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.7. The War Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (W.P. (40) 57) containing a draft replyto a telegram which the High Commissioner had received from thePrime Minister of Australia asking for an appreciation of themilitary situation in the Middle and Near East, and for information regarding the role of the Australian Forces in that area.The War Cabinet :-(i) Approved the draft reply to the Prime Minister ofAustralia contained in W.P. (40) 57.(ii) Requested the Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to consult as to whetherthe telegram should be despatched through the HighCommissioner or should be sent from the Prime Ministerto Mr. Menzies.Roumania.Oil policy,supply of equipment andraw materials.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 47thConclusions,Minute S.)8. The Minister without Portfolio recalled that he had been authorised by the War Cabinet, at their previous meeting, to reach a decision, in consultation with the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence and the other Ministers concerned, on the question of thelifting of the embargo on exports to Roumania which had beenin force since the unsatisfactory position over Roumania&apos;s oil exportsto Germany had come to light.At a meeting held on the previous evening, it had been agreedthat the embargo on exports to Roumania should now be lifted, andthe necessary instructions had been issued.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Visit of theSecretary ofState forDominionAffairs to egypt.Australian andNew Zealandcontingents.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)9. At the request of the Prime Minister, the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs gave to the War Cabinet a short account ofhis recent visit to Egypt when he had welcomed the arrival of theAustralian and New Zealand contingents.The Secretary of State for the Dominions said that the arrival of these troops had produced a great effect in the Middle East. Ithad also impressed the Diplomatic Corps in Egypt. The move hadbeen carried out with great smoothness and efficiency. The forceconsisted of some 6,600 Australians and some 6,800 New Zealanders.Two further contingents from each Dominion, of similar size, were still to come. The New Zealanders were located near Cairo and the australians in Palestine. He (the Secretary of State) thought atfirst that there might be some feeling about this, but he had found,that the Australians preferred to be in Palestine, and he had beenasked to thank the War Office and the General Officer Commanding,Middle East, for the excellence of the arrangements that had beenmade. Everything had been done to facilitate the moving in of thetroops, who were of magnificent physique. They were smarter thanthe Australian and New Zealand troops had been in the Great War,and he thought that they wished to remove the impression made in1914-18 that they could fight but not drill. The Secretary of Stateadded that he did not think it would be wise to leave the Australiansin camp in Palestine too long, as there was nothing for them to dothere but train and they were anxious to fight.
-Situation inEgypt.Malta:Australiandestroyers.The Secretary of State for the Dominions, continuing, said thatthe bulk of opinion in Egypt was on the Allied side. Egypt was nowsatisfied that we could defend her. The state of the Egyptian army was perhaps better than might be expected, but matters in regardto the air position were not quite so satisfactory. Sir miles lampson and General Wavell considered the forces in the Sudanwere not strong enough. He wondered if South African troops could be sent there in order to maintain the general confidence of the egyptians ?The Secretary of State for War said that he would be willingto consider this suggestion.The Secretary of State for the Dominions, continuing, said thatthe Egyptian Press was very friendly, as was the local Italian Press.The Egyptians were, however, depressed by the publication of our shipping losses, which were presented in a form which combed awrong impression.The Secretary of State added that on the way home he had called at Malta and found everyone there in good heart. The naval commander-in-Chief had reported warmly regarding the efficiency of the crews of the five Australian destroyers which, were based at malta.The Prime Minister thanked the Secretary of State for his statement and congratulated him on the success of his mission.The War Cabinet-(1) Took note of the above statement.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for War would consider the possibility of the garrison in the Sudanbeing reinforced by the despatch of troops from SouthAfrica.War Cabinet 10.   The Prime Minister said that the Meeting of the War-Arrangements.    Cabinet on Thursday,  the 22nd  February,  would be held  at10-30 a.m.He thought that it would not be possible to conclude thebusiness of the War Cabinet on Friday morning before the ceremonyin connection with the parade by Officers and men of H.M. ShipsExeter and A fax on the Horse Guards Parade. He therefore proposed that the Meeting of the War Cabinet on Friday should beheld at 3-30 f.m.The War Cabinet took note of these arrangements.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 21, 1940.
