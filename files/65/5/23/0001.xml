Wages and prices.The possibilityof stabilisingthe prices ofstaplecommodities.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 21stConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy dealing with the possi-bility of stabilising the prices of staple commodities as part of theGovernments policy in relation to wages and prices (W.P. (G)(40)18). &apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the question for decision was whether the Government should employ public funds,and, if so, to what extent, in order to keep down the retail pricesof the most essential commodities entering into the cost of living.In reaching a decision regard must be paid to the following : (i) The expenditure of public funds on keeping down the costof living was bound to effect our financial position inview of the large sums involved.   This might be veryserious, since it would be difficult to cover by taxation and borrowing even&apos; the existing demands on the budget in the next financial year.  Any gap which could not be covered would introduce an element of inflation,(ii) The possibility of keeping down the cost of living wasintimately connected with the demands made by labour for wages advances.   At the present time labour, when asked to assist in preventing wages increases, were inclined to reply by saying that the Government should themselves take steps to keep down prices.The Government had already incurred substantial expenditure(amounting approximately to  1,000,000 a week) on keeping down the cost of certain essential foodstuffs.   Hitherto this had not beenmade public, but it could not, and indeed should not, be concealedmuch longer.That figure was, however, in no sense a measure of the totalcost to the Exchequer of continuing a policy of this character(paragraph 5 of the Committee&apos;s Report). It would be very dangerous for the Government to make a public declaration of their intention of maintaining the cost of living at its present figure foran indefinite period. In so far as the Ministry of Food had madedefinite contracts for purchases for a substantial period ahead, itwas possible to form some judgment of future trends. Arrange-ments of this kind had been made in regard to a number of essential foodstuffs, but not in the case of cereals, which constituted the mainrisk. Since last September the rise in the wholesale prices of cerealshad been double that of other commodities. He (the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer) had been pressed by Mr. Crerar to make a definitebargain for Canadian wheat, but had refused to do so on the termsthen suggested ($1 a bushel for two years).The Minister of Food said that in the negotiations withMr. Crerar we had offered 85 cents, and he in the end had come downas far as 93 cents, as compared with his original demand of 115 to120 cents. Notwithstanding the failure of these negotiations,substantial purchases had recently been made on the market at86 cents.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to paragraph of the Report, which set out the principal elements in the cost-of-living index. The basis of that index required revision, but it wassacrosanct in the eyes of Labour and could not be modified in timeof war. The Committee had, however, arranged for the establish-ment of a parallel index giving the war cost of living, which would pay regard to changes both in quantity and quality resulting fromthe war. Rent, including rates, was already controlled (16 percent.), and, if food (60 per cent.) were kept substantially at itspresent price level, we should have gone a long way towards keeping the cost-of-living index steady. This would be still further assuredif clothing (12 per cent.) could also be prevented from rising in cost.This latter question, which raised the problem of standard clothing,[20722]b 2
was at present being examined by the Interdepartmental Committeeon Economic Policy. It would be seen, therefore, that, other thingsbeing equal, it would be possible for the Government, at the cost ofthe Exchequer, to secure for a time a fairly close approach tostabilisation of the cost of living as reflected in the cost-of-living index.It had been pointed out in the discussions in the Committeethat we were getting no advantage, in the form of a definite bargainwith Labour, from the substantial expenditure now being incurred on subsidies, though no doubt indirect advantages were secured asa result of the situation created by a steady cost of living. He was advised and he fully concurred that it was not possible to enterinto any definite bargain, with Labour that wages should not go upif the cost of living were kept steady. Trade Union leaders werenot in a position to bind their members on a question of this kind;moreover, there were other reasons, apart from the cost of living,why in war time some wages might rise, e.g., owing to scarcity of skilled labour in (for example) the munitions industries. The factthat no bargain with labour was practicable was, however, no reason why the Government should not try to stabilise the cost of living.The Report of the Committee pointed out (paragraph 14) that therewere three courses open to the Government :-(i) The Government might abandon the present policy and arrange for food prices to be raised by stages until thewhole or the main part of the Exchequer loss wascancelled. The Committee were definitely opposed toadopting such a course, and he (the Chancellor of theExchequer) was willing to continue the subsidiesat their present rate for a further period. Therewas, he felt, a great advantage to the Govern-ment in so doing, since, in view of the very large part played by wages in determining the cost of the immense contracts of all kinds which the Governmentwas placing in this country, e.g., if wages were allowedto rise too far, the cost of those contracts would be morethan proportionately increased,(ii) The Government might for a time at least continue theirpresent policy and even extend it, e.g., into the field of clothing, but without attempting to secure any under-standing from organised Labour in return. This wasthe course which he and the other members of theCommittee were disposed to favour,(iii) Finally, the Government might continue and extend theirpolicy in return for a general understanding withorganised Labour that they, as a movement, while notstanding in the way of applications for wage increases of a reasonable character from industries which had notyet received advances during the recent wage cycle, woulddiscountenance or discourage any further pressure for wage increases beyond that point. This alternativeoffered certain attractions but, as he had already explained, he did not believe that any such understanding with Labour could be reached. If a proposal on theselines were put to Labour and rejected by them, theeffect would be far worse than if the Government wereto have made no attempt to secure such an agreement.It should be remembered also that, even if such anagreement were reached for a fixed period, the cost of buying supplies from abroad might, in the meanwhile,rise so seriously that the arrangement could not becontinued. In that event, the jump in the cost of livingmight be so&quot; considerable, even if the full shock were removed by the continuance of subsidies at varying levelsfor a further period, as to furnish by itself a most potentcause for increased wage demands.
The general conclusion reached by the Committee was that a policyof subsidising the cost of living should be continued, and, ifnecessary, extended to clothing; and that the fact that these subsidieswere being paid should be announced. It should be made plain,however, that the Government could not undertake to support anyparticular level of prices for necessities indefinitely, without regardto changes in costs abroad or wages at home. At the same time theGovernment, while avoiding any suggestion of a formal linkingbetween wages and prices, should make it clear that they expectedthat, to the extent that the policy of price stabilisation in regardto the necessities of life was continued, claims for increased wageson account of the cost of living would not be justified.The First Lord&apos; of the A dmiralty said that, if a policy of price stabilisation, such as that suggested, were practicable, the Govern-ment would thereby deprive demands for wage increases of theirmoral support, at least in so far as they were based upon the costof living. The Government would, therefore, be able to take a much stronger line to prevent wage increases. The Government could then say that they had decided themselves to bear the brunt of theincrease in the cost of the necessities of life and could with confidenceresist, as unpatriotic, demands for increases in wages. TheGovernment should face the likelihood that at some stage therewould be strikes even in the munitions industries. These couldbe far more readily overcome if the cost of living were kept steady.Prom this point of view it was desirable to include in the scheme as wide a range as possible of the commodities entering the costof living index.   The scheme was in his view sound.The President of the Board of Trade thought that the Govern-ment would be well advised not to move too quickly in the directionof imposing a complete control on the upward movement of thecost of living. It was always easier for the Trade Union leaders to guide their members than to control them; and, if it were madeimpossible to justify any demand for wages increases based onthe cost of living, demands would be put forward on other grounds which the Trade Union leaders would find it much more difficultto oppose. A small gradual increase in the cost of living would create a sense of contentment in the minds of the workers and would do no harm. It was surprising indeed how relatively small werethe increases in wages since the war; these had been mostly settled with reference to the cost of living and had given satisfaction tothe workers concerned. It was, in his opinion, easy to over-estimateboth the extent to which earnings had been increased by overtimeand the extent to which the earnings of working-class householdshad, as such, been increased. While he was in favour of stabilisingthe cost of foodstuffs, he was more doubtful regarding the applica-tion of that policy to clothing and fuel. As regards the latter, itwould in any case be wiser to wait until more definite information was available as to the cost involved.One great advantage of stabilising the cost of living was thatit would give relief, not only to wage earners, but also to all thosedependent on fixed incomes who, if the cost of living were to rise,would be unable to obtain relief through wage increases. Speakingpersonally, he would not himself be unduly alarmed at a prospect oflinking wages to the cost of living for a limited period, and of restoring the Industrial Court as the organ for measuring the wageadvances to be given.The Prime Minister said that he would be opposed to a directlinking of this kind, although, of course, the cost of living did affectwages. If the Government were to subsidise the cost of living, theyshould make the fullest possible use in public of their decision.Sir Thomas Phillips said that the Minister of Labour was infavour of what might be called an elastic stabilisation of the cost
of living. On the question of the best method to be adopted tosecure for the Government the full advantage for this policy, it was important to recall that the local Trade Union Executives werebeing pressed by their membership to secure increases in wages, andthat, if they took the opposite view, the result would be that authority would pass from them to the unconstitutional elements inthe labour movement. It was for this reason that the constitutionalleaders should not be pressed too far. It would not be possible toobtain from the Trades Union Congress a pledge on the subject ofwages, and it would not in his view be desirable to seek such a pledge at the present time, even if it were possible to obtain one.If the cost of living was eliminated as a ground for demandingwage increases, demands would be put forward on other and more dangerous grounds. He favoured, therefore, an arrangement bywhich, on the one hand, the cost of living would be keptsubstantially stable, and, on the other hand, would be allowed torise from time to time to a limited extent, thereby providing thelocal Trade Union Executives with an opportunity for securingsmall advantages for their members. The question of the text ofthe statement to be made and the method of making it wouldrequire careful consideration.The Minister of Health said that he was in favour of an elasticadjustment rather than a rigid one. As regards the approach to labour, the experience of the Old Age Pensions Scheme suggestedthat it was much better for the Government to take Labour into their confidence rather than to seek to commit them to the merits of any particular policy.The Minister of Food said that, on the general question ofpolicy to be adopted, he was in agreement with the views expressedby the President of the Board of Trade and by Sir Thomas Phillipson behalf of the Minister of Labour.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as regards the approach to Labour, it had been suggested that he might go tothe meeting of the National Joint Advisory Council to be held on the31st January. On the following day (the 1st February) a general debate on economic organisation would take place in the House ofCommons, and this would provide an admirable opportunity for ageneral statement of policy to be made on behalf of the Government.The Prime Minister agreed that a statement should be made inthe House of Commons on the 1st February. As regards thequestion whether, and, if so, how, a statement should be communi-cated previously to the Labour Movement, he suggested that thefinal arrangements should be left to the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Labour.The War Cabinet-(1). Gave general approval to the recommendations of the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy in regard tostabilising the price of certain staple foodstuffs whichenter into the cost-of-living index (W.P. (G.) (40) 18),and in particular agreed (a) that the policy to be aimed at should be the generalstabilisation, for a period of six months, at approximately the present figures, of the cost ofcertain staple foodstuffs, but that this stabilisation-tioh need not be rigid :(6) that consideration should be given to the question of preventing rises in fuel costs; and of the institu-tion of standard clothing, with a view to preventing rises in this item in the cost-of-living index figure.
NorwegianRoute.Analysis of cargoes.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that as arranged at the meeting of the War Cabinet, noted in the margin, he had made an analysis of the cargoes carried by ships in British convoyon the Norwegian route since the 23rd December, 1939. Out of atotal of 107 cargoes the principal items were as follows : Pulp (31) and Paper (5*-)General cargoBallastOre ...TimberShips.361292465*These figures were very striking and suggested that the questiondeserved further examination, in order to ensure that the cargoesbrought by ships from Scandinavia contributed&apos; fully to our war effort. In particular, a reduction should, if possible, be made in thenumber of ships arriving in ballast. The great bulk of the ships inquestion were under neutral flags.In discussion, reference was made to the difficulty of compellingneutral ships, coming to this country for cargo, themselves to carrycargo instead of arriving in ballast; to the possibility that in theperiod under review the imports of pulp and paper- might have beenexceptionally high owing to seasonal or other causes; and to other factors bearing on the nature of the cargoes carried on theNorwegian route.The War Cabinet agreed (a) To invite the President of the Board of Trade, in conjunc-tion with the Minister of Supply, the Minister ofShipping and other Ministers concerned, to prepare areport (i) setting out the nature of the cargoes normallycarried by neutral and British ships trading tothis country from Norwegian ports;(ii) making    recommendations    for    improving    thesituation.(previous reference:W.M. (89) 122ndConclusions,Minute 2.)(&amp;) That the President of the Board of Trade should consult with the Lord Privy Seal with a view to the inclusionof the report referred to in (a) in the general report on shipping which the latter had been asked to undertakeat the Meeting of the War Cabinet noted in the margin.(2) Agreed that it was desirable that the Government&apos;s policyin this matter should be made widely known, and thatthe Statement in which it was announced should be sodrafted as to secure the widest measure of support forthe principles involved.(3) Agreed that this Statement of Policy should be announced in the Debate on Economic Organisation to be held inthe House of Commons on the 1st February, 1940.(4) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in conjunctionwith the Minister of Labour, to decide whether, and, if so, in what form, any previous communication on thissubject should be made on behalf of the Government tothe Labour Movement.(5) Took note that arrangements had been made by the Ministerof Labour, in conjunction with the Treasury and theMinistry of Food, and other Departments concerned, to,prepare a scheme for the introduction of a war cost-of-living index, which would be maintained in addition tothe existing cost-of-living index figure.
colonial empire.Utilisation ofMan-power resources.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The War, Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (G.) (40) 15) on the utilisation of the Man-Power Resources of the Colonial Empire.The Secretary of State for the Colonies explained that the firstcall for Colonial man power should be for local defence (or usein the Middle East) and for the maintenance of their civil servicesand their essential industries. The next call should be for pioneerunits, and it was the intention to employ these units, other thanAfrican, in France. He had consulted the Governors of the west indian Colonies, as he had been in some doubt whether the proposal was desirable for climatic reasons. The view expressed by the governors, on the advice of the local medical authorities, had beenthat, provided that there were a sufficient complement of doctors and adequate medical services, there would be no objection to theproposal. The chief trouble was likely to be lung disease. It was,however, recommended that these units should not be sent to Franceuntil the Spring was well advanced.The Prime Minister said he was doubtful of the advantages of the proposal to recruit these pioneer units.The Secretary of State for War said that he also was doubtful asto the utility of the proposals at the present time. At a later stage in the war they might be tried out. On the other hand, therewould be advantages in trying to get labour from China, and hewould like the authority of the War Cabinet to send to Hong Kongtwo officers who had been engaged in recruiting Chinese labour. in the last war, with the object of trying to secure supplies of-Chinese labour from Northern China for use in France.The First Lord of the Admiraltyexpressed the view that thisproposal was politically dangerous at a time when over a million people were unemployed in this country. Admittedly it had beendone in 1918, but-by that time we had then lost a million menin the war.The Secretary of State for War said that, in order to obtainthe labour required from this country, it would be necessary touse:-compulsory powers.-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs doubted whetherthe recruitment of Chinese labour would be found possible at this juncture. &quot;He thought the French might object, and the Japaneseposition-in Northern China would make it extremely difficult.-The Prime Minister pointed out that capital might be made out:of this measure in enemy propaganda.In &quot;discussion, it was explained that it was intended that thetwo officers referred to should make confidential enquiries as tothe position, sothat plans might be ready for action if it was eventually found-that the necessary labour could not be obtainedfrom resources in this country. It was pointed out that it was hardly possible to make enquiries of this nature without incurringpublicity, as publicity was the essence of a recruiting campaign.Publicity might have &quot;the most undesirable reactions and provokeforeign propaganda.The First Lord of the Admiralty enquired whether it wouldbe possible to proceed more rapidly with the extension of the MalayRegiment, wdiich was referred to in paragraph 17 of the Memo-randum (W.P. (G.) (40) 15), fand whether it was possible to usethenv to help garrisoning Singapore, where they might relieveEuropeans and would make a balance with the Indian element inthe garrison.The Secretary of State for the &quot;Colonies agreed that this sourcemight be tapped with success at a later stage.   The reasons against
pressing matters at this point were, first, that it had been decided on the grounds of security that it would be necessary to keepEuropean troops in any case in Singapore, and secondly, that further Malay forces, if raised, could be equipped only at theexpense of European troops.The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinet thatall Colonial Governments abroad had been advised that the RoyalAir Force were willing to accept fully qualified tradesmen. TheAir Ministry did not contemplate any campaign for large-scalerecruitment of Colonials of mixed or coloured blood, and he felt thatthese would be better employed in local pioneer units. The RoyalAir Force, however, required a number of Cypriots or Palestiniansfor Royal Air Force ancillary services in the Middle East, andauthorisation had already been given for enlistment in local services.He felt it inadvisable to disperse resources for flying trainingthroughout the Colonial Empire, and that it was wiser to concentrate on schemes for training in the Dominions, Middle East, SouthernRhodesia and India. It would be premature to encourage applica-tions from prospective candidates for flying duties until the OverseaTraining Schemes were in a more advanced stage, when the ColonialOffice would be informed of the necessary action to be taken.The proposal to raise a battalion in Cyprus was then discussed.The War Cabinet were informed that the arrangements had beenagreed between the War Office and the Colonial Office.In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for the colonies said that he thought that the desire to serve was for the present being met by the proposals at present in view, and he did not anticipate any difficulty if no further steps were authorised beyond those already taken to afford opportunity of service to personnel inthe Colonies.He also drew attention to the fact that paragraph 45 of his memorandum should have included a reference to the addition ofa second rifle battalion to the Northern Rhodesia Regiment, andshould, allowing for this, have described the number of Africansserving with the local forces in East Africa as a whole as havingincreased from approximately 5,500 to 15,000.The War Cabinet agreed (i) To approve generally the proposals set out in w.P. (G.) (40) 15, for the utilisation of the man-power resources of the Colonial Empire, in particular that thefirst call on the man-power should be for local defence and for the maintenance of civil services and essential industries.(ii) That it was undesirable at the present time to proceedwith the proposals summarised in paragraph 58 (b) forthe recruitment of pioneer units.(iii) That it was undesirable to proceed at the present juncturewith the proposal for sending two officers to Hong Kongto investigate the possibilities of recruitment of labour,in particular in Northern China, for use in France.The Far East. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to theRelations with discussion on this matter at the previous Meeting of the WarJapan: the case Cabinet, and said that he proposed to send two telegrams to Hisof the S.S. Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo. The first would consist of anAsama Maru. exposition of our case in international law. The second would(Previous instruct Sir Robert Craigie to put before the Japanese ForeignReference: Minister (a) certain proposals for dealing in the future with theW.M. (40) 22nd transport of German personnel in Japanese ships, together with conclusions, (&amp;) certain suggestions with a view to reaching a settlement of the minute 9.)[20722]c
present incident. These suggestions, placed in order of theiracceptability to ourselves, were as follows : (i) It might prove on investigation that some of the Germanstaken from the Asama Maru did not fall within the category of those specially useful for the German war effort, and could perhaps be handed over to the JapaneseGovernment, the rest continuing to be detained,(ii) Alternatively, we might be willing, as a gesture, to handover the whole party to the Japanese Government, if thelatter would undertake to intern them for the duration of the war.(iii) Or, again, we might be willing to hand them over on condition that they should give an undertaking, eitherto the Japanese Government or to ourselves, not to engage in any warlike service against the Allies duringthe war.Sir Robert Craigie would not, of course, offer these suggestions in succession, or allow M. Arita an immediate choice between them.In discussion it was agreed that the third solution should not beput forward, for the present at any rate.As regards the main issue, the view was expressed that itwould be a great advantage if we could rid ourselves permanentlyof the annoyance of having to search Japanese vessels for Germansof military age seeking to return to Germany. The real question was whether it was possible to arrive at an agreed settlement forthe future without loss of prestige to the Japanese Government.We also, however, had prestige to maintain. The first step,therefore, was to get the Japanese Government to accept the proposition that the passage of Germans of military value in their ships across the Pacific must be stopped. It might be useful, in thisconnection, to point out that, just as the United States mails had become the vehicle of an organised traffic in contraband, so therewas a danger that Japanese shipping might become the vehicle foran organised traffic in German personnel.The next stage would be to reach agreement as to how this traffic was to be stopped; and the final step would be to apply theagreement so reached to the Asama Maru incident. Provided theJapanese Government displayed a desire to obtain a solution of thegeneral issue, His Majesty&apos;s Government could afford to go a long-way to meet the Japanese Government as regards this particularincident. But a settlement of the general issue was an indispensablecondition to a compromise in this particular case.It was pointed out that the Japanese might well adopt theattitude that a settlement for the future should take the form of a&quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement,&quot; which would not be made public. Thiscourse would not meet our point of view. Further, any agreement on this matter was bound to obtain publicity.In further discussion, the First Lord of the Admiralty saidthat the Navy had &quot; failed to find &quot; the further Japanese ships now en route, regarding which the Japanese Ambassador in london had spoken to the Foreign Secretary (Foreign Office telegram toTokyo, No. 49, dated the 25th January).The Foreign Secretary said that he had received no message ofimportance from Sir Robert Craigie since the latter&apos;s telegram ofthe previous day, in which he had expressed the opinion that japan had not a single leader who would dare to face such a storm as thepresent, and to tell the people the truth (Tokyo telegram No. 120).The War Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to redraft the proposed despatch to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Tokyo, in consultation with the First Lordof the Admiralty, in the light of the discussion which hadtaken place.
