The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 50th(Conclusions,Minute 5.)Leaflet raids andreconnaisanceflights.Air Attacks onU-boats.S.S. Altmark.1. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff reported that there hadbeen 4 unidentified raids off Gromer and St. Abb&apos;s Head up to6 p.m. on the previous day. Aircraft had been sent up to investigate,but no interceptions had been made. Shortly before 9 p.m. 3 or4 enemy aircraft had been active some distance off the north foreland. In all, 76 fighter patrols had been sent up, involving172 aircraft.Two Whitley aircraft, operating from Villeneuve, had madeleaflet raids over Prague and had returned safely. Two Wellingtonshad set out from Mildenhall on a similar mission over Kiel and hamburg. One aircraft had returned safely to this country, but theother was missing. The aircraft which had returned reported that,on asking for her position by wireless, a German station had sent out a false position. Cases of this sort had occurred previously.The missing aircraft might, therefore, have been deceived in thisway and landed in Belgium, since its last recorded position seemedto have been over Brussels. There was a certain military value incarrying out these raids over Kiel, in addition to their propagandavalue, since it enabled the area to be reconnoitred for possibletargets in the moonlight. Leaflet raids had also been carried out over Bremen and Hamburg.A reconnaissance of enemy naval bases had been made by Blenheims during the afternoon, but they had reported fog overthe area and had seen no enemy vessels. One Whitley aircraft had carried out a security patrol over the enemy seaplane bases atBorkum, Nordehey and Sylt.Three enemy submarines had been, sighted by aircraft of coastal Command. The first, seen by a Hudson, some 60 miles east of Fair Island, had submerged before an attack could be delivered,but destroyers had been directed to the vicinity. The other two hadbeen attacked by Ansons north-west of Cape Wrath. On the first of these (as reported at the previous meeting) two bombs had been dropped, the first falling close to the submarine, which had started to dive until about two-thirds submerged, and had then reappeared.After remaining for about one minute on. the surface, it had sunkslowly on an even keel. Two bombs had been dropped on the thirdsubmarine sighted; unfortunately, one of the bombs had failed toexplode, and this attack had almost certainly been unsuccessful.A special night reconnaissance had been made for the Altmark,and the aircraft had reported lights in Joessing Fjord. Threemerchant vessels had been seen steaming along the Norwegian coast,but none of these had been identified, as the Altmark. there connaissance had been continued at dawn, and a third aircraft had just been despatched to keep it up. The area to the south ofJoessing Fjord was being covered in case the Altmark had already made her escape.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 50thConclusions,Minute 6.)Attacks onU-boats.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the success ofthe first of the two attacks north-west of Cape Wrath, to which the deputy Chief of the Air Staff had referred (Minute 1), wasconsidered by the Admiralty to have been doubtful.In the early hours of the 24th February H.M.S. Gurkha had attacked a submarine 130 miles north-north-west of Cape Wrath,but the result was unknown.A report of an attack on a U-boat south-west of the Scillies onthe 22nd February had been received. This had been carried outby HALS. Mackay and H.M.S. Walpole, but the final attack had
Canadian air personnel.Interception ofGermanmerchantvessels.H.M.S. Nelson.(previous erence:W.M. (39) 111thConclusions,Minute 2.)Defences ofScapa Plow.(previous kef erence:W.M. (39) 99thConclusions,Minute 2.)produced wreckage and bags of flour, and it was therefore thoughtpossible the contact had been a wreck.The First Lord gave details of the movements of the Fleet andof a transport carrying Canadian airmen.The German ship Wahehe had now been boarded and a prizecrew was bringing her in. Three out of the 6 German ships whichhad recently left Vigo had therefore been picked up by the royal navy, but it seemed probable that the other 3 would make good their return to Germany through Norwegian territorial waters.The German papers had at last announced the damage with.M.S. Nelson. It was very satisfactory that no news of this had reached Germany for three months. He was considering how to dealwith this matter. His inclination was to issue a suitable referenceto repairs to Nelson, but not to give information gratuitously to theGermans as to what exactly had happened.The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War Cabinet infor-mation as to the progress of the measures for providing effectivedefences at Scapa Flow.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 50thConclusions,Minute 7.)Western Front.Finland.3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.In the Karelian Isthmus the Finns had withdrawn their right flank to near Johannes, thus sacrificing the Koivisto Peninsula, butshortening their line. The coastal batteries on Koivisto Island were still in action. A Finnish communique stated that on the22nd February Russian attacks in the direction of Ylasomme andNayhkijarvi towards Kamara and Liepasu were all repulsed, as were also attacks in the centre of the Isthmus and near Taipale.North of Lake Ladoga mopping-up operations by the Finnscontinued; otherwise there was no change in the situation.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Turkey.Relations with.S.S.E.(previous erence:W.M. (39) 51stConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Lord Privy Seal asked Sir Alexander Cadoganwhether any information was available as to tension on the Turco-Soviet frontier in the Caucasus, and, in particular, as to incidentssuch as those reported in The Times that morning.Sir Alexander Cadogan said that no information had beenreceived. The Bulgarian Minister in London had, however,mentioned in a recent conversation that he did not now anticipatea German drive into the Balkans or a Russian attack on Bessarabia,but that, in his opinion, the danger-spot was in the Caucasus. Hehad not been able to indicate more precisely what he had in mind,but had referred to the possibility of some Russian maladresse.
