BroadcastingShippingLosses.of(previous reference erence:W.M. (39) 118thConclusions,Minute 5,)1. The War Cabinet had before them the following memoranda relating to the Broadcasting of Shipping Losses : (1) By the First Lord of the Admiralty-W.P. (G.) (39) 156,&apos; W.P. (G.) (39) 160 and W.P. (G.) (40) 8.(2) By the Minister of Shipping-W.P. (G.) (40) 2.(3) By Lord Macmillan-W.P. (G.) (39) 165.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Minister ofInformation had called on him the previous day and asked that thediscussion of this matter might be postponed for a little while until he (the Minister of Information) had had time to make further enquiries. The Minister of Information thought that after making such enquiries he might be able to suggest other ways of handling the question. In these circumstances, he (the First Lord) asked fora postponement of the discussion.The War Cabinet agreed To defer until a later date the consideration of the broadcasting of Shipping Losses.Propaganda.PrinciplesunderlyingBritish war-timePropaganda.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by LordMacmillan (W.P. (G.) (39) 162) relating to the principles underlyingBritish war-time Propaganda.The Minister of Information said that he considered theMemorandum, which had been submitted to the War- Cabinet by his predecessor, a good statement of propaganda policy and he was&quot;ready to endorse it. He would like to know, however, whether theWar Cabinet considered that sufficient emphasis had been laid onarousing a positive will to defeat and destroy. By this he mean the thought the document might contain something more positiveagainst the system which we were out to destroy.Some discussion then took place as to how the French would react to some of the principles laid down in the Memorandum.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that paragraph 12 might be expanded somewhat in order to make it more suitable for French thought.It was suggested that, as this document was the work of his predecessor, the Minister of Information might like to re-examineit and to submit it again to the War Cabinet as a paper by himself.At the same time, he might consult the French Minister of&quot;Propaganda and obtain his general concurrence in the document.The War Cabinet invited the Minister of Information (a) to review the Memorandum on the principles under-lying British war-time propaganda submitted by his predecessor in the light of his own ideas; and(b) before bringing the Memorandum again before theWar Cabinet, to consult with the French Ministerof Propaganda with a view to obtaining his generalconcurrence.Palestine. 3.   The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the(Previous Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G.) (39) 161  and reference: W.P. (G.) (40) 1 and 4) and the First Lord of the AdmiraltyW.M. (39) 123rd (W.P. (G.) (39) 163) on the policy to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;conclusions, Government in regard to Palestine and the communications to be minute 7.)        made on this subject to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington,[20665] b 2
and a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies onthe Control of Land Transfers in Palestine (W.P. (G.) (40) 3).The First Lord of the Admiralty said that nothing had happened to make him change his views in regard to Palestine,which were well known. He would not himself have wished to raisethe general issue, but this had been raised in an acute form by theterms of the draft telegram to Lord Lothian contained in w.P. (G.) (39) 161. His own views as to a more suitable line to take in giving guidance to Lord Lothian were contained in paragraph 8of his Memorandum W.P. (G.) (39) 163. It seemed to him very important that no controversy should be allowed to arise on this issue during the war, both from the point of view of the adverse effects on Jewish opinion in America, and thus on American opinon as a whole, and also in order to avoid undesirable political contro-versy at home. In so far as his proposal might be taken to indicate a change of policy on the part of the Government, it was reasonable to refer to the new factor introduced by the action taken by the mandates Commission of the League of Nations subsequent to thelast consideration of the matter in Parliament.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hesympathised in no merely formal sense with the attitude of theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, but he could not resist the conclusionthat, if we were to take the line of leaving our policy in a conditionof uncertainty, this was just the way in which future dangerousmisunderstandings would be created. Any suggestion that we werehesitating in our Palestine policy would have a disastrous effect onArab opinion, with results which he viewed with considerableapprehension. Our line should be to avoid creating any impression of instability, while at the same time using the most discreetlanguage in our pronouncements on the subject, and being careful to adopt a moderate policy in Palestine on any issues that requiredimmediate action, e.g., in the matter of land sales.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that theland question was the only issue on which any immediate action had to be taken that would arouse controversy, and that it was this that the Jews had had in mind when they had made their recentprotests. On the other two main points dealt with in the white paper, the policy laid down was not likely to arouse immediatecontroversy; thus, as regards immigration, the Jews were not altogether dissatisfied with the numbers allowed under the white paper over the 5-year period, and were probably prepared to waitin hopes that the policy might be altered in the interval; and, on theconstitutional issue, there was no question, under the White Paper,of any changes until peace and order had been established inPalestine. This was, therefore, not a live issue at the moment andwe might well decide that the constitutional issue must be left in abeyance while the war continued.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence drew attention tothe great strategical importance of not disturbing the presentposition of tranquillity in the Middle East and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty referred to the great importance of securing a friendly public opinion in the United States in readiness for thetime when our exchange difficulties would become acute.The Prime Minister suggested that, in view of the differences of opinion on the general question of Palestine policy revealed inthe discussion, he should discuss the matter further with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, with a viewto discovering a line of possible agreement.
Old age pensions.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 98thConclusions,Minute 12.)4. The War Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (W.P. (G-.) (40) 5) containing proposalsfor an amendment of the Old-Age Pensions Scheme. His principalrecommendations were that the Government should -(a)of 60 of aadmit to pension a wife not under the agecontributory pensioner of 65 years or over;(b) lower the pension age for insured women to 60; and(c) accept responsibility for supplementing all old-age pensionsfrom age 65 (men) and 60 (women) at 100 per cent.Exchequer cost on a household needs basis.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to give an interim answer to certain Parliamentary Questions on thesubject of old-age pensions with which he would have to deal that afternoon, indicating that be hoped to be in a position to make afull statement in about a week&apos;s time. During the intervening weekit would be necessary to put the finishing touches to the scheme, andto arrange for its detailed examination by the Home PolicyCommittee. He would also have to see the representatives of theTrades Union Congress whom he had already met in November and december. Would it be better tactics to meet the Trades UnionCongress representatives on the morning of the day on which theannouncement was to be made, or three days before? The latter course involved the possibility of leakage and&apos; of an unfavourableconstruction being put on his proposals before they had even been announced.The general view of the War Cabinet was that the Chancellor&apos;s interview with the Trades Union Congress representatives shouldbe deferred until the day of the announcement of the new scheme.The principal points which were made in the course of the chancellors statement, and of the discussion which followed it,were as follows : (1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed, in lieu of ascheme for a flat-rate increase pressed for by represen-tatives of the T.U.C., to introduce a generous and well-considered system of supplementation on ahousehold needs basis. The principal features of hisscheme were as follows : &apos;(a) The supplementary payments would be adminis-tered not as now by Public - AssistanceCommittees, but by the Unemployment assistance board. The actual payments would be made through the Post Offices instead of through theEmployment Exchanges. It had been calculated that the average amount of the supplementarypayment, for those who received it, would beabout 6s. a week.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Prime Minister to discuss the matter further with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(ii) In the meantime, deferred a decision on the issues of policyraised in the Papers under consideration, including theproposals submitted by the Secretary of State for theColonies in his Memorandum W.P. (G.) (40) 3 as tocontrol of land transfers.
(&amp;) Supplementary payments would not be given exceptin cases where their necessity was proved. On theother hand, the household needs basis which itwas proposed to adopt would be less rigorous thanthe family needs basis now in force.&quot;(c) The transfer from rates to taxes of the financial responsibility for supplementation would be welcomed in certain quarters. The amount bywhich the existing burden on local authorities would be relieved was about  5^ millions perannum. A final settlement between the localauthorities and the Exchequer would be deferred until the next review of the Block Grant in 1942,but the Government would be justified inrequiring some contribution from local authoritiesduring the intervening period. The Chancellor&apos;sproposals in this respect were set out in para-graph 34 of W.P. (G.) (40) 5.(d) The immediate cost to the Exchequer of the new scheme as a, whole might be as high as 10 millions per annum. This figure might be considerably increased if the cost of livingcontinued to rise.(2) Under the existing scheme the wife of an old-age pensionercould not draw a pension until she herself was 65. It-was hard that a couple should be entitled, when the husband was 64, to draw 27s. a week in unemploymentbenefit and, when the husband was 65, should only beentitled to an old-age pension of 10s. Complaints onthese lines would be remedied by the decision to admitto pension the wives, aged 60 and over, of contributorypensioners aged 65 and over. After the concession hadtaken effect, the women concerned would be excludedpersons under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.The lowering to 60 of the pension age for insured womenwas intended as a corresponding concession to spinsters.(3) It would be necessary, in order to balance the contributoryscheme, to raise contributions from lid. to Is. Id. in thecase of men and from %\d. to 8^d. in the case of women Id. of the additional contributions being paid in eachcase by the employer and the remainder by the worker.(4) Supplementary pensions under this scheme would beauthorised for considerable periods ahead, withoutconstant enquiries into family circumstances.(5) No great popular enthusiasm was to be expected for ascheme conceived on the above lines. On the other hand,to adopt a popular but expensive scheme, involving a flat-rate increase, would have been to strike a false noteat the outset of a great war.(6) When the existing contributory scheme had been intro-duced, the Government of the day had been entitled to expect that war pensions would form a steadilydiminishing charge on the Exchequer. This assumptioncould no longer be made. It would not be until January1956, when three decennial increases in contributionshad taken effect, that contributors entering the scheme at the age of 16 would pay for approximately the wholeof the benefits for which they were insured, both beforeand after the age of 70.(7) Reference wa,s made to the figures as to contributions for new entrants at the age of 16 given in paragraphs and 15. It was explained that the figures in para-graph 7 showed the full actuarial contributions required
The Ai*Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Secretary of State for Air said that weather conditionshad hindered air operations on the previous day. Patrols andescorts had been carried out, but no enemy raids had been reported.A submarine had been attacked by a Hudson, 120 miles east ofKinnaird Head. Bombs had been dropped, but there was no evidence of damage to the submarine apart from discoloration ofthe water in the vicinity.to make the scheme self-supporting on the basis of theexisting benefits. The figures in paragraph 15 showed the increase in the contribution necessary to pay for theincreased benefits proposed by the T.U.C. representa-tives, without, however, increasing the contribution tomake good the present gap between contributions and benefits.(8) The Minister of Health said that he was in generalagreement with the Chancellors proposals. He had,however, certain comments to make : (a) It would be administratively possible for the twoHealth Departments to bring into operation inJuly 1940 the admission of wives between 60 and65 and the lowering of the pensions age forinsured women. The Departments, however,would be faced with a big task which might involve awards to as many as 150,000 wives and150,000 spinsters. In &quot;all, possibly 400,000decisions would have to be reviewed.(fe) It was recommended in paragraph 38 of theChancellor&apos;s Memorandum that supplementationon a needs basis should come into operation assoon as the necessary administrative arrange-ments could be made and legislation passed. Itwas very important that the interim period should be made as short as possible. otherwise there would be a real danger that some localauthorities might pay out supplementation at an excessive rate. There was, therefore, a strong-case for an early assumption of financial responsi-bility by the State, not as a relief to the localauthorities, but as a meastire of control, andtherefore of economy. These were matters which required early examination by the Treasury, theMinistry of Labour and the two health departments.(e) The Minister indicated that he wished to reserve hisposition on one or two points, e.g.. the case ofpersons in residential institutions.The War Cabinet-(i) Gave a warm approval in principle to the proposals forthe   amendment   of   the   Old-Age   Pensions   schemecontained in the Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (W.P. (G.) (40) 5).(ii) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration to the points set out at (8) above, and toarrange for the scheme whole to be examined indetail by the Home Policy Committee,(iii) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce the Scheme, after the completion of the enquiries at (ii).
The Naval 6.   The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it had beenSituation. announced on the German wireless that the submarines Starfish and(Previous Undine had been destroyed in the Heligoland Bight as the resultReference: of German defensive measures, and that part of the crews had been.M. (40) 14th rescued. He read the draft of a communique which he proposedConclusions, to issue announcing the loss of these two submarines and of the minute 4.) Sea Horse. It was agreed that this statement should include a reference to the German report that part of the crews of two of the submarines had been rescued.German The First Lord also mentioned a statement issued in Germanysubmarine which said that British claims to have destroyed 70 Germanlosses. submarines were ridiculous, and that if we had said 35 this wouldhave been nearer the mark. This figure was. of course, very near to our own claim, which was to have destroyed between 35 and 40German submarines.The sweep to the Maas Lightship, which he had reported to theWar Cabinet on the previous day, had resulted in six ships havingbeen brought in. One of these was a, German vessel of some600 tons. The others were neutral vessels, which would be examined by our Contraband Control.  Another sweep was being carried out.A Dutch vessel, the Arendskerk, of 7,900 tons, had been sunk by a torpedo 100 miles S.W. of Ushant. The Kildale, 4,000 tons,bound from the Plate with wheat, had been mined 2 miles east ofthe Sunk Light Vessel, but was still afloat. The steamship Gracia,of 5,600 tons, outward bound in convoy, had been damaged in liverpool Bay and had been beached. The search for the Germansteamship Santos, which had broken out from Rio de Janeiro, hadbeen abandoned owing to the warships engaged in the search being required for other duties. The Admiralty had decided that, as theGermans would be likely to send warships to assist the Germanvessel Trautenfels, which had damaged her rudder and had driftedoutside Norwegian territorial waters, it was necessary to send alarger force than one cruiser. This had been done, but the weatherhad since deteriorated.In reply to the enquiry made by the Minister without portfolio the previous day, the First Lord said that three vessels had been seton fire, viz., the Keynes, the Pitwines and a Danish vessel. Theformer, which had been sunk, was reported to have been set on fireby incendiary bombs. The other two vessels had been set on fire butnot sunk, and it was not known whether the bombs which haddamaged them had been of the incendiary type.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Western Front.possible german attackon the Nether-lands andBelgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Secretary of State for War and the Foreign Secretarygave the War Cabinet further information regarding possible events in Belgium. Particulars of this information and of the conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.
The Nether-lands andBelgium.Imports of oiland other war materials.(previous erence:W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 8.)8. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that theMinister for Economic. Warfare was anxious, if the Militarysituation permitted, to remove the embargo imposed the previous day on the export or shipment of war materials, particularly oil, to holland and Belgium.The War Cabinet -(i) Agreed that in the altered circumstances the embargo:imposed the previous day might now be removed,(ii) Invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence tocommunicate this decision forthwith to the Minister for economic Warfare.The MilitarySituation.Finland.(previous reference:9. The Secretary of State for War said it appeared thatrather severe fighting was in progress on the Salla front. No exactinformation was, however, available. In addition, Soviet bombershad been extremely active. There was reason to think that the constant Soviet air raids were having some effect on the morale of w.M. (40) 14th the civil population in Finland.Conclusions,Minute 5.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatM. Gripenberg, the Finnish Minister, had informed him that morning that in their air attack the previous day the Soviet bombershad only just failed to bomb the house in which marshal mannerheim was working. He had added that the Finnish Staffanticipated that there would be fine weather at the front inFebruary, and that this period would be one of great difficulty forthe Finnish Army.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Finland. 10.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionSoviet-Finnish to telegram No. 13, dated the 15th January, 1940, from HisConflict: Majesty&apos;s Minister,  Copenhagen,  reporting that,  according toreported offer of reliable sources, the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs hadmediation by informed the Scandinavian Ministers in Copenhagen that GermanyGermany. had that day proposed terms for the cessation of the Soviet-Finnishconflict direct to the Government of the U.S.S.R. and, through the danish Government, to Finland. He (the Secretary of State) had mentioned this report to M. Gripenberg, the Finnish Minister, whohad received no information on this subject from his Government.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance for Finland.Aircraft.(previous references:W.M. (40) 11thConclusions,Minute 4, andW.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 9.)11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hehad seen M. Gripenberg, the Finnish Minister, who had made themost earnest plea that we should supply Finland with 60 fighters,either Spitfires or Hurricanes. He (the Secretary of State) had replied that it was very unlikely that we should be able to meet this request. He wondered whether there was any possibility of ourobtaining some for Finland from Italy?The Secretary of State for Air said that there was no possibility of obtaining Italian fighters for immediate delivery to finland.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatM. Gripenberg had raised the question whether it would be possibleto obtain Lockheed aircraft from the United States of America for Finland. He had apparently discussed this possibility some timepreviously with the Chief of the Air Staff, and he now had infor-mation, which he claimed had been checked by our Air Attache in[20665] c
i Washington, that we had on order Lockheed aircraft for earlydelivery, and that it would be possible to;divert to Finland some ofthe aircraft which were on order to us, without delaying completionof our order.The First Lord o&apos;A the Admiralty suggested that we should inform the United States Government confidentially of the action we had already taken to help Finland, and should explain that wewere unable to spare fighters for Finland, since our fighters were needed for our own protection against Germany. Could not theUnited States Government be persuaded to let Finland have someof the fighters now destined for their own army, the transactionbeing camouflaged by an arrangement under which the aircraft would be transferred to a company, by which in turn they would besent to Finland ?The Secretary of State for Air said, that no doubt president roosevelt wa.s in a position to exercise a decisive influence on UnitedStates aircraft manufacturers. He had shown a considerablepersonal interest in our own needs, and it might well be that he might feel still more strongly in the case of Finland.The Prime Minister doubted whether the United StatesGovernment would be prepared to let Finland have aircraft on orderby the United States Government. He thought it likely, however,that they would be prepared to facilitate the release to the finnish government of some of the Lockheed general reconnaissance aircraft now on order for us.The Secretary of State for Air said that he would at once make enquiries as regards the possibility of obtaining Lockheed aircraft from the United States and would report the result of his enquiriesto the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the course of thesame day.Export credits The Foreign Secretary said that M. Gripenberg had also raised for war with, him the possibility of obtaining export credits in order to paymaterial. for the war material which we were now exporting to Finland, andhad suggested that authority might be given to the Export credits guarantee Department to discuss the matter on a basis of 25 percent, cash, and credit for five years for the remaining 75 per cent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had no objectionto the matter being discussed with the Export Credits guarantee department. He imagined that the credit would be classed as apolitical one.The War Cabinet :-(i) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,after consultation with the Secretary of State for Air,should address a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Washington, asking him to investigate the possibility ofsecuring the transfer to the Finnish Government ofLockheed aircraft now under construction in the UnitedStates of America,(ii) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would communicate with the Export Credits guarantee department and request them to get in touch with theFinnish Minister, with a view to discussing the payment for war material despatched to Finland by means of export credits.
Scandinavia.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 10thConclusions,Minute 1.)12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to theproposal which had been mentioned at the Meeting of the WarCabinet noted in the margin, that a Mission should proceed to scandinavia, headed by a Member of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet: Decided to defer a decision on this matter till the followingdav.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 16, 1940.
