Guns.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 100thConclusions,Minute 13.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Committee on the Possibility of increasing the number ofA.A. guns to be supplied to the British Army in France at theexpense of the Air Defence of Great Britain (W.P. (39) 177).The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that this paper should be referred to the Military Co-ordination Committee. Hewas impressed by the large drain on our personnel which resulted from the increasing number of A.A. guns manned in a state ofinstant readiness throughout this country. He thought that adifferent scale of readiness might be adopted in different areas. Hethought also that some of the Navy&apos;s demands for A.A. guns mightbe diminished.In discussion it was pointed out that the genesis of this paper was a suggestion that our Fighter defence was so effective that areduction could be made in the number of AA. guns. The Reportdealt with this limited issue, and pointed out that there had notbeen sufficient war experience on which to base the suggested review.
It was agreed, however, that it would be desirable that the military co-operation-ordination Committee should consider the whole question of A.A.defence.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Minister of home security said that, in view of his responsibilities, he would be glad to take part in the discussions of the Military Co-co-ordination committee when this matter was dealt with.The &quot;War Cabinet-(i) Approved the Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (39) 177),subject to any modification resulting from (ii) below,(ii) Invited the Military Co-ordination Committee, in consulta-tion with the Minister of Home Security, to consider thequestion of Anti-aircraft Defence, including suchmatters as whether the authorised scale of defence ofthe Air Defence of G-reat Britain needed modification in the light of the experience so far gained.Turkish 8.

Turkish earthquake, and its reactions on Turkish superstitions.The Germans would not be slow to exploit the position to the full,and Mr. Woolley deplored the meagreness of the sum. ( 25,000)we had promised to Turkey for the relief of distress.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs confirmed thatMr. Woolley could speak with authority on Turkish affairs.The Prime Minister was inclined to think that the sum of 25,000, which we had given, was on the meagre side. He thought we might say that, as the earthquake had been followed by furthershocks and floods greatly increasing the damage and distress, we desired to increase the amount of our gift to. sav, a sum of theorder of  100,000.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested that theBritish and French, acting together, might offer  500,000. he asked, however, for further time to consider the matter and undertook to report to the War Cabinet the following day.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised the importanceof obtaining the full co-operation of the French in anything thatwas done.The War Cabinet :-Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toexamine the question of a further grant to Turkey forthe relief of distress, if possible in co-operation with theFrench, and to report to the War Cabinet on the following day.Germany.possible development ofpolicy.(previous reference:W.M.
