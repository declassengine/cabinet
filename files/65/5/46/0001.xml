359W.M. 46 (40)The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air reported that the weather *Situation. had been particularly bad on the previous day for air operations,(Previous especially in the southern portion of the North Sea.   No enemyReference:        aircraft had approached our coasts, but the usual patrols had been.M.

She had moved from JoessingFjord, but had not been found.Three Hudsons from Thornaby, searching an area west of the danish coast, had sighted 6 enemy mine-sweepers about 50 miles west of the Horns Reef. The mine-swTeepers, which appeared tobe armed with 2 anti-aircraft guns each, had opened fire. our aircraft had attacked in succession, dropping four 250-lb. bombseach, several of which had fallen within 50 yards of the vessels.One of our aircraft, making a low attack, had sustained damage from the blast effect of its own bombs, but all three aircraft had returned safely to their base.The pilot and crew of the bomber which had reconnoitred the heligoland anchorages on the. night the 17th-18th February hadbeen examined in conference with the Naval Staff, who had reachedthe conclusion that the 4 large warships reported by thisreconnaissance to be lying north-west of Heligoland were probably the Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and two pocket-battleships. heavy bombers had stood by to attack these ships, but weather had prevented the operation. An attack would be made that night if conditions proved suitable.Air operations in France had been stopped by bad weather.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 44thConclusions,Minute 2.)Loss of H.M.S.Daring.Shipping losses.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that the destroyer Daring had been torpedoed some 40 miles east ofDuncansby Head&quot; in the early hours of the 18th February. only survivors had been picked up, and it was feared that theremainder of the ship&apos;s company had been lost. The ship had probably been attacked by one of the small German submarines,which were very difficult to see, even on the surface, at night.Eleven destroyers were hunting in the area where the attack hadbeen made. The loss of H.M.S. Daring brought the total numberof lives lost in the Navy up to about 2,700 since the beginning ofthe war.In view of the presence of German heavy ships off Heligoland,which might presage an attack on the Norwegian convoy, the outward-bound convoy had been held back for one day to give timefor our heavy ships to get into position to give it the necessarycover. Details were given of the progress of the completion of the defences of Scapa, which would greatly ease the position in respectof the activities of our heavy ships.The First Lord described the action that was being taken todeal with the German heavy ships found off Heligoland.Recent enemy attacks on trade were as follows : S.S. Pyrrhus (7,400 tons), outward-bound to Manila in convoy, torpedoed 90 miles north-west of Finisterre on the17th February. The convoy was escorted by 2 Frenchdestroyers.   It was not yet known whether the ship had sunk.Norwegian S.S. Kuernaas (1,800 tons) mined or torpedoedoff the Dutch coast; 20 survivors rescued by a Dutch steamer.Norwegian S.S. Sangstad (4,300 tons) torpedoed 115 miles east of Kirkwall; 29 survivors picked up by H.M.S. Inglefield.Dutch S.S. Ameland (4,500 tons) sunk, probably mined,40 miles west of the Hook of Holland; survivors picked up bya Dutch tug.[20859]
(previous reference:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Attack onU-boat.S.S. Greystoke Castle (5,900 tons) and S.S. Cheldale(4,200 tons) had collided off Durban on the 17th February, Cheldalesinking in two minutes; 1 officer and 18 men only had been saved.The damaged tanker Imperial Transport was now 100 miles west of the Hebrides, in tow, but, owing to bad weather, was makinglittle progress.Sweeping operations through the Outer Dowsing area were still being carried out to ensure the safe passage of convoys.H.M.S. Vanessa had attacked a good contact 60 miles south-west of the Lizard, with results that seemed likely to have been successful.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 44thConclusions,Minute 3.)Western Front:distribution ofGermandivisions.Relativestrength ofAllied andGerman land forces.Finland.3. The Secretary of State for War reported that a conference had recently been held between the British and French IntelligenceStaffs, in which it had been agreed that the Germans had nowformed between 150 and 160 divisions. Twenty of these were thought to have completed unit training and moved out in January.The chief increase in the number of divisions was in CentralGermany.Some discussion took place concerning the relative strengths of the Allied and German land forces, and the Secretary of Statefor War undertook to prepare a comparative statement for theinformation of the War Cabinet.Continuing, the Secretary of State for War said that therehad been a slight lull in the fighting on the Karelian Isthmus. Theextent of the Russian success was not yet known, but the Finnsadmitted that they had withdrawn between the River Vuoksi andthe Gulf of Finland. The Russians claimed to have reached apoint 4 miles from Vipuri, and to have isolated the Koivisto coastalbatteries. The exact situation, however, was by no means clear. it seemed probable that the Finns had withdrawn a distance of about miles, but they had another 4 miles to retire before they wouldbe driven out of the narrow part of the Isthmus.In the Kitela area 2 Russian divisions had broken up into smalldetachments protected by tanks. The Finns had been unable to mopthese up, but were wearing them down by continual sniping attacks.On all the other fronts the general position was satisfactory.The War Cabinet Took note of the above statement, and of the undertaking by the Secretary of State for War to circulate a table showing the comparative strengths of the German and allied land forces.Weekly Resume.        4.   The War Cabinet had before them the Weekly Resume(Previous (No. 24) by the Chiefs of Staff of the Naval, Military and AirReference; Situation.W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 4.)
361W.M. 46 (40)The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that the FirstLord of the Admiralty had raised the question whether the Resumeshould be prepared weekly or monthly.In discussion, the view was expressed that this Resume was a document of great value, but that its preparation must involve the staffs in considerable work. It was also felt that a reduction inthe number of Reports issued to Ministers was desirable.It was pointed out that this Resume was issued to Ministersnot in the War Cabinet, and that copies were also sent to theDominion Prime Ministers (excluding Eire) and to the UnitedKingdom High Commissioners in the Dominions for their information.The Minister without Portfolio said that the issue of Reportsat weekly intervals (as had been the practice in the Great War) hadadvantages from a historical point of view.The view generally held was, however, that the disadvantages of issuing these Resumes at monthly intervals were counter-balanced by the saving in the time of the Staffs concerned, and bythe fact that in a monthly review it was possible to obtain a somewhat better perspective.The War Cabinet-(i) Took note of the Weekly Resume No. 24 (W.M. (40) 56).(ii) Agreed that in future the Resume should be preparedmonthly, and not weekly,(iii) Agreed   that   the   Departmental   Operations   Reportshitherto presented to the War Cabinet should now be dispensed with.Frequency ofsubmission.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 24thConclusions,Minute 10.)(previous reference:W.M. (40) 41stConclusions,Minute 4.)Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 44thConclusions,Minute 4.)Message fromM. Daladier asto supply of aircraft.5. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that theFrench Ambassador had called on him that morning to convey a personal message from M. Daladier about the provision of assistanceto the Finns.M. Corbin had represented that the French Government felt the situation in Finland was so grave that it was essential to expedite the despatch of assistance. They suggested that Britishbomber aircraft should be flown out, disguised with Finnishmarkings. The French Military Attache in Helsingfors hadreceived information that there was extreme confusion in theRussian rear areas, and heavy air attack on these areas wouldprobably put an effective stop to any further advance of the russian forces. M. Daladier was very anxious indeed that British bombersshould be sent for this purpose, and he had accordingly arranged for his message to be delivered personally to the Prime Minister.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence suggested that weshould lend a squadron or two of heavy bombers to the Finns for alimited period, to carry out the operation suggested by the french military Attache.The Chief of the Air Staff pointed out that there was no ground organisation in Finland which could maintain these aircraft. Without it, their efficiency would be very greatly reduced.According to information received from a Finnish air officer nowin London, there was no shortage of air personnel in Finland. Allthat was required was material.The Secretary of State for Air observed that we had already sent considerable quantities of aircraft to Finland, and acceptedserious risks in doing so. He did not think that we could give the many further assistance.
Possibility of accelerating the arrival ofmaterial.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Field, guns. Continuing, the Prime Minister said that the French were sending 36 75-mm. guns, which were being embarked on the19th February, and they were also despatching French artilleryexperts by air to Finland.A record of certain further information given to the WarCabinet by the Prime Minister is contained in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The Chief of the Air Staff said that all possible steps werebeing taken to accelerate the despatch of air material to Finland.The Air Ministry were investigating the possibility of fitting extratanks on aircraft in order that they might be flown out instead ofbeing crated and shipped.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that at least amonth must be allowed, under present conditions, between thedespatch of material from a British or French port and its arrival in Finland. Railway experts had been sent to Sweden already, butthe worst congestion was probably in Finland itself.The discussion then turned on the suggestion by Mr. NoelBaker that an Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committee should beset up with plenary powers to expedite the despatch of material to finland. It was pointed out that a large number of departments were involved, and that in most cases Ministerial authority for thedespatch of material was necessary. The proposal of Mr. NoelBaker was generally thought to offer no hope of accelerating thesupply of material.During the discussion it became clear that we were seriouslyin need of more exact information regarding conditions in Finland.The reports which were received from various sources differedwidely, and we did not know, for example, whether the Finns had,in fact, the ground organisation and flying personnel necessary to operate additional aircraft; nor did we know how much of ourmaterial had actually arrived, or what use was being made of it.It was suggested that Brigadier Ling should be instructed tofurnish an immediate report on his arrival, if the new Air Attachehad not yet reached Finland.The War Cabinet-(i) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to expedite as faras possible the arrival of the new Air Attache,(ii) Invited the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and theChief of the Air Staff, in consultation, to arrange for animmediate report to be submitted by Brigadier Ling asfollows : (a) What aircraft, aircraft stores, and major items ofmilitary equipment from France and the UnitedKingdom had reached Finland.(b) What use was being made by the Finns of thematerial already supplied, and what further assistance in equipment and/or technical personnel they particularly required.(c) Whether there was available in Finland the groundorganisation and/or flying personnel which wouldenable additional aircraft to operate usefully.Supply of mili-tary information from Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 3.)Italy. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that heEconomic had now had an opportunity of discussing with the Master of therelations. Rolls the situation created by the breakdown of the recent economic(Previous negotiations with Italy.Reference: It seemed clear that the collapse of the negotiations wouldW.M. (40) 44th  cause Italy serious economic difficulties, both in disposing of herConclusions, horticultural produce and in securing coal. Not only would ItalyMinute 6.)
363W.M. 46 (40) &apos;       22 &apos;mbe unable to obtain coal from the United Kingdom to make good the loss of the coal imports from Germany which would now be stopped, but she would be unable to obtain her full normal supplies from this country through inability to provide the necessaryforeign exchange. The Master of the Rolls was satisfied thatleading Italian industrialists were well aware that such difficulties,when they arose, would result from the Duce&apos;s decision and would do their utmost to secure its modification. The Master of the Rollsthought, therefore, that, while we should be neither vindictive norweak, our proper course would be to adopt a polite but firm line.The Minister for Economic Warfare would have to answer inthe House of Commons on the following day a question byMr. Shinwell, asking whether German coal loaded in Italian ships at Rotterdam for Italy was subject to contraband control. He (theForeign Secretary) had discussed this matter with the Minister for economic Warfare and the Master of the Rolls, and agreed thatthe former should reply that German coal exports to Italy wouldbe stopped &quot; at an early date.&quot; The Master of the Rolls felt that,before we stopped ships carrying German coal to Italy, we should notify the Italian Government of the date as from which we proposed to put this decision into operation, and had suggested thatthe date should be the 8th March, 1940.The Prime Minister enquired whether the proposal was thatwe should stop ships which had sailed with German coal after the8th March, 1940, or whether it was proposed that after the8th March we should stop all ships carrying German coalencountered on the high seas, irrespective of the date on which theyhad started their voyage.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that the master of the Rolls had meant the former.The Prime Minister was averse from giving the Italian Govern-ment too long notice of the date as from which German coal exports would be stopped, lest they should take steps in the intervening period to expedite the sailing of Italian ships with German coal.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that our best coursewould be to make the decision operate as from the 1st March, 1940,but to apply it only to ships which left port after that date.The Secretary of State for Air said that, according to his information, very strong pressure was being brought to bear uponthe Duce, and for this reason he felt that the earlier of the two dateswas preferable.The Prime Minister said that, once the Italians knew that thedate had been fixed, and that it was imminent, those who were opposed to the Duce&apos;s decision would redouble their efforts to secure its modification.The War Cabinet agreed (a) that, in answering a question on the subject in the Houseof Commons on the 20th February, 1940, the Ministerfor Economic Warfare should confine himself to sayingthat German seaborne exports of coal to Italy would be stopped at an early date;(b) that, unless His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, were tobring forward important arguments in favour of a later date, the Italian Government should be informed thatany ship which left port after the 1st March, 1940,carrying German coal for Italy would be stopped andits cargo subjected to enemy export control.
Roumania.Oil policy:supply of equip-ment and rawmaterials.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 38thConclusions,Minute 6.)PermanentCourt ofInternationalJustice.The optional clause.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that his interview with M. Tilea, the Roumanian Minister, had been delayed, but he was seeing him that afternoon. He hoped that atthis meeting M. Tilea would hand him the answer of the roumanian government to the question raised in the aide-memoire on thesubject.of the supply of equipment and raw materials which he had handed to him on the 30th January, 1940.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.8. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (G.) (40) 50) covering a draft despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris dealingwith the future policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regardto the Optional Clause of the Statute of the Permanent Court ofInternational Justice. The despatch instructed the ambassador to enquire whether the French Government would agree to ourterminating our acceptance of the Optional Clause as soon aspossible, and simultaneously depositing a fresh acceptance, whichwould repeat our 1930 reservations, and would add to them a reservation of disputes arising at a time when His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are engaged in hostilities.Our initial ten-year period of acceptance of the optional clause had expired on the 5th February, 1940. The matter was oneof some urgency, since proceedings arising out of the exercise ofour belligerent rights might be started against us at any time. TheForeign Secretary therefore proposed to invite the Secretaries ofState for Dominion Affairs and for India to consult with theDominion Governments and with the Government of India at thesame time as the French Government were being consulted.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet (a) approved   the   draft   despatch   to   Paris   attached   toW.P. (G.) (40) 50;(b) agreed that the Dominion Governments and the Govern-ment of India should be taken into consultation at thesame time as the French Government.Scandinavia. 9.
