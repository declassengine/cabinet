1. The Secretary of State for Air said that bad weather had again hampered air operations.One unidentified aircraft had been plotted off the Suffolk coast,but had not been intercepted.A number of floating mines had been seen near the leave boatBiarritz, in a position off the French coast, not far from that inwhich one or two ships had recently been sunk.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that he had heard from Lord Riverdale that a. number of floating mines had beenexploded by destroyers in the Channel, not far from the ship inwhich he was returning from Canada. From the description, it didnot appear as if these mines, which, from their position, must almost certainly be our own mines broken adrift from the Dover Barrage,had been rendered safe.The First Sea Lord said that he would have this informationinvestigated.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 6thConclusions,Minute 1.)The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 6thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Sea Lord said that the S.S. Egton, 4,300 tons,had reported, from a position 10 miles N.N.W. of Cadiz, that shewas being attacked by a submarine. The outcome was not yet known.The East coast convoys had been somewhat delayed by fog, but were now sailing again.Magnetic Mines. Further operations had been carried out with the new devices(Previous fQr dealing with magnetic mines.   Two of these had proved highlyReference:W.M.

The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatconfirmation had now been received of the Finnish victory over the44th Russian Division, near Suomussalmi, which had been reportedin the newspapers. The Finnish Headquarters had been bombedout of Mikkali, and had had to move elsewhere.There was nothing to report from the Western Front.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Western Front.possible german attackon holland and/or Belgium.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 116thConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Lord Privy Seal enquired whether the General staff had any confirmation of the report, which had appeared in the daily Telegraph, that Hitler&apos;s Headquarters had been moved to apoint opposite the Dutch frontier.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that no informa-tion on this- point had been received.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the reportfitted in with the suggestion made by Count Ciano to Sir percy loraine, that the danger to Holland and Belgium was once moreacute.He (the Foreign Secretary) had seen the Belgian Ambassador,and the Dutch Minister, and had passed on the hint with all reserve the Belgian Ambassador had himself some information which
pointed in the same direction. The Dutch Government had made asatisfactory public statement to the effect that they would resistif any part of their territory were attacked, and he had suggested to the Belgian Ambassador that M. Spaak might make it known that, if Germany attacked Holland. Belgium would go to her assistance. The Belgian Ambassador had agreed that a statement on these lines would be useful.In the course of subsequent discussion the Lord Privy Sealenquired whether steps were taken by the Intelligence sta,ffs to find out where newspapers received information of this type, with a viewto checking its accuracy.It was pointed out that the German Government had developed a system whereby foreign newspapers could be fed with the kind ofinformation which the Germans wished to put about, as part oftheir campaign for keeping neutral nations in a state of anxiety.It was not likely that Hitler, who strongly believed in the efficacyof the sudden blow, would allow information of his real intentionsto leak out.Nevertheless, the possibility that, as a result of the non-successof his naval campaign, Hitler might be seeking a fresh outlet couldnot be entirely discarded.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Turkey.agreement reached onoutstanding-financial andtrade questions:&quot;suspensiveclause &quot; to bebrought toan end.(previous reference:&quot;W.M. (39) 118thConclusions,Minute 13.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theprevious evening the following agreements had been signed in Pariswith M. Numan Menemencioglu, the Secretary-General of theTurkish Foreign Office : (i)  25 million armaments credit,(ii)  15 million gold loan.(iii) (a)  2 million clearing loan.(b) Additional agreement.(iv) Chrome,(v) Sultanas.(vi) Protocol cancelling Article 6 of the Special Agreement.The general effect was that we had secured an agreement asregards chrome which debarred the sending of any supplies from turkey to Germany for the duration of the war or for a period ofnot less than two years: that we had undertaken to purchase a large quantity of sultanas; and that the Suspensive Clause would bebrought to an end immediately upon the arrival at Ankara of thegold promised to Turkey for the gold loan. Arrangements werebeing made for the gold to be conveyed by French cruiser fromMarseilles, and it was expected that it would reach Ankara not later than the 27th January.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a particularly satis-factory feature of the settlement arrived at was that all theagreements reached, except No. (iii), were tripartite agreementsjoined in by the French as well as ourselves. This provided anadmirable example in practice of the French and ourselves working-together in the spirit of the agreement which he had made withM. Eeynaud, though for special reasons the proportions in whichthe two countries were to find the funds required under these agreements were not those provided for in the Eeynaud agreement.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.
The Balkans. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionBulgaro- to telegram No. 18 from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Sofia, reportingTurkish that, as a result of consultations, the Turkish Minister had nowEelations. produced the text of a draft Declaration to serve as a basis for(Previous discussion  between M.  Numan  Meneraencioglu,   the   Secretary-Reference:        Genera] of the Turkish Foreign Office, on his arrival at Sofia, andW.M. (40) 3rd    the Bulgarian Government.   The general effect of this draft was conclusions,      that the Bulgarian and Turkish Governments would undertake, in minute 11.)       the intei^ests of the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, to make ittheir business to collaborate with a view to strengthening theirfriendship and to preserving the neutrality of Bulgaria fromintimidation. It would be very satisfactory if it were found possibleto secure a Declaration by the two Governments on these lines.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Far Eastern 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionSituation. to telegram No. 19 (11.). dated the 9th January, 1940, from HisJapanese plans Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, reporting that the Japanese plans for the establish- for the establishment of a Central Government in China underment of a Wang Ching-wei, which had been approved by the MilitaryCentral authorities and by the Asiatic Development Council at the end ofGovernment in the previous week, bad that day been submitted first to the CabinetChina. Advisory Council and later to a special meeting of the Cabinet, by(Previous both of which bodies these plans had been approved.   After the reference:        meeting of the Cabinet, a statement had been issued which, afterW.M. (39) 113th quoting the Konoye statement of the 3rd November and theConclusions,      22nd December, 1938, went on to say that the movement for the minute 9.)       establishment of a contact with the Central Government had nowgathered strength, that the time was now ripe for further progress,that careful study had revealed that what was in the mind of WangChing-wei was in consonance with the declared intentions of Japan,and that in consequence the Japanese Empire would direct allpossible efforts to assist the formation and expansion proposed forthe new Government under Wang Ching-wei.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Scandinavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 6thConclusions,Minute 8.)Anglo-soviet negotiations:Summer 1939.Publication of blue Book.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 103rdConclusions,Minute 12.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a state-ment on the subject of Scandinavia. Particulars of this statement and of the conclusion reached by the War Cabinet are recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thedraft of the Blue Book proposed to be presented to Parliamentrelating to the abortive Anglo-Soviet negotiations of the summer of 1939 had now been completed. Its preparation had taken longer than had been anticipated, owing partly to reluctance&apos; in the firstinstance on the part of the French Government and partly to acertain nervousness on the part both of the Roumanians and ofthe Turks. In its present form, the Blue Book contained the text(subject to a few minor excisions) of all the relevant documents,together with a short preface drawing attention in a non-controversial way to the trend of events covered by the Documents.At one time it had been suggested that the preface should be of aspirited nature, but he had deprecated this, since he had not wishedto excite public opinion in this country too violently against theSoviet Government.    In face of the Soviet aggression against
Finland, there seemed now still less reason for such a preface, since there were few people left in this country willing to make excusesfor the Soviet Union.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of the criticism which had been levelled against the Government in thismatter right up to the outbreak of the war, he hoped that the BlueBook would make it clear that the reason why our negotiations withthe U.S.S.R. had failed was precisely because we had declined to expose the Baltic States to the risk of indirect aggression at thehands of the Soviet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thoughtthat this point was made quite clear in the present draft. Hethought, however, that it would be useful if he could circulate thedraft to the War Cabinet for the observations of his colleagues.The War Cabinet took note That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposedto circulate the draft of the proposed Blue Book relatingto the Anglo-Soviet negotiations of 1939.Richmond Terrace, S. W. 1,January 9, 1940.
