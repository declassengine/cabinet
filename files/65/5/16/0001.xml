The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air said that air activity hadSituation. been almost entirely prevented by the weather, and, apart from a(Previous certain number of routine patrols, there was nothing of interest to reference: report.WM.

(40) 15thConclusions,Minute 6.)Counter-measuresagainstmagnetic mines.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that extremely bad weather had hampered naval activity.The cruiser which had been sent to intercept the Trautenfels,which was believed to be in difficulties off the Norwegian coast, hadbeen recalled, as there was reason to think that the Trautenfels had gone into a Norwegian anchorage.A report of the sighting of a German warship near Iceland had proved to be a false alarm.The following sinkings by enemy action were reported : Steamship Josephine Charlotte (3,422 tons), Belgian, sunk by mine off the North Foreland. The ship had been off the proper course.Steamship Inverdargle (9,400 tons), British tanker loaded withaviation spirit, mined or torpedoed off Lynmouth, North Devon.No survivors had yet been discovered.Destroyers had carried out a sweep off the Dutch coast two.nights before, but had only picked up one Latvian ship, which hadbeen sent in for examination.The First Lord then gave an account of his visit with.M.S. Vernon, and of the successful developments in connectionwith magnetic mining which he had been shown.A number of sweeping devices were proving successful inpractice, and it remained to discover by experience which would prove the most economical.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Western Front.Possibility ofGermaninvasion ofBelgium.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 15thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there were nooperations to report on the Western Front. Leave from the british expeditionary Force would be resumed on the following day.The Prime Minister referred to telegram No. 19 from Belgium,in which our Ambassador reported a talk with the Belgian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, in the course of which the latter had said thatthe Belgian Government regarded tripartite Staff Conversations asundesirable from the political point of view, but that full informa-tion would be given to ourselves and the French by the BelgianGeneral Staff.It was pointed out, in discussion, that this statement hardlyaccorded with the information given in telegram No. 14, that information was now in envelopes, which would be handed to ourService Attached on the outbreak of war.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that this would obviously be an unsatisfactory arrangement. Operations would bemuch hampered unless a joint plan with the Belgians had been previously prepared. The War Office were, however, preparing a questionnaire to transmit to the Belgian staff, so that as muchinformation as possible could be obtained.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had sent a telegram (No. 9) to Sir L. Oliphant, which had crossedtelegram No. 19.   In this he had emphasised the importance of[20671] b 2
securing full information from the Belgians forthwith. He did notthink it would be advisable to try to pursue the matter further until a reply had been received to this telegram.There was some speculation as to the German motive infrightening the Belgians and thus inevitably driving them into closer contact with us. It was thought unlikely that they wouldhaAre done this except as cover for a move elsewhere. On the otherhand, it might be that they hoped, by constant scares which came to nothing, to lull us into a false sense of security.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Weekly Reports.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 8thConclusions,Minute 5.)4.   The War Cabinet took note of the following Reports : (1) Weekly Report (No. 19) by the Secretary of State for Air(W.P. (40) 19).(2) Weekly Report (No. 19) by the Secretary of State for War(W.P. (40) 20).Finland.MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 15thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Secretary of State for War said that the situation in finland, according to the latest reports, was as follows : Karelian Isthmus. A Russian attack on the Eastern portionof the sector had been repulsed with losses on both sides.North of Lake Ladoga. Two Russian Divisions were reportedto be still in difficulties. The 168th Division was said to have had3,200 casualties since the beginning of hostilities, and the replace-ments were of very poor quality. Self-inflicted wounds among theRussians were of common occurrence.Salla. The Finnish operations were developing slowly.Extreme North. No information available.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 15thConclusions,Minute 11.)Aircraft.Anti-aircraft guns.6. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that thequestion of assistance to Finland had been discussed by the military co-operation-ordination Committee on the previous day. Their meeting hadbeen attended by Brigadier Ling, who had reported that.Field-Marshal Mannerheim was particularly in need of war material,more especially fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft weapons. air attacks on Finnish communications and factories were causing great difficulties. He also wanted reinforcements of about 30,000 trained men by next May, when his own. troops would be exhausted through lack of reserves and rest.A good deal of material was already being sent to Finlan&quot;d bythe French and ourselves. In all, some 169 aircraft were being dispatched to Finland from various sources. Unfortunately, wecould not spare any modern fighter aircraft, of which the Finnswere particularly in need, and which would certainly play havocwith the Russian bombers. The War Office were letting the Finnshave all the equipment which could be spared without seriousdetriment to the efficiency of our own forces.The Finns were particularly short of heavy anti-aircraft guns.It had been found that the Russians did not attempt to attack anyplace which was defended by guns, but the Finns had practicallynothing but Bofors light guns, which were only of use against low-flying attack. The Military Co-ordination Committee intended toexamine the possibility of releasing some 3-inch -&quot;guns fromA.D.G.B. The problem, however, was a difficult one, since A.D.G.B.was still far short of its full requirements.   The general feeling of
the Committee had been that we should do as much as we possiblycould for the Finns so long as we did not seriously whittle away ourown security.Volunteers. As regards personnel,  Brigadier Ling had  expressed theopinion that volunteers would be of little value in Finland, at this time of year owing to the climatic conditions. They might bringonly discredit upon this country. On the other hand, it would bedifficult, for political reasons and in view of public opinion in thiscountry, to take the line that we should send no volunteers at all.Offers had been received from private individuals to raise volunteerunits, and even to pay for them.The Committee had felt that any volunteers allowed to go to finland should be carefully selected. It seemed necessary, therefore,to set up a small unofficial bureau, preferably under the aegis of theFinnish Legation. Mr. Gibson, who had been associated with thework of the Spanish Non-intervention Committee, seemed to be themost suitable person to run the bureau. It would be necessary togive him assistance from official sources sub rosa. If this were done,it would be possible to ensure that only the very best personnelwere accepted. General MacDonogh did not wish to be associatedwith an organisation on such a small scale as was now contemplated,and the Committee had accordingly asked him (the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence) to inform General MacDonogh that inthe circumstances his services would not be required except perhaps in an advisory capacity.The Committee had then considered what could be done aboutsending the additional assistance, up to, say, 20,000 men, for whichField-Marshal Mannerheim asked in the early summer. It wouldbe out of the question to raise a force of this size without the officialhelp of the War Office. The difficulty would then be to induce the swedes to allow such a large body to pass through their country to finland. If an attempt was made to put them in at Petsamo, thiswould mean the use of a larger force altogether, in view of the certainty of Russian resistance. It seemed therefore that any large measure of assistance to Finland in the summer would have to bein the form of a properly organised expedition, even though this might involve general hostilities with Russia. The Committee had asked that a complete scheme for effective intervention in Finlandby next May should be drawn up by the General Staff. This matter should clearly be considered in conjunction with other projects.Moreover, before any plans could be made for sending an expeditionto Finland through Sweden, Staff conversations with Sweden wouldbe necessary.Proceeding, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat he had had a conversation the previous day with M. Wallen-berg, who had come to him officially in the hope of obtaining armsfor Sweden. He had pointed out to M. Wallenberg that we could-not supply arms for Sweden except at the cost of denying them to finland. M. Wallenberg had said that opinion in Sweden was greatly divided as to the desirability of seeking the assistance ofthe Allies against the possibility of a Russian invasion. There were many in the country who thought that the Western Powers did notdispose of sufficient strength, and that it would be better for sweden to seek the aid of Germany. If this was the case, there was all themore reason for having a considerable force ready to despatch to scandinavia, since this might tip the balance in our favour whenthe critical moment came.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that theexistence of such a force would be likely to have a great influence on the attitude of Sweden, which must be largely dictated by fear.Unfortunately, Sweden was at the present time behaving in a mostdiscreditable fashion over the despatch of assistance to Finland.She had pleaded with us not to involve her in difficulties in regardto the Narvik traffic, on the ground that such action would
embarrass her in her efforts to aid Finland. Now, when we wanted to send assistance to Finland, she was again pleading with us notto do so, for fear of embarrassing her in other directions. He agreedthat it would be out of the question to send any large number of volunteers, but if, through the proposed bureau, a small body wascollected, he would certainly be in favour of bringing every pressure to bear on Sweden to allow them to pass through to Finland.Some discussion then took place on the proposal to set up asmall bureau for the reception of volunteers. It was urged, on theone hand, that the numbers of suitable personnel who could be foundwould be so small as to be likely only to bring ridicule upon thiscountry. Nothing but the very best men could be sent, particularlyin view of the high state of morale in Finland at the present time.In any case, it seemed likely that the Finns would collapse in Mayunless substantial help was then sent to them, and that anyvolunteers who went would be involved in their disaster. TheGovernment would therefore be taking a great responsibility if itencouraged volunteers in any way.On the other hand, it was argued that the setting up of the bureau would prevent indiscriminate recruitment of undesirables.Politically, it would be extremely difficult for the Government toput a complete stoppage on the passage of all volunteers to Finlandby invoking the provisions of the Foreign Enlistment Act. the bureau would be run by the Finnish Legation, and the Governmentwould therefore have no responsibility towards the volunteers. any necessary assistance fom official sources would be givenclandestinely.It was also suggested that it would be desirable to obtain information from France as to what attitude the French were taking in regard to the despatch of volunteers to Finland.The War Cabinet agreed (1) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs toascertain what attitude was being taken by the french as to the despatch of volunteers to Finland, and tocommunicate this information to the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence.(2) To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, in thelight of the discussion in the War Cabinet and of theinformation obtained as to the attitude of the FrenchGovernment, to explore with the Finnish Minister inLondon the suggestion that a small unofficial bureaushould be established in London for the recruitment of volunteers.(3) To invite the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence toreport the result of these enquiries to the War Cabinet.Turkey.Relations with bulgaria.Visit to Sofiaby theSecretary-General of theTurkishMinistry forForeign Affairs.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 7thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hiscolleagues would have seen telegram No. 47, of the 15th January,from Ankara reporting the results of the visit to Sofia by theSecretary-General of the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs.Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen reported that both the turksh foreign Minister and M. Numan were thoroughly satisfied with the visit. The former had stated that, in addition to the resultsannounced in the published communique, there was an oral under-standing- (ft) that Bulgaria would not attack any of her neighbours;(6) that she would defend herself against any attack;(c) that there would be periodic exchanges of informationbetween the two Governments;(d) that, if a crisis arose, Bulgaria would not act without consulting the Turkish Government.
The Foreign Minister had added that M. Numan had expressedthe view that, as things now stood, there was definite hope of doinggood work with Bulgaria and of drawing her nearer to the BalkanEntente.The Foreign Secretary thought that M. Numan&apos;s visit to Sofiahad been thoroughly satisfactory from our own point of view. Itshould be on record that the initiative in arranging the visit had come from our Minister in Sofia.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Vatican.possible development ofGerman policy.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet certain information regarding an audience which the Popehad granted to Mr. Osborne, His Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Holy See.Particulars of this information are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Scandinavia.(previous preference:W.M. (40) 15thConclusions,Minute 12.)9. Discussion took place on a proposal that a Mission, headed by a Member of the War Cabinet, should proceed to Scandinavia.In this connexion the War Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (40) 25).An account of the discussion, and of the conclusions reached,is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 17, 1940.
