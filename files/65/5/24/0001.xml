The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 23rdConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat 18 Blenheims of Bomber Command had carried out a short,sweep of the North Sea on the previous day.A total of 45 Fighter Patrols, involving 142 aircraft, had beensent up. The usual routine anti-submarine patrols, reconnaissancesand convoy escorts had been flown by aircraft of Coastal Command.There had been no important enemy air activity.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff confirmed a report whichhad appeared in that morning&apos;s press that one of our reconnaissance aircraft had been shot down over Duisberg on the previous day. Theaircraft was one belonging to the Air Component, and had been carrying out a routine reconnaissance of the Ruhr.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 23rdConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet certain particulars about the present dispositions of the Home Fleet.An aircraft, believed to be a Heinkel, had appeared overLiverpool about 1 - 30 p.m. on the previous da)^. There was no truth in the report which had been broadcast by the B.B.C. the previous evening of a raid on the Shetlands by German aircraft; the aircraft in question had been our own.At 8-30 p.m. on the previous day the Latvian steamshipEverene (4,434 tons) and the Norwegian steamship Gudveig(1,300 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk off the Farne Islands,Northumberland. All traffic between the Tyne and Methii had been stopped, and escort vessels were hunting.H.M.S. Vanquisher, which had been hunting a submarine inthe Bristol Channel since the 24th, had made three attacks on theprevious evening on a. very good contact with what was believed tobe a U-boat. The results had been promising and the Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches, had ordered divers to investigate.A submarine had been sighted off Peterhead at 11 p.m. on theprevious evening and was being hunted.The Outward-bound Norwegian Convoy was on its way, and thenext Homeward-bound convoy was due to leave Norway shortly.The Commander-in-Chief. China, had reported that on the21st January a British registered launch had been seized by a japanese trawler inside British territorial waters near Hong Kong.It had been detained for four hours, the crew had been beaten, andthe British flag had been hauled down. After search alongside a japanese destroyer, the launch had eventually been released.The First Lord gave the War Cabinet further particulars ofthis incident from a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, China,which he then handed to the Foreign Secretary, who said that hewould take the matter up.The First Lord also described the progress which was being-made with the devices for dealing with the magnetic mine.In reply to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Chief of naval staff said that there was no further news about the results of the attack which had been carried out on a U-boat near whereH.M.S. Exmouth had been sunk, but it was hoped to send divers to investigate.:20723]
The MilitarySituation.Western front and Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 23rdConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.There was little news from Finland, though, north of lake ladoga, the Finns had repulsed some attacks : there had been alull in Russian air activities.In reply to an enquiry, the Deputy Chief of the Air staff said that 11 &quot;out of the 12 long-nosed Blenheims which it had recentlybeen decided to supply to the Finns had arrived in Finland.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.Recruitment of volunteers.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 21stConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of certaindevelopments which had taken place since they had authorised the setting up by the Finnish Minister of a Recruiting Officer for volunteers in this country. The Finnish Minister had wished to constitute a Committee to assist him in the management of andraising funds for the Force which would be raised through thisRecruiting Office. He had invited Mr. Amery to be an active memberof the Committee. Mr. Amery had agreed and had suggested as members of the Committee some dozen persons, all of them well-known and many of them prominent in political life. The namessuggested included Mr. Attlee and Sir Archibald Sinclair. Allthese gentlemen had been approached and some of them had promised to join the Committee and to form the executive, while others had agreed to help. Mr. Attlee and Sir Archibald Sinclair had expressed their sympathy with the aims of the Committee, but had not committed themselves to active assistance. Later they had made enquiries as to why they had not been approached officially, asthey evidently were under the impression that the Government wasgiving active assistance to the Committee.The Prime Minister said that it was very doubtful whetherit was desirable that a Committee of the type suggested should beset up. It was apparently intended to keep the names of theCommittee secret from the public, though how this was to be donewas not clear if the Committee was to be an active body. He thoughtit would be desirable to explain to Mr. Amery, who wasenthusiastically in favour of assistance to Finland, and no doubtvisualised thousands of volunteers being sent from this country, that what the Government had authorised was a Recruiting Office foran International Force which British subjects would be permitted to join, and that there were strong arguments against attempting to organise a British volunteer force on a large scale. In particular,if this were attempted, it was extremely likely that the volunteerswould not be granted passage through Norway and Sweden.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had had a letter from Mr. Amery, expressing the hope that we should do our utmost to support the Finns, and in particular would assist in the despatch of a volunteer force. In his reply, he had set outthe difficulties attending the despatch of volunteers, especially in large numbers, but had told him that the Government would approve the enlistment of British subjects in an International Force.After further discussion, it was agreed that the formation ofthe proposed Committee should be discouraged and that the best way of achieving this would be for the Foreign Secretary to see Mr. Amery and to set before him all the aspects of the problem asthey appeared to the Government. After this, it might be necessaryfor the Prime Minister to see Mr. Attlee and Sir Archibald Sinclair.The War Cabinet agreed : (i) That it was undesirable that a Committee should be setup on the lines proposed by the Finnish Minister andMr. Amery.
(ii) To invite the Foreign Secretary to see Mr. Amery and explain to him the views of the War Cabinet as expressedin the discussion, and the position generally in regardto recruitment of volunteers,(iii) To invite the Prime Minister to see Mr. Attlee andSir Archibald Sinclair, if he thought fit, after theForeign Secretary had explained matters to Mr. Amery.German-soviet relations.Alleged cessionto Germany bythe U.S.S.R. ofdistricts in poland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 20thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs said that hehad received a report from Mr. Middleton, until recently BritishVice-Consul at Cluj. Mr. Middleton stated that before leavingCluj he had had a conversation with the Roumanian Consul inLemberg&apos;, who had remained there up till the 5th January. Itappeared that it was the report of this Consul which had startedthe story about German occupation of districts in Eastern Galicia.The information given to Mr. Middleton by the Roumanian Consulmight be summarised as follows :  A German repatriation commission was at work inLemberg; it was working with Germanic thoroughness and hada large number of officials of all kinds and also doctors.A minute inventory was being made of every item of Germanproperty left behind in Galicia in order that the largest possiblebill might be presented by Germany to the Soviet Government.The commission was equipped with a large quantity of military transport, which was used for the removal of German refugees and their portable belongings. There was a considerablenumber of senior German Army Officers attached to this commission, but, apart from this, he (the Roumanian Consul)thought that all the Germans at Lemberg were engaged onlegitimate business; he added that at the most the commissiondid not represent more than a &quot;scouting party.&quot; He addedthat, on the other hand, a German colonel had told him &quot; weare coming in later.&quot;In making this report, Mr. Middleton had said that Germanpersonnel were operating the Galician oilfields, but that apart fromthis the Germans were not interfering with the administration ofthe district, which was being quite competently and humanely rununder Soviet control.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Roumania.Supply of equip-ment and rawmaterials.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 22ndConclusions,Minute 11.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thathe had received a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Minister, Bucharest(No. 65, dated the 23rd January, 1940), in which Sir ReginaldHoare reported having had a discussion with M. Gafencu, theRoumanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the subject of roumanian oil supplies to Germany. This telegram had crossed the telegram which he (the Secretary of State) had sent toSir Reginald Hoare in the light of the War Cabinefs decision atthe meeting noted in the margin. Sir Reginald Hoare now urgedthat no further action should be taken, and that he (the Secretaryof State) should not see M. Tilea, the Roumanian Minister inLondon, until the arrival in London (probably on the 29th January)of the representative of the Ministry of Economic Warfare and the petroleum Department, who was on his way back from Bucharest.He (the Secretary of State) had been in consultation Avith theMinister without. Portfolio, and was disposed to agree to take nofurther action until the arrival in London of the representative ofthe Ministry of Economic Warfare.   He felt, however, that none
The Far East. 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that it wasRelations with clear that popular feeling in Japan was deeply stirred by theJapan: the case Asama Maru incident. There had been demonstrations in front of the S.S. of the British Embassy in Tokyo and also in front of the Consul-Asama Maru. GeneraFs office at Yokohama, where windows had been broken. In(Previous the early hours of that morning he had despatched two telegrams to reference:        His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo.   The first of these telegramsW.M. (40) 23rd   (No. 54) (the text of which had been settled the previous eveningConclusions,      after consultation with the Prime Minister and the First Lord of minute 4.)        the Admiralty) contained instructions to Sir Robert Craigie as tothe communication he should make to the Japanese Government,and followed the lines agreed upon by the War Cabinet at their previous Meeting.   The second of these telegrams (No. 55) was anexposition of the legal position prepared by the Legal Adviser to theForeign Office.The Prime Minister enquired whether it was thought thatthere was any danger, in view of the inflamed state of public opinion in Japan, that personal violence might be offered to Sir robert craigie.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he didnot think that such a development was likely; but he would bear the point in mind and would consider whether&apos; any precautionarysteps could be taken. He had arranged to send to the japanese ambassador in London the text of the second of the telegrams towhich he had referred, and the substance of the first, so that the ambassador might be fully aware of the communication which wewere making;&apos; to his Government. He had in mind also thepossibility of himself seeing the Ambassador again later in the day.He had no confirmation of the reports in that morning&apos;s Press that japanese shipping companies had decided to refuse passages to german nationals of military age. He proposed that a representa-tive of the News Department of the Foreign Office should meet theJapanese London Press correspondents and say that, whileexplaining that we felt bound to maintain all our rights, we were well disposed towards Japan and were anxious for her friendship.It was necessary to bear in mind the profound shock to publicopinion in Japan caused by this incident occurring &quot; almost underthe guns of Yokosuka.&quot; Nevertheless, he believed that the JapaneseGovernment would welcome a settlement, and that, if such a settle-ment were now secured, it would only be because this incident had occurred.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.The Vatican.Anglo-Vaticanrelations.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thathe had received a letter from Sir Percy Loraine stating that, when mr. Osborne had last been received by the Pope, His Holiness had said that he would be glad to have an opportunity of meeting him(Sir Percy Loraine). In enquiring whether there would be any objection to his being received at the Vatican, Sir Percy Lorainehad said that he would first inform Count Ciano and enquire whether the Italian Government saw any objection.the less we should in the meanwhile continue to hold up the despatchof consignments to Roumania.The War Cabinet Took note of the above statement, and agreed not to liftthe ban on the despatch of consignments to Roumania.
Eire.Internal politi-cal situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 4thConclusions,&apos;Minute 8.)9. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs gave particulars regarding the development of the internal politicalsituation in Eire. Particulars of this information are recorded inthe Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 26, 1940.It would be recalled that Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s predecessor(Lord Perth) had been received by the previous Pope, but he, ofcourse, had been a Roman Catholic. On the other hand, thesituation had changed as a result of the recent exchange of visitsbetween the Quirinal and the Vatican. He (the Secretary of State)had informed Sir Percy Loraine that he was not perturbed by-possible criticisms in this country, or by the clanger that such a visitmight be misinterpreted as indicating some further peace move bythe Pope. In his view, these considerations were outweighed by theneed for maintaining cordial relations between the Vatican and ourselves. The Pope had taken the initiative in this matter, and itwould be discourteous to send him a refusal. Subject, therefore, tothe suggested consultation with Count Ciano, he (the Secretary ofState) thought that Sir Percy Loraine should accept the Pope&apos;invitation.The War Cabinet agreed with this view.
