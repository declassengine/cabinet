West Indies:Report of RoyalCommission.Publication ofrecommenda-tions.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)Short-termreliefprogramme.1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (W.P. (G.) (40) 45) covering asummary of the recommendations of the West India RoyalCommission.The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalled that on theoccasion referred to in the margin the War Cabinet had decidedto withhold approval to the publication of the Report; and had invited him to communicate this decision to Lord Moyne and tothe Governors of the West Indian Colonies.The members of the Commission had been disappointed at theWar Cabinefs decision, and disagreed with it. Provided, however,that they were not associated with the decision, they were willingto help the Government, and had agreed to prepare a statementof their Recommendations which could be published on theCommission^ own authority.The Secretary of State proposed that the Command paper should consist of this Summary, plus the names and terms ofreference of the Commission, their itinerary, and a letter from himself to the Commission on the subject of the non-publicationof the body of their Report. The case for publishing theCommission^ recommendations was, he thought, overwhelming. Ifaccompanied by an announcement of the remedial measures to betaken, it would go far to allay the suspicions to which the non-appearance of the body of the Report would inevitably give rise.The Prime Minister said that he found nothing in the summaryto which the War Cabinet need take exception. The summarywould, he thought, be generally accepted as ample evidence of the comprehensive way in which the Commission had investigated thesocial, educational, economic, agricultural and other problems ofthe Islands. The Commissioners would certainly not be open to thereproach of timidity. They need not fear that their work would suffer in the public estimation by reason of the non-publication ofthe body of their Report. There was general agreement with thisview.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he had considered what explanation should be given for non-publicationof the body of the Report. It seemed the best solution to give no reason at all in public. Privately, however, the press might be told that while we would not have objected to-the Report if taken as a whole, the use by the enemy of selected extracts might havebeen damaging to us.General agreement was expressed with this view.The Colonial Secretary said that, as he envisaged the situationafter the publication of these documents, the Governments criticswould point to the fact that they contained no promise of any immediate relief to the West Indies. Something in the nature ofa. short-term jjolicy Avas obviously needed. He had reached agree-ment with the Treasury (who had been very helpful in this matter)on a short-term plan by which a sum of  350,000 Avould be made immediately available for relief and unemployment works in thevarious West Indian Islands.As regards the announcement of this short-term plan, he had considered the desirability of inserting a passage in the white paper on Colonial Development, immediately after paragraph 1.But he thought that the short-term plan, if it found a place inthe White Paper, might have the appearance of a panic measure,or a bribe. Accordingly, he proposed that, on the 20th February(the date on which the tAvo Command Papers Avere published inLondon), the West Indian Governors should be authorised to announce separately, each in his own Colony, the allocation of a specific sum for short-term purposes.[20841]b 2
A nnouncementof the Govern-ment&apos; s intentionto act in thespirit of theRoyalCommission&apos;srecommenda-tions.In discussion general agreement was expressed with theColonial Secretary&apos;s short-term plan. It was felt, however, that ashort passage should be introduced at the end of paragraph 1 toexplain that a sum was being made immediately available, as a first instalment of the long-term policy.Attention was drawn to paragraph 1 of the White Paper on colonial Development, in which it was stated that while theGovernment cannot commit themselves now to accept particularproposals, they are anxious to act as early as possible in the spiritof the recommendations of the Royal Commission as a whole.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought it impossible without more time for examination to go further at the moment.This passage itself would be definitely reassuring to the west indies, as it indicated that the Commission^ development and welfare recommendations in respect of the West Indies, costingsome  1,400,000 per annum, would find their place within the framework of the new comprehensive proposals for colonial development.The War Cabinet-(i) Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies toarrange for the publication, as a White Paper on the20th February, of the Recommendations of the WestIndia Royal Commission, in the form annexed to his memorandum W.P. (G.) (40) 45. together with suitableintroductory matter,(ii) Agreed that no reason should be given publicly for thenon-publication of the remainder of the Report of theRoyal Commission,(iii) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to add to paragraph 1 of the draft statement of policy on colonial development and Welfare and on Colonial Research(see Minute 2) a statement in general terms of theGovernments intention to take early action to give some measure of immediate assistance to the west indian Colonies.The colonial empire: State-ment of policy on development and welfare and on ColonialResearch.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)development and welfare.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies, to which was attached a draft statement of policy on Colonial Development and Welfare and on colonial Research (W.P. (G.) (40) 44).The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the recommen-dations of the West India Royal Commission included proposalsfor an expenditure of some  1,400,000 per annum from theExchequer, in order to enable the West Indian Colonies to reach areasonable standard of Government and social services. Conditionsthere were probably worse than in any other part of the Empire,partly because, with the exception of Trinidad, they had no mineral resources and practically no secondary industries and were thusentirely dependent upon agriculture; and partly because theirpopulation was relatively sophisticated and therefore expected social services of a fairly high order. But conditions were bad in some ofthe other Colonies also, and, generally speaking, they had not sufficient financial resources to provide themselves with the services which were required by present day standards.A survey in the Colonial Office of the needs of the Empiregenerally had led him to propose that the Exchequer should find upto  5 million per annum in order to enable the Colonies to bring their services up to a reasonable standard, (This figure included 1,400,000 for the West Indies.) If this were agreed, new legisla-tion would be necessary. The existing Colonial Development fund was limited to  1,000.000 per annum, and was also restricted in its
scope, as explained in his Memorandum. He therefore proposedthat the existing Colonial Development Fund should be abolished and that provision should be made for a new vote for colonial development and Welfare up to  5,000,000 per annum for the next ten years. Responsibility for making the. new grants would rest with the Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,but a new Advisory Committee would be set up on which he would propose to increase the official element to roughly half the membership.Eesearch. jje pr0p0se(jj jn addition, a separate vote of  500,000 a year for colonial Research and a Colonial Research Advisory Committee toadvise as to the expenditure of this sum. Again, the Secretary ofState and the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be responsible forthe actual allocation, but he was anxious to get advice through theCommittee from the best scientific minds in the country.Discussion ensued whether an advisory body of distinguishedscientists would be best suited to advise on the disposition of a fund of this character. Would scientists have sufficient experience of conditions in the Colonies to enable them to consider competing claims? Scientific specialists were perhaps apt to take a narrowview of claims outside their own particular field.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he contem-plated that full reports and information as to the work being-carried out in the Colonies would come before the AdvisoryCommittee, and also that they should be in touch with expert opinion in this country, e.g., through the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.They would be free to spend part of their funds on research workin this country if they thought fit. There would be an officialelement on the Committee, e.g., the Agricultural and MedicalAdvisers of the Colonial Office, and he bad in mind to suggestsomeone with wide Colonial experience as Chairman. For example,he might propose the appointment of Lord Hailey as Chairman bothof the Research Advisory Committee and of the Development and welfare Advisory Committee.There was general agreement with&apos; the view that it was important that there should be a strong non-specialist element onthe Research Advisory Committee and that the Chairman, inparticular, should be a man of broad experience. It was also urgedthat the Committee should be encouraged to concentrate on the major problems involved (e.g., those in which the bigger researchundertakings are interested), and not to become involved in minoradministrative detail.Mandated The Minister without Portfolio said that the publication of the territories. proposed statement of policy would be extremely valuable  inconnection with the activities of the Mandates Commission of theLeague of Nations.The Prime Minister suggested that, if it was contemplated that mandated territories should participate in the proposedExchequer grants on the same basis as Colonial territories, it was-very desirable to make a more conspicuous statement to this effectthan the passing reference contained in paragraph (3) of thestatement as drafted.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that his proposal was that the mandated territories should not be excluded from theproposed schemes, though they would not necessarily be treated onexactly the same basis as the Colonies. There would, for example,be no distinction between Tanganyika and Kenya, but it might benecessary to make some distinction in the case of a Class A mandatesuch as Palestine, where the Jewish community, at any rate, was[20841] b 3
relatively wealthy. He hoped, however, that the proposed fund would be used to assist Arab agricultural development in Palestine.There was general agreement that Mandated Territories shouldbe treated as on the same basis as Colonies in this matter, and thatit was desirable that this fact should be emphasised in the white paper.The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook to insert a paragraph in the draft statement on these lines.The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to paragraph 15 of thedraft statement, in which reference was made to the need forco-operation with the local Colonial authorities, and pointed outthat in certain cases the local legislatures would probably opposereforms.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that care would betaken to see that the proposed grants did not merely relieve theColonial Governments of their responsibilities; they would, in fact,be given only on condition that the Colonial Governments carriedout their share of the work. He agreed that it would be wise toinclude in the paragraph in question a reference to the&quot;responsibilities&quot; of the local legislatures as well as to their&quot;rights and privileges.&quot;The Minister without Portfolio said that, in the absence of theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, he would be seeing theDominion High Commissioners, and asked if there would be any objection to his informing them, as a matter of courtesy, of theGovernments proposal.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he saw noobjection and that he would be glad to draft a statement inconvenient form for this purpose. He thought, however, that itwould suffice if they were informed on the ensuing day.The view was generally expressed that the proposals in thedraft statement represented a very important and desirable develop-ment in British Colonial policy.The War Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to issue as a White Paper on the 20th February the statement ofpolicy on Colonial Development and Welfare and on colonial Research in the form annexed to his Memo-randum W.P. (G.) (40) 44, subject to its amendment tomeet the points made in the discussion (see also Minute 1).CompulsoryMilitaryService.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 119thConclusions,Minute 1.)Liability ofBritish subjects in Prance andFrench citizensin GreatBritain.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister ofLabour and National Service (W.P. (G.) (40) 43) as to the liability for compulsory military service of British subjects in France, andof French citizens in Great Britain.The Minister of Labour said that paragraph 3 (2) of theMemorandum had originally been drafted on the basis of the issueof a separate Proclamation for each age group to be called up. Wewere now following the plan of proclaiming, several age groups ata time. This paragraph had therefore been amended to referspecifically to the date on which the men in question would be&quot; required to register,&quot; if they were resident in Great Britain.
335W.M.42 (40).The schedule of Reserved Occupations would apply both to (i) British subjects who returned to this country in pursuanceof the Agreement,(ii) French subjects who elected to remain in this country.The next step would be the continuance of negotiations with theFrench Government, and, if these were successful, Parliament wouldbe asked to pass the necessary legislation, as in the Great War.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Minister of Labour and National. Service, as set out in their Memorandum W.P. (G.) (40) 43.4. The Secretary of State for Air said that Bomber command had carried out a sweep over the North Sea. but no enemy vessels had been sighted.A reconnaissance had been carried out over Borkum, Juist andNordeney, but no enemy warships or submarines had been seen. Iceconditions extended about five miles out to sea.There had been no enemy air activity off the British Isles.Seventy-two fighter patrols had been despatched during the day,involving 204 aircraft. The usual patrols had been flown by coastal command.There was no activity to report from the British air forces inFrance.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The air situation.(previous preference:W.M. (40) 41st-Conclusions,Minute 1.)The naval situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 41stConcl visions,Minute 2.)Search forGermanmerchantvessels.Shipping losses.U-boat sunk.U-boat sunk on12th February.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff gave the War cabinet certain details regarding the present movements of the Home Fleet.The hunt for the remaining four merchant ships which had left Vigo had continued during the previous day without result.The British Sultan Star (12,000 tons), carrying an importantcargo of meat, had been torpedoed South-West of Land&apos;s End onthe previous afternoon. Being a fast liner she had not been in convoy, and was the first fast ship which had been torpedoed.Three destroyers, who were within 30 miles, had arrived onthe scene and rescued the crew. These destroyers had obtained acontact close to the Sultan Star just after she had sunk, and had attacked. The U-boat had been seen to break surface and thendisappear in such a manner as to give reason for believing thatshe had been sunk.The British tanker Imperial Transport had been torpedoed150 miles West-north-west of the Butt of Lewis on the afternoon of the 11th February. Her bow had been blown off, but she was still able to steam 4 knots. She was being escorted home by a destroyer.Divers had arrived at the Clyde to examine the U-boat whichhad been sunk there./
The Military 6.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that thereSituation. was nothing to report from the Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 41stConclusions,Minute 3.)Western Front.Finland. The Finns had acknowledged losing certain positions in theSumma area. They were holding their own North of Lake Ladoga.In Central Finland they had succeeded in wiping out anotherRussian battalion.The general situation was reported to be stable. Though the finns were tired, there was no question of their being exhausted.The real reason for the seeming setback which they were nowsuffering was their lack of ammunition for field guns. This imposedvery severe restrictions on expenditure and meant that they hadto forego anything but the most profitable targets. They wereoutranged by an overwhelming concentration of some 600 Russianguns, but for all that their casualties had not been serious. by contrast, the Russians had lost some 80,000 to 90,000 killed, andtheir morale was deplorable.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 41stConclusions,Minute 5.)Supply of aircraft.Pilots.7. The Secretary of State far- Air informed the War Cabinetthat the final preparation of 12 short-nosed Blenheims was being completed, and that these would be ready to be flown to Finlandin ten days&apos; time.In this connection the Secretary of State for Air raised thequestion whether the War Cabinet would see any objection to these aircraft being flown to Finland by volunteer R.A.F. crews who would remain there to fight against the Russians. From the operationalpoint of view the opportunity of fighting in Finland would giveR.A.F. pilots and crews valuable training and experience. Therewould be no lack of volunteers. They would have to resign theircommissions, and special consideration would have to be given tosuch matters as their pay, non-effective benefits, and subsequentre-employment in this country. Some 24 volunteers might go to finland with the 12 Blenheims, but this initial step might involve us in further commitments, by way of reinforcements. Contingentsof volunteers might, with advantage, be sent out for pre-arrangedperiods and be relieved by succeeding contingents, on the lines whichhad been practised by the Germans and Italians in Spain.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saw no objectionfrom the political point of view, provided the personnel were represented as volunteers. The only objections he saw were thedifficulties which might be raised by Sweden and the embarrassmentwhich might be caused if British crews were taken prisoner bythe Russians. If, however, the War Cabinet were prepared toagree to volunteer air crews proceeding to Finland, might therenot be even greater advantage in sending British personnel withthe Hurricanes which were about to go to Finland ?
Field guns andammunition.Eail waydifficulties.Approach toFrance.The Lord Privy Seal considered that the despatch of Britishflying personnel to Finland would probably produce results out ofall proportion to their numbers, and lie was therefore strongly infavour of their going. General agreement was expressed with thisview provided that it was administratively practicable.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that orders hadbeen given for the immediate withdrawal of 30 field guns fromreserve for despatch to Finland in accordance with the decision taken by the War Cabinet on the previous day. In reply to thePrime Minister, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to report full details to the War Cabinet on the following day as tothe date when these guns and the ammunition for them would leave.General Gamelin&apos;s reply to a suggestion that field guns mightbe made available from France had not been favourable. the explanation, possibly, was that the French had sent all availablesurplus guns to the Balkans and, having regard to the ten additionalDivisions which they were in process of forming, were unable to spare any for Finland.Meanwhile, the 24 field howitzers, each with 2,000 rounds,already despatched from this country, had now arrived in Finland.They should shortly be in action and should go far to improve thesituation.Railway delays in Sweden has been partly due to the movingof two Swedish Divisions northwards to Boden. The position should improve as a result of the despatch of seven railway expertsfrom this country two to Sweden and five to Torneo, where theywere straightening out a considerable confusion of wagons, in close co-operation with the Finnish staff.The Lord Privy Seal thought it important that our transporta-tion experts should have a real knowledge of the Swedish railway system, and be of such standing as to be able to talk on level terms to the higher Swedish railway authorities.The Prime Minister said that he had seen the Finnish minister on the previous day and. had helped to reassure him. M. Gripenberghad asked whether we could, not intercede with the French. Inview of General GamelhVs reply to the appeal of the Chief of theImperial General Staff, be (the Prime Minister) thought it mightbe opportune for him to make a personal appeal to M. Daladier.He could say that the British Government had considered it worth Avhile to make considerable sacrifices on behalf of the Finns;and he could ask whether the French could not see their way to making similar sacrifices, particularly in regard to the possiblerelease of field guns, of which, the Finns had such great need.The War Cabinet (i.) Authorised the Secretary of State for Air if, on further investigation, a workable scheme could be devised, toarrange for a limited number of R.A.F. flying personnel to proceed to Finland, in the guise of volunteers, for thepurpose of fighting against Russia; such personnel toproceed with the Blenheim aircraft (or possibly with theHurricane aircraft) which were shortly to be sent toPinland.(ii) Invited the Prime Minister to address a personal appealto M. Daladier to release field guns and ammunition for Finland.(iii) Invited the Chief of the Imperial General Staff to reportto the War Cabinet at their meeting on the following-day details regarding the despatch to Finland of the30 field gUns and 30,000 rounds of ammunition.
Italy.economic relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 41stConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that thelatest telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome (Nos. 126,127 and 128, dated the 14th February, 1940), suggested thatthe prospects of obtaining the proposed Trade Agreement had become more unfavourable. In an interview on the 13th February,1940, Count Ciano had said that the Duce felt sure that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would understand that in view of his specialrelations with Germany, he could not honourably permit the sale tous or to France of guns, anti-aircraft guns, explosives and otherweapons of destruction. In the same conversation Count Ciano had again asked about German sea-borne coal; was any date fixed forits stoppage 1 Sir Percy Loraine had replied, not to his knowledge;he supposed that no action would be taken until the Master of the rolls had reached London and reported to the War Cabinet. Heimagined, however, that it was quite likely that seizures would begin in the following week. Count Ciano had then said : &quot; Assoon as that ? &quot; To which Sir Percy Loraine had contented himself with replying that the original date of enforcement had been mid-December last. As to Count Ciano&apos;s statement that Italy was nowrearming, Sir Percy Loraine had told him that if, as was probable,she was unable to obtain the necessary raw materials outside the sterling area, she would have to come to us to obtain them. If shesought such assistance, he (Sir Percy Loraine) thought that any british Government would inquire against whom the armamentsthus created were to be used, and would ask for guarantees against their being used against us or our Allies. The Italian Governmentcould therefore be under no illusions as to the nature of the situation created by Signor Mussolini&apos;s veto.The Prime Minister said that there were many forces in Italyanxious to secure the proposed Trade Agreement with us. He felt,therefore, that, if we did not act too hurriedly, there was a good chance that Italian policy might develop in the direction that we desired.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.internal situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 35thConclusions,Minute 7.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the WarCabinet certain information regarding the internal situation in italy. This information is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.The War Cabinet took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 15, 1940.
