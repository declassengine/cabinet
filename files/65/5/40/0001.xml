The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : Survey of the National Resources in relation to our War Effort.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering memorandum by Lord Stamp.  W.P. (G.) (40) 35.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. W.P.(40) 45.Memorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty.

(G.)(40)42.Equipment of the British A rmy.Report by the Military Co-ordination Committee. W.P.(40) 48.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Lord Stamp3s survey of the national resources in relation to our war effort was a documentof outstanding importance. It was not a Treasury document, butan independent survey. It was based on the detailed knowledge ofthe machinery of the Government possessed by Lord Stamp&apos;s survey,while the calculations were based upon figures obtained from the responsible Departments concerned. It was thus a document of exceptional authority. For example, the figures in respect of foodgiven on the debit side of the balance sheet on page 11 of LordStamp&apos;s paper had been furnished by the Ministry of Food, who inview of the forward contracts which they had made (except in thecase of cereals) were in the best position to estimate not merely how much we should be able to import in the first year of the war, buthow much we should have to pay for such purchases. Similar con-siderations applied to the figure given for the import of rawmaterials. On the credit side of the calculation, net receipts inrespect of shipping services had been placed, as the First Lord ofthe Admiralty pointed out, at zero. This was due to the fact thatour imports were given Lob. in Lord Stamp&apos;s calculation and note.i.f., as was done, for example, in the Board of Trade&apos;s annualestimates of our balance of payments. It would have made no difference to the final result if a credit had been taken for shippingreceipts, since it would have been necessary to make a correspondingentry on the debit side. The only possible case where this would nothave applied was in respect of earnings by the British ships tradingbetween neutral ports, but in war time the amount involved underthis heading was naturally not large.Lord Stamp&apos;s calculation, which dealt only with the first year of the war, turned upon four main figures. The first of these wasthe estimate of the net adverse balance on income account, which inthe table on page 11 of his paper was placed at  369 million; butLord Stamp had indicated in paragraph 5 of his paper that, in hisown opinion, this figure might in certain circumstances amount to 400 million.Lord Stamp&apos;s second figure was his estimate of the extent towhich it would be safe for us in the first year of the war to drawon our resources of gold, foreign balances, and foreign investments;this figure Lord Stamp placed at  150 million. As pointed out inhis (the Chancellor&apos;s) Memorandum (paragraph 5), his Treasuryadvisers, approaching this problem independently and from adifferent angle, had reached a conclusion on this point identical withthat arrived at by Lord Stamp and his colleagues. Now that the lists of mobilisable dollar securities were available, their total estimatedvalue had been found to be the same as, or only a little less than,the estimate which he had formed at the outbreak of the war. Theamount, of course, was very much smaller than that at our disposalduring the last war.   He hoped that it would be possible to secure
for these assets the sum estimated as their value, but the difficulties to be overcome were very considerable. In the first place, the UnitedStates Treasury did not relish the prospect of our throwinghundreds of millions of dollar securities on the New York market.We had originally hoped to use these assets as securities on which to borrow in New York, but the provisions of the United States lawmade this impossible. Mr. Morgenthau had then suggested that weshould persuade the United States companies concerned to buy back from us the securities of theirs which we held. Mr. Morgenthaunow found that this was impracticable, and had suggested that weshould proceed to realise our securities on the market. This processhad already begun, some  30 million having been realised since september through the sale of securities by private holders in thiscountry. Receipts from such sales were now falling off, and it would shortly be necessary for the Government to start selling.A slight misunderstanding had arisen as regards the basis ofthe estimate of  150 million to be drawn from our reserves in thefirst year of the war. This figure did not represent (as might bethought from question (g) in paragraph 3 of the Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty) the annual rate at which weestimated that it would be possible for us to mobilise our resources.He had already explained what the figure of  150 million repre-sented. Our dollar investments would, of course, be sold as quickly as was consistent with securing the best price possible.If, therefore, we took the net adverse balance in the first year as likely to amount to  400 million, and if we drew on our reserves to the extent of  150 million, we were still left with a gap of 250 million.Lord Stamp&apos;s third figure related to supplementary capital resources on which we might draw, namely, loans from the Empire,and sales of our not easily realisable assets, such as ArgentineRailways, foreign subsidiaries of British companies, and of Britishsecurities. With regard to the support which we might receive from the Dominions and other Empire countries, such support would only be available in so far as the Empire countries concernedachieved a favourable balance of payments; and, as regards oursupplementary foreign assets and sales of British securities, the willingness of foreign markets to absorb these securities would depend in part on the view taken abroad as to our prospects of victory. Having regard to all these considerations, Lord Stamphesitated to put the amount which we might obtain from thesesupplementary sources at  100 million. An examination of theresults achieved in the last war showed that we had not succeeded in obtaining large sums by such sales. In the case of many foreignconcerns in which we held large interests, interference by theforeign Governments concerned had reduced the value of theequities to very small dimensions. Argentine Railways afforded agood example. The Argentine Government, which had no interestin the amount of the dividend to be paid to the shareholders, hadcomplete control both over fares and rates, and also over wages, withthe result that there was very little left for the shareholders afterfares and rates had been reduced to very low levels and wages pushedup to high levels.The Lord Privy Seal thought that securities in tin and rubbercompanies, which we did not possess in the last war, would be more likely to find a sale in New York than such securities as ArgentineRailways.The Secretary of State for War said that the balance-sheetgiven in Lord Stamp&apos;s Paper referred to the United Kingdom only.So far as the United Kingdom was concerned, we always expected,even in peace time, to have an adverse balance of payments in hardcurrencies, but we recovered a substantial portion of this throughthe favourable balance achieved by the Empire countries.  It should
be possible to achieve considerable relief for our hard currencydifficulties by taking advantage of the favourable position of theColonies; as between the Colonies and ourselves, it should not bedifficult to effect a considerable adjustment through the resale tothem of their own Government loans, &amp;c.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the element referredto by the Secretary of State for War was intended by Lord Stampto be covered under his estimate of  100 million to which he had just referred. If Lord Stamp&apos;s figure was accepted, it would serve to reduce the gap in the first year of the war from  250 million to 150 million.In addition, some relief might be looked for in the new drivefor exports. Half the first year of the war had, however, nowpassed, and it was unlikely that the net relief under this head inthe part under review would amount to more than  50 million.Even if this result were achieved, there would still remain a gap of 100 million in the first year of the war.It should be realised that Lord Stamp&apos;s calculations did not include anything for the possible further purchase of steel fromthe U.S.A, nor did it make allowance for a further increase in air expenditure in the United States. While, therefore, it waspossible that on the credit side some of Lord Stamp&apos;s estimatesmight be conservative, there was also a possibility that some ofhis estimates on the debit side might be exceeded in practice. Thepresent document submitted by Lord Stamp was intended to bethe first of a series, and each successive revision, prepared in thelight of the fuller information then available, might be expectedto approximate still more closely to the actual position.The conclusions which he (the Chancellor) had reached were set out in paragraphs 19 to 21 of his Memorandum. He was particularly glad to find that a similar conclusion was recorded in the Report of the Military Co-ordination Committee.The Prime Minister said that the conclusions indicated by theChancellor showed that, when the various reliefs had been applied,there would still be a net adverse balance in the first year of thewar of  150 millions, or  100 millions if a net increase of 50 millions in exports was achieved. How was it proposed thatthis part of the gap should be closed ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was not possibleto foresee how this difference was to be met. To some extent itshould be possible through a further reduction in imports. LordStamp had emphasised that many of the figures given in his paper were no more than reasoned guesses of the probable order of magnitude of the items which they represented, and the net adverse balance might prove to be less than  400 millions.Sir Horace Wilson said that the figure of  150 million hadbeen taken as representing the amount of our capital resources on which we might safely draw in the first year of the war. if all other means failed, we might have to draw upon those resources to a larger extent in order to make good the net adverse balance;but in doing so we should be making an inroad into those resources to an extend beyond that which we regarded as the margin of safety.In the first four months of the war, there had been a heavydrain on our resources, including some withdrawals of capital fromthis country. The possibility of such withdrawals was an addeddanger always confronting us. If it were essential, this dangercould be met by the &quot; blocking &quot; of foreign balances held in London,but resort to this remedy would involve a very grave decision.The Prime Minister said that the fact that we were alreadyencroaching on our exchange resources beyond the margin of safety
must be borne in mind when the French request that we should increase our share of dollar purchases, and the proposal that weshould buy additional aircraft in the United States, were underconsideration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, though the issues raised were less complex issues, examination of the man-powerproblem pointed to the same conclusion, namely, that an attempt to fulfil our present programmes within the period laid down would put very great pressure on our existing resources. It seemed desirable on man-power grounds alone that we should rearrangeour programmes in the light of what was practicable.The Prime Minister said that Mr. Jewkes&apos;s memorandum(Annex 2 to W.P. (G.) (40) 35) raised a number of interestingpoints. For example, when speaking of the expansion of the labour force in the strategic industries under the original programmes,Mr. Jewkes said &quot; It will demand a redisposal of labour, both as tooccupation and as to place, which far transcends any efforts of a like kind even in revolutionary or totalitarian societies.&quot;Did the Minister of Labour agree with this view ?The Minister of Labour said that he felt some doubts. Forinstance, a little later in his Memorandum, Mr. Jewkes based an argument as to the rate of future expansion in the engineering industries on the comparatively small diminution in the numbers unemployed in those industries. He (the Minister) did not think this argument was sound, since the rate of expansion had been much greater than was suggested by the diminution of unemploy-ment. The Engineering Employers Association normally carriedout a census of the numbers of workers employed by their membersevery October. This year, at his request, they had also carriedout a census in January. (This census by no means covered thewhole field of munitions industries.)  The figures were as follows : Total number of personsemployed by members of theEngineering EmployersAssociation. Increase.October 1938 ...... 775,000October 1939 ...... 860,000 85,000January 1940        ...... 925,000 65,000Thus in the twelve months from October 1938 to October 1939 therehad been an increase of 11 per cent, in the numbers employed,whereas in the three months from October 1939 to January 1940there had been an increase of 1\ per cent, or at an annual rateof 30 per cent.The Prime Minister pointed out that even this rate of increase was not nearly adequate to meet the programmes.The Minister of Labour said that he attached the greatest importance to the good relations subsisting between the EmployersAssociation and the Amalgamated Engineering Union. the communique issued at the close of his recent meeting with theUnions had not been prompted in any way by the Ministry ofLabour and disclosed a very helpful attitude. Mr. Smith, one ofthe union officials, had said that it would be necessary to breakdown each process so as to make the use of skilled labour as effective as possible; he contemplated that each really skilled man wouldbecome a supervisor and instructor of a number of less skilled men.The Prime Minister referred to another passage in mr. Jewkes&apos;s Memorandum, in which he pointed out that the normalincentive towards an increase in labour in a particular industry the supply programme:man-power resources as alimiting factor.
was a rise in wages in that industry, and that if, under war conditions, this incentive was not to be allowed to operate, somesubstitute would be required. The suggestion was that labour whichhad become unemployed through war conditions tended to remainunemployed rather than to seek employment in the expandingindustries.The Minister of Labour said that, if a substitute to the normalincentive to transfer was to be found, it should be looked for in steps which would compel the unessential industries to release labour.This could be done, for example, by denying raw materials to theunessential industries. In his view, however, a much greatertransference of labour was taking place than was generally recognised. A recent article in the Economist had shown that manyindustries which were suffering from war conditions were releasinglabour. In the engineering industry itself the difficulties of thesmall firms appeared to be most marked in the case of garages,whose business was much reduced under war conditions. Thedifficulties of small firms were greatest in the building industry,particularly in the South of England.The Prime Minister said that the public impression ofunemployment was of a stagnant pool; but it appeared to be thecase that unemployment was rather a canal, from which, indeed, the expanding industries were being constantly recruited, but whichwas itself being fed from the industries and firms which were suffering under war conditions.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked whether the conditions for the grant of unemployment benefit were such as to preventanyone who had refused work in a new industry receiving benefit.It must be remembered that in the last war munition workers hadbeen protected from being called up. By itself, this was an induce-ment to join the munitions industries, and the threat to removeprotection could be used to promote transfers from one industry toanother. It was true that at present, when only a comparativelyfew age groups had been called up, this method of inducing transferwas of little assistance; but this difficulty could be overcome by making many more age groups liable to military service than atpresent, granting a larger proportion of exemptions than hitherto.On the other hand, this method of inducing transfer would meet with great hostility on the part of labour.The Minister of Labour said that benefit could be withheld for six weeks in the case of a man who refused a suitable offer ofemployment. It might be necessary to consider in the future the disqualification for a similar period of those who refused an offer of training. Training by the Ministry of Labour had hitherto beenlooked on as a social service, and not as a means of supplyingindustry with the skilled labour it required. He deprecated the useof liability to military service as a means of inducing mobility oflabour, on the ground that it would provoke resistance on the partof the Unions. In his view, the essential points were to maintainthe best possible relations between employers and employed andso far the Unions had been much more helpful than he could haveanticipated; and, secondly, to ensure that skilled men were used onlyto the best advantage. This applied not only.in industry, but alsoin the Services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the War Cabinet(Previous that they had asked him to examine the question of man-power inEeference:        relation to supply.  He hoped to be in a position to circulate a paper.M. (40) 17th to them on this question almost immediately, which would deal,Conclusions,      among other things, with the question of labour and dilution.Minute 1 (III).)
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it must always beremembered that in the last war they had called up about 4^ million men out of an occupied population of about 13 million males.To-day they were only proposing to call up 2^- million men out ofan occupied population of about 151 million males.Programme for The Chancellor of the exchequer then turned to paragraphs 19equipment of and 20 of his Paper containing his conclusions on the army the British programme. These he was glad to see accorded very closely with theArmy. conclusions of the Military Co-ordination Committee in W.P.(40) 48. Lord Stamp had sounded a warning that by aiming at too high an objective we might interfere with the orderly carrying-outof our plans. The Army programme could be spread, either by adopting a lower standard of equipment or by accepting a longertime for completion. The Report of the Military Co-co-ordination committee embodied both these alternatives, and he was preparedto accept it.The Secretary of State for War said that, if it were found thathis programme could not be carried through for such reasons asshortage of dollar resources, he must reserve the right to question the programmes of the other Services. The contemplated Armyprogramme was small, and any diminution in it might lead to our war effort becoming lopsided, with too large a weight for the air and too small a weight for the Army.The Minister without Portfolio, referring to paragraph 20 of w.P. (40) 45, entered a caveat against the proposal to delay theconstruction of factories of the simpler types on the ground that, inthe event of heavy air bombardment by the enemy, it might beinvaluable to possess those additional factories to take the place of factories that had been destroyed.The First Lord of the A dmiralty, referring to paragraph 20 of w.P. (40) 45, in which it was suggested that &quot; orders should at once be given for constructing factories of complicated types requiringeighteen months or more for their completion,&quot; pointed out thatsuch factories were not necessarily complicated in type, and suggested omission of the word &quot;complicated.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed.The War Cabinet then considered the Report of the military co-operation-ordination Committee on the Target for the Second Year of War(W.P. (40) 45).The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, Chairman of theCommittee, said that behind their Report lay a great deal of workon which the Committee would be reporting to the War Cabinet indue course. The present paper had been submitted in order to record their conclusions from the supply angle on the matters raised byLord Stamp from the economic angle. On the assumption stated inparagraph 4 of their Report that &quot;authority will be given to theMinistry of Supply to provide every factory and all manufacturingfacilities which they can say will be in production by the1st September, 1941,&quot; the Committee had asked the Minister ofSupply to give his estimate of the total output of what might be termed the &apos;&apos; difficult&apos;&apos; armaments. These estimates were givenin Appendix A to the paper, and must be taken as subject to theprovisos in Appendix B. The Committee had then examined the size of the forces which could be equipped on these estimates. Onthe assumptions given in paragraph 5 of the paper as to standards of equipment, estimates of wastage and provision for training, theyhad found that the quantities shown would not suffice to equip eventhe 36 Divisions now in existence. There were, however, certainfactors which might be expected to operate so as to enable a largerArmy to be equipped.  The scales of initial equipment and wastage
were felt by some members of the Committee to be too high, and this applied particularly to rates of wastage. The Secretary of Statefor War had already started an investigation into this question.The calculations assumed that active operations would begin on the1st March, 1940, and this might not be so. Further, should Divisionsoperate elsewhere than on the Western Front, lower rates of wastagewould no doubt obtain. Lastly, there was a hidden asset, not included in the figures, in the shape of salvage. For these reasons the Committee had felt that the aim of 55 Divisions should , beretained, but to be attained at the earliest possible date rather thanwithin the first two years of war.The reduction in scales which, as explained in paragraph 6 ofthe Report, was now under investigation would lead to a largerforce being sent overseas than at present appeared likely. It was important that a balanced plan of production for all the itemsrequired should be developed. Hence the Committee urged that&quot; sanction should not be withheld for any production plans that maybe required to keep other items of equipment in step &quot; (i.e., itemsnot in Appendix A). Furthermore, they also asked that sanctionshould be given for the provision of plants which took a long timeto erect in similar terms to paragraph 20 of W.P. (40) 45.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed with theproposals of the Military Co-ordination Committee, and was pre-pared to give the Minister of Supply the authorities asked for intheir Report forthwith. He had asked the Minister of Supply toinform him of the dollar resources which he would require for thearmy programme in the second year of war, but he did not intend to hold up action pending receipt of that information.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence welcomed the chancellors assurances. It was impossible at this stage to say whether in the course of time the Air Force or the Army would prove to be the more important. Hence we should make prepara-tions for maximum programmes in respect of each, and be readyto switch from one to the other as necessity might dictate.The Lord Privy Seal welcomed the Report of the military co-operation-ordination Committee, and believed that in practice it wouldbe found possible to achieve the 55 Division programme soonerthan was anticipated, provided that the scales of equipment wererevised.The Minister of Supply said that the quantities in Appendix of the Report by the Military Co-ordination Committee were agreedfigures and represented the maximum output, on present forecasts for all factories, which could be brought into operation before the1st September, 1941. If the estimates were to be achieved, he wouldhave to approach the Chancellor of the Exchequer for authorityto give continuation orders. He particularly desired to draw theattention of the War Cabinet to the provisos regarding his estimates of output given in Appendix B of the Paper. He would submit to the Chancellor his programme of dollar purchases for the second year of war, but must draw attention to the fact that, owing tothe long time taken to erect factories for propellants and explosives,it would be necessary to purchase finished materials from the UnitedStates, if a balanced programme were to be achieved.Standards of The First Lord of the A dmiralty referred to the standards of equipment and initial equipment and scales of wastage. These scales had beenrates of wastage worked out in great detail, but were apparently applied uniformly(army, navy and to a large, as to a small Army. If we could achieve the ideal, soair force). much the better; but all wars had to be fought with the equipment to hand. He would rather have more men in the line with smallerscales of equipment, than smaller forces with an ideal scale. he therefore welcomed the investigation by the Secretary of State for
War into the Army scales but thought that the other Service(Previous Departments should initiate similar investigations.   He himselfReference:        was already investigating the effect of the Northern barrage on W.M. (39) 116th requirements of anti-submarine craft on the western coasts.Conclusions, Reference was also made to the fact that it was believed that minute 4.)        the French standards of equipments were, in certain, respects,lower than our own.The Secretary of State for War said that it was also doubtfulwhether the French would be able to maintain their existing numberof divisions for any length of time if, as a result of active fighting,wastage was taking place on any considerable scale.The Minister of Supply said that in any event the French wererelying on us to make good their deficiencies in certain directions,for example, in the supply of explosives and propellants.The Secretary of State for A ir said that he was quite preparedto agree to an investigation on the lines suggested by the FirstLord of the Admiralty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer welcomed such investigations,since any reduction in scales of equipment had a double effect.Not only were initial scales cut down, but subsequent maintenancewas also reduced. He suggested for the consideration of the FirstLord of the Admiralty that provision for shell in the Navy waspossibly too large.The Secretary of State for Wair pointed out that for weapons which had been in existence in 1914-18 experience was availableto draw on in estimating rates of wastage. Difficulty arose with new weapons such as anti-tank and tank guns, and heavy and light A.A. guns.The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ expositionof our present and prospective future exchange position.(ii) Took note of the Survey by Lord Stamp of our national resources in relation to our war effort (W.P. (Q.) (40) 35),and invited Lord Stamp to arrange for the calculationsset out in this Survey to be kept continuously underreview in the light of additional information received and of changing conditions; and to prepare periodicallyfurther Reports, on the lines of this Survey, for submission to the War Cabinet.(iii) Agreed (a) that our objective should continue to be the full programme of 55 Divisions by the earliest possible date;(&amp;) that the Minister of Supply should be authorised tomake the arrangements required (includingmanufacturing facilities) to produce by september 1941 the programme set out inAppendix A to W.P. (40) 48;(c) that the Minister of Supply should be authorised toprovide Army stores generally in such quantitiesas, when related to the items set out inAppendix &quot; A &quot; to W.P. (40) 48, will result in a balanced programme for the number of divisions for which-on a review of the scales of equipment and wastage the programme in Appendix A i sfound to be appropriate;(d) that, as regards munitions, the Minister of supply should be authorised to proceed forthwith withthe construction of factories requiring 18 months or more for their construction, on the basis of thefull programme of 55 Divisions;

(40) 39thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat he and the First Lord of the Admiralty, with their military advisers, had, in accordance with the decision taken by the WarCabinet on the previous day, scrutinised the information obtainedfrom the reconnaissance recently carried out by the Royal Air Force.As a result, it had been decided to take no action.Enemy air activity off our coasts had been very much below normal, only one unidentified raid having been reported. Sixty-fourFighter patrols had been despatched, involving 163 aircraft whichhad been employed on routine patrols, escort to convoys, sectorpatrols and escort to cross-Channel vessels.No operations had been carried out either by Bomber Commandor by British Air Forces in France.The usual patrols and searches had been carried out by coastal command.A Hudson aircraft, returning to Leuchars from patrol dutyover the North Sea, had sighted a lifeboat containing ten men,who had appeared to be in a state of extreme exhaustion. Theaircraft had directed two minesweepers to the lifeboat and had seen the ten men rescued. The men were the crew of the trawlerTheresa Boyle (224 tons) which had been sunk on the 10th February.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(Previousfief erence:W.M.

The First Lord of the Admiralty described the steps whichhad been taken to hunt the five German &quot;merchant ships which had left Vigo on the night of the 10th February. One ship, the Morea(1,900 tons), had been intercepted by H.M.S. Hasty, and was being sent to a home port. One other ship, the Wahene (4,700 tons), hadbeen sighted, but not recognised, by a British flying-boat; neverthe-less, the prospects of catching her were still hopeful.Three officers and sixteen ratings had been taken prisoner fromthe submarine which had been sunk by H.M.S. Gleaner in the approaches to the Clyde on the 12th February. Twenty-two bodieshad been recovered.

One destroyer and two escort vessels were hunting in the area, with no results so far.At 12-55 a.m. on the 13th February S.S. British Triumph(tanker 8,500 tons), in ballast, had been mined or torpedoed10 miles North-East of Cromer. She had been taken in tow by the tanker British Officer, and tugs had been sent to her assistance.There was hope that she would be brought in safely.At 2-5 a.m. on the 13th February S.S. Albert L. Ellsworth(Norwegian tanker 8,300 tons), bound from Abadan to Bergenreported that she had been torpedoed 20 miles South-West of theFaroe Islands. Northern patrol trawlers had been sent to her assistance, but she had since cancelled her S.O.S. and had reported&apos; All O.K.&quot;An attack had been carried out by two anti-submarine trawlers,the Tiger and the Cape Warwick, on a contact 5 miles North of st. Abb&apos;s Head in 27 fathoms on the 8th February. It wasconsidered that the attack had probably been on a submarine, andif so, that the submarine had almost certainly been destroyed.At 6-55 p.m. on the 12th February S.S. Somme (British 5,300 tons), in a position 300 miles North-West of Madeira, had made a submarine distress signal and had reported that she wasbeing shelled. No further signals had been received. This might prove to be a false alarm.The First Contingent of the Second Australian Imperial force had arrived at Suez on the morning of the 12th February, and hadbeen greeted by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 3.)Western Front.4. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat there was nothing of importance to report from the western front.Finland.Fighting in the Karelian Isthmus had reached its highestintensity during the past few days. The main attack continuedto be directed on Summa. The Finns had frustrated Russianattempts to outflank them, and, though they were very tired, theywere continuing to do well.Seventy-three Russian tanks had been captured or destroyed in fighting North of Lake Ladoga.There was nothing of importance to report from the FinnishEast Front.
Assistance to finland.Supply of field guns andammunition.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat the Finnish General who was in this country had been to see him with an urgent and entirely new request for the immediate despatch to Finland of 100 field-guns and the necessary ammunition.The Finns were well supplied with Russian field-guns, but they were very short of ammunition. It would not be possible to adapt ourplant to make shells suitable for the Russian guns under several months.The Secretary of State for War said that it was obsolutelyimpossible, in his opinion, to grant the Finnish request for 100 field-guns. Our difficulties were partly due to the fact that we werechanging over to a new type of field-gun. The French, however, had used the same type of gun for many years and might be in an easierposition than ourselves. The Chief of the Imperial General staff had therefore sent a personal message to General Gamelin asking him if he could help. The demand for field-guns was a new demand and had not figured in any of the requests made by Brigadier Lingafter his recent visit to Finland.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theFinnish Minister had been to see him on this matter and had spokenin terms of the deepest anxiety about the tremendous strain to whichthe Finns were being put at this moment. He (the Foreign Secre-tary) fully appreciated the difficulty of providing field-guns from our own resources. If they could be made available from France,well and good. If not, he asked whether it would not be possiblefor us to find, say, ten or twenty guns. He wondered whether, on balance, it would not be to our advantage to accept the risk involvedin order to avert the collapse of Finland.The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that the Finns were making a very important contribution to the war in holding up theRussian economic support of Germany.In further discussion, it was suggested that the possibility should be explored of finding guns from India, Egypt, Malta orCanada.The War Cabinet agreed To invite the Secretary of State for War to explore thepossibilities suggested in discussion of making a limited number of field-guns available to the Finns, and to reportthe results of his investigation to the War Cabinet on thefollowing day.Assistance to finland.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 39thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. In connection with the preceding Minute a short discussion took place on certain other aspects of assistance to Finland. Thediscussion and conclusions reached are recorded in the Secretary&apos;standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 13, 1940.
