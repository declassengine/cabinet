Air Operations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 21stConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Secretary of State for Air reported that air activity-had again been much below normal. Nine bomber aircraft had completed reconnaissances in the western part of the North Sea theprevious afternoon.Two unidentified aircraft had been reported off the coast duringthe day, the first well to the east between Cromer and Foulness earlyin the morning, and the second off Orfordness about midday.Thirty-four routine fighter patrols had been undertaken,involving the use of 81 aircraft.A U-boat had been sighted 18 miles S.S.E. of Swansea, but haddived before an attack could be made.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40)Conclusions.Minute 6.)AdditionalNorwegianconvoysarranged.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that steamshipBaltanglia (1,523 tons) and the Norwegian steamship Pluto(1,598 tons), on passage from Bergen to the Tyne and Tees respec-tively, had been mined and sunk south-east of the Fame Islands.21st They had not been in convoy at the time. The crews had beenrescued. The existence of mines in this area had not been previouslyknown.There were 58 ships waiting at Bergen for convoy to thiscountry, and special arrangements had been made to provide escortsfor additional convoys to clear this accumulation. Normally convoysonly ran once in 8 days.The First Lord undertook to give the War Cabinet an analysis of the cargoes carried by the ships on the Norwegian route, whichwere mainly neutrals. The German attacks on neutrals weretending to drive them into our convoys, and it would be for con-sideration whether we should not offer special insurance terms to neutral ships which sailed in our convoys. This might well be aprofitable business.The Finnish steamship Onto (1,333 tons) had been mined27 miles north-east of Yarmouth, but was reported to be still afloat.The drifter Triple Alliance, on passage to Kirkwall, wasoverdue and must be presumed lost.Anti-submarine activities were as follows : HALS. Echo claimed a contact in the Firth of Tay.Seven destroyers were carrying out a search in the bristol channel.Three destroyers were searching for U-boats located by wireless direction-finding in the Western Approaches.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.Western front and Finland.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.The Secretary of State for War said that the latest reports from Finland were as follows : Karelian Isthmus. Violent Soviet attacks in the Taipalesector had made no impression. Further attacks were expected.North of Lake Ladoga. Heavy Soviet attacks had been taking place along the Suojarvi-Sortavala railway, apparentlyin the hope of eventually turning the Mannerheim line.Soviet troops were still holding out 20 miles west of Salla,but were nearly cut. off and were being supplied by aircraft.Northern Sector. Nothing to report.[20712]

The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, as requested by the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the previous Monday,he bad looked into the question whether he could release any Skuaaircraft for use in Finland. He was prepared to release 20 Skuasfor use as fighter dive-bombers, and also 13 Rocs.The Secretary of State for Air said that he was seeing theFinnish Minister that afternoon and would inform him accordingly.The War Cabinet took note that 20 Skua and 13 Rocaircraft could be released for Finland.Weekly Reports. 6.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 87, dated the 22nd January, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, in which Lord Lothian gave a full account of a conversation which he had had that morningwith Mr. Cordell Hull, United States Secretary of State, who had said that a combination of circumstances was producing friction between our two countries which, unless it could be removed, might become very dangerous. In this connection he referred to the disputes about the censorship of United States mails, the forcibletaking of United States ships into the combatant zone, thediscrimination in the operation of contraband control at the station at Gibraltar, the Navicert system, and the effect on United Statespublic opinion of the stoppage of the purchase by the UnitedKingdom of United States agricultural supplies and especiallytobacco. He (the Secretary of State) was arranging for thepreparation of a long and reasoned reply to be communicated byLord Lothian to the United States Government.United Statesof America.ComplaintsregardingContrabandControl, &amp;c.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 4thConclusions,Minute 5.)
9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatimmediately before coming to the War Cabinet he had had a long-conversation with the Japanese Ambassador, who had called on him on instructions from M. Arita. His conversation with the ambassador might be summarised as follows : The Ambassador opened the conversation by saying, thathe understood that the Japanese and British Governments werein dispute in regard to the legal issues raised by our actionin removing German subjects from the Japanese steamshipAsama Maru, and he did not therefore propose to addresshimself to that matter. He did, however, desire to impress upon him (the Secretary of State) most earnestly the profoundand painful impression created in Japan by the fact that theseGermans had been removed from a Japanese vessel withinthirty-five miles of the Japanese coast. Both he and the newJapanese Government desired to improve Anglo-japanese relations, and it was most unfortunate that this incident shouldhave occurred in view of the incalculable possibilities whichit opened up.He (the Secretary of State) had replied that he would not discuss the legal position, but that, in our opinion, we had avery good case. He had made it clear that if there was tobe any question of complaints being made, complaints wouldnot come from the Japanese side only, since we had been givenserious cause for complaint by the high-handed action of theJapanese in various matters. He had agreed that the presentincident was unfortunate from the point of view of Anglo-Japanese relations, but as a practical man the japanese ambassador would no doubt agree that it was more important to consider how to improve our future relations than to concentrate on this particular case. From our information it seemed that the Japanese were forming almost a habit ofcarrying in Japanese ships organised bodies of German citizens who were unable to get home to Germany by any other means.This was of particular importance in view of the indications that the pressure we were exerting, on the German naval forces were handicapping their submarine activities; and it would be quite impossible for us to acquiesce in a practice which enabledGermany to repatriate technicians who might be employed onsubmarine duties.The Japanese Ambassador said that the Japanese Govern-ment were sincerely anxious to maintain their neutrality and keep out of the war, and that they desired also to be morehelpful to us than to Germany. We must realise, however, thegreat difficulties which such incidents created for the JapaneseGovernment in face of popular emotion in Japan.He (the Secretary of State) had then drawn a bow at aventure and had asked the Ambassador whether he was right in thinking that, from the point of view of the JapaneseGovernment, it might be possible for them to reach an arrange-ment with us by which they undertook not to carry in Japaneseships Germans of military value, if, at the same time, we coulddevise some method of overcoming the difficulties in regard tothe present case.The Ambassador replied that he had not previously con-sidered such a possibility, but it seemed to him worth further examination. He then asked whether if, as appeared, we werein a position to furnish lists of German citizens whom we wished to intercept, it might be possible to make some progress on the basis of our communicating such lists in future to theJapanese authorities. In reply to a question, the ambassador had said that he thought that the Japanese Government mightbe willing to examine the possibility of making progress onthese lines.
The Secretary of State had concluded the interview by saying that, while we appreciated the difficulties of theJapanese Government, it was necessary for them also to realiseour position. He had undertaken to think over what had passed during the discussion and to have a further talk withthe Ambassador in the very near&apos; future.In his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) opinion, the Japanese Governmentwere anxious to reach a settlement Avith us in this matter, but theirpride was deeply wounded, more especially in view of the fact thatthe incident had taken place so near to Tokyo. In his view, it wouldbe prudent, and might also serve to improve our general position,if we could find means of meeting the Japanese Government to someextent over the present incident, provided that in return we secured a satisfactory undertaking from them as to the future. What hehad in mind was some compromise under which we might returnto the Japanese some of the Germans Avhom we had removed fromthe Asama Main. The War Cabinet should realise that, if nocompromise were reached, there was a likelihood of serious trouble with the Japanese Government.The Prime Minister said that the situation was both difficult and delicate, but we must take care that we did nothing having theappearance of a humiliating withdrawal in the face of the Japaneseattitude. The possibility of re-examining our case against theindividual Germans whom we had taken might be worth considering.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, if a general agree-ment could be reached with the Japanese Government dealing withthe carrying of German nationals in Japanese ships, the terms ofthe agreement could be applied retrospectively to the particular case of the Asama Maru, provided that the fact that such anagreement had been reached was announced before any statement was made in public regarding a compromise on this particular case.It was worth while making an effort to secure an undertaking fromthe Japanese Government barring from Japanese ships certaindefinite classes of German nationals possessing qualifications whichwould enable them to plajr an effective belligerent role, if allowed toreturn to Germany. Even to obtain such an agreement, he would,however, be opposed to handing back all the Germans taken fromthe Asama Maru, since this would involve us in too deep ahumiliation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that such anagreement would be of real value. It was conceivable, however, that,in order to obtain it, we might have to consider going to the lengthof saying to the Japanese that, while we reserved all our rights and made no admissions, we were prepared to take the view that, sincethe case of the Asama Maru had arisen before we had had anopportunity of reaching a general agreement with the JapaneseGovernment, we were prepared as between friends to give theJapanese the benefit of the doubt in that case (i.e., to return the mentaken off the A sama Maru) in exchange for a binding undertaking by the Japanese Government not to permit Germans of specifiedclasses being carried in Japanese ships in future. He realised the objection to going so far, and it would certainly be necessary totake the utmost care to avoid giving the impression that we hadsurrendered to the Japanese demand. On the other hand, there wasa risk of serious trouble with Japan if this matter was not satis-factorily settled.The Prime Minister said that he was anxious to avoid serious trouble with the Japanese, but nevertheless it would be impossiblefor us to agree to give back these men unless we obtained somesubstantial concession in return. The important thing was thatthese Germans should not be allowed to return to Germany, and.
provided that this was assured, it would be a matter of indifferenceto us whether they were interned by us or the Japanese. It wouldbe a mistake to regard the problem as one merely of preventingGermans in Japan from returning to Germany, since, if this methodof return to Europe were assured to Germans, advantage of itwould be taken by Germans in other parts of the world.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that what we should aim at securing was a broad agreement, the central feature of whichwas the regulation of these questions for the future. Such anagreement would relieve us of the necessity of searching Japaneseships, in view of the promise which we should have obtained fromthe Japanese, and it would provide also a framework in which wecould devise a compromise for dealing with the present case. Whatwas essential was to avoid the central feature of the agreement being the return by us of some or all of the Germans taken from theA sama Maru.The War Cabinet agreed That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty should consult together withthe object of devising for the consideration of the WarCabinet a scheme under which (i) the Japanese Government would give us a satisfactoryundertaking that for the future Germans possessingcertain specified qualifications would not be permitted to return to Germany in Japanese ships;(ii) means would be provided in the application of theagreement under (i) for reaching a settlement withthe Japanese Government of the case of theGermans removed from the steamship A sama Maru.German oil supplies.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 93rdConclusions,Minute 12.)Second Reportby the MinisterwithoutPortfolio andbite Minister forCo-ordination ofDefence.10. The War Cabinet had before them the Second Report bythe Minister without Portfolio and the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence on German Oil Supplies (W.P. (40) 26).The Minister without Portfolio said that for some time events had been moving fa,st in oil matters. The freezing of the Danubeprovided a lull in which it was of advantage to take stock of theposition. The main features of the Report before the War cabinet were as follows : (1) Very little oil had been reaching Germany; not more than10,000 tons a month was evading the contraband control;according to latest information, only 4,500 tons had gotthrough from Russia up to the end of 1939; and onlya trickle was coming now from Baku via the route acrossthe Black Sea.(2) Roumania was, therefore, by far the largest external source of oil for Germany, and we were doing all in our powerto reduce the quantity of oil which Germany obtained.(3) The Roumanians had resisted German pressure to begin with, but now appeared to have given way. It appearedfairly certain that they had adopted a policy of quotas;and they were refusing export licences for contractswhich we had already made with the Oil Companies;and there was now talk of a State Commission to controloil exports.(4) There was no reason to modify our policy because of roumania&apos;s agreement with Germany. In the case of roumania, it was one thing to make an agreement andanother to get it carried out.The Minister without Portfolio then invited attention to theconclusions and recommendations of the Report, as set out in para-
graph 23. He emphasised, in particular, the recommendation thatwe should employ opportunist tactics to hamper the Germanswherever and whenever possible, and should make all necessary preparations to employ to the full the weapons which we had, e.g.,superior financial resources, greater share-holding control of theRoumanian Oil Companies, ability to supply raw materials, and capacity to foster neutral markets to Roumania&apos;s advantage.In conclusion, the Minister without Portfolio paid a tribute tothe zeal and initiative displayed by the Departments concerned incarrying out the War Cabinet&apos;s policy, to the excellent workperformed in Bucharest by Mr. Bridgeman and Mr. Hall-Patch,and the invaluable support of the British Minister in Bucharest.The Prime Minister referred to the German activities in South -East Poland, where they appeared to be putting the railways inorder. He assumed that this would improve the position as regardstransport of Roumanian oil to Germany.The Minister without Portfolio agreed that more oil could be transported if the Railways were improved. On the other hand, wewould continue our measures to hamper railway communication.The Secretary of State for Air observed that, from the figures given in paragraph 32 of the. Report, it appeared that our total annual requirements were of the order of 8^ million tons of oil,whereas in the Falmouth Report* our estimated annual require-ments were stated to be 16-^ million tons. If. as a result of war experience, we had found that our peace-time estimates could be cut by 50 per cent, should not a similar reduction be made in ourestimates of German consumption ?The Secretary for Mines informed the War Cabinet that theReportf on the German Oil Position which had been forwarded bya Committee under his Chairmanship was under review, and a revised Report would be submitted to the War Cabinet in the very near future. The estimates given in the previous Report, whichhad been prepared at the beginning of the war, had been based onpeace-time figures, and were being scrutinized in the light of war experience.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that, even if thefigures for German consumption were reduced by 50 per cent,German imports still seemed to be falling far behind her require-ments. If, therefore, our tactics continued to be successful,Germany might find herself forced to invade Roumania to obtainher essential supplies.The Secretary of State for Air remarked that, in that event,sabotage could still prevent the Germans from obtaining the oil,at any rate for a considerable period.The First Lord of the Admiralty added that the threat to destroy the wells should therefore be a most potent weapon in thehands of the Roumanians in dealing with Germany.The Prime Minister said that he would be disinclined to count on effective sabotage of the wells in the event of German invasion.Difficulties of transport appeared to be a more likely limiting factor in the amount of oil Germany received.The Minister without Portfolio said that, if the War Cabinetconfirmed the policy set out in his Report, all possible pressureshould be brought to bear on the Roumanian Government to dissuadethem from taking action which would be against our interests. Thisformed the subject of the next item on the Agenda.The War Cabinet approved the policy set out in the Report(W.P. (40) 26).* C.I.D. Paper No. 272-A, paragraph 263. f W.P. (39) 90.
Roumania. 11.   The  War  Cabinet  had  under  consideration  a  jointSupply of war memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence andequipment and tne Minister without Portfolio (W.P. (40) 30)&apos;.raw materials in jlie Minister for Co-ordination of Defence explained the relation to proposals in the joint Memorandum, which were the outcome of aRoumanian Meeting of Ministers held on the 19th January, 1940, under hisoil policy. Chairmanship, with a view to discussing the measures which could(Previous be taken to ensure that we obtained satisfaction from the RoumanianReferences:       Government in the matter of oil.   The supply position was set outW. M. (39) 85th in paragraphs 8 and 10 of the Paper.   We had already deliveredConclusions,      goods to the Roumanians to the value of  2,110,000 against the minute 12, and  original credit, given in the Spring of 1939, for  5^ millions.W. M. (39) 108th Further goods to the value of some  2 millions were ready for conclusions,      immediate delivery or were on order, leaving a balance from the minute 9.)        original credit of  1^ millions.   Owing, however, to the rise in costs and certain variations in the Roumanian orders, it would nowbe necessary to give an additional credit of  2 millions, if theRoumanian requirements, as agreed before the war, were to bemet.   The Roumanian Minister had now presented a new list of demands, which included large numbers of A. A. and anti-tank gunsand large quantities of raw materials, and was of so extravaganta character as to raise doubts as to its bona fides.   The list was,however, being examined as a matter of urgency, to see what wecould provide, particularly from the sterling area.   There were alsocertain financial inducements which had been suggested by theTreasury and were detailed in paragraph 14 of the Paper.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence then explained theconclusions of the joint Memorandum, and pointed out that the ministerial meeting to which he had already referred had been soimpressed with the urgency of the situation that they had authorisedaction to be taken before the matter was referred to the War Cabinet,The proposals which we could make to the Roumanian government as an inducement to adopt a reasonable attitude over oil were summarised in conclusion (4). as were also the conditions which theRoumanian Government would have to fulfil before we would beprepared to implement our proposals. He wished to draw special attention to conclusion (6), under which Departments had alreadyceased the export of goods to Roumania and the issue of export licences in connection therewith. It was necessary to arm theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs with the latest material forhis discussions with the Roumanian Minister, and this was beingco-ordinated by the Minister without Portfolio in accordance with conclusion (8). The Minister without Portfolio was also suggested as the authority to lift or reimpose the ban on exports to Roumaniain accordance with the oil situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in agreementwith the financial provisions of the proposals.Some discussion ensued on the position as regards the threemotor torpedo boats mentioned in conclusions (4) (iv) and (6).The First Lord of the Admiralty said that these motor torpedo boats had already been handed over and had Roumanian crews onboard. The Admiralty were not in a position to requisition them,and could only make difficulties over the provision of stores.It was pointed out that these boats were to pass through theFrench canais on their way to Roumania, and that, if need arose,the French authorities might be asked to delay their passage.Reference was also made to certain motor ambulances whichwere ready for loading on board ship. It was agreed that these should be released.The Secretary for Mines said that, so far as commercialarrangements were concerned, the purchase of oil on our account was proceeding satisfactorily.[20712] c
The War Cabinet :-Endorsed the conclusions of the Joint Memorandum by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence and the minister without Portfolio (W.P. (40) 30), which are reproduced asan Annex to these Conclusions.Australian andNew ZealandContingents.(previous reference:W. M. (89) 94thConclusions,Minute 4.)Publicity forarrival inEgypt.12. The Secretary of State for War said that Australian andNew Zealand forces would shortly be arriving in Egypt. The HighCommissioner for Australia had represented to him the necessityfor ensuring that the publicity given to their arrival was on thesame scale as that previously given to the Canadians. Accordinglyhe (the Secretary of State for War) had arranged to send a specialfilm unit to Egypt, but he wished to raise the question of the dateof release of the resulting films.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that, on general grounds,he would prefer all the troops concerned to have disembarked beforethe films were released. On the other hand, the risks in the Red Seawere almost negligible, and the news would inevitably leak outthrough neutrals in Egypt. He was accordingly prepared to agreeto release the films before disembarkation was complete.It was agreed, however, that it would be as well to put thepoint to the Dominion authorities. The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs undertook to do this, and to communicate withthe Secretary of State for War. He also pointed out that the firstnews of arrival should be issued in an official announcement by theDominion Governments concerned.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1 ,January 24, 1940.
ANNEX.That firm and active steps on the lines proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs in Appendix I (2) of the Memorandum W.P.(40) 30 should be taken to ensure, whether by inducement or by threat,that the Roumanian Government adopt a more accommodating-attitude towards the requirements of His Majesty&apos;s Government inrespect of oil.That a complete list of the means of pressure available to us must be presented to the Foreign Secretary as soon as possible.That so far as the Roumanian demands for supplies are concerned, thematerial required should be completed) as soon as possible by theChairman of the Anglo-French Co-ordinating Committee for Supplies(Sir Arthur Robinson), who will forward it to the Minister without portfolio for transmission to the Foreign Secretary. (See alsoconclusions (7) to (10) below.)That as regards financial arrangements the following proposals of theTreasury should be approved :  (i) The offer to pay up to 25 per cent, in dollars for oil should be withdrawn.(ii) Sterling at Roumania&apos;s free disposal in the Clearing should beavailable to buy (a) raw materials from the sterling area, of which suppliescan be made available. A list of these should be givenindicating what is, on present indications, likely to beavailable (see (3) above);(b) such munitions as may be available in the United Kingdomnow or later (at present little will be available for earlydelivery);(c) war material from third countries, e.g., Italy, and, in exceptional cases and within prescribed limits, theUnited States of America.

(5) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be invited tocommunicate to the Roumanian Government the decisions recorded in(4) above and to request their acceptance.(6) That unless and until the condition referred to at the end ofparagraph (4) above is fulfilled, no further promises of any kind should be made to the Roumanian Minister by any GovernmentDepartment, and Government Departments should hold up all exportof goods to Roumania and export licences in connection therewith.Further instructions will be issued to Departments when this ban islifted. In this connection the Admiralty are asked to take suitablesteps to hold up the departure from England of the 3 motor torpedo boats recently handed over to the Roumanian authorities.(7) That the Allied Demands Committee, in working out details, should assume (a) That an additional credit of  2 million will be granted to cover the cost of requirements, the supply of which was originallyagreed with the Roumanians, but their export will at all timesbe dependent on the fulfilment of the conditions stated at theend of Conclusion (4) above.(b) That as regards shipments of goods, they should act in accordancewith Conclusion (6) above.(c) That in principle it is desirable to meet the new Roumaniandemands provided that the furnishing of supplies at all timesdepends on the fulfilment of the condition at the end of conclusion (4) above.(d) That they are desired to examine the possibility of supplying rawmaterials from the sterling area, whether or not such materials are included in the list of the Roumanian requirements detailedin Annex B of Paper No. A.D.
