The Aii-Situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 38thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat on the 10th February Fighter units of the Air Component ofthe Field Force had despatched 5 patrols, involving 9 aircraft. Thenormal patrols, searches and convoy escorts had been undertaken by aircraft of Coastal Command. No enemy sightings, however, hadbeen reported, and there was little of importance to report.On the 11th February enemy air activity off our coasts had been limited to one unidentified raid in the mouth of the Wash duringthe early hours of the morning.There had been 82 patrols by Fighter Command, involving217 aircraft, engaged upon protection of shipping, escort of convoys and escort of Channel steamers.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff described an importantreconnaissance which had recently been carried out by the RoyalAir Force.The War Cabinet (i) Took note of the above statement.(ii) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for Air to discuss the information obtainedfrom the reconnaissance referred to, and to report tothe War Cabinet.The naval situation.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)U-boat sinkings.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 28thConclusions,Minute 2.)Shipping losses.General.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty gave the War cabinet particulars of movements of the Home Fleet.Later reports disproved the claim previously reported that thePaddle-Minesweeper Brighton Queen had shot down a german aircraft.An enemy submarine had been attacked in the approaches tothe Clyde by one of our patrol vessels at 3-55 a.m. that morning.A second attack had been carried out at 5-1 a.m. The U-boat hadsurfaced at 5-25 and the crew had surrendered at 5-30 a.m., aftersinking their ship. The U-boat was lying in 30 fathoms, and therewas some prospect that she might be raised.Interrogation of the captured crew of the U-55 placed the credit for her destruction to the Sunderland aircraft rather than to H.M.S. Foioey. The bomb dropped by the aircraft, although ithad not hit the submarine, had caused the captain to give the orderto abandon ship.The Dutch Burgerdyk (6,853 tons), previously reported as having been in collision, was now said to have been sunk by aU-boat.Six German ships had left Vigo on the night of the10th February.A Midshipman, Petty Officer and five men of H.M.S.Greyhound had been lost in a boat which had capsized, whilstboarding a, ship at sea on the previous afternoon.The blockship S.S. Branksea had sunk while in tow on the morning of the 10th, for reasons which were as yet unknown.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 38thConclusions,Minute 3.)Western Front.[20825]3. The Secretary of State for War said that there was nothing to report from the Western Front.b 2
Finland.Supply of mili-tary information from Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 36thConclusions,Minute 3.)There was no change in the situation in Finland. The russians had attacked chiefly near Summa and Taipale, but, though theymight have broken in at certain points, they had been ejected.The Prime Minister drew attention to a press report that therewere a number of German ships at Petsamo, and the First Lordof the Admiralty said that he had noted the statement, and was having it examined.The Secretary of State for War said that an additionalMilitary Attache was being sent out to Finland to strengthen ourlink with that country.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.Weekly Resume. 4. The War Cabinet took note of the Weekly Resume (No. 23)(Previous by the Chiefs of Staff of the Naval, Military and Air SituationReference: (W.P. (40) 46).W.M. (40) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4.) ---Assistance to finland.Request for field guns andammunition.Supply of aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 80 from Helsinki, in which an urgent request for field guns and ammunition for the Finns was reported, and enquire whether anything could be done.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that this request,together with others which had been received, was being examined in the War Office, but he feared there was little that we could do, aswe had already stripped ourselves bare. He had seen the FinnishChief of Staff, who had told him that the French appeared to have sent most of their spare material to the Balkans. The situationin Finland had not materially changed, and he was of the opinionthat the Finns would be able to hold out.The Secretary of Slate for Foreign Affairs enquired whetherthe transport of the aircraft which we had promised the Finns couldbe expedited. Reports showed that, up to the 8th February, only24 Gladiators and 10 Blenheims had arrived in Finland.The Secretary of State for Air said that he would give theWar Cabinet full details of the position at their next meeting.The Finnish pilots who were to train on the Hurricanes had arrived in this country.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 37thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. In connection with the preceding Minute, discussion tookplace on certain other aspects of assistance to Finland. A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.
7. The Home Secretary stated that the War Cabinet on the&apos;23rd January had instructed .him to consider the legal aspects ofthe establishment, of a Recruiting Office for volunteers for Finland.He had discussed the matter with the Foreign Office and the attorney-General and had found that it would be necessary to issuetwo licences : first, a general licence authorising any british subject to enlist; secondly, a licence to Mr. Gibson to carry on his activities. It was proposed that the general licence should bepublished, but that the publication of the terms of the licence toMr. Gibson should be avoided if possible. The Home Secretary saidthat he thought there might be some criticism in the House ofCommons, on the ground that these licences constituted a breach of neutrality vis-a-vis Russia. Mr. Pritt had already put down aQuestion for the following Wednesday which referred to theForeign Enlistment Act. The Foreign Office considered that any criticism should be answered by stating that we were carrying out a resolution of the League of Nations; this might be supported asa make-weight by the point that Russia herself argued that she wasnot at war with Finland.The second line of defence was that, since we were carrying out a resolution of the League of Nations, the provisions of the ForeignEnlistment Act did not apply, and that any action which we tookin regard to issuing licences under the Act was done ex abundanticautela.The War Cabinet took note of the Home Secretary&apos;sstatement.Finland. 8.   In reply to a question by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,Visit of Sir the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, at his recentWalter Citrine interview with Sir Walter Citrine and Mr. Noel Baker on theirand Mr. Noel return from Finland, he had asked the latter to furnish him withBaker. a Note setting out his impressions regarding the morale of the(Previous Soviet Army.   The general impression which that interview hadEeference:        left on his mind was that E&apos;inlancks most urgent need was for w.M. (40) 38th material, and not for men.   Sir Walter Citrine had said that at conclusions,      their  final interview  Marshal  Mannerheim  had  expressed the minute 4.)        greatest gratitude for the help that we had given in the way ofmaterial, and had expressed the hope that his country would not bethought ungrateful if he now asked for still further assistance inthis form.   Both Sir Walter Citrine and Mr. Noel Baker hadthroughout their interview with him (the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs) evinced the strongest hostility against the soviet union.Interview with The Foreign Secretary said that be had also had a discussionMr. Attlee and in regard to Finland with Mr. Attlee and Mr. Arthur Greenwood,Mr. Greenwood, who had shown considerable anxiety lest, through giving active aid to the Finns, we might ourselves become involved in war with theU.S.S.R., a contingency which they regarded as most undesirable.The difference in the attitude which they had taken up from that ofSir Walter Citrine and Mr. Noel Baker was significant.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.Becruitment of volunteers.(previous kef erence:W.M. (40) 21stConclusions,Minute 4.)Sweden. 9,   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thatAttitude on the 10th February he had seen the Swedish Minister, who hadtowards aid for said that it was not possible for him at the present moment to finland. prophesy what attitude the Swedish Government would take ifFinland was clearly in grave danger of being annihilated. the waiting attitude which the Swedish Government had adoptedcorresponded with Swedish public opinion. There was always a danger that too generous aid to Finland by Sweden might undulyweaken the Swedish power to defend herself at home.   The elements
in Sweden which thought that no danger need be apprehended fromGermany in such circumstances were not representative of Swedishopinion generally. A suggestion had been made that units of theSwedish Army should be invited to volunteer for service in Finland,on the understanding that any individual serving in such units should be permitted to remain in Sweden if he so desired. Thisproposal had not yet been approved by the Swedish Government.In general the Swedish Government still thought that they had alittle time before they need reach a final decision as to their attitude.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Balkans.Meeting of the balkan Ententeat Belgrade.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 34thConclusions,Minute 37.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 133, Dipp, dated the 9th February, 1940, fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, reporting that the turkish minister for Foreign Affairs had told him that it had been agreed at the meeting of the Balkan Entente at Belgrade that the General Staffs of the Balkan Entente Powers should meet shortly at Athensto work out plans for mutual defence against outside aggression.This was very satisfactory, and showed that more progress had beenmade at Belgrade than we had previously supposed.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy.economic relations.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 38thConclusions,Minute 5.)11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 122 dated the 10th February, 1940, from Rome.In this telegram, Sir Percy Loraine reported having received an indication that Signor Mussolini&apos;s veto on the sale of weapons of war to the United Kingdom might possibly be reconsidered afterthe 15th February. Sir Percy Loraine added that he could notplace much reliance on this indication but that, as only a questionof a few days was involved, it might be as well not for the moment to take any steps which might prejudice the chance of reconsider a-tion.The Secretary of State for Air said that he had that morningascertained that the tests of the trainer and fighter aircraft, whichwe had proposed to buy from Italy, were taking place that dayas previously arranged. This seemed to suggest that signor mussolini&apos;s veto might not be absolute. The German armamentsMission were due to leave Rome in about a week, and it wasconceivable that this fact might have some bearing on the date15th February, mentioned in Sir Percy Loraine&apos;s telegram.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.       -,;Palestine.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)General policy.12. The War Cabinet resumed their discussion of the policy to be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to palestine and the communications to be made on this subject to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington.The War Cabinet had before them: (i) A Memorandum by the Prime Minister covering a revised draft telegram to Lord Lothian, the terms of which, so.far as concerned general policy, had been approved by:the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (W.P. (G.) (40) 38).(ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(W.P. (G.) (40) 3).
So far as concerned general policy, the War Cabinet warmlyapproved the terms of the revised draft circulated by the PrimeMinister.Control of land Discussion then turned on the control of land transfers.   Thetransfers. First Lord of the A dmifalty said that he regretted greatly that thispolicy should be adopted in the interests of one of the two partiesto whose welfare the Mandate had enjoined us to pay an equalregard. This part of the White Paper plan had been condemnedby the majority of the Mandates Commission at Geneva. In his view, it was a short-sighted policy. The action proposed would put a stop to agricultural progress in Palestine. The Jewishsettlers had made tremendous strides in recent years, while therewas no prospect that the Arabs would ever abandon their primitivemethods of cultivation. It was a striking fact that the arab population had shown the largest increase in those areas whereland had been purchased by Jews.Further, the policy proposed would almost certainly befollowed by a slump in land values, from which Arabs and Jewsalike would suffer.Finally, what was the urgency in taking these steps ? our action would cause a great outcry in American Jewry.The Secretary of State for War, looking at the matter fromthe economic point of view, thought that it might be a good thingfor Palestine, Jew and Arab alike, if steps were taken to slowdown the movement for the intensive cultivation of the land. Therewas great danger of over-production of citrus fruits.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he and his advisers were inclined to hold this view. On the other hand, one could not withhold one&apos;s tribute of admiration for the work theJews had carried out in reviving a dead countryside.The Secretary of State said that his views on land policy, andthose of the High Commissioner for Palestine, were set out in his memorandum W.P. (G.) (40) 3. In their view, a policy of controlover land sales was justified alike on merits and on grounds of expediency. All the Commissions and Committees of enquiry which had visited Palestine were agreed that land sales must be restricted if we were not to be faced with a landless Arab problem.As a World Power, it was necessary for us to hold the balance fairlyas between Jew and Arab. There could be no question that theArabs&apos; confidence in our word would be lost forever if we went backon this part of our policy.It would be an error of judgment to exaggerate the influence ofthe Jewish element in the United States. We had been told at thetime of the WTrite Paper that the Jewish element would sway publicopinion in that country against us, but this had not, in fact, proved to be the case.The land policy now proposed would not mean a crystallisationof obsolete agricultural methods. The land transfer RegulationsAvould divide Palestine into various categories, subject to greater or less degrees of restriction, or to none at all, but the boundariesthus set up would not stand for all time. It had long been Govern-ment policy to teach the Palestinian Arabs to modernise their agricultural methods, and this might be continued by an offer offinancial assistance. The Arabs themselves were in no condition toput new money into their land. It was mostly either hill or desertland, and barely provided them with a livelihood. Care would betaken not to say so publicly, but the intention was that land salesshould be allowed to continue in all the better agricultural districts of Palestine.The Prime Minister thought that the concensus of opinion among the Commissions and Committees which had visitedPalestine was very striking. It proved clearly that there wereeconomic as well as political reasons for the Secretary of State&apos;s land policy.
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he, personally,,ascribed to Government encouragement very little of the credit forthe great agricultural improvements which had taken place inPalestine. Broadly speaking, they were all the result of privateJewish efforts. So far as the Government of Palestine had playedany part in agricultural development, it was with Jewish moneywrung from the settlers by taxation. Nor was he impressed by thepolitical grounds on which it was attempted to justify our actionin bringing this great agricultural experiment to an end. Thepolitical argument, in a word, was that we should not be able to win the war without the help of the Arabs; he did not in the least admit the validity of that argument.Provided, however, that there was no ambiguity about hisposition, and that his views were on record in the War cabinet minutes, he would not press further his opposition to the Secretaryof State&apos;s land proposals. He was grateful to his colleagues for having met him on the wider issues raised by the message from theAmerican Zionists.The War Cabinet--(i) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to despatch a telegram toHis Majestv&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, in the termsof the draft annexed to W.P. (G.) (40) 38.^(ii) Approved generally the proposals submitted by theSecretary of State for the Colonies in his Memorandum(W.P. (G.) (40) 3) as to the control of land transfers.Palestine.Recruitment ofPalestinianarmed forces:Release ofBritish garrison.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3 (b).)13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies in regard to the recruitment of Palestinian Armed Forces (W.P. (G.) (40) 16).The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the origin of his Memorandum was the War Cabinet&apos;s invitation to theSecretary of State for War and himself &quot; to explore the possibilityof raising Palestinian forces, with a view to enabling the regulargarrison of Palestine to be reduced.&quot; There were no two opinionsas to the desirability of that object. After several years of civilAvar, however, the position in Palestine was so delicate that thetask of restoring and maintaining internal security could not as yet be committed to purely Palestinian forces. The withdrawal ofthe British garrison would mean an outbreak of trouble betweenthe Arab and Jewish elements in those forces. In a very short timethe need would arise for bringing back the British garrison.On the other hand, if we secured a progressive ameliorationin political conditions in Palestine, we should gradually be able toset the British garrison free, unit by unit, to play a part in thewar. The withdrawal of British units depended largely on thesuccess of Sir Charles Tegarfs plans for the Palestinian Police.In view of the unsettled state of the country, these plans included the construction of fortified Police posts. It was estimated thatit would be eight and a half months before the Police posts wouldbe completed.As regards the offers of military service which had beenreceived from the people of Palestine, the Secretary of State drew attention to the proposals set out in paragraphs 5-7 of his memorandum W.P. (G.) (40) 16.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it might have been thought a matter for satisfaction that the Jews in Palestine shouldpossess arms, and be capable of providing for their own defence.They were the only trustworthy friends we had in that country,and they were much more under our control than the scattered Arab-population. He would have thought that the sound policy forGreat Britain at the beginning of the war would have been to
303W.M. 39 (40)..build up, as soon as possible, a strong Jewish armed force inPalestine. In this way we should have been able to use elsewhere the large and costly British cavalry force, which was now to replace the eleven infantry battalions hitherto locked up in Palestine. Itwas an extraordinary position that at a time when the war was probably entering its most dangerous phase, we should station inPalestine a garrison one-quarter of the size of our garrison inIndia and this for the purpose of forcing through a policy which,in his judgment, was unpopular in Palestine and in Great Britainalike.The Secretary of State for War wondered whether the Policeposts of which the Colonial Secretary had spoken need be in thenature of permanent fortresses. Would not temporary fortificationsdo equally well ? It was of the utmost importance from the pointof view of the Army that the period before the withdrawal ofour garrison in Palestine should be as brief as possible.He thought it important that the various measures described in paragraphs 5-7 of W.P. (G.) (40) 16 should not include thecreation of either Arab or Jewish units. Every unit should be aPalestinian unit.The Secretary of State added that he was in entire agreementwith the Colonial Secretary&apos;s general policy.The Secretary of State for Air hoped that it might be found-possible to offer Palestinians the opportunity of enlistment in theR.A.F. It would also be desirable to offer them opportunity ofenlistment in various ancillary units under the command of theAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief in the Middle East.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was inagreement with the suggestions made by the Secretary of State forAir. He also agreed as to the need for shortening the period which must elapse before the Palestinian Police Force could takeover the complete responsibility for internal security. Theconditions obtaining in Palestine would, however, make it necessarythat the Police posts should have considerable defensive strength.Of the British forces now in Palestine, 8 infantry battalions andtwo cavalry regiments represented the garrison which was regardedas necessary for internal security purposes, and the remaining,troops in Palestine represented part of the Middle East reserve.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the FirstLord&apos;s statement had raised fundamental issues. What his proposal amounted to was that the Jews and Arabs should beallowed to arm, and left to fight out their differences alone. this might have been a natural solution before we accepted responsibilityfor Palestine, but to take such a course now would be discreditable.The First Lord had stated his case as if the issue was confined to palestine alone; but the problem was a much wider one and hadrepercussions throughout the Moslem world.The Prime Minister said that the First Lord was not alone infeeling dissatisfied with the situation. He also regretted the policywhich had brought us to the present pass. At the moment, he didnot see a solution to these difficulties, but we certainly could not givethe Jews alone freedom to arm.In reply to a question, the Secretary of State for the Coloniesstated that there were sufficient arms in all Jewish settlements (ona scale agreed with the Jewish Agency) for the protection of thosesettlements. There had been a steady improvement in the situationsince the issue of the White Paper, and he was taking steps to see whether the revised Police arrangements could not be introduced in less than eight and a half months.[20825] o
The First Lord of the Admiralty expressed the view that agendarmerie was much better suited to the needs of a country suchas Palestine than a regular military force..   The War Cabinet-(i) Agreed that it was not practicable to substitute aPalestinian armed force for the British garrison inPalestine.(ii) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to take steps to expedite the reconstitution of the Police Forcein Palestine, with a view to the revised arrangements being put into effect in a shorter period than eight anda half months.(iii) Approved the arrangements set out in paragraph 9 (b)and (c) of W.P. (G.) (40) 16 in regard to the opportunityto be offered to Palestinians for enlistment, subject to thefollowing addition to paragraph 9 (b), namely : that the scope of this offer should be extended rocover corresponding trades in the Royal Air Force;and that the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Middle East, should be given authority to recruitPalestinians for service in ancillary units, either inPalestine or in any theatre of war, at his discretion.(iv) Expressed general agreement with the view that, whenrebellion had been finally broken and when there organisation of the Police Force was completed, itshould be possible to reduce the British garrison to onemotor battalion, one infantry battalion, and one cavalry regiment.Palestine.Illegal Jewishmilitaryorganisation.14. The War Cabinet then considered two Memoranda by theSecretary of State for the Colonies on the subject of &quot; IllegalJewish Military Organisation &quot; (W.P. (40) 17 and 25).The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that there was now clear evidence of the existence in Palestine of a clandestine Jewishmilitary organisation. On grounds of expediency, as well as of good government, measures should be taken to deal with it, and the Jewsshould be treated no less firmly than the Arabs. As a result ofthe steps taken by the Palestine Government to disarm the arabs and provide armed guards for Jewish settlements, it could notbe pleaded that the Jews were compelled to rely for their securityon action of this kind. If the existence of this illegal organisationwere to be ignored by the Government, it was probable that theposition would quickly deteriorate. The Secretary of State saidthat the course suggested by the General Officer Commanding(summarised in paragraph 4 (5) of the first of his two papers) wentfurther than he himself recommended. Fie did not think that a widespread and active search for arms should be made in Palestine.Repressive action of this kind would be provocative and would encourage outbreaks of civil disobedience, with the result thatunnecessarily large military forces would have to be retained inthe country. He favoured, therefore, a middle course on the lines set out in paragraph 13. Under this proposal there would be nosystematic and intensive search for arms; searches would only bemade when reliable information was received. As regards drilling,he did not propose that the penalties imposed should be made more severe than they were at present. It was anomalous that, so long asboth Military and Civil Courts were in existence, offences of asimilar nature should be tried sometimes before one, sometimesbefore the other. He proposed, therefore, that, while the military courts remained in existence, power should be taken to enable ail
cases of this nature to be tried by those Courts. It was hoped thatit would be possible later to abolish Military Courts, and to restore the control of law and order to the civil authorities.In the discussion which followed the question was askedwhether there was, at present, one law for the Arabs and anotherfor the Jews.The Secretary of State for the Colonies explained, in reply,that, under the terms of the Regulations, the penalties were thesame for all offenders. The Military Courts, however, possessed,and were accustomed to exercise, a considerable measure of discretion in regard to the severity of the sentences which theyimposed. Their practice had been to treat Jewish offenders moreleniently than Arabs because it was felt that the Arabs were the aggressors, and that there was, therefore, a presumption that theJews acted in self-defence.The War Cabinet-Approved the recommendations contained in paragraph 13of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies (W.P. (G.) (40) 17) regarding the lines on whichthe High Commissioner for Palestine should be authorisedto proceed in dealing with illegal Jewish militaryorganisations.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.February 12, 1940.
