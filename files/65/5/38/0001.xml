The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)Enemy air activity.CoastalCommandoperations.1. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that there hadbeen a good deal of enemy air activity throughout the previous day.Raids had been carried out in two periods. The first, involvingsome 15 enemy aircraft, had been between 11 - 25 a.m. and 12 - 40 p.m,and had consisted of attacks on the following ships : H.M.S. Griffin, the Cree and four Minesweepers, two ofwhich had been sunk, near Rattray Head.Some unknown ships, the Stratheilan and other fishing-trawlers in the Forth and TayThe Lord Darling and Clintonia off Flamborough Head.The Boston Trader near Cromer. This vessel had sincegone ashore.There had been four interceptions. One Heinkel had beenbrought down, intact, on land near North Berwick. Another enemy aircraft was known to have come down in the sea halfway betweenthe Firth of Forth and Germany, the crew taking to theircollapsible boat. (This loss had not been claimed in the communiquesince this would have disclosed to the enemy our source of informa-tion.) A third had been damaged, but it was possible that it mighthave succeeded in reaching Germany.A second series of raids, involving possibly two or three aircraft, had been carried out about 8 p.m. in the Lowestoft andSouthwold area, and were thought to have been for minelaying.Weather had prevented interception by our fighters.A Hudson aircraft had sighted three enemy destroyers in theHorns Reef area at 1-26 p.m. on the previous day. The destroyers had opened anti-aircraft fire, and the Hudson had retaliated with bombs which, however, had missed. Eight Messerschmitts 109 had then appeared on the scene. These had registered hits on the tailunit, turret and wireless cabin of the Hudson, and had made theport rudder control unserviceable; but had refused to come withinrange of the rear gun turret of our aircraft. Taking advantage ofclouds, the Hudson had then completed its patrol.A Coastal Command aircraft had attacked a German mine-sweeper North of Heligoland on the previous afternoon.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff informed the War cabinet of certain impending operations.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)Enemy air attacks on shipping.Other enemy attacks on trade.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that on the previous day seven merchant ships had been attacked by enemy aircraft, but only three had suffered any damage,and none had been sunk.Four minesweeping-trawlers had been attacked off Aberdeen.Two had been sunk, one with all hands, and the other with a lossof at least two officers and several of the crew.H.M.S. Griffin had been machine-gunned off Buchan Ness, twoof the crew having been wounded.The Paddle Minesweeper Brighton Queen had been attacked by two aircraft off Arbroath at 11-30 a.m, and later by a single aircraft. Eight bombs had been dropped and the ship had beenmachine-gunned, but the Brighton Queen reported that fire from her Lewis gun had repeatedly hit the aircraft making the second attack, which had been seen to dive headlong into the sea about half a mile away. This was additional to the enemy losses reported by the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff.There had been no attacks on trade other than those madeby aircraft.[20807]b 2
S.S. Chagres (5,406 tons), previously reported as being in towafter having been mined off Liverpool, was now believed to have sunk.-General. The  magnetic  Minesweeper  Horde  had  exploded  anothermagnetic mine and was continuing operations.The British Tanker Appalachee (8,800 tons), had been in collision with one of our warships in fog, but would be repairedin about ten days.Enquiries had been received from the International Red Crossat Geneva as to whether we had any knowledge of one Captain      llNeumann, who was described as the Commander of the U-45.   This       *submarine was not on our list of sinkings, nor was Captain Neumannamong our prisoners of war.   It was to be inferred that the U-45had been sunk.The War- Cabinet took note of the above statement.The MilitarySituation.(Previousfief erence:W.M. (40) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)Western Front.Finland.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that anotherGerman Division had been formed in Poland. A Division, formerlyopposite Luxemburg, had been moved North to the vicinity of theMaestri schatcht Appendix.In Finland the Soviet attacks had continued South of lake ladoga, but had been nowhere successful and the Russians had hadheavy losses, particularly in tanks. He attributed these losses tothe unsuitable nature of the country and the difficulty of operatingtanks in the snow, which forced them to go very slowly, handicapswhich the Finns had exploited to the full.In Central Finland the fighting was reported to be taking placenearer the Russian frontier, showing that the Russians hadretreated.In the extreme North the fighting centred round Salmijaervi,and the Russians were reported to be very short of food.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had seen the Finnish Chief of Staff (Enckell by name), who had arrived inthis country by air in connection Avith the supplies which we were sending to Finland. The latter had given a much more reassuringaccount of the situation in Finland than that contained in recentreports from other, and in particular French, sources. Thisconfidence was, moreover, confirmed in a letter which he had brought from Field-Marshal Mannerheim, who, in referring to the Finnishneed for long-range guns, had written of the campaign as&quot; certainly a long one.&quot; This was in keeping with views which hadbeen previously expressed by Field-Marshal Mannerheim.The War Cabinet took ixote of this statement.Finland. 4.   In continuation of the preceding statement, the SecretaryVisit of Sir of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had had a long talk withWalter Citrine Sir Walter Citrine and Mr. Noel Baker on their visit to Finland,and Mr. Noel Their general account of the situation had been very encouraging,Baker. and they had been given to understand that the Russian losses were very high indeed in relation to those of the Finns, the ratio of 50 : 1even having been mentioned. Mr. Noel Baker had interviewed anumber of Russian prisoners, and. as a result of this and other infor-mation given to them, they had formed a very low opinion ofRussian morale. The Finns seemed to think that they could holdout for some considerable time longer, especially if they could receivethe assistance which they wanted in the form of aircraft and
293 W.M. 38 (40).artillery. They were anxious to obtain the services of aircraftmechanics, but otherwise laid very small emphasis on assistance inthe form of man-power. They were hoping to get the men that theyneeded from Sweden and Norway, a Norwegian Arctic Divisionbeing mentioned, and they had taken the line that their chances ofsecuring this help would be prejudiced if help from the Allies wasgiven so ostentatiously as to embarrass Sweden and Norway vis-a-visGermany.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Italy. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionEconomic to telegram No. 108 from His Majesty5s Ambassador in Rome,relations. reporting that he had been informed by Count Ciano &quot; that Signor(Previous Mussolini was not prepared anyway for six months to discussReference: question of the sale by Italy to the United Kingdom of any weaponsW.M. (40) 26th of war such as military aircraft, guns, bombs, &amp;c,&quot; as contemplatedConclusions, in the general agreement which the Master of the Rolls was hoping,Minute 1.) to negotiate with the Italian Government. He had given as his reasons (i) that he did not wish to expose himself to &quot; misunderstand-ings with Germans,&quot; and(ii) that he felt unable to denude Italy in the present circumstances-stance of her modern armaments.Sir Percy Loraine had made it clear that this meant the break-down of our comprehensive scheme.In telegram No. 109, Sir Percy Loraine reported that CountCiano5s attitude had been most friendly, and that he was reallydisappointed at the rejection of our plan. Sir Percy Loraine hadtaken the line that, if Signor Mussolini&apos;s decision was taken to imply that he would be willing to discuss these matters six monthshence, he (Sir Percy Loraine) was not sure that we should be. Weshould probably be able to get what we required from other sources,and it was his own view that &quot; before six months had elapsed, the fate of European man for many generations to come would havebeen settled.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadnot yet had time to study the implications of these telegrams, butthat at first sight they were not altogether unsatisfactory, as atany rate freeing us from any position of obligation to Italy.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the failure to receive airy anti-tank guns, &amp;c, from Italy was serious, but thatwe could manage without them.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.Roumania.Oil policy:supply of equip-ment and rawmaterials.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 37thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 103, in which Sir Reginald Hoare reported a conversation with the President of the Roumanian Council. Theposition seemed not unsatisfactory, but there was nothing definiteto consider until we received the Roumanian reply to our aide-memoire on the supply of equipment and raw materials. - ^The Prime Minister said that at a luncheon on the previous day, the Roumanian Minister in London had taken the line thatour complaints of the Roumanian Governments oil policy were entirely due to a misunderstanding. They were not helping theGermans to more than the minimum extent necessary in order tokeep them quiet.
The Minister without Portfolio pointed out that the longer we continued to hold up exports to Roumania without any official announcement, the more embarrassing the position became. Theposition could be held over the weekend, but would become moreand more difficult.The War Cabinet :-(i) Took note of this information.(ii) Agreed that the ban on the despatch of consignments to roumania should be continued for the time being.The Far East.Relationsbetween japan and the U.S.A.(previous references:W.M. (39) 101stConclusions,Minute 11, andW.M. (40) 21stConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to telegram No. 44 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Chungking-commenting on an earlier telegram from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Tokyo, and urging that we should let the United States ofAmerica pursue without hindrance the firmer policy towards Japanwhich they seemed to have in mind. He (the First Lord of theAdmiralty) entirely agreed with the views contained in this telegram, on the ground that it would be very much to our interest that the United States should bring increasing pressure to bearon Japan, as this would not only help China but embarrass Japan,without causing any blame to rest upon us.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed generally with this view. He had not yet had an opportunity of studying the earlier telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokyo, buthe thought that there was perhaps some misunderstanding on thepart of Sir A. Clark Kerr rather than an important divergence of views between the two Ambassadors.The War Cabinet took note of this discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 10, 1940.
