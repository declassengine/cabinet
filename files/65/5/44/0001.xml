347The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Attack onU-boat.w.m. m (40)2181. The Secretary of State for Air informed the War Cabinetthat the weather had seriously interfered with flying operations onthe previous day.No enemy aircraft had been reported close to our coasts.Normal convoy and escort patrols had been carried out by our fighters and had included 85 patrols, involving 211 aircraft.A reconnaissance had been carried out on the previous day ofthe anchorages and r-oads at Heligoland by a Blenheim of bomber command. This aircraft had failed to return, and it was fearedhad been lost.   The reconnaissance was being repeated that day.No operations had been reported from the British Air Forcesin France.The usual patrols, searches and convoy escorts had been flown by aircraft of Coastal Command.A Hudson aircraft had attacked an enemy submarine some90 miles east of the Orkneys at 12-40 p.m. Two bombs had been dropped, one of which had burst 20 yards ahead of the U-boat&apos;speriscope and the second 20 yards ahead of the first. A large patchof brown oil had come to the surface, and three minutes later a whiteraft had appeared.The Chief of Naval Staff remarked that this probably had todo with the boat&apos;s escape apparatus.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air said a specialreconnaissance had been carried out into the Skager Rak and along the South Coast of Norway to find the German vessel AItmark. the vessel had been sighted by Hudson aircraft just before 1 p.m. about20 miles north-west of the Lister Light, with results which theFirst Lord would describe (see Minute 2).The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3.)S.S. Altmarh.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the War Cabinetthat the A it mark had been identified on the previous afternoon byone of our aircraft. The information had been-passed to surfaceforces consisting of a Destroyer Flotilla (Leader H.M.S. Cossack)and the Cruiser H.M.S. Arethusa, which were in the vicinity. Onthe approach of one of our destroyers, H.M.S. Intrepid, theAlt-mark had sought refuge in the Losing Fjord. This fjord being a cul-de-sac, the Intrepid had taken station off the entrance with two Norwegian torj^edo boats between her and the Altmark.At 4 p.m. the Captain of the Destroyer Flotilla had reportedthat he was in Josing Fjord with the Altmark, from which he haddemanded the release of the British prisoners. Two Norwegiantorpedo boats were standing by. After consultation with theForeign Secretary, who had given his concurrence within fiveminutes, the following signal had been sent to the Captain of theDestixryer Flotilla : &quot; Unless Norwegian Torpedo Boat undertakes to convoyAltmark to Bergen with a joint Anglo-Norwegian guard onboard and a joint escort, you should board Altmark, liberate the prisoners, and take possession of the ship pending further instructions. If Norwegian Torpedo Boat interferes, you should warn her to stand off. If she fires upon you, you shouldnot reply unless attack is serious, in which case you shoulddefend yourself, using no more force than is necessary andceasing fire when she desists.Suggest to Norwegian Destroyer that honour is served bysubmitting to superior force.&quot;These Admiralty instructions had crossed a signal from the captain of H.M.S, Cossack reporting that he had been informed bythe Commanding Officer of the Norwegian Torpedo Boat Kjell that[20853] b 2
the Altmark had been examined in Bergen on the loth February,whence she had been authorised to proceed South through Terri-torial Waters. The Captain of the Kjell had further said that theAltmark was unarmed, and that nothing was known of prisoners.On being so informed, H.M.S. Cossack had withdrawn to awaitinstructions.After receiving and decyphering the signal from HALS.Cossack, the Admiralty had sent instructions supplementing their original telegram as follows : &quot; If offer of joint escort and guard to Bergen is not accepted and you have been forced to board, action is to be taken as follows : (ft) If the prisoners are found to be on board, ship is to bebrought in as a prize.(6) If no prisoners are found and ship is definitelyAltmark, Captain and Officers are to be brought toEngland in order that we may ascertain what hasbeen done with prisoners. Ship to be left infjord.&quot;Before receiving these last instructions, the Captain of theCossack had, however, acted on the original Admiralty telegram.The news of his action was first made known to the Admiralty bysignals which were intercepted from the Altmark to the GermanEmbassy at Oslo, reporting that she had been boarded, andcomplaining of alleged English brutality.The first news of the action from the Captain of the Cossackwas received at the Admiralty at 2-40 a.m. in a telegram which stated that he had re-entered the fjord after dark. He had boardedthe Altmark by laying his ship alongside and had recaptured allthe prisoners numbering between 300 and 400. The Altmark hadmanoeuvred to try to sink the Cossack, while she was going along-side, but in the effort had herself run aground at the end of thefjord, and was probably unseaworthy as a result. The Norwegianshad stood aside, refusing to help but without taking any activesteps to interfere. One British and several German casualties had resulted from the boarding operations, which had been resisted bythe Altmark, and the Cossack was reported to be somewhat battered.No German prisoners had been taken.Continuing, the First Lord said that the Cossack was now on her way home and was clue to arrive at 1 p.m. that day. Pendingthe fuller report which would be obtained on her return, he had thought it desirable that an official communique should be issued on the information which was at present available, with the least possible delay. He had accordingly prepared a draft, which hethen read to the War Cabinet.Consideration was given to the text of the Communique.Discussion turned mainly on whether it was wise to include in thisCommunique, which would have to be issued at once having regardto the false statements already made on the German wireless, anypassages or phrases condemning the attitude of the Norwegians, orgoing so far as to accuse them of a breach of international law.It was felt that, while the case for the action which we bad takenwas extremely strong on grounds of common sense and broad equity,it was undesirable to deal with this aspect of the matter untilthe receipt that afternoon of the report of the Captain of HALS.Cossack.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised the importanceof energetic action by the Ministry of Information. The german wireless had already made a number of statements, the completefalsity of which had been proved. It was important to seize theopportunity of demonstrating to the world the unreliability ofGerman wireless news.
A preliminary discussion took place on the action of theNorwegian authorities in this matter. It was significant that theNorwegian authorities had considered a search of the Altmark atBergen to be necessary, but they had failed to find any prisonerson board and had then given the A it mark permission to proceedthrough territorial waters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the norweigen minister might be asked what was the object of the Norwegiansearch; what had been the results of the search; and why Norwegiangunboats had been in company with the A it mark.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thoughtit likely that the Norwegian Minister would come to see him that afternoon. If the Norwegian Minister were to make a protest, he(the Secretary of State) would take the line that it was we, andnot the Norwegians, who had strong grounds for complaint in thismatter.Discussion then ensued on the wider aspect of this event. Itwas pointed out that this ca.se constituted a flagrant misuse of territorial waters, and that the Norwegian authorities had demon-demonstrated their inability to prevent such a misuse, notwithstanding that they purported to have searched the ship. It was thought thatthe case should prove a powerful lever for obtaining Norwegianassent to the laying of a minefield in Norwegian territorial waters.The War Cabinet-(1) Expressed their high appreciation of the manner in whichthis exploit had been carried out.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to issue the draftCommunique which he had read out to the War Cabinet,subject to the amendments agreed to; and to consult withthe Minister of Information in regard to the issue ofa denial of the German wireless statements.The Military 3.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theSituation. number of German divisions on the Western Front had increased to(Previous 147, of which 100 divisions were concentrated close up to the Front.Reference:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Western Front.Finland. The Finnish situation was still obscure.   As far as could be ascertained, extremely heavy Russian attacks had been launched onthe whole front in the Karelian Isthmus, and they had succeeded in forcing a salient in the Finnish line near Summa. It seemed fairlycertain, however, that the Finns had not abandoned any importantposition and that their line was still intact. The Russian losses hadbeen extremely heavy and, taking into consideration the number oftroops they had employed, their advance had been very slow.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether newspaperreports of fighting in Summa itself, were true.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff- said that this infor-mation was probably correct, but this would not indicate that themain Finnish position had been penetrated.
Assistance to 4.   The War Cabinefs attention was invited to messages from finland. Mr. Harold Macmillan, M.P., at present in Finland, emphasising(Previous the gravity of the situation and the urgent need of the Finns for reference:        artillery, ammunition and aircraft.W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Sliort-nosedBlenheims.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 41stConclusions,Minute 5.)(previous reference:W.M. (39) 104thConclusions,Minute 7.)In reply to a question, the Chief of the Air Staff referred tothe suggestion, made at the meeting of the War Cabinet referred toin the margin, that short-nosed Blenheims at present in service withthe Royal Air Force might be immediately released for Finland, onthe understanding that they would be replaced by an equivalentnumber of new aircraft which were not yet ready to leave the factories. This possibility had been examined, but it was doubtfulwhether any short-nosed Blenheims could be spared. In any case,,the short-nosed Blenheims promised to Finland from the manufac-turers would be available in two or three days, so that no time wouldbe saved by releasing aircraft from the Royal Air Force.The Chief of the Air Staff asked whether it was still necessarythat any aircraft sent to Finland should ostensibly take the form ofa sale by the aircraft firm concerned to the Finnish Government.The War Cabinet agreed that the existing procedure for transferring aircraft to Finland as a commercial transaction shouldbe continued unless delay would be caused thereby, in which casethe Air Ministry were authorised to supply the aircraft to Finlanddirect.7o-mm. gunsfrom the UnitedStates.The Minister without Portfolio said that he had been asked to sound the High Commissioner for Canada on the possibility of theCanadian Authorities facilitating the supply of 75-mm. guns nowin the United States to Finland. The High Commissioner^,personal reactions had been favourable.The Secretary of State for Foreign A fairs drew attention to.&apos;telegram No. 245 to Washington, in which Lord Lothian had beenasked whether he considered that, if the Finns were to try to persuade the Swedes to get the guns, they would have a better chanceof success. He suggested that no further action should be takenpending the report from Lord Lothian on his talk in Washingtonwith, his Finnish colleague on the matter.The Minister without Portfolio said that he would make sure that the Canadian High Commissioner had reported his conversa-tion to the Canadian Authorities.The War Cabinet (i) Took note of the above statements.(ii) Agreed that aircraft could be supplied direct to theFinnish Government, if delay would be involved in arranging for the delivery to take the form of sale bythe manufacturers to the Finnish Government,
351 W.M. 44 (40)        220Assistance to 5.   The   War   Cabinet   had   under   consideration   certainFinland. questions, the discussion in regard to which is recorded in the(Previous Secretary&apos;s Standard. File of War Cabinet Conclusions.Preference:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Newspaperarticle. .____Italy.economic relations.(previous reference erence:W.M. (40) 43rdConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a letter which he had received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome, inregard to the breakdown of the recent economic negotiations with italy, the substance of which might be summarised as follows :  Sir Percy Loraine suggested, that the War Cabinet neednot feel unduly depressed. Signor Mussolini had taken, on political grounds, a decision on a matter which had been sub-mitted to him by us on the economic plane. The Duce took the line that, if he had agreed to our economic proposals, hewould himself have tacitly taken a political decision of the first importance, namely, to render help to us against his GermanAlly. The Italian Government did not suggest in any way that, in making our economic proposals, we had attempted to force with them a political issue. Sir Percy Loraine had inhis conversations with Count Ciano obtained an expressrecognition of the attitude of the Italian Government on thispoint. If Signor Mussolini had agreed to our economicproposals, we should have secured a political success of a kind which could hardly be expected within nine months of the signature of the Italo-German military alliance, and afteronly six months of indecisive warfare.Sir Percy Loraine summarised the effect of the negotia-tions as follows : we had failed to secure from Italy certainweapons, the possession of which could not have exercised a decisive military effect. On the other hand, we ourselves had given away nothing. Italy would not receive the coal and rawmaterials which she desired, and as a result she was weakerand less able herself to make war. Italian industrialists wouldknow that, if they were short of coal, this would be due solely to a decision taken by the Duce on purely political grounds.The position was that we had made honourable proposals toItaly, but that the Duce had. been unable to accept them; inthe result no harm had been done, and on the whole the negotia-tions had strengthened our position.In reply to a question by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary&apos;of State for Foreign A fairs agreed that we had now reached the stage at which we should give orders for the inter-ception of ships carrying German coal to Italy. He wished, how-ever, first to see the &quot;Master of the Rolls, which he had arranged to do the following Monday (the 19th February, 1940). The Ministerfor Economic Warfare had to answer a question on the subject onthe Tuesday (the 20th February, 1940).The First Lord of the Admiralty said that it would, in his view, be a mistake to announce in advance our intention to seizesuch ships; the better course would be to issue the necessary orders and to make a statement when one or two ships had in fact beenintercepted.
contraband control.Attitude of theUnited StatesGovernment.(previous references:W.M. (40) 21stConclusions,Minute 10,and 29thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. In connection with the discussion recorded in Minute above, the First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in deference tothe Foreign Secretary&apos;s anxiety lest anything untoward shouldhappen to a United States vessel, the Admiralty had issued ordersabout a fortnight previously that no United States vessels shouldbe brought into the danger zone prescribed by President Roosevelt.As a result, no United States vessels were being brought to the examination base at Kirkwall, and all were passing freely to their destinations. It would, in his view, be a real calamity if a UnitedStates vessel brought into Kirkwall by our orders was torpedoed bya German submarine with a resultant loss^f life to the UnitedStates crew. In that event, anger in the United States would bedirected not against the German submarine, but against us because it would have been we who had forced the United States vessel inquestion to enter the danger zone in spite of the Presidents orders.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, while he appreciated the action taken by the First Lord of the Admiralty,that action was causing serious embarrassment to the Minister for economic Warfare in the administration of contraband controlvis-a-vis other neutrals. It would be extremely difficult to justifygranting an express exemption in favour of the United Statesvessels in view of the attitude of such neutrals as Italy and Japan.There was a real danger that, in that event, very serious inroadswould be made into the whole contraband control system. On thewhole, he felt that our proper course would be to furnish HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, with a frank and full state-ment of our difficulties, and to ask him to lay it before the UnitedStates Government, who might then be willing that, in order tomaintain the principle, we should from time to time take a UnitedStates vessel into Kirkwall for examination.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that from the legal pointof view there was no doubt that, if there was to be a blockade, itshould be applied indiscriminately to all the neutrals. In thepresent case, the problem seemed to be to strike the balance betweenthe risk of creating serious annoyance in the United States on theone hand, and. on the other hand, the embarrassment which anexemption in favour of the United States would cause us in dealing-with other neutrals.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,February 17, 1940.
