The First Lord of the Admiralty said that there had been no enemy air attacks on shipping in the previous 24 hours; nor had any British ships been sunk by other forms of enemy activity.The Swedish ship Fram (2,491 tons) had been torpedoed near-Banff.   Five survivors had been landed. ;There had been contact with a U-boat, and the hunt was continuing. ]Shipping on the East Coast was now moving freely again.     .The third Canadian troop convoy was on its way across the atlantic. When it arrived, the First Canadian Division would be complete.The first Australian and New Zealand convoy had left Colombo.Seventy-five per cent, of the fishermen who bad volunteered totrawl for magnetic mines in response to an appeal made by theAdmiralty some weeks previously had expressed a desire to continueto carry on this dangerous occupation for the duration of the war.An account had now been received of one of the attacks madeby a German bomber on a fishing vessel. \The aircraft circled round thirteen times. Each time it drovethe crew into the charthouse by machine-gun fire, and then flewoverhead and dropped incendiary bombs on to the deck. When ithad passed, the crew rushed out and threw the bombs overboard,which they just had time to do before the next attack took place.One of the bombs had rendered their only boat unserviceable. Theaircraft finally flew so close to the vessel that it broke a stay withits wing-tip, and then departed.When asked what he would have clone if the enemy aircraft had been brought down into the sea, the Captain of the fishing vesselsaid that he would have picked the pilot up, and would have puthim in his bunk. He bore no malice, as the pilot was only carrying-out his orders in making the attack.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought the Captain&apos;s state-ment showed how far the people of the country had gone in takingfor granted the atrocities which the enemy committed in his methodof prosecuting the war. He could not subscribe to the view that theenemy, who committed such brutalities, should be welcomed withopen arms and treated as a friend. The widespread dissemination of such an outlook must have a harmful effect on our power to wagethe war, and would encourage the apathy in neutral countries.In discussion, the view was expressed that more might be done to rouse the feelings of humanity against the Germans, but that, ifwe adopted German methods, the effect would probably be to confirm the neutrals in the view that brutality was an inevitablecharacteristic of war.1. The Secretary of State for,Air said that bad weather had again severely hampered air operations. There had been no enemy air activity, and our forces had been unable to undertake anyoperations of importance. Many of the lighter aerodromes were still unserviceable on account of snow.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.
The Secretary of State for War said that he had seen a picturein a newspaper (which he would send to the First Lord) of a merchant vessel which had been set on fire and was sinking. Twoguns were visible on board the ship, with the barrels horizontal,from which it appeared that, if either of them was an anti-aircraftgun, it had not been made use of.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.The MilitarySituation.Distribution ofGermandivisions.-(previous reference:W.M. (40) 27thConclusions,Minute 7.)Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 29thConclusions,Minute S.)3. The Secretary of State for War said that one new Germandivision had been identified in Poland, bringing the total to 16; one new division had been reported in Czeeho-Slovakia; and there were indications of two new divisions in Central Germany, bringing thetotal there to possibly 6. The total number of German divisionswas 140, or possibly 142.The Russian attacks in the Karelian Isthmus and North of lake Ladoga had met with no success; the Finns were attacking inthe centre of Finland, and in the North the Russians had now been pressed back to the positions which they had occupied before their recent attack started.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.India and the 4.   In an introductory statement, The Secretary of State forWa1&apos;- India explained that the Viceroy&apos;s speech at Bombay on the(Previous 10th January had been acclaimed by Mr. Desai, the Congress leaderReference: in the Legislative Assembly, as constituting a considerable stepW.M. (39) 12lst towards resolving the constitutional impasse. Shortly afterwards,Conclusions, the Viceroy had received a letter from Mr. Gandhi suggesting a minute l.) meeting, which had now been arranged for Monday, the5th February.The Secretary of State then drew attention to the more impor-tant paragraphs of his Memorandum W.P. (G.) (40) 37.In paragraph 6 he stated the general problem with whichwe were faced, namely : (a) the Congress demand for full self-government and forthe calling of a Constituent Assembly as soon as might be after the war. in which the Indians them-selves would frame a constitution, free from outsidedictation; and(&amp;) the demand of the Minorities that no commitmentshould be made as to India&apos;s future to which theywere not consenting parties.Paragraph 8 contained his own proposals as to the lines on which the Viceroy might be authorised to proceed in had discussions with Mr. Gandhi.Paragraph 9 set out the basis on which the Viceroy himselfsuggested that the conversations might be conducted.In later paragraphs he gave reasons for thinking thatthere was no chance of the Viceroy&apos;s plan, unless it were substantially modified, proving the basis of fruitful discussion.In his view agreement between the various Indian communitieswas the only possible basis for further progress, unless the fairtreatment of the Minorities was to remain the ultimate respon-sibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government (paragraph 10).
(previous reference:W.M. (39) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1.)The crux of the matter, in his view, was that the postulateof Indian agreement should be regarded as inter-linked withthe acceptance by us of the results of that agreement, subject always to our insistence on the desiderata set out in para-graph 8 (vi) and (vii). In other words, subject always to thosestipulations, we ought no longer to stand in the way of Indiabecoming a self-governing Dominion (paragraph 12).These desiderata might appropriately be obtained bymeans of a negotiated treaty (paragraph 15).If substantial progress could be made towards agreement withMr, Gandhi and Congress, Congress Ministries would again assumeoffice in those Provinces where the Congress had a majority. If, onthe other hand, there were a complete break with Congress, are currence, of civil disobedience must be anticipated. This wouldprobably mean serious trouble in March or April, for the following-reasons : (1) The Annual General Meeting of the All-India CongressCommittee had been called for March. It seemedimpossible that they would not take strong action if no agreement had been reached before then.(2) At that time of year agricultural operations in India had ceased, and could not be resumed until the rains came in the middle or at the end of June. The Spring and early Summer was always the time at which there wasthe greatest risk of mass movements.(3) Under Section 93 of the Act of 1935, it was necessary toreport the position to Parliament six months after theassumption of sole charge by the Provincial Governors.Unless, therefore, the position materially improved,Parliament would have to be invited in April next topass resolutions continuing in force the Proclamationsin virtue of which the Provincial Governors had takencharge. The Congress Party might think it good tacticsto arrange for disturbances to break out about that time.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that in November 1939alarming prospects had been held out of what would happen if theProvincial Ministries resigned. The War Cabinet had been pre-pared to go very far to avoid the anticipated results, but not far enough to satisfy the Congress Party.The War Cabinet had taken a firm stand against theimmoderate demands of Congress, and had given their full support to the Viceroy and to the Provincial Governors in taking thenecessary measures for the maintenance of law and order. what had been the result? India had enjoyed a period of perfecttranquillity. For the first time for several years the CongressProvinces had been properly administered.We were now told that we were again faced with danger, andthat to avoid that danger it was of the utmost importance that theViceroy should reach agreement with Mr. Gandhi. The Memorandabefore&apos; the War Cabinet, and the telegrams which had been exchanged with the Viceroy, recommended far-reaching constitu-tional proposals. Was it fair that Parliament and the War cabinet should have to involve themselves in these complications in the midstof a great war? No doubt the Viceroy must see Mr. Gandhi, buthe should make it clear that he had nothing to add to his previousstatements. He should point out once again that a standing offer-was already open to the Congress ex-Ministries, and that they couldreturn to office at any moment, if they chose.The First Lord said that he did not share the anxiety toencourage and promote unity between the Hindu and Moslemcommunities.   Such unity was, in fact, almost out of the realm of
practical politics, while, if it were to be brought about, theimmediate result would be that the united communities would join in showing us the door. He regarded the Hindu-Moslem feud as abulwark of British rule in India.The First Lord did not believe that the Government would meet with serious Parliamentary criticism if they chose the firm course.A method of government which kept India quiet for the duration of the war would be certain of the approval of the country as awhole.The Lord Privy Seal agreed that it would be inadvisable to ask parliament to legislate on Indian constitutional matters so long asthe war lasted. He thought, however, that it would be a mistake to stop discussions which might bring a settlement nearer. All theevidence available to us went to show that a break between theViceroy and Mr. Gandhi would be a calamity, which might very well be followed by serious trouble in the Spring. Mr. Nehru andthe extremists would probably carry the day, and we should haveto deal with a period of civil disobedience, if not of terrorism. Werewe prepared to contemplate that possibility at a time when we mightbe involved in operations on the Western Front and with Russia?The Lord Privy Seal did not dissent from the view that it was preferable in theory that the present constitutional position should remain undisturbed until after the war, and that, short of this, ifthe Viceroy&apos;s proposals were accepted in India, it would be a satis-factory situation. The question was : could the Viceroy hold that position ? If he could, so much the better. If he could not, he (theLord Privy Seal) saAv no better method of dealing with the situationthan the proposals in W.P. (G.) (40) 37.Our position in the world would be greatly strengthened if wewere able to negotiate a treaty with Indian politicians, as the meansof securing our desiderata in connection with the defence of India,the service of the sterling debt, the rights of the services, &amp;c. Thesanction behind such a treaty would be the retention of the british garrison in India.The First Lord of the A dmiralty was afraid that the new statusproposed for India amounted to little more than a loose alliance with the British Empire. We should take warning from, ourdealings with. Egypt.The Lord Privy Seal said that he certainly did not wish Indiato follow the Egyptian precedent of a treaty between independentPowers. The inauguration of an Indian Federation, inside theEmpire, was essential to the scheme which he contemplated. he wished to see Federation come into force as soon as the necessarynumber of States (i.e., the number required under the Act of 1935)could be persuaded to accede. If possible, this should take placesimultaneously with the signature of the proposed Treaty.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theMemorandum before the War Cabinet, with its accompanyingtelegrams, set out the ultimate realities of the Indian situation asit was likely to develop, and looked forward to the problems to be faced in the future. He agreed that we should hold out no prospectof legislation during the war. and he appreciated the argument that it was early to talk of any further progress so soon after thepassing of the Act of 1935. But, in his view, the Indian problem was dynamic and not static, and our difficulties were liable toincrease unless we faced the fundamental issues. If we decided to stand firmly on our existing position, strong forces would probablyaccumulate against us. It was better to attempt to direct those forces into safe channels. It was significant that the Viceroy andthe Secretary of State, with their heavy responsibilities and theirdirect knowledge, recommended that we&quot; could not merely leave theposition as it was.
In his opinion two essentials must be borne in mind. First,we must protect ourselves against the charge that we were actingupon the &quot; Divide and Rule &quot; principle. He entirely agreed withthe proposals of the Secretary of State on this point : we mustinsist on agreement between all the parties concerned as an essential condition of progress, and we must make it clear that it was theirown responsibility to secure this agreement, but that we would give them as much help as possible. It would tremendously strengthen our position if it could come to be believed that we really meant this.Secondly, the essential points as to defence, &amp;c, had to be providedfor, either by safeguards in an Imperial statute or by a negotiatedtreaty, and if we could secure them by the second alternative, that,also, would have a very great effect upon Indian feeling.He therefore favoured telling the Viceroy that, if he could secure agreement on the lines which he himself proposed, so much the better; but, if not, that he should proceed on the lines suggestedby the Secretary of State. He did not consider that there was any great difference between the latter and the Viceroy. Such differenceas there was related primarily to the point in time at which a fulleroffer should be made.As regards Dominion status (paragraph 8 (ii) of W.P. (G.)(40) 37), he thought that the Viceroy should say that the questionof secession was academic. Discussion on this point might lead to ghandi saying that the self-government offered was something lessthan that enjoyed by the Dominions. .The Chancellor of the Exchequer analysed the differences between the Viceroy&apos;s proposals as set out in paragraph 9 of w.P. (G.) (40) 37 and the suggestions of the Secretary of State asset out in paragraph 8. In particular, while the Viceroy contem-plated offering consultation with the Indians on the revision of theConstitution after the war, the Secretary of State suggested inparagraph 8 (vii) that, subject to a number of assumptions and safe-guards, we should commit ourselves to accepting a Constitutionframed by Indians themselves. He preferred the Viceroy&apos;s pro-posal, and. saw no reason to make at the.present time an offer suchas that suggested by the Secretary of State. In any case, theretention of a British army in India, was inconsistent with completeself-government.He also pointed out that the Viceroy, in paragraph 4 of his telegram 140-S, urged that &quot;we ought to go very slow.&quot; At thepresent time we ought to take the course which would help us mostin the prosecution of the war, and it was, after all, the Moslemcommunity that provided the fighting men. In view of the short time that had elapsed since the passing of the Act of 1935, of all the assurances that had been given at that time, and of the fact that none of the Princes had yet made terms for coming into a FederalIndia, there was every reason for not going any faster than we were obliged to. An offer on the lines proposed by the Secretary of state would not stop the movement in India which gave rise to excessivedemands. Our general line, therefore, should be not to urge theViceroy to go any further than he himself thought strictly necessary.Fie also drew attention to the mention, in paragraph 4 (3) of theSecretary of State&apos;s telegram No. 431 of the 26th January, of thepossibility of securing a treaty of limited duration, which seemedto him likely to have disastrous results.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs said that he had been entirely in favour of the offer which the Viceroy had previouslymade to the Congress Party. That offer, however, had not beenaccepted, and he saw no reason to do more than to inform theCongress Party that the offer previously made was still available.He was by no means convinced that there was serious risk of civildisobedience and consequent rioting if we made no immediateadvance.
The Prime Minister drew attention to the statement by theViceroy in paragraph 8 of his telegram No. 140-S (Appendix A toW.P. (G.) (40) 37) to the effect that he regarded his talks with gandhi as purely preliminary. He concluded that there was no need at this stage for any decision as to the next step to be takenshould the first stage of the conversations disclose that Gandhi wasnot ready to accept the Viceroy&apos;s point of view. He proposed,therefore, that the Viceroy should be authorised to open up conver-sations on the lines which he himself had proposed; that he shouldbe asked to report further if he found progress on these lines to beimpossible; but that no further instructions should be sent to him for the present.There was general agreement with this view.The Secretary of State for India said that he fully appreciated the arguments against forcing the pace. He had never wished to urge the Viceroy to go beyond what he himself thought necessary.On the other hand, he was very anxious to prevent serious outbreaks.Both in India and elsewhere, our sincerity was doubted when wesaid that we were not deliberately adopting the policy of &quot; Divideand Rule.&quot; He himself thought this a thoroughly bad principle,and we might well have to take some definite action to show that we did not believe in it. It would not be possible for us to maintain our present position in India unchanged after the war, and our difficulties would be increased i f we made no advance until it were forced on us. He thought it was a wiser policy to make some progress towards a settlement while conditions were favourable.He said this in order to make his own position plain, but hewould be quite happy now to telegraph to the Viceroy, authorisinghim to proceed in his talks Avith Gandhi on the basis of the suggestions contained in paragraph 9 of W.P. (G.) (40) 37, to report back if difficulties arose, but to offer nothing more A\ri.without furtherauthority from the War Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the state-ment in the opening paragraph of telegram No. 99 G, elated the23rd January, 1940, in which the Viceroy anticipated, thatMr. Gandhi might take the opportunity of the forthcoming meeting to press him as regards the treatment of the Scheduled Castes as a minority for the purpose of constitutional protection. In anotherconnexion, the Secretary of State for India had spoken of the needfor protecting the &quot; great minorities.&quot; He asked whether the scheduled Castes constituted one of the &quot; great minorities &quot; forwhich protection would be necessary in any future constitution.The question was of great importance, since Mr. Gandhi was clearlymost anxious that special protection should not be afforded to the scheduled Castes, the members of which he regarded as beingHindus.The Secretary of State for India said that he certainly regarded the Scheduled Castes, which comprised some 60 million persons, as constituting one of the &quot;great minorities,&quot; and therefore as requiring special protection in any constitutional arrangement inexactly the same Avay as the Muslims. So far as special representa-tion in the Legislatures was concerned, both as regards method and extent, this was at present determined by the Poona Pact, a contract which, by its own terms, was terminable only by mutual consent.There was one specific point in regard to the future status of.India on wdiich the Viceroy had asked for definite instructions (seeparagraph 4 (a) of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram No. 127-S, dated the28th January, 1940), namely, whether there was any objection to theuse by him (the Viceroy) in conversation with Mr. Gandhi ofthe words &quot; Independence within the Empire &quot; as being equivalentto Dominion status. Notwithstanding the great importance attached to the word &quot; independence &quot;by Congress, it seemed on thewhole preferable to employ the word &quot; self-government.&quot;
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that therewas an accepted formula describing Dominion status and suggestedthat it would be unwise to attempt to employ any other phraseology.The Lord Privy Seal agreed that the proper course would be to employ the accepted formula, and at the same time to make it clearthat, in our view, &apos;&apos; Dominion status &apos;&apos; implied membership of theBritish Empire.The Secretary of State for India said that he wOuld explain the position to the Viceroy in the light of what had been said.The War Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for India to inform theViceroy as follows : (i) That, in his forthcoming talks with Mr. Gandhi, heshould proceed on the lines of the programmesummarised in paragraph 9 (a)-(d) of W.P. (G.)(40) 37.(ii) That if he found further progress on these lines to beimpossible, he should report to the Secretary ofState, who would consult with the War Cabinet,before making any further offer,(iii) That he should not use the phrase &quot; independence within the Empire,&quot; but should use the phrase&quot;Self-governing&quot; or &quot;Autonomous communitieswithin the Empire.&quot;The Balkans. 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionAttitude of to telegram No. 21, dated the 31st January, 1940, from HisItaly.

The Secretary of State also drew attention to telegram No. 86,dated the 1st February, 1940, from Rome, in which Sir percy loraine reported having had another very intimate conversationwith Count Ciano, from which he felt justified in concluding that signor Mussolini&apos;s official attitude was at bottom appreciably lessunfavourable to us than he (Sir Percy Loraine) had previouslysupposed. The Secretary of State said that there seemed from this telegram reason to hope that, in general, the situation was betterthan we had thought.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Western Front.possible german attackon netherlands and Belgium.(previous reference:W.M.

The Hague, in which Sir Nevile Bland reportedhaving been informed that morning by M. van Kleffens, the netherland Minister for Foreign Affairs, that he still thought thatthe German invasion scare of a fortnight ago had been exaggerated.As regards the story of secret documents having been found on german airmen in Belgium, Baron von Zuylen had admitted rathershamefacedly (presumably to the Netherland Minister in Brussels)that even M. Spaak had not actually seen the documents in question.In general, he (M. van Kleffens) thought that the situation wascalmer for the moment; there had, he understood, been slightmovements of German troops away from the Netherland-german frontier.    The whole incident of the alleged capture of these
documents was, in his (the Secretary of State&apos;s) opinion, extremelysuspicious, and he doubted very much whether the documents wereThe War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The Far East:Relations with japan.The case ofthe S.S.Hcyio Maru.(previous reference:W.M.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 189, dated the 1st February, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo, in which Sir Robert Craigie reportedthat, in view of the shortness of time available, he had told theJapanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, most confidentially,that he had reason to believe that there might be some german officers from the Graf Spee among the Germans to be embarked onthe s.s. Heyio Maru at Callao. His communication had beenreceived in a most appreciative spirit by the Vice-Minister forForeign Affairs, who had undertaken to send instructions both toLima and to Callao that full investigations should be made. He (theSecretary of State) had instructed our Consul-General at Callao toget into contact with the Japanese Consul-General at that port.He had now been informed by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, buenos aires, that the Argentine Foreign Office stated most categoricallythat none of the officers of the Graf Spee had escaped from internment.The War Cabinet would have seen from Sir Robert Craigie&apos;telegram No. 210, dated the 1st February, 1940, that the case of thes.s. Asama Maru was well on the way to being settled satisfactorilyon the basis of the return by us to Japan of ten of the Germans inquestion.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Richmond Terrace, S.
