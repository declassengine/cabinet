The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that bad weather had very much limited the activities of the patrols of Fighter command the previous day. No enemy aircraft had been reported. NormalCoastal Command patrols had been carried out. A flying boat basedon Lerwick had sighted a submarine close to one of our cruisers.The aircraft had dropped one bomb, which fell about 20 yards fromthe submarine, and it was thought probable that this had saved the cruiser from attack.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.AiroraftIndustry.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Secretary of State for Air said that the unrest in theaircaft industry, the possibility of which he had mentioned at themeeting referred to in the margin, had not developed to any seriousextent. Most of the hands at Napiers had not been at work on saturday and had held a mass meeting, but they had all returnedto work that morning. Reports had been circulated of meetings of workmen at other aircraft factories, but there was as yet no confirmation -mation of these reports, which might form part of an attempt tofoment unrest.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.Aircraft and air personnel.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 19thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Secretary of State for Air said that the Air Ministry,in response to a request received, had been considering whether12 Hurricane fighters could not be provided for Finland. Thedespatch of these aircraft would mean the subtraction of 12 aircraft from A.D.G.B.The War Cabinet were aware of our own position. It mightbe, however, that these aircraft would give an equally valuable contribution in Finland towards our war effort as a whole. If sent,8 would go in the immediate future a.nd 4 later on. As regardspilots, either volunteers could be found in the Royal Air Force, or,alternatively, Finnish personnel could be brought over here for ashort course of training. If Royal Air Force personnel were used,the fact was certain to become known. Some 25 to 30 personnel would have to be sent, including about 9 pilots. The aircraft couldbe flown out, but the ground staff would have to.go separately, either by sea or by air transport. Even if the aircraft were handed overto the Finns, they would need a few mechanics permanently. the finns could certainly provide pilots of their own, who would be ofa high standard. As regards time, the limiting factor was thedespatch of the ground equipment. It would be about four weeks before the aircraft could operate in Finland. It would make little difference whether we sent our own pilots or whether the Finns cameover here for training.Some discussion took place as to whether, if Hurricane fighters were sent, it would be better to use Royal Air Force volunteers orFinnish pilots trained in this country. The following were theprincipal points made :  (i) It was urged that the best use would be made of thesevaluable aircraft if they were piloted by Royal Air force personnel, at least to start with. They would no doubtcause considerable havoc among the Russian bombers1,and this would raise the prestige of the Royal Air Force,which in itself would be of great value to us.(ii) The size of a unit would be very small, and it would haveto operate as part of a Finnish squadron and not as aseparate entity like the Lafayette squadron from america in the last war.[20694]b 2
(iii) Would the proposal to use Royal Air Force volunteers aspilots cause difficulty with the Swedes, who were anxious that no personnel at present serving in the Armed Forcesof the Crown should pass through their country to finland? The answer to this was that the personnel would have been temporarily released from their obli-gations to this country.(iv) It was possible that, when it became known to theGermans that we had despatched pilots from the RoyalAir Force, they would retaliate by sending reinforce-ments on a larger scale from the German Air Force tothe Russian side. This, however, was not felt to belikely. It was perhaps rather more likely that russia would declare war on us.The view generally expressed was that, since there would beno difference in time, it would be preferable to train Finnish pilotsfor the aircraft than to send volunteers from the Royal Air Force.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that before any decision was taken the financial implications should be taken into account.The Secretary of State for Air agreed, but did not think thatthe financial issue would give rise to difficulties.Continuing, the Secretary of State for Air said that, in viewof the discussion, the War Cabinet would presumably prefer thatthe 12 short-nosed Blenheims, which it had been agreed to send to Finland, should be flown over by civilians, and not by Royal AirForce personnel. The Finns had also asked for 5 mechanics asground staff for the Gladia,tors which were being sent. He alsoenquired whether the Admiralty would be prepared to release anySkuas, which could be used as dive bombers in Finland.The War Cabinet took note : (i) That the Secretary of State for Air would submit definite proposals at the next meeting of the War Cabinet inthe light of the above discussion, for the despatch to finland of 12 Hurricane fighters, including any necessary personnel.(ii) That the 12 short-nosed Blenheims should be flown overby civilian personnel; and that 5 mechanics should besent as ground staff with the Gladiators.(iii) That the First Lord of the Admiralty would enquireimmediately into the possibility of releasing some Skuaaircraft for Finland, and would report to the WarCabinet.The naval situation.(previous reference.W.M. (40) 19thConclusions,Minute 2.)Loss of H.M.S.Exmouth.4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was grievedto have to inform the War Cabinet that we had lost another FlotillaLeader on the previous day. H.M.S. Exmouth had been torpedoed,and, from the evidence available, it was thought that she had sunkwith all hands.   The circumstances were as follows : At about 5 a.m. on the previous day the Danish vessel Tekla(1,469 tons), bound from the Firth of Forth for Horsens with coal,had been torpedoed 50 minutes north-east of Tarbatness (MorayFirth), in close proximity to M.V. Cyprian Prince, which, carrying-valuable stores for the defence of Scapa, was being escorted from;Aberdeen to Kirkwall by H.M.S. E.xmouth. At 12-39 p.m.H.M.S. Exmouth was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief, Rosyth,to hunt the submarine. Subsequently, at 3-46 p.m. and 5-23 p.m,;Exmouth was told to report her position, but no reply was received.At 5-52 p.m. Cyprian Prince arrived at Kirkwall alone and reported that at 4-44 a.m, when following Exmouth, an explosion
Attacks onmerchantshipping.Attack on german U-boat.Germans taken from an inter -cepted Japanese. ship.had been heard which the Chief Officer had thought to be depth charges dropped by Exmouth. Four minutes later a secondexplosion had occurred. The Master had thereupon altered course and had then passed through some light wreckage. He had heardvoices in the water and had seen flashes, possibly from torches.When clear, he had stopped his engines, but, in view of theimportance of his cargo, had subsequently decided to go on toKirkwall. It was a dark night, with no moon and faint visibility.An Anti-submarine Striking Force, aircraft, minesweepers, twolifeboats and subsequently a destixryer had been sent to search thevicinity. One lifebuoy from Exmouth had been picked up andfloating debris had been sighted.At 7-15 p.m. on the 20th January the Norwegian vesselMiranda (1,328 tons), outward bound from Blyth, had been torpedoed in approximately the same position as the Tekla makingtwo neutral vessels and Exmouth sunk in the same area.The British ship Protesilaus (9,577 tons), in ballast, had been mined off Swansea probably by a magnetic mine on the way fromLiverpool to Barry Dock.   She was now beached.At noon on the 21st the Greek vessel Ekatontarchos Drakoulis(5,329 tons), bound from Rosario for the Tyne with a cargo of grain, had been sunk by a- submarine south-west of Oporto.At 2-30 p.m. on the 21st January the British ship Ferryhill(1,086 tons) had been mined on the way from Blyth to the Tyne andwas believed to have sunk.Steamship Notos (referred to at the previous meeting) was safeand had reported that, when 50 miles north-west of St. Kilda, she had sighted a U-boat, -which had submerged and closed to half a mile. When surfacing, with her conning-tower awash, an explosionhad occurred, apparently on board the submarine, which had raiseda column of water and black smoke to a height of 40 feet.The submarine H.M.S. Tribune, on return from patrol, had reported that on the 17th January she had fired eight torpedoes ata U-boat, which had stopped. The hydrophone effect of the U-boat&apos;scharging-engine had ceased simultaneously with the hearing of a heavy thud, but no trace had been found upon surfacing at daylightsome four hours later.  This seemed to be a fairly hopeful attack.A report from steamship Esterand at 4-30 p.m. on the20th January stated that she was continuing her voyage after&quot; salving the crew.&quot; It was thought, that this might refer to the crew of steamship Nautic, which had been reported as sinking onthe morning of the same day. The positions did not correspondvery closely, but no other vessel was known to have been in distressnorth of the Shetlands on the 20th January.Commenting on the situation, the First Lord said that a recrudescence of U-boat activity was evident. The neutrals werelosing more tonnage than we were.One of our warships had intercepted a Japanese ship off theEast coast of Japan and had successfully taken off 15 german officers and 8 German men.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.B.B.C. news bulletins.Broadcast ofshipping losses.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 15thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in recent weeks,the B.B.C., when broadcasting the News Bulletin, had adopted theplan of prefacing the news with a brief summary of the moreimportant items, in the nature of headlines. As a result, the moreimportant items were mentioned twice; first in the summary, andthen in the bulletin itself. He had been struck by the prominencewhich had been given over the week-end to the sinking ofH.M.S. Grenville, which had been given first place in the briefsummary and had th&amp;r ^een mentioned a second time in the bulletin.
In the discussion which ensued it was felt that it was difficultto criticise the B.B.G. for giving a prominent place in the news toa Naval loss, such as the sinking of II.M.S. Grenville. On the otherhand, it was generally agreed that the plan of prefacing the bulletinwith a summary which led to mentioning items twice over was opento objection, in that it led to the repetition of items of bad news.In discussion reference was also made to the habit of certainnewspapers of using posters featuring British losses and giving them an altogether undue prominence. It was suggested that thiswas a matter which might perhaps be discussed at some stage withthe Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association.The War Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to represent to the Ministerof Information the views of the War Cabinet in regard t,oprefacing daily News Bulletins by a short summary ofthe main items.The MilitarySituation.Western front and Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 19thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat there was nothing of importance to report from the western front.There had been no change on the Finnish Front, but russian air Raids continued. The Finns were reported to have counteredby bombing Kronstadt and Baltiski.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff said that Blenheims had probably been used for these raids.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.WeeklyResumes.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 14thConclusions,Minute 6.)German-soviet relations.Alleged german occupation ofdistricts insouthernPoland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 18thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The War Cabinet took note of Weekly Resume No. 20 bythe Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 22).8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 38, dated the 19th January, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires, Moscow, in which Mr. le Rougetelsummarised the latest information available regarding the allegedpresence of German troops in the Lemberg area. This telegrammight be summarised as follows : The British Military Attache had received definite information from the same neutral source as that from whichthe earlier information had been received that there were atleast 4,000 German troops in the Lemberg area. It appeared that the German Assistant Military Attache, when asked point-blank for an explanation, was much taken aback, but did notdeny the report. The German Military Attache had subse-quently sent for our Military Attache&apos;s informant, and told him that the report was based on a misunderstanding; andthat there were in fact only 400 German uniformed officials inthe area, who had been sent there to supervise the repatriation of German nationals. Mr. le Rougetel reported also that theMilitary Attache&apos;s informant was quite satisfied of the accuracy of the reports which he had received and was unconvinced by
the German Military Attache&apos;s explanation. For his part,Mr. le Rougetel remained sceptical; if German forces were ineffective occupation of Lemberg, it was, in his view, difficultto explain why the Soviet Government should have issuedpermits to various foreign officials, including two members ofthe British Embassy Staff, to visit that area at the presenttime, since theie would have been ample scope for the usualobstruction and delay. On the other hand, the work of evacuating the German-speaking Poles, most of whom wouldbe Jews, from Lemberg to Germany would hardly justifythe employment of so many as 400 German officials.Mr. le Rougetel was inclined to suspect that the Germansintended to place the Przemysl-Lemberg-Kolomea railwayunder German military control, thus ensuring the safe and effective arrival of cars from Roumania and providing also an effective means under certain eventualities for concentratingtroops on the Roumanian frontier.The Secretary of State added that the Roumanians andHungarians were likely to take different views if the informationreported above proved to be correct. The Hungarians were far more frightened of the U.S.S.R. than of Germany, and were, there-fore, not likely to be as alarmed as the Roumanians.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Finland:Soviet-FinnishConflict.Reported offer of mediation byGermany.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 15thConclusions,Minute 10.)9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 423, dated the 21st January, 1940, from FlisMajesty&apos;s Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires, Moscow, in which Mr. le Rougetelreported that he had been informed by the Estonian Minister thatthe German Ambassador had recently expressed to him the viewthat it would be useless to press the Soviet Government to make anypeace move with Finland until the Soviet Army had succeeded in.obtaining some measure of military success. He (the EstonianMinister) was convinced, however, that Germany would urge theSoviet Government to negotiate with Finland as soon as it waspossible for them to do so with the minimum loss of face.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Scandinavia.General policy.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 18thConclusions,Minute 10.)10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a state-ment on the subject of Scandinavia. Particulars of the discussionare recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.The War Cabinet agreed That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should address to the Dominion Governments a telegram setting-out for their information full particulars regarding thetreatment by Germany of Scandinavian shipping, not only when trading to this country, but also when engaged in trade with other parts of the world.
Netherlands.Allegedviolation of neutrality byBritish aircraft.(previous reference:W.M. (39) 34thConclusions,Minute 9.)11. The Prime Minister enquired whether there was anyfoundation for the report which had appeared in the Press, after our air reconnaissance over Northern Germany some two dayspreviously, according to which the German Government had addressed a strong pi^otest to the Netherlands Government againstthe action, as they alleged, of British aircraft in flying overNetherland territory on their way to Germany. According to thisreport, the Netherland Government were alleged to have replied toGermany that Netherland anti-aircraft batteries had fired on theaircraft in question, and that, as these seemed to be British, they(the Netherland Government) proposed to make enquiries in London.According to the same report, British leaflets were alleged to havebeen dropped by the aircraft in question near the German-Netherland frontier.The Secretary of State for A ir said that he had no informationas to any of our aircraft having been fired upon in the manneralleged, but he would call for a further report.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, so far ashe was aware, no enquiries on the subject had been received fromthe Netherland Minister in London, but. he would look into thematter.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussionRichmond Terrace, S.W.1,January 22, 1940.
