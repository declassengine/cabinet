The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Attacks on BastCoast shipping.Beeonn aissancesof heligoland bight.Leaflet raids.1. The Chief of the Air Staff said that 12 enemy aircraft had left the German coast on the previous day. Of these, only three orfour had pressed home their attacks on the East Coast convoy. Theremainder had turned back without accomplishing anything.Of those which had carried out the attack, two had been inter-cepted and shot down--one near the Bass Rock, and one 12 miles east of Coquet Island.In reply to the Foreign Secretary, he said that there had beena number of previous instances of German aircraft apparentlysetting out to carry out attacks, but turning back half-way for noapparent cause.Two reconnaissances had been carried out of the heligoland bight with the object of locating enemy warships. One had succeeded in reconnoitring Heligoland, and had established the factthat there were no enemy warships in the anchorages. The otherhad been shot down, probably by German fighters.Another successful flight over Berlin had been carried out during the night. The aircraft had dropped four flares over thecity, and bad plainly observed the buildings from 11,000 feet.About 40 searchlights had been exposed, but had appeared to bemore interested in illuminating the flare than in trying to pick upthe bomber. Only one shell had burst near the aircraft, and nofighters had been observed.He thought it probable that the enemy had not opened fire over berlin so as not to cause undue alarm on account of a single aircraft.Two aircraft had also reconnoitred Cuxhaven, Kiel andHanover and had dropped leaflets.There were no other operations to report.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Attacks on shipping.Penalties forneglect ofCourseInstructions.2. The First Lord informed the War Cabinet of certain fleetmovements.He said that, in the course of the air attack on the East Coastconvoy off St. Abb&apos;s Head, which had been referred to by the Chiefof the Air Staff, the British steamer Sandhill (586 tons) had been bombed, but not hit, and the British ship British Governor (tanker,6,840 tons) had been holed by a near miss, but was still seaworthy.The Italian ship Mira (3,615 tons), which was near the convoy,had also been bombed, but not hit.The Finnish ship Orion (2,400 tons) had been torpedoed 30 miles east of the Orkneys. A tug had been sent out to try and salve theship. Sixteen survivors had been picked up, and a hunt was inprogress for the submarine.The French collier, P.L.M. No. 25 (5,400 tons), had been mined and sunk 5 miles north-west of Cromer Knoll. The ship had runaground when in the South-bound convoy. She had been towed of)&apos;by H.M.S. Flamingo, but had passed over a mine before regainingthe swept channel.H.M.S. Jackal had been in collision with the Swedish steamerStorfors (545 tons) off the Northumberland coast. The Jackal was now in the Tyne, and steps were being taken to bring in theStorfors.   There were no casualties.The S.S. Ulster Queen (3,700 tons) had gone aground on thenorth-east point of the Isle of Man. The passengers had been takenoff and tugs had been sent.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence enquired whether&apos;action was taken against the Captains of merchantmen whodisregarded their course instructions.The First Sea Lord said that action was taken, though perhapsof not sufficiently drastic a kind.   The Captain whose ship had[20922] b 2
run into our minefield at Singapore had had his certificate taken away from him.The coming of longer days and better weather should reduce our losses from marine risks, which at present were very heavy.Report of A message had been received from the Naval Attache, Oslo,British prisoners that the Norwegian Admiral at Bergen suspected the presence of on German British prisoners on board two German merchant vessels which hadmerchant left Vigo, and were now in Norwegian waters.   He had ordered avessels in search, and posted torpedo boats to prevent their sailing untilNorwegian        it had been carried out.waters. The Admiralty had no evidence to support the report thatthere were any British on these ships. It was interesting to note,however, that the Admiral in question was the one who had ordereda search of the Altmark, for which he had been reprimanded byhis Government.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Western Front.Finland.3. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat there was nothing of importance to report from the western front.In Finland, the Russian attacks in the Western half of theKarelian Isthmus had continued, and a fresh attack had takenplace in the Taipale Sector. The Finns claimed to have held these attacks, but the position on the Western flank was confused and appeared dangerous. The fact that the Russians had been ableto maintain their offensive in spite of the Finnish withdrawal tothe second line of the Mannerheim system was ominous. If theycould break through this line during the next two weeks, theywould be able to make contact with the remaining Finnish defencesbefore these were completed. Elsewhere in Finland nothing ofimportance had occurred. There had been fighting at Hoyenjarvi,and the Finns were reported to have withdrawn to Nautsi.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Assistance to finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 53rdConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theFinnish Minister had been to see him that morning about an urgentenquiry which he (the Finnish Minister) had received from theFinnish Government.A record of the ensuing discussion, and of the conclusions reached, is recorded in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of War cabinet conclusions.Finnish-Soviet 5.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadConflict. that morning seen the Finnish Minister, who did not believe theAttitude of rumours current that Germany was anxious to mediate in theFinland towards conflict between his country and the Soviet Union. He regardedGerman Soviet willingness  to  offer  any  terms  as  a  favourable  sign,mediation. M. Gripenberg had said that there was no question of Finland(Previous giving UP the struggle.   It was thoroughly realised in Finland that reference: Finnish capitulation would be followed by terrible hardships, massW.M (40) 20th deportations, and worse. According to his (M.

(Previous The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added that he had reference: given M. Gripenberg particulars of what had passed recentlyW.M.

(40) 18thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 46, Saving, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Rome,reporting that Signor Sacerdoti had informed Mr. Rodd that he hadlearnt that the Germans were building submarines at a rate whichwould enable them to deliver between eight and ten monthly. Theprogramme had been begun in September last, and Signor Sacerdotianticipated that the real danger to British shipping would beginabout the end of April, when the first of these submarines would come into service. He supposed that the Germans now had aboutthirty-five submarines fit to take the sea, of which between fifteenand twenty were probably in dock.The First Sea Lord said that the figures given above coincidedfairly closely with the estimates made in the Admiralty.The Prime Minister said that this report seemed on the face of it not improbable. He also mentioned a report that the Germansproposed to give the Soviet Union a German battleship in returnfor a certain number of Soviet submarines.The First Sea Lord, said that so far no confirmation had beenobtained of the numerous reports that the Germans had obtainedsubmarines from the Soviet Union in the Baltic and in the Far East.It was unlikely that the Germans would offer a capital ship to theSoviet Union, since they were known to be anxious not in any wayto upset the naval balance of power in the Baltic.The War Cabinet took note of the above discussion.Germany.possible intentions.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 22ndConclusions,Minute 7.)Turkey.Relations withthe U.S.S.R.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 51stConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto telegram No. 40,&apos; dated the 27th February, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Minister, Copenhagen, in which Mr. Howard Smithtransmitted various reports as to Germany&apos;s possible intentions.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign A -/fairs drew attentionto telegram No. 173 (R), dated the 26th February, 1940, from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Ankara, in which Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen reported categorically that reports emanating fromBelgrade regarding Turco-Soviet clashes in the Caucasus werewithout any foundation whatever. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessenhad added that, if the recently enacted Law for the Protection of theState was interpreted as an indication of abnormal developmentswithin Turkey, that interpretation was equally fallacious.
Poland.Draft Agree-ment in regardto Polish Forcesserving with british units.(previous reference:Conclusions,W.M. (39) 94thMinute 9.)9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (W.P. (G.) (40) 56) to which was annexed adraft Anglo-Polish Agreement for the organisation and administra-tion of Polish Forces serving with British Units.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs described the originand purpose of the draft Agreement and said that it had beenapproved by all the Ministers concerned. A Naval Agreement hadalready been signed. The present draft dealt almost entirely withthe Polish Air Units which it was proposed to incorporate as partof the Royal Air Force. As regards the Polish Army, the BritishGovernment would be concerned only to facilitate the recruitment and transport of Poles to France to join the forces being formedthere.The draft had been communicated to the Polish and french governments. It would be reviewed in the light of their repliesand would then be brought again before the War Cabinet. he understood that the Polish Government were critical of some partsof the proposed agreement.The War Cabinet :-(a) Approved as a basis of discussion with the French and polish Governments the draft Anglo-Polish agreement for the organisation and administration of Polish Forcesserving with British Units in the form annexed toW.P. (G.)
