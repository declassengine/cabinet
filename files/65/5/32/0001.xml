The Air 1.   The Secretary of State for Air informed the &quot;War cabinet situation. that bad weather conditions, including very poor visibility, had(Previous again impeded air operations on the previous day.Reference: Enemy  activity  had  been  much  below normal,  only  oneW.M. (40) 30th reconnaissance aircraft having been reported during the morning,Conclusions, about 7 miles East of Yarmouth. This aircraft had been inter-Minute l.)        cepted, but had dived into cloud before it could be engaged.Thirty-four Fighter patrols had been despatched, involving-93 aircraft. The tasks undertaken had included patrols over the fishing fleet, escort for cross-channel traffic and routine patrols onthe East Coast.No operations had been undertaken by our Bomber aircraft during the previous day.The usual reconnaissances and patrols of Coastal Command hadbeen completed with only a few exceptions where the weather hadintervened.An enemy submarine had been sighted on the surface in the afternoon in a position 112 miles off the Orkneys by a Hudson. Thesubmarine had been attacked, but had escaped.An Anson of 269 Squadron from Wick had found a raft, forwhich it had been sent in search, 30 miles North-East of Lossie-mouth, and had directed two armed trawlers to the rescue of the seven men who were on it.The Secretary of State described certain measures which theAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, was taking to deal with the detection of enemy air attacks on East Coastshipping.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 30thConclusions,Minute 2.)Attacks onmerchantshipping.Attacks onU-boats.Tankers inconvoys.2. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet of certain operations which were being undertaken by theHome Fleet, in co-operation with the Royal Air Force.At 5 p.m. on the 2nd February the tanker British Councillor(7,048 tons), bound from the Tyne for Abadan in ballast, had been mined or torpedoed when in convoy 20 miles off Withernsea (SpurnHead, Yorkshire). Forty-three survivors had been taken off byH.M.S. Whitley.  Two men had remained on board.An unknown ship had been sunk by mine or torpedo 2 miles south of Auskerry (East of Kirkwall).H.M.S. Wren had carried out one and H.M.S. Viscount twO:attacks on a contact 40 miles South-West of Land&apos;s End. Largequantities of oil had appeared, followed by subdued underwaterexplosions. The Viscount had subsequently carried out a thirdattack, and oil had continued to come to the surface.The Commander-in-chief, Western Approaches, had reportedthat H.M.S. Veteran had carried out further attacks on her U-boatcontact 140 miles South-West of Land&apos;s End (reported to the War-Cabinet on the previous day), and that he considered that both this and that carried out by Viscount were probably on U-boats, and, if so, that they were certainly destroyed.Other attacks on submarine contacts had been carried out by destroyers off Scarborough and by anti-submarine trawlers 1 mileSouth of the Owers.The Minister without Portfolio suggested that, of the tankerswhich, had been sunk, rather a high proportion would seem to havebeen at the tail of the convoy, and he suggested that it might be wise, in future, to place these ships elsewhere in the convoys.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that the admiralty should look into this matter.[20782]b 2
Thetw inquiry. The Prime Minister mentioned that he had glanced throughthe report of the inquiry on the sinking of H.M.S. Thetis. Theevidence had been very thoroughly examined and sifted, but the finding of the Tribunal as to the cause was inconclusive. Hesuggested that the report should be made public after it had been examined by the Admiralty.Welcome of The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested, and it was agreed,H.M.S. Exeter,   that the Admiralty should make arrangements for a welcome by thepublic of H.M.S. Exeter on her impending return to this country.The War Cabinet took note of the above statements.The MilitarySituation.Western Front.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 29thConclusions,Minute 3.)Finland.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Chief of the imperial General Staff said that therewas nothing to report from the Western front. The thaw wasextending, and conditions were extremely bad in consequence. Theroads were temporarily unusable.In Finland, the Russians had made a heavy attack at Summa,at the Western end of the Mannerheim Line. This appeared tohave been one of the heaviest attacks since the beginning of the war,and had been supported by armoured sleighs. It had not, however,been successful.Air raids were still continuing.The War Cabinet took note of the above statement.Scandinavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 31stConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet certain informa-tion received from the Military Attache in Stockholm regardingpossible developments in Scandinavia. An account of this informa-tion, and of further discussion on this question, is given in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.The Far East:Relations with japan.The case of theS.S. AsamaMaru.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 30thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theagreement with the Japanese Government for trie settlement of theAsama Maru case was, in substance, most satisfactory, and, indeed,considerably better than either he or the Admiralty had originallyhoped for. Sir Robert Craigie had secured the agreement of theJapanese Government for the return of nine Germans only (seeTokyo telegram No. 228, dated the 3rd February, 1940). As regardsthe future, the Japanese were clearly anxious to prevent any furtherincident, and were issuing orders to Japanese shipping companiesnot to accept as a passenger any German national of military age or any known German agent without reference to Tokyo; the british embassy would then be given an opportunity privately to state whatnames we considered fell within our prohibited categories; and theJapanese shipping companies would then be instructed to refusepassages to these individuals (see Tokyo telegram No. 211, datedthe 1st February, 1940).Late the previous evening a substantial point of difficulty had arisen concerning the method for the publication of the agreement reached with the Japanese Government. This had been disclosed in telegram No. 211, referred to above, which had been considerablydelayed in transmission. The relevant passage in that telegrammight be summarised as follows : As regards publicity, Vice-Minister for Foreign affairs stated that, as a result of further consultations, the JapaneseGovernment felt that it would be better not to attempt any
definition of men who would be refused passage on the Japaneseships. They suggested that for the present any official statement should be along the following lines : &quot; As regards the future, diplomatic negotiations arestill proceeding and, in the meantime, it is consideredunlikely that any further difficulties will arise of the kind which led to the Asama Marti case.&quot;Sir Robert Craigie appreciated that, from our point ofview, this presentation made it look as if we had handed back the men affected with no quid pro quo. But the life of theJapanese Government would be at stake during the budgetdebates which were to begin the following Tuesday, and he hoped it would be possible to stretch a point in order to meetthe Japanese on this point of publicity. The important point was that in fact no further Germans in our categories would leave Pacific ports and, whatever precautions might be takenin regard to publicity, this fact would eventually emerge.He (the Secretary of State) had thereupon addressed to Sir robert craigie a telegram (No. 92) in which he had said that he wouldnot agree to one half of the plan being announced without theother half. Shortly after the despatch of this telegram he hadreceived Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s telegram No. 228, dated the3rd February, 1940, which contained the following further reporton the attitude of the Japanese Government as to the form of theannouncement to be made : As regards future arrangements the Minister for ForeignAffairs is most insistent that anything implying the conclusionof the actual agreement should be rigorously avoided, at least for the present. He therefore proposes, after referring to thedecision to release nine men, to proceed as follows : &quot; as regardsthe future, negotiations are thus far proceeding, and pendingthese negotiations I do not consider the public need feel anyuneasiness as to the repetition of such an incident.&quot;He hopes that you may see your wa)&apos;- to confining yourselfto a similar announcement, but, if preferred, there would be noobjection from the Japanese point of view to your adding orsubstituting something to the following effect: &quot;While each side maintains its view of the legal position, it is notanticipated that any further misunderstanding will occur onthis subject.&quot;He (the Secretary of State) felt that our proper course would beto adopt the second of the suggestions quoted above, namely, not to add, but to substitute for the previously suggested sentence, a sentence on the lines indicated by Sir Robert Craigie. He would propose, however, to secure, if possible, the agreement of theJapanese Government to the substitution of some stronger word in place of the word &quot; misunderstanding &quot; in that sentence. Theannouncement, when finally stated, would be issued as a jointcommunique by Sir Robert Craigie and M. Arita, the JapaneseMinister for Foreign Affairs.In the course of a short discussion, the words &quot; disagreement,&quot;&quot; incident &quot; or &quot; difficulties &quot; were suggested as possible substitutesfor the word &apos;&apos; misunderstanding.&apos;&apos;The Prime Minister said that it would be most satisfactory ifit were possible to reach a settlement on the lines indicated b)^ theSecretary of State.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldtelegraph to Sir Robert Craigie authorising him to clinch theagreement with the Japanese Government on these lines; he would
also give him final instructions as to which of the documentsexchanged between the Japanese Government and ourselves were tobe published; publication would take place on Monday, the5th February. As regards the handing back of the nine Germans,Sir Robert Craigie had secured the agreement of the JapaneseGovernment to a satisfactory formula, the text of which was givenin his telegram No. 212 (R), dated the 2nd February, 1940.The War Cabinet agreed That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Tokyo,authorising him at once to conclude an agreement with theJapanese Government on the lines indicated at &quot;A&quot;&apos;above.Richmond Terrace, S.W.1,February 3, 1940.
