Scandinavia.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 9thConclusions,Minute 6.)Finland. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Report by the MinisterMethods of for Co-ordination of Defence, on behalf of the Military Co-ordina-giving tion   Committee,   on   the   methods,   short   of   direct   military assistance. intervention, by which assistance could be given to Finland (W.P.(Previous&apos; (40) 14).References: The first question raised in this Report was whether materialW.M. (40) 3rd assistance to Finland should be limited to the despatch of equipment,Conclusions, or whether it should be extended to include the despatch of minute 6, and volunteers. The view was generally expressed that it would haveW.M. (40) 5th a good moral effect if volunteers were able to go to Finland, evenConclusions,       in small groups.Minute 4.) Secretary of State for War said that he was preparedto agree that it might be useful to send small bodies of experts,but that he would be reluctant to see a campaign organised forrecruiting volunteers on a considerable scale. Brigadier Ling was now on his way back from Finland, and on his return would beable to give General Mannerheim&apos;s views as to Finland&apos;s needs inthe matter of volunteers.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that no steps should be taken to start recruiting volunteers in this country until we had satisfied ourselves that Norway and Sweden would conniveat their passage through those countries.The other main point dealt with in the Report was whether,if volunteers to Finland were permitted, the Bureau which wouldhave to be set up should be official or unofficial. The two alternativeswere set out in paragraphs 7-9 of the Report.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that Sir GeorgeMacdonogh, with whom he had discussed the matter, was anxious that the Bureau to be established for according assistance to finland should have an official status and should be situated inthe War Cabinet Offices. He doubted whether Sir GeorgeMacdonogh would be willing to act as the head of an entirelyunofficial organisation. If an unofficial Bureau was set up, it wouldbe necessary to arrange that the Bureau should keep in touch with official sources of information, as described in the Report.The view generally expressed was that the Bureau should beof an unofficial character, while being given official assistancesub rosa. .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he was sure that the Swedes and the Finns themselves would prefer thatthe Bureau should be set up on an unofficial basis.The War Cabinet (i) Reached the provisional conclusion that it was desirablethat a token force of volunteers should be sent to finland; but deferred a final decision pending (a) receipt of Brigadier Ling&apos;s report;(b) receipt of a report from the Foreign Secretary asto- the attitude of Norway and Sweden to thepassage of volunteers through their territories.[20633] b 21.   The War Cabinet had before them the following papers : (a) A Memorandum prepared in the War Office (W.P. (40) 13).(6) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff (W.P. (40) 15).A record of the discussion and of the conclusions reached bythe War Cabinet are contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard file of War Cabinet Conclusions.
(ii) Agreed that, pending a final decision under (i),&apos;no steps should be taken to set up an organisation for the despatchof volunteers to Finland,(ai) Agreed that any such organisation should have an unofficialstatus, but that, in addition, there should be an OfficialSection dealing with Finnish matters in the Office ofthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence; and that the unofficial Bureau should be given official help and information clandestinely.(iv) Invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence andSir Horace Wilson to explain to Sir George Macdonoghthe reasons for this decision, and to ask nim to act ashead of the proposed unofficial Bureau as soon as itwas set up.The air situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40.) 9thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Secretary of State for Air reported that the usualpatrols and escorts had been carried out by the Fighter command and that standing patrols had been maintained on the East Coast.There had been 11 separate visits of enemy aircraft to the vicinity of the East Coast between Aberdeen and Kent, four aircraft in allhaving crossed the coast near the Tyne, Humber, Thames Estuaryand Kent. Our anti-aircraft defence had come into action in the tyne. Humber, and Thames Estuary, but, with one exception, nointerceptions had taken place, largely on account of the haze andof the fact that only single enemy aircraft were concerned.An enemy bomber which had attacked shipping off the Norfolkcoast had been engaged by a standing patrol of three Spitfires andsmoke had been seen to issue from its port engine and wing beforethe combat terminated some 50 miles out to sea.Bomber Command had carried out their normal offensive patrolsover the German mine-laying seaplane bases. The flare path atRantum had been attacked by heavy bombs, after which the lightshad been promptly put out and activity seemed to cease. A nightreconnaissance had taken place over the Ruhr, during which leafletshad been dropped at dusseldorf and Frankfort. Other aircraft had dropped leaflets over Hamburg and Bremen, and aircraft fromthe Air Component had carried out a successful photographic reconnaissance over the Ruhr and Rhine valleys as far as Emmerich.Two Hudson aircraft had sighted three enemy destroyers some40-50 miles N.W. off Horns Reef and had carried out a high levelbombing attack, but no hits were obtained.A Hudson on patrol in the central part of the North Sea had failed to return.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.The naval situation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 9thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The First Lord of the Admiralty reported that the Britishsubmarine Seahorse&apos; was now three days overdue. A German broad-cast had claimed that a British submarine had been sunk and this must be accepted as a possibility in view of the dangerous area inwhich this vessel had been operating. Another submarine, theUndine, had failed to report her position On the previous eveningor to reply to a signal in the morning.Apart from the consequences of air attacks, the following werethe merchant shipping losses of the previous day: The British tanker also (7,267 tons) had been sunk by a mine or torpedo off Liverpool.The Italian liner Traviata (5,123 tons) had been sunk bya mine off Cromer.
The MilitarySituation.(previous reference:W.M. (40) 9thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Secretary of State for War said that there was verylittle news from Finland, but that a reliable secret report showed that three battalions of the Russian division operating north of lake Ladoga had fled precipitately when attacked by the Finns.This, coupled with the fact that a large portion of another division hand put up their hands recently near Suomussalmi, threw an interesting light on Russian morale. It appeared probable that in both areas it was a reserve division that had first suffered defeat,but a regular division that had failed so abysmally in moraleafterwards.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,January 12, 1940.The British trawler Lucida (251 tons) had been sunk by a-mine 20 miles east of the Tyne.The British ship Qranta (2,719 tons, in ballast) had been mined and sunk off Cromer. This ship had not been in theswept channel.Air attacks on merchant shipping had shown greaterintensity The British steamer Keynes (1,706 tons) had been bombednorth-east of Cromer; and the British steamer Pitwines(932 tons) had been bombed 18 miles south of FlamboroughHead.   Both these ships had been set on fire and abandoned.Two toawlers had been attacked, east of Buchan Nesswithout suffering casualties and others had been bombed inthe mouth of the Tay; no particulars of any damage wereavailable.Enemy aircraft had dropped a parachute mine east of theGoodwins and a mine with a balloon attached had dropped in thesame area. The balloon had been recovered, but the mine had been no longer attached.It was evident that an attack was being pressed with consider-able vigour against our shipping.The War Cabinet took note of this statement.
