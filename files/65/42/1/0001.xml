The Chiefs of Staff reported the principal events of theprevious week.Owing to bad weather Bomber Command had been limited toan attack on Nuremberg, on which 2,500 tons had been dropped.Bomber casualties for March, in spite of heavy losses in theNuremberg attack, amounted to 4-5 per cent, as compared to5-4 per cent, for the two preceding months. During March theR.A.F. had dropped in all 27,000 tons of bombs, of which 19,000 hadbeen dropped on Germany. The corresponding figures for theUnited States Air Force were 18,000 and 13,000 tons. UnitedStates bombers had attacked airfields in France. Coastal Commandhad made one promising attack on a U-boat. Enemy losses for theweek amounted to 111 aircraft destroyed and 22 probably destroyed.In addition, the United States Air Force claimed to have destroyed100 on the ground. Allied losses were 128 bombers, 32 fighters and7 Coastal Command aircraft.Communications, ports and battle targets, also Sofia, had beenattacked. Sixty-seven enemy aircraft had been destroyed ascompared to 48 Allied.In the Pacific 154 enemy aircraft were claimed as destroyed(half this number, being on the ground) as compared to 11 Allied.Confirmed shipping losses by enemy action during Marchamounted to 123,238 tons. April losses to date amounted to5,222 tons. During March 14 U-boats had been destroyed and5 probably destroyed. One U-boat had been destroyed so far thismonth.Although complete details had not yet been received, it wasknown that naval aircraft from carriers had successfully attackedthe Tirpitz in Alten Fjord. Several hits had been obtained, andthree aircraft only had been lost.To the extreme north of the Russian Front at Narva theGermans claimed to have surrounded several Russian divisions.There had been German reports of Russian attacks at Pskov andVitebsk. Further south the Russians had cut the Kovel-Brest-Litovsk Railway. The Germans in Tarnopol were practicallysurrounded. The Russian thrust to the Carpathians had reachedand passed the River Pruth. Between the Pruth and the Dniesterthe Russians were attacking in a southerly direction in anendeavour to cut off the Germans in the Odessa salient. TheGermans had already lost Ribnitsa and the railway thence to Jassy.b 21. The War Cabinet were informed that Lord Noel-Buxtonhad put down a Motion for debate in the House of.Lords on thefollowing day in the following terms : &quot; To ask His Majesty&apos;s Government whether, in view ofthe importance attached throughout the world to the AtlanticCharter, and in view of the statement made by the PrimeMinister, that there will be no question of the Atlantic Charterapplying to Germany as a matter of right and barring terri-torial transferences or adjustments in enemy countries, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will make clearer the bearing of theCharter on the future of Germany; and to move for Papers.&quot;After discussion, the War Cabinet agreed that the Leader ofthe House of Lords should deal with the matter on the followinglines : He should say that, while the Government recognised that astatement on this matter would have to be made at some time in thefuture, a debate on this issue at the present time would be pre-mature. It was clear that, before any authoritative pronouncementcould be made, there would have to be consultations with theDominions Prime Ministers and with the principal Allied Powers.His Majesty&apos;s Government were satisfied that it would not be in thepublic interest for this matter to be debated at this juncture. If,nevertheless, a debate ensued, His Majesty&apos;s Government would nottake part in it.
Burma. The Japanese forces that had cut the road between Tuitum andImphal had been dealt with. To the north, other Japanese forcesthat had cut the road between Imphal and Kohima had been drivenback. Japanese forces in this area had been drawn off in order todeal with our penetration groups further to the east. These forceswere operating partly on the railway line in the neighbourhood ofKatha and partly on the northern Irrawaddy.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.BombingPolicy.Targets inOccupiedTerritory.(PreviousReference:W.M.

(43) 134thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The War Cabinet had a discussion on the policy of bombingtargets in Occupied Territory, a record of which is contained in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File of War Cabinet Conclusions.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that Mr. Berle had arrived to-day for the proposeddiscussions on civil aviation. Mr. Stettinius was expected on themorning of Good Friday.A brief discussion took place on the latest developments in theItalian situation. A record is contained in the Secretary&apos;s StandardFile of War Cabinet Conclusions.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thatM. Paasikivi had now returned from Moscow to Finland with anexplanation of the Russian terms.The War Cabinet-Took note of these statements.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded theWar Cabinet that some months ago he had received a request fromSir Walter Citrine that one or twp representatives of the TradesUnion Congress should be granted facilities to visit Italy. Thisrequest had not at the time been agreed to. Since then the UnitedStates labour representatives had visited Italy, and on the wholehe was disposed to accede to the T.U.C. request, which had beenrenewed.The War Cabinet-Endorsed this view.Blockade.Relief forOccupiedEurope.(PreviousReference:W.M.(43)63rdConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Economic Warfare (W.P. (44) 177) reporting that theAmerican Embassy had been instructed to seek our concurrence ina proposal to inform the Swedish Government immediately thatthe British and United States Governments were disposed to permitlimited shipments of special relief food-stuffs to Belgium, France,the Netherlands and Norway if the Swedish Government wouldundertake to distribute the food-stuffs and could get the GermanGovernment to accept certain control stipulations.The Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfaresuggested that the objections, whether from the psychological or themilitary point of view, to action on the lines proposed were inpresent circumstances decisive. It was probable that the Americanproposals were mainly promoted by considerations of internalpolitics, and that the supply and other considerations involved hadnot been thoroughly examined.
IndustrialUnrest.General.Apprentices&apos;Strike.Miners&apos; Strike., (PreviousReferences:W.M.(44)32ndConclusions,andW.M.(44)33rdConclusions,Minute. 1.)7. The Minister of Labour and National Service said that theindustrial situation gave some ground for uneasiness. It was truethat, apart from the miners, the number of workers involved intrade disputes in March was only 30,000, which in all the circum-stances was not a&apos; very high figure. Nevertheless, a number ofelements were working to create unrest, and he regarded thesituation with considerable anxiety.It was clear that the apprentices&apos; strike on Tyneside, the Clydeand in Yorkshire was a political one and had been instigated by agroup which had broken away from the Communist Party whenRussia became our ally.The trades unions were doing what they could to get thestrikers to return. A deputation from the strikers had sought aninterview with him, but he had refused to see it. Notices callingup the strikers for medical examination were being issued and theDirector of Public Prosecutions was considering whether the ring-leaders could be prosecuted under the Trade Disputes and TradeUnions Act, 1927. The existing emergency powers did not enablehim to take effective action, and he intended to put before the LordPresidents Committee proposals for extending these powers.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the action taken by the Minister of Labour andNational Service.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, of the 130,000miners in the Yorkshire coalfield, 40,000 were now back at work andthat he hoped that the drift back would continue. There had beena serious loss of production and it had been found necessary to cutindustrial supplies of electricity by 10&quot;per cent, and of gas by25 per cent. These cuts affected the whole country and had comeinto force that day. If the strike had cleared up by the end of thisweek the effect on war production would not be serious, but if itdragged on longer a very awkward situation would arise.- The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Aircraft Produc-tion, suggested that firms engaged on war production would acceptthe cuts on electricity and gas supplies more readily if some actionwere taken to reduce domestic consumption, either by rationing orby an appeal to householders.The Minister of Production pointed out that, apart from thecuts in gas and electricity, the strike had led to a shortage of hardcoal, with the result that a number of plants engaged an warproduction had had to close down. He endorsed the view of theMinister of Fuel and Power that if the strike had not cleared upby Easter the position would be very serious. With regard to thesuggestion that domestic consumption should be reduced, he pointedout that severe cuts had already been imposed on domestic con-sumers, and suggested that it would be unwise to take further actionat the present moment.The Prime Minister said that the Minister of Labour andNational Service and the Minister of Fuel and Power would, ofcour-se, continue to do everything in their power to restore theposition by Easter.   If, despite their efforts, the strike continuedAfter discussion, the War Cabinet Agreed that the objections, set out in the MinistersMemorandum, to the United States proposals were decisive,particularly in view of impending military operations, andinvited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of Economic Warfare, theSecretary of State for War and the First Lord of theAdmiralty, to settle the terms of a reply to this effect,emphasising the objections on military grounds.
beyond that time a situation of the utmost gravity would havearisen, and in that event it would be necessary to have recourse toexceptional measures to deal with it.The War Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the action of the Minister of Production and theMinister of Fuel and Power in imposing cuts onindustrial supplies of gas and electricity.(2) Agreed that for the present no action should be taken toreduce domestic consumption of fuel.(3) Agreed that, if the situation had not cleared up by Easter,a very grave situation would have arisen, which wouldcall for the use of exceptional measures; and invited theMinister of Labour and National Service and theMinister of Fuel and Power to consider what measureswould have to be taken in that event.8. The Prime Minister said that Mr. Nash was leaving thiscountry on the following day, and the present would be the last timeon which he would attend a meeting of the War Cabinet on hispresent visit. He was sure his colleagues would wish him to sayhow glad they had been to have had Mr. Nash among them at thisjuncture, and how grateful they were to him for his counsel.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1944.
