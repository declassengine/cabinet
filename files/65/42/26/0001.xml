Field-MarshalSmuts.ProposedStatement byPresidentRoosevelt.2. A discussion took place on President Roosevelt&apos;s proposalthat he might make a statement to the German people, to be issuedafter the opening of the battle in Europe. A record of thediscussion is contained in the Secretary&apos;s Standard File of WarCabinet Conclusions.the Army forthe Guards.Man-power. 3.   The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that theProposed War Office had recently proposed that certain Guards Units,Transfer of Men including a Tank Brigade, should be cannibalised so as to providefrom the E.A.F. reinforcements for other Guards Units. He had opposed thisRegiment to suggestion, which was contrary to the practice followed by theGermans and Russians, who, far from reducing their Guardsformations, created additional ones out of Infantry divisions, thusreaping the advantage from the prestige attaching to the title.He thought it better to comb the rest of the Army for the Guards.But the Army was very short of men suitable for Guards andInfantry, and it behoved us to take all possible steps to secureadditional men of the right stamp from other branches or arms ofthe Services. He had accordingly looked to the R.A.F. Regiment toprovide a large quota, having regard to the fact that conditionswere quite different now from what they were at the time of itsformation. He had proposed to the Secretary of State for Air andthe Secretary of State for War five weeks previously that theyshould consult together with a view to transferring 25,000 men fromthe R.A.F. Regiment to the Army, but no consultations had beenheld and he had received a number of communications from theSecretary of State for Air pointing out the disadvantages of thecourse proposed. He did not intend to go into the merits ofthe case, but to appoint a Committee to examine it and makeconcrete proposals.The Secretary of State for Air said that he was prepared toco-operate and only wished he had been consulted earlier, becausethe demand for the transfer of these men was based on a number ofmisapprehensions. There were to-day only 38,000 men in the R.A.F.Regiment in this country, and all were discharging military tasksassigned to them by the Chiefs of Staff. In his last minute he had-requested the Prime Minister to agree to the problem beingdiscussed between the General and Air Staffs on the basis of anexamination into both the-Army and R.A.F. Light Anti-Aircraftcommitments, and he felt sure that a reasonable scheme could bedrawn up in this way. Fie had offered to call for volunteers fromthe whole of the unskilled men of the R.A.F. as well as from theR.A.F. Regiment. Fie had also pointed out that his anxiety andthat of the Air Staff about drastic reductions in the R.A.F.Regiment derived solely from their desire to exert the maximumair impact upon the enemy during &quot;Overlord&quot; and subsequentoffensive operations.In further discussion it was pointed out (a) That the highest ceiling ever authorised for the R.A.F.Regiment was 93,000, but this had never been reached and therehad been four successive cuts made in its strength.(b) That the Adjutant-General had specified a height standardof 5 feet 9 inches for the men to be transferred. The PrimeMinister said that it certainly ought to be possible to relax this,in order to get men of the right stamp.. (c) The Army had already made a considerable comb-out of itsown units.  It was estimated that it took from three to four monthsto train as an Infantryman a man who had received basic trainingas against six months for a recruit.  It was calculated that the Army* See W.P. (44) 265.[27595] B 21. The Prime Minister wished Field-Marshal Smuts ManyHappy Returns of his birthday on behalf of the War Cabinet.
would fall short of its requirements in the second half of 1944 by:some 90,000 men. This would mean that 5 Divisions&apos; would have tobe broken up in various theatres.(d) A heavy cut had already been made in anti-aircraft andsearchlights and the strength of such units would again beoverhauled in the light of developments this summer.The Minister of Labour and National Service said that he wasnow engaged on a preliminary survey of man-power. It was quiteclear that, with the heavy casualties which the Army would incur(the estimate of which he considered to be perhaps on the low side),it would become more and more necessary to regard the fightingServices together, and to pool their resources of man-power.Otherwise, it would be very difficult to meet the legitimaterequirements of the Army. Medical. re-examination of all thedeferred men was being undertaken, but it was clearly of little usegiving the forces Grade II men, as by so doing one would simplyrob industry without providing efficient fighting men.The Prime Minister enquired whether an appeal for volunteersfrom the R.A.F. would be likely to be successful.The Chief of the Air Staff said that there were about 112,000non-skilled men in the R.A.F. at home. He thought that theremight be a number of these who would volunteer for transfer toa more active role, and it would certainly be advisable to make useof as many volunteers as possible, as they would be more likely tomake efficient soldiers.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that he had asked for25,000 men from the R.A.F. Regiment when he thought that itsstrength was greater than he now. knew it to be. He would becontent if 10,000 could be found for transfer. It would be necessaryfor the whole question to be examined, and it would be open to theSecretary of State for Air to bring forward his proposal aboutreductions in the anti-aircraft gun and searchlight units ofthe Army. But the R.A.F. must make its contribution to enablethe Army to sustain, the great battles&apos; which were impending.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Presi-dent of the Council, bringing into consultation if necessarythe Minister of Labour and National Service, as a matter ofurgency to examine, and make recommendations on, theproposal that as many men as possible should be taken fromthe R.A.F.  Regiment and other similar  sources andtransferred to the .Army for service in the Guards.(2) Agreed that for purposes of the above examination, thefollowing information should be furnished forthwith  (a) A statement by the Secretary of State for War,setting out the basis of the requirement, and thesteps already taken by the War Office to combmen from other branches of the Service in orderto find men for the Guards and Infantry.(6) A statement by the Secretary of State for Airshowing the composition, location and employ-ment of the whole of the R.A.F.  Regiment,including training establishments, depots, &amp;c.(3) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Air, withoutprejudice to the above examination, should forthwithcall for volunteers, both from the R.A.F. Regiment, andfrom the R.A.F. clS  1 whole, other than from men inskilled trades.
SelectCommittee onNationalExpenditure.Beport on TankProduction.(PreviousEef erence:W.M.(44)lst   -Conclusions,Minute 7.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(W.P. (44) 262) containing-(a) A Eeport dated the 9th March, 1944, from the SelectCommittee on National Expenditure on TankProduction.(b) A Memorandum by the Minister of Production, setting outthe observations of himself and the other Ministersconcerned on this report.(c) A letter from Sir John Wardlaw Milne, M.P., to the PrimeMinister asking for early consideration of the report.(d) The interim reply which the Prime Minister proposed tosend to Sir John Wardlaw Milne.Discussion in the War Cabinet was confined to considerationof (d).It was generally felt that at this stage, and until furtherconsideration had been given to the Select Committee&apos;s report, itwould be premature to hold out the prospect of a public debate onthis matter. The War Cabinet &quot;accordingly agreed that the latterhalf of the interim reply should be amended to read as follows : &apos;&apos; Later in the session I should hope that it would bepossible to give your Committee the reply to which they areentitled Meanwhile, I can assure you that the conclusionsand criticisms contained in your Report have received mostcareful consideration by the Departments concerned, and incertain cases action has already been taken on the lines whichyour Committee have recommended.&quot;Army 5.   The War Cabinet again had before them a MemorandumBenevolent by the Secretary of State for War (W.P. (44) 116), proposing theFund, formation of an Army Benevolent Fund to facilitate the provision(Previous of administration of charitable assistance for the soldier and hisEef erence: dependants. When this matter had come before them on theW.M.(44)26th 28th February, the War Cabinet had deferred consideration of theConclusions, scheme until after the forthcoming Debate in the House of CommonsMinute 10.)     on Army Pay and Allowances.After a short discussion, the War Cabinet approved the schemein principle, but left the date of the public -announcement of thescheme to the discretion of the Secretary of State for War.War Pensions.(PreviousEef erence:W.M.(44)23rdConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs referred tothe debate which had taken place earlier in the day in the House of-Lords on the following motion by Lord Cork and Orrery :  &quot; To ask His Majesty&apos;s Government when the statementpromised to this House on the 14th March last, upon the subjectof the allowances granted for the children of Officers who havelost their lives on Service, may be expected; and to move forPapers.&quot;It had looked as though the Government would be ^defeated,and the debate had, therefore, been adjourned. He felt that, beforethe debate was resumed, the War Cabinet ought to consider whatreply should be given to the arguments put forward by thesupporters of the motion, and he proposed to circulate aMemorandum on the matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the factthat in the discussion which the Lord President of the Council, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and he had had on the
subject of war pensions with Members of the House of Commonson the previous day no mention had been made of the point raisedin the motion.&apos; The War Cabinet-Took note that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairswould submit a memorandum as to the reply which shouldbe given to Lord Cork and Orrery&apos;s motion.Town andCountryPlanning.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)38th&apos;Conclusions,Minute 2.)7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Town and Country Planning (W.P. (44) 261) coveringa draft Town and Country Planning Bill.The Minister of Town and Country Planning, explained thatthe Bill conferred on local authorities power to acquire land fordealing with extensive war damage and for other planning purposesby a simpler and more rapid process; provided for assistance fromthe Exchequer to local authorities in respect of the acquisitionand clearing of land to deal with war damage; made certainimprovements in planning control, and dealt with the question ofthe price at which land should be acquired for public purposes.Its provisions had been very thoroughly considered by theReconstruction Committee and had been discussed with theAssociations of Local Authorities. The Associations were notaltogether satisfied with the Bill and, in particular, objected to thesubstitution of a. 1939 standard for a 1939 ceiling in the provisionsrelating to the price of land acquired for public purposes. If,however, the Government stood firm it was unlikely that LocalAuthorities would carry their criticisms very far. To implementpromises given in The King&apos;s Speech the Bill ought to be passedthis Session, and he hoped that the War Cabinet would authorisehim to introduce it before the Whitsun Recess. A number ofdetailed points arising from the consideration of the Bill by theLegislation Committee still had to be cleared up, but if authoritywere given for the introduction of the Bill these points could bedisposed at a further meeting of the Committee before the Billwas published.The folloAving points arose in discussion  (a) The view was expressed that it would be undesirable topublish the Bill until the Government were ready to publish theWhite Paper on Compensation and Betterment. Agreement had notyet been reached among Ministers on the problems dealt with inthe White Paper, and there was no guarantee that its terms wouldhave been agreed in time to allow of its being published with theBill if the Bill was introduced before Whitsun.(b) The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security saidthat, while he appreciated the arguments in favour of introducingthe Bill at once, he feared that by doing so before it was clear thatthe extremely complicated problems with which it dealt weresatisfactorily resolved, the Government might create for itself anembarrassing situation in Parliament.(c) The Minister of Health said that the acquisition of landand the preparation of plans for housing inevitably took aconsiderable time.. The Government had announced its proposalsfor the erection of emergency houses, and local authorities Wereexpecting to proceed with large housing programmes of their ownas soon as the war ended. He feared that when the Housing Bill,which he had been authorised to introduce, came before Parliamentthe Government would be severely criticised for not giving localauthorities the special powers which they would require, in &quot;thematter of land acquisition, to meet the exceptional situation whichthey would have to face after the war..
Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,24th May, 1944.(d) It was pointed out that the Uthwatt Committee hadrecommended March 1939 value as a ceiling fdr the price to bepaid for land acquired for public purposes. The Bill, however,provided for the adoption of March 1939 value as the standardin. all cases of compulsory acquisition. The result was that localauthorities would probably have to pay the March 1939 value in allcases, whereas at present they could sometimes buy at a lower figure.There was likely to be considerable criticism of this in the Houseof Commons.(e) It was suggested that the normal procedure laid down inthe Bill for the acquisition of land was not sufficiently expeditiousto enable local authorities to proceed with the redevelopment oftheir war-damaged and obsolescent areas at a reasonable pace.The general feeling of the War Cabinet was that, despite thecriticism to which the Government were being subjected for delayin introducing the Bill, it would be better to defer its introductionfor a short time. This would allow of further consideration beinggiven to the controversial provisions of the Bill, with a view toeffecting improvements which would make it more acceptable toParliament. This should also enable further progress to be madein the preparation of the draft White Paper on Compensation andBetterment.The War Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Town and Country Planning tobring before them in a fortnights time the question ofthe introduction of the Town and Country PlanningBill.(2) Agreed that in the interval (i) an effort should be made toadjust the terms of the White Paper on Compensationand Betterment, and (ii) the provisions of the draft Billshould be further considered.
