Oil.Discussionswith theUnited StatesGovernmentatWashington.(PreviousReference:W.M. (44) 45thConclusions,Minute 1.11. The War Cabinet had before them (1)The Eeport of the Ministerial Oil Committee(W.P. (44) 269).(2) A Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (W.P. (44) 281).(3) A Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty which washanded round at the meeting, dealing with the possibleeffects on our belligerent rights of an undertaking tomake petroleum available in international trade to thenationals of all peace-loving countries in adequatevolume.The Minister of War Transport said that the Eeport of theMinisterial Oil Committee (W.P. (44) 269) was based on closeexamination by all Departments concerned of the Washingtondiscussions. When the United Kingdom delegation had been sentto Washington, tension with the United States over oil questionshad been great. But with the despatch of the delegation there hadbeen a marked improvement in the situation, and the discussionshad proceeded in a friendly atmosphere.There had been no suggestion in their course of any encroach-ment on our rights or on our concessions. The position had beeneased by the fact that, whereas the United States had at an earlierstage expressed uneasiness as to the adequacy of reserves, thedelegation had arrived at a time when there was reassuringinformation available as to reserves, and when the United Stateshad reached the conclusion that there was ample oil in the worldto meet all requirements for a very long period.The delegation had not failed to bring out the differencebetween our position and that of the United States. While theUnited States had a very substantial production in their owncountry which was in fact absorbed by their domestic demands, wehad little or no home production, but a large production in theMiddle East. Our representatives had claimed as a first right thatwe must be able to meet our needs in peace or war from our ownproduction. It had been difficult to find words to meet that position,but in the outcome agreement had been reached on the basis set outin these two papers.It should not be overlooked that the United States were at agreat advantage as compared with the British Empire in the matterof oil, and that in consequence there was much advantage in theacceptance of the principle of an equal position for all oil develop-ment which had been achieved under the agreement, a result whichavoided the risk of a serious oil war for concessions, and the creationof a position of strain and competition, the political effects of whichmight well be embarrassing. The arrangement proposed had, forthat reason, much to commend it. It also ensured the orderlydevelopment of oil resources which was very desirable from the pointof view both of the United States and of the British Empire. Itwould, in addition, help to stabilise world prices.The composition of the Petroleum Commission proposed underthe Memorandum of Understanding now before the War Cabinetwould be half British and half American. The. Commission wouldhave no executive control, and could not go beyond makingrecommendations to the two Governments concerned, with whomthe decision would rest. Failing agreement, no effect wouldbe given to those recommendations. The Commission would haveno responsibility for fixing prices, but would shape the course forproduction to meet demands, and its operations should result in theavoidance of wide margins in oil prices. The only difference in theposition of the United Kingdom and the United States in respectof the Commission&apos;s operations was that the United States domesticproduction, which was consumed within the United States, wouldfall outside its purview, and that it would be solely concerned withexport production. No fixed period would be set for theMemorandum, but it would be subject to six months&apos; denunciationby either side.[27614-2] B 2
The Lord Privy Seal said that he had- set out in his papeibefore the War Cabinet (W.P. (44.) 281) the objections which hesaw to the agreement now under discussion. He quite recognisedthat the arrangements embodied in that agreement would be ofassistance to the oil companies and would in that way benefit worldprices. The difficulty he felt was that the British Empire derivedno advantage from it. Tt was, in his judgment, a cartel, and oneunworkable by us because its terms secured all benefits andadvantages to the United States.In the first place, the United. States was primarily a producerinterest and was left free to deal with its own domestic production,We, on the other hand, were essentially a consumer interest.   Thedifficulty of reconciling our consumer and the American producer %interest was obvious.Secondly, our strong position was in the Middle East, but theprices of Middle East oil were the lowest throughout the world.The result was that the United States would enter the agreementas a high price country; the high-cost producer always had theadvantage under a cartel.Thirdly, at the present time the United States had already aone-third share in the British Empire market. Under the agree-ment and in particular the terms of Article III they would retainthat.Fourthly, our negotiators in Washington had been unsuccessfulin securing American acceptance of joint support from the UnitedStates for concessions held by British nationals.They had been equally unsuccessful in securing acceptance bythe United States of reciprocal obligations for the supply of oilin the event of war, though both of these were points which theMinister of War Transport had accepted as being of the firstimportance before the delegation left this country. As regardsforeign exchange, he accepted that the phrase &quot;relevant economicfactors &quot; in (3) of the Preamble (Appendix A to W.P. (44) 269) ofthe draft Memorandum of Understanding was designed to protectthat position. But the agreement, as it stood, might well preventthe sale of oil at a depreciated sterling price. The agreement was,in his j udgment, of a quite extraordinary character since the UnitedStates received under it complete protection for its own oil market,while the British oil market was left without any correspondingadvantage and that at a time when, as was now admitted, therewas no oil shortage or reason to anticipate one in the United States.The agreement as it stood was really for the protection of theUnited States market and its production. Next in order of advan-tage stood the South American market. On the other hand ourMiddle East development in which we were so vitally interestedwas segregated and our production in the Middle East limited underArticle III of the Agreement. All these considerations assumedeven greater importance since, whatever the preliminary characterof the agreement, if entered into it must, in his judgment, becomean obligatory agreement in time. While the United States wasputting forward the agreement on the basis of an internationalundertaking, in fact it was in practice designed to safeguard theUnited States position to the detriment of our own.The Lord Privy Seal continued that he was in favour of an oilunderstanding with the United States, but that it must not operateto our disadvantage. He thought that our negotiators shouldreturn to Washington and should ask for six things-(1) an undertaking that world resources should be brought intothe agreement;(2) that British consumption should be excluded;(3.) that we should be free to impose a tariff on imports of oil soas to preserve the position of oil production within theEmpire;(4) that there should be a mutual understanding as to themaking of oil available in time of war; , -
61W.M. 70 (m).1ArgumentsagainstAcceptance.(5) that the United States should undertake to grant its supportto our concessions; and(6) that the issue of tankers should be satisfactorily settled.A general discussion followed in the course of which thefollowing arguments were advanced against the acceptance of theMemorandum of Understanding in its present form : -(a) The Memorandum of Understanding was one-sided andconferred no advantage on His Majesty&apos;s Government. Under itEmpire production would be regulated by international agreement,while United States internal production was wholly protected, andthe South American oil interests were compensated for keeping-out of the United States domestic market by being confirmed intheir existing one-third share of the European market.(b) It was inequitable that we should be required to throwopen our Empire resources to general competition, while the UnitedStates secured complete protection for their domestic production.There would be no justification for accepting the reservation bythe United States of a special area which would fall outsidethese arrangements. Was it not dangerous formally to concedethe principle of non-discrimination in respect of oil developmentin British territory&apos;? Were we not entitled to claim in respect ofoil produced in our own territories that we should be better offthan, and not merely on an equality with, other countries ?(c) The Memorandum as it stood risked limiting our right ofblockade in time of war and our power to bring pressure to bearin the interest of economic warfare on countries which might wishto supply oil to our enemies. It was suggested that a phrase shouldbe embodied in the draft Memorandum to the effect that 11 Nothingin this declaration shall apply in the event of war in which eitherhigh contracting party is involved.&quot;(d) Anxiety was expressed about the possible effect on ourbelligerent rights of any undertaking such as that in Article I (1)of Appendix A or Article 2 (1) of Appendix B to W.P. (44) 269&quot; that petroleum shall be available in international trade to thenationals of all peace-loving countries in adequate volume, at fairprices and on an equitable and non-discriminatory basis.&quot; Oilwas a vital war material. He suggested that a.formula should befound which would fully safeguard our position in time of war andthat in Article 2 (1) of Appendix B of W.P. (44) 269 after theword &quot; that,&quot; the words might be inserted &quot; when the contractingGovernments are themselves at peace but subject,&quot; &amp;c.(e) The arrangements embodied in the Memorandum in effectrepresented a degree of discrimination in favour of the UnitedStates which it was impossible to reconcile with the United Statesattitude in the Article VII conversations. We should secure thesame rights for United Kingdom consumption in relation to oilresources under our control as the United States enjoyed underthe terms of the draft Memorandum over oil resources under theircontrol.(/) The arrangements proposed should only apply to Britishproduction to the extent that there was a surplus available forexport outside the Empire.(g) In the matter of oil we were admittedly in a relatively weakposition compared with the United States. That was not the caseas regards certain other commodities such as tin and rubber. Anarrangement such as that now contemplated in respect of oil mightform a very awkward precedent if we wished later to&apos; protect ourposition in respect of commodities in which we were more happilysituated. We should consider whether any arrangement in regardto oil should not be further examined, in the light of agreements ofa more general character, before final agreement was reached inregard to this matter.(h) The arrangements embodied in the Memorandum were opento the suggestion that they had in view the avoidance of difficultyin the United States over anti-Trust legislation. There might wellbe much to be said for straightforward cartelisation in certain raw[27614-2]b 3
Arguments infavour ofAcceptance.materials which would contribute to the stabilisation of worldprices. But that should be on the basis of an agreement precisely-worded, and under which responsibility rested with the Governmentsconcerned. The present arrangement did not sufficiently protectthe consumer interest in countries which had or controlled no oil.(j) Many friendly members of the United Nations wereconcerned in this question. Might not the conclusion of an agree-ment between the United States and ourselves be regarded as theassumption of a rather dictatorial position in regard to theproduction and the price of petrol, an attitude which might makea very unfortunate impression on our friends ?(k) Further consideration should be given to the criticisms ofthe agreement in its present form which had. been received fromthe Australian Government (Tel. No. 121 of the 30th May).(I) We should insist on a mutual guarantee of concessions, andon an understanding that oil should be available to both countriesfor military purposes in time of war.(m) While it was true that the proposed Petroleum Commissioncould, only recommend action, and while the decision would rest withthe Governments concerned, we might find it very embarrassing torefuse to implement a recommendation formally made by the Corn-mission merely because it did not suit us.(n) We were dealing with a vital asset of the British Empireand could not be too careful in our handling of it. It was essentialnot to allow ourselves to be rushed into arrangements which wemight subsequently have cause to repent of.It was urged on the other hand in support of the agreement :--(a) While admittedly it represented in the first instance anunderstanding between the United Kingdom and the United States,the object of that understanding was to eliminate the numerousurgent oil matters which were primarily of concern to thosecountries, and to pave the way to a multilateral agreement at a laterstage. The terms of the understanding when published would makeit clear to the world that a multilateral agreement was our objectiveand that the understanding itself was purely of a preliminarycharacter.(b) Its conclusion would avoid a revival of the undesirablestate of tension over oil which had existed between the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom before the recent negotiations inWashington.(c) It would also reduce the danger of an oil war betweenUnited States and United Kingdom interests and would contributeto keeping the oil market steady and to the avoidance of violentfluctuations in price, which were undesirable from the consumers&apos;point of view.(d) Failing an arrangement such as that now in view, theUnited States, given its very strong position in regard to oil,would beyond question become the dominant figure in world oilquestions. Under the arrangement as it stood, we secured aposition of equality, despite our smaller oil resources, with theUnited States.(e) As regards the suggestion that we should not give theUnited States the open door in British territories, .the UnitedStates already under our existing policy had the benefit of the opendoor save in India, where, as had been made clear in the recentnegotiations, that was not the case. Our position was in no wayworsened by the conclusion of this agreement.(/) As regards the protection granted by the agreement toUnited States internal production, United States internal produc-tion was for practical purposes absorbed by United States internalconsumption. There was nothing to prevent any British oil interestfrom endeavouring to produce and market oil in the UnitedStates, though any oil so produced or marketed would fall outsidethe terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, since it wouldbe an item of United States internal production and governed byinternal United States regulation.
63W.M. 70 (H).(cf) There was much to be said for an understanding in respectof a wasting world asset which would ensure the orderly regulationof the production and marketing of that asset, and so, apart fromreducing the risk of political difficulties over oil questions betweenthe United States and the United Kingdom, would unquestionablybe in the general interest of the world sis el whole.(h) The - contrast between the provisions of the agreementand the policy of Article VII was not so sharp as had beensuggested. By proceeding as we were under the agreement by wayof a preliminary agreement to a. multilateral agreement, we were,in fact, meeting one of the criticisms that had been advancedagainst the procedure that had been adopted in the case ofArticle VII.(j) &quot;While the arrangements in view might be regarded as in thenature of a cartel, and restrictionist, they would in fact be subjectto governmental control, since it was intended to have a majority ofgovernmental representatives both on the United Kingdom and theUnited States side, of the proposed Petroleum Commission; and noaction could be- taken without governmental approval.At the conclusion of the discussion the Prime Minister saidthat he was clear that the general sense of the War Cabinet favouredcontinuing negotiations with the United States Government with aview to reaching an agreement on oil questions. It was clear,however, that it was also generally felt that the draft agreement setout in the Appendices to W.P. (44) 269 would need further examina-tion in the light of the points that had been raised by the Lord PrivySeal and in the course of the discussion. He thought it mostimportant that we should not allow ourselves to be rushed in thismatter. He fully accepted the force of the arguments for a friendlyunderstanding with the United States, and he recognised that wemight be at a disadvantage in negotiation with a great and friendlyPower, to which we had substantial obligations, in time of war. Butwe must make sure that in reaching an understanding we did notprejudice our own interests, even if that involved rather more delaythan might be altogether welcome to the United States GovernmentrWe must ensure that justice was done to our legitimate claims to agreater extent than appeared to be the case under the proposedarrangement. In particular, the question of the open door asregards oil in British territories called for careful consideration. Itwas vital that we should be able to exploit our own oilfields to thefull, and to meet our oil requirements from our own Empire. Thatwas also true of the question whether it would not be better to linkthe regulation of oil with that of matters such as tin and rubber,in which we were better placed.He would like to consider further whether the discussions withthe United States Government when resumed should be undertakenby the same delegation as had carried out. the recent talks or on theMinisterial level;He suggested that he should now appoint a small Committee,after consultation with certain of his colleagues, further to examinethe points raised in the discussion and the agreement as a whole, andto consider also on what level further discussions with the United&apos;States Government should be conducted, with instructions to makean early report to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows : (1) Agreement in principle was recorded in favour of con-tinuing negotiations with the United States Government,with a view to reaching an agreement on oil questions.(2) The draft agreement set out in the Appendices toW.P. (44) 269 called for further examination in the lightof the points raised in discussion.(3) It would also be for consideration whether the furtherdiscussions should be undertaken by the same delegation. as had carried out the recent talks, or whether theyshould be conducted on the Ministerial level.
(4) The Prime Minister undertook, after consultation withsome of his colleagues, to select the personnel of aCommittee which should (a) carry out the further examination referred to in (2),and(&amp;) consider on what level the further discussions shouldbe conducted.Shipping. 2.   The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theInternational Lord President of the Council (W.P. (44) 273) reporting that certain    f)Control proposals about the international control of shipping after theafter the liberation of Europe had been put forward by the Minister of WarLiberation Transport to the Armistice and Post-War Committee.   This Com-of Em-ope. mittee recommended these proposals for the approval of the War(Previous Cabinet on the understanding that their acceptance would commitReference:     &apos; us only in regard to our control of our shipping in relation to otherW.M.(43)9lst nations, and would be without prejudice to the decisions to beConclusions, reached in due course on our domestic post-war shipping policy.Mmute 3.)  or^ President of the Council said that the scheme raisedtwo main points.The first was the precise form of control to be exercised by eachGovernment over its own ships. The United States Governmentwished to bind all the Governments subscribing to the plan to themaintenance of full requisition. The Minister of War Transportconsidered that this should be accepted.The second point was the time limit to the international control.The United States Government favoured a minimum period ofcontrol up-to 6 months after the end of the Japanese war. TheMinister of War Transport proposed that this 6 months&apos; periodshould be the maximum in the interests of securing the participationof the minor Allies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that theacceptance of the arrangements proposed by the Minister of WarTransport would be without prejudice to our power to make otherarrangements, if necessary, at a later date.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals set out in W.P. (44) 273.3. At their meeting on the 6th January the War Cabinet hadset up a Committee to consider the constitutional policy to befollowed in Malaya and in the British territories in Borneo on theirliberation, and to recommend directives on which the authoritiesresponsible for planning the civil administration of these terri-tories after liberation could work.The War Cabinet now had before them a Report from thisCommittee (W.P. (44) 258) and agreed that the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should be authorised:  (1) To issue the directives at Appendices I and II ofW.P. (44) 258 on policy in Malaya and Borneo, to thoseresponsible for planning civil administration in theseterritories after liberation.(2) To open confidential discussions with the Court of Directorsof the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company witha view to coming to an understanding (without anyfinancial commitment at this stage) as to the conditionson which the administration of North Borneo would betransferred from the Company&apos;s responsibility andcontrol to that of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(3) To open confidential discussions with the Raj ah of Sarawakwith a view to the preparation of a new Agreement onthe lines proposed in paragraph 3 (c) of Appendix II.Far East.ConstitutionalPolicy inMalaya andBorneo.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)
Production. 4.   The Minister- of Aircraft Production informed the WarPublication Cabinet that the United States Office of War Information hadof Figures of released for publication in this country on the following morningAircraft a statement about aircraft production.   This statement gave theProduction. combined yearly output of the United States and the BritishEmpire since 1940, and then proceeded to give figures of theUnited States output. The British production could be deducedby subtracting one set of figures from the other. The Wirfr Cabinethad hitherto always set its face against publication of these figures.The fact that the first publication of figures of our aircraft produc-tion had taken place in a United States statement had, of course,been badly received by the Press.Moreover, although the figures given were not inaccurate, theywere presented in a way which gave a somewhat misleadingimpression, and showed our output in an unfavourable light ascompared with that of the United States. This impression couldnot, however, be corrected unless we gave details which it hadhitherto been contrary to our accepted policy to make public.The War Cabinefs conclusions were as follows(1) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was invited tomake a protest to the United States authorities inregard to this unauthorised disclosure. The Ministerof Aircraft Production was asked to send to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs the necessarymaterial for this communication. -(2) The Minister of Aircraft Production was authorised toprepare, in consultation with the Secretary of State forAir, a statement for publication with a view tocorrecting the misleading impression which the articlereleased by the United States Office of War Informationwould create about our aircraft production. Thegeneral view of the War Cabinet was that, in view ofthe extent to which the production of the UnitedNations now exceeded that of the enemy, some relaxationof the previous restrictions against publication ofproduction statistics could now be envisaged.(3) Should a Parliamentary Question be asked about this. disclosure, the reply should take the form of dissociatingourselves from the comparison between the UnitedStates and United Kingdom productive effort impliedin this statement.France.(PreviousReference:&quot; 5.
