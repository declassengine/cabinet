The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet of theand Air latest developments in Italy, Burma and the Far East.Operations.Italy, Burmaand Far East. , ((Previous , . .Reference: __.---W.M.(44)64thConclusions,Minute 1.)2.   The War Cabinet had before them : (a) A Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare(W.P. (44) 242) on Economic Policy towards Turkey.(b) A Memorandtim by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (W.P. (4.4) 244), recommending that in the imme-diate future our policy towards Turkey should be asfollows :-(i) We should begin slightly to modify our attitude ofaloofness to take into account the new co-operativespirit of the Turks, but not abandon it.(ii) The ban on arms supplies should remain and nodefinite response should be made to Turkish hintsfor resumption of military conversations unlessand until the military authorities so desired,(iii) We should continue our economic warfare campaignaimed at the disruption of Turco-Germansupplies, details of the next stages of which weregiven in the Memorandum by the Minister ofEconomic Warfare.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs commended theproposals in his Memorandum to the War Cabinet. There seemedadvantage from all points of view in continuing a stern economicpolicy towards Turkey though, in view of their recent decision tocut off supplies of chrome to the Axis, the policy of extreme aloof-ness which we were at present working need not be pursued tothe same extent as hitherto.The President of the Board of Trade said that if it wasdesired, on grounds of policy, to send some supplies to Turkey, nodifficulty would arise under certain heads, e.g., raw wool and somechemicals, but that he would be opposed to making available suppliesof further cotton piece-goods or hides.The Prime Minister thought that, while a slight easing of ourattitude would be justified, we should be at pains to make it clearto the Turks that we were still far from satisfied with their atti-tude, and that their change of policy over chrome by no means wentas far as we would wish. We should bring it home to them thatthey had missed their market- but if, in fact, as the campaignprogressed, they showed signs of wishing to join the Allies, therewould unquestionably be distinct advantage to us in their doing so.In his handling of the situation, our Ambassador should have thisin mind and direct his course accordingly.The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Minister of Economic Warfareas set out in W.P. (44) 244 and W.P. (44) 242, subjectto the points made in the discussion by the Prime Ministerand the President of the Board of Trade.Policy towardsTurkey.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)[27528-2]
Greece.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)56thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs told the WarCabinet that he had recently put it to the Russians that if theywished us to allow them to take the lead in Roumania, they shouldbe prepared to reciprocate by allowing His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto do likewise in Greece. He had joist heard officially from theRussian Ambassador that the Russians had agreed thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should play the hand in Greece. Theyhad asked, however, whether the United States- would mind this,to which he had replied that he was sure that no difficulty wouldarise over that.The War Cabinet-Took note with satisfaction of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.NaualConstructionProgramme.(PreviousReference:W.M.(43)171stConclusions,Minute 1.)Redesign th4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty on the new Construction Programme1944 (W.P. (44) 245).  The 1944 Programme was as follows :-4 &apos;&apos; Lion &apos;&apos; class battleships and proceed with theproduction of 6 Triple 16-inch Turrets of revised design.5 6-inch Cruisers.22 Fleet Destroyers.20 Submarines.5 Sloops (including 3 authorised in previous programmes).32 Small type M.T.Bs.Miscellaneous small craft.In addition the programme included provision for such numbersof landing ships and craft as would, broadly speaking, absorbcapacity for a further 12 months. But the position would bereviewed and a more specific submission would be made to the WarCabinet as soon as the outlook was reasonably clear.Authority was asked to -place orders in the Dominions for afurther 36 L.S.Ts. No final decision had been taken about theconstruction of further L.S.Ts. in this country when those alreadyauthorised had been completed.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the 1944Programme estimated the cost at  93 millions as compared witha total of  203 millions for the 1943 Programme. The followingwere the main features of his programme.Battleships. -He attached considerable importance to approval being givento revising completely the design of the Lion, Temeraire, Conquerorand Thunderer, and to proceeding with the construction of the6 16-inch turrets for the first two. named of these ships so that theycould be laid down in the 1945 Programme.Cruisers.Excluding very old ships, we had now only some 40 cruisers.He proposed, that 5 should be laid down this year. Their armamentwould be 12 6-inch guns, 12 4-5 A.A. guns on power-mountings.They would have very long endurance, and would be completelyequipped with the latest types of Radar.If very heavy casualties were sustained in &quot;Overlord,&quot; hemight ask for further cruisers to be laid down this year. We hadalready lost 29 cruisers during the war.Destroyers.We had lost 139 in the war and now had 90 fleet destroyersand 155 escort destroyers. About 100 were building or on order.He asked for 22 as compared with 43 last year.
Submarines.We had lost 81 in the war. We now had 132 operationalsubmarines, and 34 in training, while 85 were building or on order.He proposed to include 20 &quot;A&quot; Class submarines in theProgramme.Other Types.No additions were proposed to the existing programmes ofescort vessels. He asked for approval to order 5 sloops, of which 3could be reinstated from programmes approved in 1941 and 1942.He attached great importance to placing an order of 36 L.S.Ts. tobe built in the Dominions, and also to the programme of landingcraft. During the last three years, we had turned out an averageof 2 landing craft a day and one small seagoing craft a day. Thelabour employed in building these small craft was in the aggregatevery considerable.The Minister of Production said that it would be a great helpif steps could be taken to accelerate the completion of the 45 L.S.Ts.now under construction in this country.Having regard to the acute shortage of man-power, he thoughtthat there would have to be a substantial cut in the Admiraltyallocation of industrial man-power about the middle of 1945, andhe suggested that the rate of production of the long-term projectsincluded in the programme should not be settled until the forth-coming man-power review had been completed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his main concernwas with the long-term projects, particularly capital ships. Hehoped that no decision need be taken now as to the balanced fleetwhich the post-war navy would require. He did not, however,object to work being started on the gun turrets for the Lion andTemeraire, or to the redesign of 4 battleships. Apart from this,it seemed to him that the limiting factors on the programme werefactors other than financial.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that throughout the warthe Admiralty had not been allowed to carry out any long-termprojects. The time had now come when we must think of ourrequirements for the Far East war, and also for the sort of fleetwhich we would have if we were to exercise due influence in thetransitional period.The Secretary of State for Air said that as it was clear thatthe man-power shortage would continue after the end of the warwith Germany, he thought that strong justification would benecessary before man-power was expended on projects which wouldnot mature until, say, 1950. He also suggested that if long-termprojects were under consideration, the position of all three Servicesshould be looked at.The Minister of Labour and National Service attachedimportance to maintaining in this country a labour force forshipbuilding in which a due balance was kept between naval ship-buiiding and merchant shipbuilding. He hoped, therefore, that theMinister of War Transport would be asked to state the commercialfleet which this country would require for essential trade purposesafter the war.The Prime Minister said that it could almost be said that theNavy had won the naval war in the West. It was, of course,necessary to maintain the escort flotillas for the anti-U-boat war.We must also look ahead to the war against Japan, which woulddemand a prodigious feat in transportation on the part of the Navy,and would call for a substantial Fleet Train.Battleships.The Prime Minister recalled the various stages of the battle-ship controversy over the last 30 years or more.   In his view, thesovereignty of the battleship was still maintained.   The submarine8-2] b 3
was not regarded as a real risk to a battleship with an appropriateescort. No doubt the battleship was exposed to great risks if withinthe range of shore-based air forces. But in the big open spaces, ifattended by an aircraft carrier, the battleship still held its sway.With the exception of the King George V class, which werearmed with 14-inch guns, all our battleships were now very old.No work had been done on the 4 battleships, which it had beenproposed to lay down just before the war. The only battleship onwhich we were still working was the Vanguard, and he hoped thatthat Admiralty would do their best to complete this ship in timefor the autumn of 1945. He hoped that the Admiralty would goin for complete redesign of the 4 battleships now in question, so asto incorporate all the latest improvements.(The First Sea Lord confirmed that this was the case.)Looking at the long-term position, it was clear that after thewar we should be very badly off in battleships as compared withthe United States. At the same time, he did not think that thiswas a position which need alarm us very much, and it might provethat the United States had put too much of their resources intobattleship construction. Further, he thought the United Statesmight find man-power difficulties in maintaining the very large fleetwhich they had built up. It was also worth remembering that atthe present time we could build up a line of battle which should becapable of beating the Japanese Fleet.Some discussion ensued as to the future of battleships afterthe war. The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that wehad lost only two battleships in this war by air attack, and in thosecases they had not had the protection of aircraft carriers.The Paymaster-General said that he wished his view to berecorded that after the war air power would gain the mastery overbattleships.  The Lord Privy Seal concurred in this view-&apos;The Prime Minister said that he saw no reason to lose faithin the battleship at the present time, but of course the positionwould have to be reviewed in the light of experience.Cruisers.The Prime Minister said he felt a little doubtful about theAdmiralty programme of cruisers. Aircraft carriers now carriedout a good deal of the work of scouting previously carried out bycruisers. He also questioned the advisability of armament notexceeding 6-inch guns.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the cruisersproposed would be ships of about 14,000 tons, would have12 6-inch guns, and be capable of a very rapid rate of fire.The First Sea Lord said that the strength of these ships wouldlie in the hitting power of 12 guns, capable of rapid fire. This, hethought, would be very effective. A 6-inch cruiser would not beoutranged by an 8-inch cruiser since a cruiser would not hope toengage another cruiser at a range over 20,000 yards. The UnitedStates were building some 6-inch-gun cruisers and some 8-inch-guncruisers.   The latter were very big ships.The Prime Minister said that he still thought that there wassomething to be said for building a smaller number of rather largercruisers.Fleet Destroyers.The Prime Minister referred to the tendency to include moreand more improvements in these ships, with the result that they gotlarger and larger and virtually became little cruisers. What wasmore serious was that this increase in size meant that destroyersceased to be hunters and joined the class of the hunted. Hethought that a great effort should be made to reduce the size ofthese vessels.
United 5.   The&apos; War Cabinet &quot;had before them a note by the LordKingdom       -President of the Council (L.P. (44) 91) proposing a reduction inH*      Import the United Kingdom import programme to meet &quot; Overlord &quot;Programme.     shipping requirements.(Previous The note explained that in order to provide the essentialReference:    &apos; maintenance requirements of the forces put ashore in &apos;.&apos; Overlord,&quot;W.M.(44)64th it would be necessary to make some reduction, either in. the UnitedConclusions,     Kingdom import programme or in the &quot; Bolero &quot; import programme.Minute 2.)      For operational reasons no reduction could be made in &quot; Bolero &quot;shipments and it appeared, therefore, that the only way of meetingthe &quot; Overlord &quot; requirements was to impose a cut of some 180.000tons a month on the United Kingdom import programme over aperiod of two months or more.The First Lord of the A dmiralty said that the- destroyersproposed would be vessels of 2,700 tons. They would have 6 guns.The great weight was mainly due to the propulsion machinery andto the necessary endurance. He did not think it would be possibleto build lighter ships for this purpose until means had been foundof providing a far lighter type of propulsion. This was beingintensively studiedThe First Sea Lord said that he cordially agreed with theimportance of reducing the size of destroyers. But in the circum-stances of the Japanese war he saw no prospect of reducing thesize of the destroyers it was proposed to include in the 1944programme.Landing Ships and Craft.The Prime Minister of Australia said that he thought thatthe Government of Australia would find great difficulty in buildingany more L.S.Ts.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that originally it hadbeen proposed to place orders for 42 of these ships in theDominions, including 6 to be built in Australia. As a result ofcommunication with the Australian Government, we understood theAustralian difficulties and were not asking them to build any ofthese ships this year.The Prime Minister said that the United States Governmenthad at one time reached the programme of 55 of these ships amonth, and that they then proposed to drop the programme to 40a month. We strongly urged them not to make.this reduction.They had replied that it had only been possible to maintain thehigher figure for a short time as a result of great efforts. We had,however, made it clear to them that, if they reduced the programme,the result might well be a limitation on the contribution that wecould make to the war in the Far East in 1945.The Minister of Production said that the Americans had nowreinstated 95 L.S.Ts. to the programme as from the end of the year.Although these additional ships had not been assigned to us, therewas a strong presumption, in view of previous negotiations, that weshould, get a considerable number of them.The War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows :&apos;- (1) The New Construction Programme, 1944, proposed by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty was approved.(2) The completion of the L.S.Ts. under construction in thiscountry should be accorded the highest priority.(3) Note was taken of the Minister of Production^ suggestionthat, in . view of the man-power situation, no firmdecisions should be taken as to the rate at which workshould proceed on the long-term items in the programmeuntil the forthcoming man-power review had beencompleted.
The Prime Minister said that there was no doubt that the&apos;&apos;, Overlord &apos;&apos; requirements must be met and the only question waswhether this country could stand a further cut in the importprogramme. It was important that the United States Governmentshould realise the extent of the sacrifices that we were making, andit might be desirable that he should send a message on the matterto the President.The Minister of War Transport said that it had been contem-plated that throughout 1944 we should import at the average rateof 2 million tons a month and that he had indicated to the UnitedStates Government that our target for the year was 25 milliontons. He was confident that we should receive 12 million tons^ inthe first half-year and had good hope that a further 12 milliontons would be imported in the second half-year. Having regardto the expected sailings with cargoes for discharge in this country,and to certain arrangements to ease the strain on berth facilitiesat the ports and on inland transport (e.g., by bringing in largequantities of wheat and iron ore) he hoped that the actual reductionwould be less than *180,000 tons a month for the two months inquestion. In his view the issue was hardly of sufficient importanceto justify the Prime Minister in approaching the President.The Minister of War Transport referred to a difficulty whichhad arisen in connection with the &quot;Bolero&quot; import programme,in that the United States Government were sending to this countryships considerably in excess of the numbers which had been agreedon. Berthing facilities for these ships could not be provided andmany of them would have to stand by in British waters awaitingdischarge. This had been made clear to the United States Govern-ment and they had been told that they must themselves settle, withinthe agreed numbers, the order of priority in which their &quot; Bolero &quot;cargoes were discharged.The Minister of Food said that our food stocks would havediminished by 1-2 million tons between the beginning of the yearand the end of June. The proposed cuts would further diminishour reserves but, provided that reasonable imports of food couldbe secured in the second half of the year, it would be possible tocarry on without making any cuts in food rations. Butter wasthe commodity in shortest supply. He drew attention to the commit-ment to supply 750,000 tons of food to S.C.A.E.F. at the initialstage of the invasion of the Continent, and pointed out that ifour stocks fell below the danger level it might be necessary to givenotice that we could not fulfil this commitment.&quot;The following points arose in discussion : (a) The Paymaster-General said that it seemed probable thatin three months&apos; time our stocks might have fallen as low as theSpring 1943 level, and suggested that serious consideration shouldbe given to the cancellation of the commitment to supply 750,000tons of food to S.C.A.E.F.(b) The Minister of Production drew attention&quot; to the factthat owing to the arrangements for loading cargoes any cut in rawmaterials would probably not affect imports of steel but would fallmainly on miscellaneous items such as timber, where the effect ofthe reductions might be serious.The Minister of War Transport said that he was reasonablyconfident that the balance of cargo could be fairly maintained.(c) It was made clear that the cuts would not affect importsof food from Australia and New Zealand.(d) The Prime Minister of Australia said that he had beenimpressed by the evidence of war strain in the population of thiscountry. The Dominions were most anxious to make the greatestpossible contribution to the United Kingdom and he suggested thatif some arrangements could be made, under which the DominionGovernments would be consulted at an earlier stage as to whatcontribution they might make to the general pool of resources
available to the United Nations, they might be able to suggest waysand means of helping more effectively.The War Cabinet-(1) Agreed to the proposal that some reduction should beaccepted in the United Kingdom import programme, inorder to enable the essential, maintenance requirementsof &quot; Overlord &quot; to be met.(2) Agreed that it was not necessary for the Prime Minister toaddress a communication &quot;to the President at thisjuncture about these reductions. The matter should,however, be noted in order that it might be brought tothe attention of the United States Government at somesuitable opportunity.        iPrisoners 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatof War. information about the officers who had been killed after escaping(Previous        from a German prisoner of war camp was beginning to appear inReference:       the Press.  He therefore proposed that a statement, which he wouldW.M.(44)64th  prepare in consultation with the Secretary of State for Air, shouldConclusions,     be made in the House of Commons on the following day.  No replyMinute 3.)       had yet been received from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne andthe statement would simply give the bare facts, as known to us,and inform the House that urgent enquiries were being made.  Fullinformation had been sent to the Dominion Governments.The War Cabinet-Agreed that a statement on the lines proposed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be made inthe House of Commons on the following day.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,ISth May, 1944.
