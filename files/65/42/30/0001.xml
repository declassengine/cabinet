He felt himself that it would be wise to close with theConclusions,      Portuguese on this basis, since, if we did not do so, much largerMinute 3.) &apos;      quantities would be exported while discussion continued.   Therewas, however, some risk that the United States Government wouldraise difficulties.   He suggested that he should now send a strongtelegram to Washington, urging the United States Government toagree with us in this matter.The War Cabinet-Approved the course proposed by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.ProposedInternationalMonetary Fund.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)62ndConclusions,Minute 1.15.

He recognised the force ofW.M.(43)77th    these difficulties, but felt that they were outweighed by considera-Conclusions,      tions of general policy, and the importance of maintaining equalMinute 6.)        co-operation between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStates Government in questions affecting refugees.   The camp was&apos;badly needed.   It was important to keep our bargain with theUnited States, who had performed their part.The Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security supportedthe view taken by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Refusal on our part to establish the camp would be open tomisconstruction.The Secretary of State for War said that when this matter hadcome up for consideration the War Office had not been aware of thepersonal correspondence which had passed between the PrimeMinister and the President, and that in the circumstances they nolonger pressed their objection.The War Cabinet-Endorsed the proposal by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs that a refugee camp should be set up inTripolitania.ConstituentRepublics of theSoviet Union.7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (W.P. (44) 284) examiningthe recent Soviet constitutional changes which had resulted in theappointment of Commissars for Foreign Affairs for the Ukraine,Byelo-Russia and others of the constituent Republics of the SovietUnion.   There was a risk that we should be faced with a request
from the Soviet Government to appoint a separate representativeto the Ukraine. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs feltthat we should find it difficult indefinitely to withhold recognitionof the international status of the sixteen constituent republics, but,at the same time, he saw nothing to be gained by hastening suchrecognition. His present inclination was to try to postpone thewhole question of the recognition of the independent status of thesixteen constituent republics until the peace settlement. Hesuggested that, if this view was accepted by the War Cabinet, theDominion Governments should be so informed and their viewsascertained. If they concurred, it would be well to keep each otherinformed of any Russian move bearing .on this matter, and theUnited States Government should also be informed and asked tokeep in contact with us on this,subject. The various representativesin Moscow should also be instructed to exchange informationupon it.. The War Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs at &quot;X,&quot; and agreed that the DominionGovernments should be consulted as proposed by him.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,5th June, 1944.
