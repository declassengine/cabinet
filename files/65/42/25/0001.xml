American forces had taken Fondi and Terracina wasreported to be in our hands. The movement of German reservesindicated that the enemy meant to fight the battle out in his presentpositions; but the enemy&apos;s forces were somewhat6,000 prisoners had been taken so far.In discussion the comment was made that hardly anything hadbeen said so far about the part taken by British troops in this battle.The Prime Minister undertook to bring this point to GeneralAlexanders notice.General Stilwell, by a surprise movement into the IrrawaddyValley, had. taken one of&quot;the airfields of Myitkyina, and fighting wasgoing on in the town.United States forces had captured Wakde Island, 120 miles offHollandia.Sinkings by enemy action this week amounted to 7,000 tons, andfor the first three weeks of May amounted to 17,000 tons.

2. The Prime Minister said that he had sent a telegram toMarshal Tito, informing him that King Peter had dismissedM. Puric&apos;s administration, and was about to form a new Govern-ment under the Ban of Croatia. A satisfactory answer to thiscommunication had now been received.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatKing Peter was moving very slowly as regards setting up anew Government. The suggestion had been made that it might bebetter that the new Prime Minister should be not the Ban of Croatiabut M. Grol, who was a Serb. In this event, the Ban of Croatiawould support the Government, but it did not seem certain that hewould be a member of it.The Prime Minister said that the Ban of Croatia, whohad been brought over from America, should certainly be a leadingmember of the new Government. Moreover, he thought that a veryearly decision should be reached on this matter, so that a publicannouncement could be made.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatMr. Stevenson, our Minister to the Government of Yugoslavia,would be seeing King Peter on the following day.Discussion ensued about General Velebit, the Chief of Staff tothe Yugoslav Military Mission, who had come on a visit to thiscountry with Brigadier Maclean. It was reported that animpression had gained ground that General Velebit had been some-what neglected during the first week or so that he had been in thiscountry.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he hadreceived a letter of protest on the matter from Mr. Harold Laski.It was agreed that the reply to this letter should be that the PrimeMinister, as Minister of Defence, had always intended to seeGeneral Velebit before he left this country.After some further discussion, the following decisions werereached :  (1) The Minister of Information should make arrangements forGeneral Velebit to make a tour of this country. Thiswould afford him an opportunity of visiting provincialcentres, and of seeing for himself our war effort; butwould not be made the occasion for Press interviews onpolitical matters.*(2) The Minister of Economic Warfare was asked to report tothe Prime Minister regarding the programme which hadbeen made for General Velebifs visit whilst in thiscountry.Yugoslavia.(PreviousReference:W.M.(44)60thConclusions,Minute 4.)Portugal.Supply ofWolfram tothe Axis.(PreviousReference:W.M.
